      "England boss Gareth Southgate has been installed as Sir Jim Ratcliffe's favourite to replace Erik ten Hag at Manchester United and he has now given his take on a potential move to Old Trafford",
      "Gareth Southgate has ruled himself out of the running to be Manchester United boss this summer.",
      "Southgate committed himself to the England job and said he would refuse to have discussions with any club until after the Euros. That effectively means that United would have to wait until mid-July to get Southgate who also branded the talk “disrespectful” to Erik ten Hag.",
      "United have made Southgate their No1 target should they axe ten Hag but the England manager’s comments were designed to defuse the issue so he can concentrate leading the nation to glory this summer.",
      "Southgate, talking on the eve of the Wembley friendly with Brazil, said: “I’m certainly not going to speak to anyone else, I never have, I’ve been eight years in the job and would never entertain speaking to anyone else while I’m in a job, so I don’t know if that answers your question.",
      "“My focus is the European Championship. If we did a contract here before then everybody would be saying: ‘Why are you signing a contract before a Euros where you’ve got to prove yourself?’”",
      "Southgate also underlined his commitment to the “manager’s code” in not wanting to go behind ten Hag’s back while the Dutchman is still in a job at Old Trafford. It actually means that Southgate’s best chance of getting the United job would be for them to stick with ten Hag for the start of next season - and then make a change into the campaign.",
      "Southgate added: “There are two things from my point of view. Firstly, I am the England manager and I have got one job, basically, to try and deliver a European championship. Clearly, before that, two important games this week.",
      "“And the second thing is Manchester United have a manager. I think it is always completely disrespectful when there is any speculation about a manager who is in place. I am president of the LMA so I don’t have any time for that sort of thing.”",
      "The Football Association are desperate to get Southgate to sign a new contract beyond his current £3m-a-year deal which expires in December. But Southgate insists that he will put all talks about his future on the back burner until after the Euros, although he may decide he wants another crack at a World Cup but would only quit England for a big club job.",

      "Gareth Southgate’s England reign has been positive on the whole - but after three major tournaments on his watch, it has also been a tale of missed opportunities",
      "Gareth Southgate may be the most successful England coach since Sir Alf Ramsey - but is he ruthless enough to be manager of Manchester United?",
      "The England job comes with harsh scrutiny, but in terms of global attention United is a worldwide institution where the pressure is unrelenting 24/7 and 52 weeks a year. To my mind, Southgate’s England reign has been positive on the whole - but after three major tournaments on his watch, it has also been a tale of missed opportunities.",
      "And Manchester United aren’t in the market for missed opportunities - they have had a decade of those since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. First things first: Erik ten Hag is still in charge at Old Trafford, and if he goes on to win the FA Cup and finish in the top four, there is a difficult conversation to be had about him staying on.",
      "Whatever happens in future, United fans will always savour the memory of that comeback against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. But Ten Hag knows how football works. There is no smoke without fire, and clearly Southgate has his admirers in co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s football operation.",
      "He is a decent, principled man who would wear the United blazer with pride and distinction. But would he deliver results where they matter most - on the pitch? Southgate has had a golden generation of players at his disposal with England, but so far he has missed the boat when the big prizes were there for the taking.",
      "In 2018, England were 1-0 up against Croatia in a World Cup semi-final but failed to press home their advantage. In the Euro 2020 final against Italy, they were 1-0 up again but lost on penalties - on home soil and against a side who failed to qualify for the next World Cup.",
      "And in Qatar 16 months ago, England were knocked out by France in the quarter-finals despite nullifying Kylian Mbappe. People talk about Harry Kane’s missed penalty, but that was another fantastic opportunity to go on and win a major tournament.",
      "United don’t need a manager who is a master of near-misses. They need a winner. Sure, he would enjoy the support of players like Harry Maguire, to whom he has shown great loyalty at international level.",
      "But is Southgate ruthless enough to build an empire like Fergie or Sir Matt Busby? If he was offered the job, and he took it, he would have to hit the ground running because, in the eyes of some fans, it would be an underwhelming appointment.",
      "I like Gareth Southgate as a person. He is a nice guy - but nice guys in football don’t often bring home the trophies.",

      "Manchester United could benefit from the latest set of Premier League charges with a potential move for Leicester midfielder Kieran Dewsbury-Hall.",
      "The 25-year-old has been a standout performer in the Championship this season with Leicester eyeing an instant return to the top-flight. Enzo Maresca's side were in a commanding position and clear at the summit, but a run of one win across their last five matches has seen the chasing pack close in.",
      "Now, Leicester have been hit with a Premier League charge. It was confirmed on Thursday that the Foxes have been referred to an independent commission for allegedly breaching profit and sustainability regulations. They have also been accused of failing to submit their accounts to the top-flight on time.",
      "The Foxes could face a points deduction at the start of next season if they are promoted and found to have breached regulations. Leicester issued a furious statement saying they are \"surprised\" by the actions and will \"defend itself from any unlawful acts by the football authorities.\"",
      "But Leicester might be forced to sell players, even if they are promoted. This is where United could take advantage as the club are reportedly interested in signing Dewsbury-Hall.",
      "Brighton wanted to sign Dewsbury-Hall in January and supposedly had a £20million bid rejected by Leicester, who were asking for an offer in the region of £45m. If the Foxes are promoted, it's said that they will want around £40m - the same fee Tottenham paid to sign James Maddison last summer.",
      "But should the Foxes stay in the Championship, then the asking price for Dewsbury-Hall could drop to as low as £25m, which could prove to be a bargain. The Shepshed-born midfielder has scored 10 goals and provided 12 assists in 36 Championship appearances this season and has three years left on his contract.",
      "Amid the noise surrounding his future in January, Leicester boss Maresca told The Telegraph that Dewsbury-Hall informed him that he wanted to stay at the King Power Stadium. He said: \"Kiernan came to me when there was all the noise about him and told me that he had no intention of leaving the club.",
      "\"He said he had an obligation to get Leicester promoted. He feels responsible for last season and wants to take the club back to the Premier League. All the other players are the same. Pride is important and they want to be back where they've been for so many years. I love having that commitment from them.\"",

      "Manchester United winger Facundo Pellistri has spent the last month-and-a-half on loan with Granada in Spain, but he has been left disappointed by the La Liga outfit's current woes",
      "Manchester United winger Facundo Pellistri is unhappy with how his loan spell at Granada has gone as the La Liga outfit edges closer to relegation.",
      "The Uruguay international, 22, hardly featured during the first half of the season for the Red Devils and, as a result, was the subject of transfer interest in January. United sanctioned a six-month loan move to Granada late in the winter window to allow Pellistri to continue his development.",
      "Unfortunately for the youngster, his time in Spain has been somewhat of a mixed bag. While he has played plenty of football, Granada parted company with manager Alexander Medina this month.",
      "And the outlook is pretty bleak when it comes to relegation, too. Jose Ramon Sandoval has been drafted in to replace Medina, but Granada are second from bottom in La Liga and 13 points from safety as we head into the final weeks of the season.",
      "Speaking to AUF TV, as quoted by ESPN, Pellistri expressed his disappointment with the club's current plight, saying: “At the club we are going through a complicated time, but football is like that, there are good and bad moment and you have to be quick to change the chip and bring good energy here. When I return to the club, we have to continue with the best of energy to achieve our objectives, and try to do our best here.”",
      "He added: “I’m getting a lot of minutes in Granada. I’m happy about that part, but sad about how the level of the group is going, we all want to achieve the objective the objective, there are still chances: as long as those chances are there, we’re going to keep fighting.”",
      "Pellistri's latest comments come months after his agent, Edgardo Lasalvia, took aim at Erik ten Hag. He appeared to suggest that it would be \"difficult\" for his client to continue at Old Trafford if the Dutchman remained in charge as a result of his limited game time.",
      "Lasalvia told Sport 890 earlier this year: “Whether he returns to Manchester in the middle of the year will depend on the performance he shows. If Ten Hag continues, it’s going to be difficult. Ten Hag hasn’t used him, valued him, or treated him like a professional.”",
      "Pellistri adopted a more conservative approach when he was asked about his long-term future earlier this month but also made it clear he would keep his options open heading into the summer. He has featured just 24 times in total for Manchester United since signing for the club from Penarol back in 2020.",

      "Michael Hatton, 63, got into a bitter argument with his neighbours - a man and his girlfriend - in the Hollins area of Oldham over a wooden fence he had erected between their front gardens, the court was told.",
      "As the dispute heated up, Hatton painted '58' - a cruel reference to the 1958 Munich air crash which claimed the lives of 23 people, including eight members of the United squad - onto the fence. It was also said that he daubed the words 'City rule OK, 'United are s***' and 'f*** off' with paint.",
      "In another incident, when the couple were accused of playing loud music late at night, Hatton, who works as a painter and decorator and lives with his wife, used his electric drill at 5.45am the next morning to attach 27 screws to the fence. He shouted: \"You are going to get this every morning you f****** scum.\"",
      "Tameside Magistrates' Court was told that Hatton was also heard shouting 'sl**' and 'I hope that lady dies' when the couple had their grandchildren over for a visit. In a statement, the male victim, who is currently selling his house, said he and his partner felt like they had been forced to 'live in hell'.",

      "The male's partner said: \"I absolutely hate living here because of him. We have been forced to put the house up for sale to move away. He frightens me because of the kids. I tell my family to be vigilant when going out in the dark in case Michael does something.",
      "\"I cannot sit in the garden with my granddaughter. I worry he might throw something over the fence and hurt her. He is violent and aggressive. He genuinely frightens us and makes us feel paranoid. I am constantly checking the garden to see if there is any damage he may have caused overnight. We are living in fear. He has made our life here hell in a short space of time.",
      "Suchitra Goswami, prosecuting, said: \"This is a matter involving a neighbour dispute where the defendant has been harassing the neighbours. This started in 2020.",
      "\"The victims have complained that the neighbour, the defendant, damaged a fence post which separated the garden between the two addresses. One of the victims states that the damage was done deliberately.",
      "\"Before the damage the defendant had installed new fencing on his land. On February 16, the complainant overhears the defendant outside of the rear property saying to another neighbour ‘I hope that lady dies.’",
      "\"She also overhears the defendant calling her daughter a 'sl**'. On May 30, the defendant used his drill in the early hours at 5.45 to 6.45 stating ‘you are going to get this every morning you f*****g scum.’",
      "\"On June 4, approximately 27 screws were found in the fence between the neighbours’ properties. The screws were approximately 1.5 inches long. There was no reason for those to be put there.",
      "\"For another incident on May 20, the complainant states that they returned home to find offensive writing written on the fence, visible on their side of the garden. The defendant is aware that the victims are Manchester United fans where the defendant is a Manchester City fan.",
      "\"On the fence he wrote, ‘City rule OK. United are s*** and f*** off' and ‘58’. He states that the 58 was a reference to the 1958 Munich air disaster involving a number of United players who died. This was prolonged period of causing maximum distress to the victims. They have clearly suffered.\"",
      "The court heard that Hatton has a history of 14 offences, including battery. His lawyer, Mohamed Patel insisted tensions between the neighbours have since 'settled down'. Mr Patel said: \"It is a sad situation. Ordinarily one would expect neighbours to live well together. Initially they were living well together and helping each other out.",
      "\"But the issues began in 2020 when the gentleman found a new relationship with his current partner and relationship between the neighbours got a bit sour. Music started being played a bit loud and that saw the relationship going into a downfall.",
      "\"It is always difficult with neighbour disputes. Each party thinks that they are in the right but he fully accepts responsibility for this offence.",
      "\"While I accept it is an ongoing dispute which goes back to 2020, this offence dates from 2023. There have been no further offences since June 2023, no further reports from either party to police. There have been no further issues. I would submit that things have settled down between the two neighbours.\"",
      "Mr Patel said Hatton was upset because his neighbour took down some old fencing after he put up new posts, and he reacted to their loud music, He explained: \"In relation to the drilling the night before the neighbours were playing loud music and it was a reaction to that.",
      "\"He fully accepts that he should not have done this. There have been no further developments or further issues. I understand that the neighbours’ house has been sold. It is just a matter of time before they move out.\"",
      "Hatton pleaded guilty of causing trouble between Feb 15 and June 4 of last year. He got a six-month community punishment with 15 days of special activities with the probation service.",
      "He also had to pay £100 as fine, as well as £199 in charges. Also, a restraining order for two years was put in place, stopping Hatton from going near his neighbours or stepping onto their property."

      "Mainoo's emergence has also impacted Casemiro's standing at Old Trafford. Like Eriksen, Casemiro has played significantly less this season, although he's also been plagued by injuries.",
      "It's expected that the veteran midfielder will be one of the players made available for transfer this summer. Mirror Football revealed on Thursday that Wolves' holding midfielder Joao Gomes has been identified by Ineos as a long-term replacement for Casemiro if United can find a buyer for him in the summer transfer window.",

      "Manchester United are already making plans behind the scenes ahead of the summer transfer window ahead of the arrival of Dan Ashworth, who is currently on gardening leave",
      "Manchester United are ready to firm up their interest in Gielson Bremer ahead of the arrival of the club's prospective new sporting director, Dan Ashworth.",
      "It's anticipated that the Red Devils will be busy this summer following several structural changes. Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe is now at the helm after acquiring a minority stake in the club and has already made his mark behind the scenes.",
      "It's widely been reported that one of the 71-year-old's most pressing priorities was the appointment of a new sporting director and Ashworth, who has impressed in roles with Newcastle, Brighton and The Football Association, has emerged as a primary target.",
      "He's currently on gardening leave while United attempt to agree a financial package for his services, but summer recruitment plans are starting to take shape in the meantime.",
      "United are keen to bolster their defence in the summer window and Bremer is on the club's radar after impressing at Juventus. While Ashworth will be tasked with overseeing the club's recruitment strategy and will have a deciding say in transfer matters, it's been claimed by reports overseas that he has endorsed Bremer, although this is unconfirmed.",
      "It's previously been reported that Bremer has a £43million release clause in his contract; a sum which is unlikely to be viewed as excessive. Ratcliffe has already expressed a desire to move away from the habit of spending huge amounts of money on ageing players.",
      "Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite is also on United's radar following a string of impressive performances for the Premier League strugglers this term. At just 21 years of age, he fits the profile of perspective signings United want to pursue, although he would likely command an extremely high transfer fee.",
      "With United open to signing two new centre-backs in the summer, departures are also expected. Raphael Varane is due to be a free agent at the end of the season and, barring a late change of heart is likely to leave the club.",
      "The former Real Madrid defender made a big impression after signing for United in the summer of 2021 but has fallen down the pecking order under Erik ten Hag this term, with the Dutchman instead handing an olive branch to former captain Harry Maguire.",
      "It's broadly anticipated that several other high-earners are likely to be made available for transfer at the end of the season too, meaning the likes of Casemiro and Antony could join Varane out the exit door.",

      "Reports from Spain earlier this week claimed that club president Florentino Perez is keen to sign Garnacho. Perez is set to meet with the United star when Madrid face Manchester City in the Champions League next month.",
      "Such an approach is likely to be welcomed by Garnacho, with TyC Sports reporting that he 'dreams' of playing for the La Liga giants. Madrid are looking to deploy a similar strategy that saw them sign Cristiano Ronaldo, who is Garnacho's personal idol.",
      "Garnacho's recent performances have not only impressed rival teams. Former Arsenal star Ian Wright believes the United winger is quickly becoming a major issue when opposition managers draw up their game plans.",

As soon as they get the structure right around him he can start to learn more and know where he needs to be in a game. At the moment it’s so chaotic in there. But if that happens then we’re really going to see the best of him, we really are.\"",

      "Harry Maguire wants Gareth Southgate to stay on as England manager beyond this summer's European Championships despite interest in his services from Manchester United.",
      "Southgate, 53, has transformed the fortunes of the national team since Sam Allardyce's departure almost eight years ago. He has guided the Three Lions to a World Cup semi-final and came within a whisker of glory at Euro 2020, losing the final on penalties.",
      "The Star revealed earlier this week that Ineos, led by new Manchester United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, have identified Southgate as their No.1 target to replace Erik ten Hag if a managerial change is made this summer. The Dutchman remains under pressure and his long-term future at the club now Ratcliffe and co are in charge of sporting operations is far from certain.",
      "Maguire, who has been in integral part of the England squad under Southgate for years, would surely benefit should he take the top job at Old Trafford - but he's backed the Three Lions chief to stay on beyond Euro 2024.",
      "When he was asked if he wanted Southgate to remain in his post-long-term, Maguire said: \"Yeah, definitely, obviously.‌ We want to be successful in the Euros – we are not looking at the World Cup at the moment – but obviously, if we are successful at the Euros, which is our main focus, of course, we want to be successful.",
      "“If Gareth’s the man to make us be successful then we want him to stay as long as possible. I’ve had a great relationship with him. I’ve been a big part of the success ad the progression that we’ve shown as a country. And I’m sure he will say the same thing now, it’s all about winning a trophy.",
      "‌“I don’t know what’s going to happen after the Euros, I don’t know if he knows what’s going to happen. But I feel like what he’s done from when he first took over this job to where we are at now, we’ve taken huge strides and he’s a massive part of that.”",
      "While Maguire may be keen for Southgate to stay with England, his comments are unlikely to prevent Ratcliffe and Ineos from making a move for their top target.",
      "Southgate's contract with the Football Association expires in December and he has so far refused to entertain discussions over an extension. It's been outlined that prising him away from his current contract would not be an overly expensive process for Manchester United.",
      "Much will hinge on how United end the season, as well as England's performance at Euro 2024. Failure to qualify for next season's Champions League could lead to Ten Hag leaving the club - particularly if Southgate is open to moving on from England.",

      "\"Our staff has put together a plan with Erik ten Hag on how he will get the best build-up after Rasmus' injury period. It is both for our good and their good.",
      "\"It does not make sense to smash a player through and increase the risk of an injury that goes beyond our own Euro plans. That plan is there for Rasmus and for all other players.\"",
      "Hojlund was in electric form for Man United ahead of his injury blow. He had found the net in each of his previous six Premier League appearances - his record now sitting at 13 goals in all competitions for the Red Devils following a slow start to life at Old Trafford.",
      "Hojlund will now be aiming to extend his stunning international record. Ahead of Saturday’s clash with Switzerland in Copenhagen, he can boast seven goals in just ten caps since his debut in 2022.",
      "Away from his injury concerns, Hojlund has been caught up in controversy on international duty. It was claimed that his Red Devils teammates were left questioning him for agreeing to an interview with a Man United fan channel.",
      "But he has confirmed that is untrue. Speaking to Danish outlet Tipsbladet, the striker said: \"I haven't been told anything, so it's fake news. I haven't read anything about it, but it's definitely not true that I have been told that I can't do an interview with one fan media or another.\"",

      "Mason Greenwood is unlikely to embark on a second loan spell with Getafe next season as Manchester United mull over whether to cash in on the academy graduate in the summer",
      "Mason Greenwood is unlikely to stay at Getafe next season, with Manchester United reportedly not interested in another loan spell.",
      "The 22-year-old has spent the current campaign on loan with the La Liga outfit and has bagged eight goals so far. The spell in Spain came after charges against Greenwood of attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service in February of 2023.",
      "Those at the top of the Getafe hierarchy are reportedly keen on keeping hold of Greenwood for another season but are unlikely to be able to afford to purchase the England international outright. Unfortunately for them, the Red Devils have decided they want a fee for the striker if they are going to part ways, according to The Sun.",
      "United's new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is yet to make a decision on what to do with Greenwood and has not ruled out the idea of reintegrating the academy graduate back into the first-team fold at Old Trafford.",
      "Ratcliffe said last month: \"We will make a decision, correct. All I can do is talk about the principle of how we will approach decisions like that. Is he the right type of footballer, are we happy with if is he a good person or not?",
      "\"He's a Manchester United footballer, so we are in charge of football. So the answer is 'Yeah, we have to make decisions. It's quite clear we have to make a decision. There is no decision that's been made. He's on-loan obviously, but he's not the only one.",
      "\"We've got one or two footballers that we have to deal with and we have to make a decision on so we will do that. The process will be: understand the facts, not the hype. Then try and come to a fair decision on the basis of values, which is basically is he a good guy or not? Could he play sincerely for Manchester United well, would we be comfortable with it and would the fans be comfortable with it?\"",
      "Ratcliffe isn't the only one who has discussed Greenwood, with England boss Gareth Southgate also fielding questions on the 22-year-old. Asked if the forward could add to his tally of one Three Lions cap, the manager explained: \"I don't think it's something for pre-Euros.",
      "\"Allowing him to get his career going again abroad appears to have been a good move. But I have to say I have not tracked it closely.\"",
      "Greenwood is contracted to United until the summer of 2025. That same deal includes an option to extend for a further year, though at this stage that seems increasingly unlikely.",

      "Gomes, 23, has made a strong impression at Wolves since joining the club from Flamengo in January 2023 for just £12million and Mirror Footballrevealed on Thursday morning that his imperious performances at Molineux have piqued the attention of Ineos.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team have taken charge of sporting operations at Old Trafford and are in the market for a new midfielder in the summer with Casemiro, 32, likely to depart. Ratcliffe's preference is to acquire up-and-coming talent rather than blockbuster names and Gomes, who United believe could be available for £40million, fits the bill as a player with significant resale value.",
      "United have watched the talented midfielder on several occasions this season and could firm up their interest in Gomes in the coming months. However, Gomes' previous comments on playing for United's arch-rivals may not go down too well.",
      "Speaking in a media interview back in the summer of 2022, Gomes said: “Liverpool are a team I would [like to] play for. Playing in the Champions League is my biggest dream and that of my family, my biggest dream in football.”",
      "Gomes has not only caught the eye of United since adapting seamlessly to life in the Premier League. Both Newcastle and Tottenham have also had him watched ahead of the summer, for a player whom Wolves don't want to lose, but accept could go if the price is right.",
      "The Brazilian, nicknamed 'the pitbull' has adapted seamlessly to life in the Premier League, shining at the heart of the Black Country club's midfield - filling the void left by Ruben Neves last summer - and is poised to win his first senior cap for his country against England this weekend.",
      "Despite impressing last year after joining the club for an initial £60m from Real Madrid, Casemiro has failed to live up to expectations this season and United would welcome the opportunity to get his significant salary off the books.",

      "Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe is insisting on a more prudent approach in the transfer market, with Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes earmarked as a potential target",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already hinted hisManchester United will attempt to be significantly shrewder in the transfer market.",
      "New United chief Ratcliffe singled out Casemiro as the glaring example of a recruitment approach which has left United trailing behind their domestic rivals. Erik ten Hag had been tracking Frenkie de Jong for much of that summer window, before drastically pivoting to the veteran midfielder when eventually realising - months after everyone else - that he didn't want to leave Barcelona.",
      "United shelled out £60million for Casemiro, a player with a fantastic reputation and resume. But north of 30 when he arrived, his signing always felt like a short-term measure while their competitors looked at the long haul.",
      "And that is largely what has transpired. Brilliant in his first season, but miles off the pace in his second with the Red Devils now already in the market for a replacement. And if Ratcliffe’s early sentiments are anything to go by, they will likely go young.",
      "“I’d rather find the next Mbappe, rather than spend a fortune to buy success. It’s not that clever to buy Mbappe, anybody could figure that one out,” he recently explained in one of his many media appearances.",
      "That is perhaps where the lure of acquiring Joao Gomes comes into it. A compatriot of Casemiro, the 23-year-old has the profile of their current Brazilian, but still with plenty of room for growth.",
      "Mirror Football understands that the Wolves midfielder is on United’s wishlist for the summer and has already been watched on a number of occasions. Brought to the Premier League in January of last year from Flamengo for £12m, Gomes has already shown he is more than up to the challenge of top-flight European football.",
      "His display during Wolves’ win at Tottenham last month was one of the stand-out individual performances of the entire season. And the Red Devils have attributed a valuation of around £35m ahead of a potential summer pursuit.",
      "The big problem for United though, is Gomes is no longer the secret he was during his days with Flamengo. His profile is now more in line with Enzo Fernandez, who went from South America to Europe in a bargain deal, before fetching three figures after just 29 Benfica appearances. Ironically, Wolves bid for Fernandez when he went to Benfica - but he'd already given his word to the Portuguese club - so current-sporting director Matt Hobbs turned to No.2 on his list: Gomes",
      "Moises Caicedo is another measuring stick for any pursuit of the soon-to-be Brazil international. By the end of the season, he will have effectively matched Caicedo’s appearances for Brighton - who then went to Stamford Bridge for more than £100m.",
      "Gomes has a long contract at Molineux, with the Midlands outfit now under considerably less pressure to sell than they were last summer. “Let’s say I want to raise £60m to invest in the next summer. If I can sell one player to do that, it’s much better than selling two or three,” Wolves sporting director Matt Hobbs recently explained.",
      "The Three Lions are among the favourites to win this summer's Euro 2024 tournament and you can get your hands on the brand new Nike home and away kits before the first whistle.",
      "That all leads to a likely scenario where United will have to consider laying down a significant transfer fee to land a player they see as Kobbie Mainoo’s partner for the next 10 years.",
      "“The solution isn’t spending a lot of money on a couple of great players. They’ve done that, if you look at the last 10 years,” Ratcliffe added.",
      "Finding the next superstar is a noble pursuit and one that will likely, ultimately bear fruit. But the boat may have already sailed on Gomes, he is now a Premier League star, set to make his international debut at Wembley.",
      "The idea of him being a cheap and financially prudent addition is, at best, now highly fanciful.",

      "“In the 1998/99 season, when we were going for the Treble, in the March international break, Sir Alex Ferguson pulled David Beckham, Paul Scholes and myself out the England squad, and let Nicky Butt, Wes Brown and Phil Neville play for England, so it was like three in and three out. Sir Alex hated the March international break.",
      "“There were seven of us playing for Manchester United and England and, if it was a proper qualifier, the boss wouldn’t have any issues with us playing, but if it was a friendly in the March break, he wasn’t having it.",
      "“It’s a badly placed international break, during a title run-in. Push it into early December or August, but I don’t think it should split the season.",
      "“Sir Alex would have done a deal with the England manager to make them not play in March if we had silverware to go for. He would have said that we could play in the summer or in the off-season, but not when we’re going for a Treble like we were in 1999.”",

      "Amad, who was fresh off the bench, scored a dramatic winner right at the very end of extra-time to seal United's path to the last four, where they will face Coventry City at Wembley next month. As a result, their hopes of winning a trophy this season are still very much alive.",
      "Despite being a few days into the international break, news and talking points have not been in short supply. Kobbie Mainoo was called up to the England squad for the very first time on Tuesday and could make his debut when the Three Lions face Brazil this weekend.",

      "In his press conference on Friday, Southgate has responded to being linked with the United job should Ten Hag leave:",
      "I think there are two things from my point of view. One is that I am the England manager. I have got one job, basically, to try and deliver a European Championship and clearly before that two important games this week. And the second thing is that Manchester United have a manager and I think it is always completely disrespectful when there is any speculation about a manager who is in place. I am president of the LMA (League Manager’s Association) so I don’t have any time for that sort of thing really.",

It adds that a 4pm time was sought but that the Metropolitan Police deemed it to be a ‘high-risk’ fixture, forcing an earlier start. Coventry are due to play Hull City on the following Tuesday in a Championship fixture.",

      "Keane told the Stick to Football podcast:",
      "\"Well, the timing could be right – he is lucky in terms of the timing because obviously (Kalvin) Phillips is having a difficult time and Jordan Henderson is getting a bit older. So, maybe that timing, and the best thing is when you get a player into your camp as you know at international football – okay he is doing well at United but have a look at him closely with the other international players. We have all done that. When Wayne (Rooney) came through – you look at a young player when you get to see him close up you go 'I like what I see'. It could happen.\"",
      "\"United are closing in on the milestone of the 250th academy player to be given their senior debut and that's a remarkable achievement, although unlikely to be met this season. Omari Forson, Willy Kambwala and Dan Gore were the latest players to receive their debuts. Gore has been sent on loan to Port Vale, while the others have been kept around the first-team squad. Charlie McNeill spent the first half of the season on loan at Stevenage, but was recalled in January and he's spending time with the Under-21s to get back up to speed again. Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo, Gore and McNeill all started in the FA Youth Cup final in 2022 and it's been tremendous to see them progress to make their senior debuts at the club.\"",

      "The Portuguese winger has been linked with a move to Old Trafford at various junctures in recent months. It is claimed United could try and sign him as a 'potential replacement' for Antony.",
      "Neto, 24, has scored three goals and grabbed 11 assists in 23 matches this season.",
      "\"Since becoming United boss, Erik ten Hag has signed Andre Onana, Lisandro Martinez, Tyrell Malacia, Sofyan Amrabat, Christian Eriksen, Wout Weghorst and Antony, all of whom either came from the Eredivisie or had experience in the division. None of them, regardless of the different levels of impact they have each had in M16, are players United fans would have necessarily identified as future signings prior to the 2022 summer transfer window. As a result of Amrabat being overlooked against Liverpool, it once again raises questions about how much control Ten Hag should have over recruitment. The manager, regardless of the club or division, must have a say in the players he will coach, but there is a feeling that Ten Hag's stranglehold on recruitment should be loosened, despite him admitting prior to taking over in 2022 that he wants control when it comes to signings.\"",

Everton are closing in on a new home of their own. Financially, it would make a whole heap of sense for United to follow suit.

I think when you have a combination of the likes of [Jude] Bellingham, [Phil] Foden and [Bukayo] Saka and then you have the raw pace of Rashford, teams won't know whether they are coming or going. You won’t be able to defend for pace or against pockets. To defend against pockets you have got to play a couple of tight lines, which then gives space in behind unless you're playing very very deep and then you’re just going to be playing into England's hands in many ways. So it's lovely to have a combination of pace and skill and I think with Rashford in there we certainly tick a massive box of having pace. Alternatives, who have we got? If we play two sixes then it takes away one of our top players and I think it's overkill.\"",

      "Man Utd will look to reshape their defence this summer and they have plenty of options to do just that in terms of sales and signings.",
      "No area of the pitch has been as unsettled this season as Manchester United's defence, a claim that the stats bear out. Seven different defenders have played more than 1,000 minutes this term, a number that doesn't include Lisandro Martinez, who will expect to reach that tally if he can remain injury-free between now and the end of May.",
      "Four central defenders have played between 1,274 minutes and 2,010 minutes, but not one of them is in the top seven for playing time this season, which tells a story. Most clubs will have a centre-back towards the top of that list because it is often the most settled area of the team.",
      "William Saliba and Gabriel are top of the minutes played chart at Arsenal. Virgil van Dijk is top for Liverpool and Ruben Dias is fifth for Manchester City, but with 800 more minutes than Raphael Varane, who is United's most-used centre-back.",
      "So deciphering what exactly is Erik ten Hag's first-choice back four isn't easy. It's even more complicated when looking ahead to the summer and the uncertainty that clouds the defence, in the centre especially. The only centre-back guaranteed to remain at the club is Martinez.",
      "Ten Hag has placed some of the blame for United's defensive issues this season on the fact he has had to make so many changes at the back and has struggled to field a settled rearguard.",
      "“We have had to change the defence every time [this season],” he said in January. “If you look at last season, we had a very good back four, very consistent, and we had control. This season, we always have to make adjustments at the back, there are no more automatisms and the middle is too open.”",
      "He will hope that will change next season but what is certain to change is the identity of the players available for selection. Varane might have played more than any other central defender this term, but he is out of contract this summer and is yet to sign a new deal.",
      "The World Cup winner's injury record counts against him, he was dropped by Ten Hag for a chunk of the season and commands a significant wage for a 30-year-old. Ineos might decide it is time to move on.",
      "Victor Lindelof is next on the list and he has performed admirably as a stand-in left-back at times this season. But he turns 30 in July and after seven seasons and more than 250 appearances for the club, it might also be time to move on. The age profile feels telling in defence, with Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans also the wrong side of 30. At least two of Varane, Lindelof, Maguire and Evans need to be moved on this summer.",
      "Evans, 36, has played more often than anyone expected and has proved a reliable performer. His deal expires in the summer as well but United could make a late call on the former academy graduate, depending on the incomings and outgoings.",
      "At left-back, Luke Shaw is the first-choice when fit and although the season has been a write-off for Tyrell Malacia, he will get another season as deputy to try and prove himself. Diogo Dalot has established himself at right-back, but this could be the summer to sell Aaron Wan-Bissaka. He has a year remaining on his contract and there will be interest from mid-table Premier League clubs.",
      "That leaves at least a couple of spaces to fill for United's new-look recruitment department. Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite is top target and the 21-year-old would be an excellent signing. He is comfortable on either foot and on either side of the defence and looks an ideal long-term partner for Martinez.",
      "I would opt to release Varane and sell Lindelof while keeping Maguire as third-choice. He has enjoyed an outstanding renaissance this season and has plenty to offer off the pitch as well as on it. Depending on the budget available, another young centre-back would be ideal, but with financial fair play still a concern it might not be possible. Evans could get another deal while 19-year-old Willy Kambwala looks ready for more regular first-team involvement.",
      "A new right-back would also be required. United have kept tabs on Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong, who has played as a wing-back this season and has an excellent record for attacking returns. If Wan-Bissaka is sold then a replacement to compete with Dalot is essential and that profile should be another front-footed full-back.",
      "Release: Varane",
      "Sell: Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof",

      "The 2024 summer transfer window could mark a series of changes at Man United, in terms of both incomings and outgoings.",
      "Despite still being in the conversations to win the FA Cup and secure Champions League qualification for next season, a lot of attention is already switching to the summer transfer window at Old Trafford.",
      "Following the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Manchester United will be embarking on a new journey come the summer that is hoped will lead to happier and more successful times. Vowing to knock Manchester City and Liverpool \"off their perch\" within three years, the Ineos chief has grand ambitions to make United great again.",
      "He has wasted little time in trying to make a positive impact, swooping for Omar Berrada, who has been installed as the club's new chief executive, from Manchester City. He also wants to appoint Dan Ashworth as the club's inaugural sporting director.",
      "Though Ratcliffe has suggested off-field appointments will initially take priority over player recruitment, there is no denying that this forthcoming summer's transfer window is a vitally important one in United's history. Big changes need to be made to the landscape of the squad, in terms of both incomings and outgoings, regardless of who the manager is.",
      "With that in mind, here is a rundown of what positions United plan to try and strengthen this summer, who has already been linked with filling them, who could leave and what might actually happen.",
      "United, as reported by the Manchester Evening News at the time, drew up plans for the summer window as far back as September. It is understood they have identified four positions they wish to strengthen as a priority: full-back, centre-back, central-midfield and attack.",
      "There is a general understanding that United specifically want to bolster their right-back options and they have expressed interest in Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong. However, there is an increasing belief they could also be in the market for a left-back after the injury issues they have encountered in that department this term.",
      "As for midfield, it has become increasingly clear they need to source a long-term replacement for Casemiro to fill the defensive-midfield role. He has regressed this season and they need fresh legs in that particular area.",
      "Up front, there is no denying United to source a backup option for Rasmus Hojlund. Anthony Martial is set to leave the club at the end of the season, meaning he needs replacing.",
      "As is always the case with United, they have been linked with players by the lorry load in recent months. A new name crops up almost every single day, but some of them you have to take with a pinch of salt.",
      "Nevertheless, there are some players who are understood to be concrete targets ahead of the summer, including Everton duo Jarrad Branthwaite and Amadou Onana, plus Bayer Leverkusen stars Edmond Tapsoba and Frimpong.",
      "It is understood each member of the aforementioned quartet are being monitored. Branthwaite, who was named in the England squad for the first time last week, has also been linked with several other clubs, including Real Madrid.",
      "Other names to have been regularly linked with United recently include Juventus defender Gleison Bremer, highly-rated Benfica midfielder João Neves and Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee. Furthermore, a report by the Mirror on Thursday credited United with interest in Wolves midfielder João Gomes.",
      "Just because United have drawn up a list of positions they want to bolster, it doesn't necessarily mean they will tick every box. Outgoings and the money generated from those sales will dictate what they can and cannot do.",
      "In an ideal world, United should prioritise strengthening at centre-back, in defensive-midfield and in central attack. Signing a right-back may not be as high up on the to-do list, such is the way Diogo Dalot has performed in recent months, as first thought.",
      "There could possibly be a dramatic shift in the landscape of the club's centre-back options. Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans are out-of-contract at the end of the season, while there are no guarantees Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof will not be sold.",
      "If Varane is not handed a new deal, it is highly plausible that United will make signing a right-sided centre-back one of their leading objectives. Lisandro Martinez is arguably the only member of United's current centre-back pool who is a guaranteed starter.",
      "The addition of a second striker also feels highly necessary, likewise a new defensive-midfielder. Sourcing a player to fill the latter of those two positions has to take initial priority, though the acquisition of a new centre-forward cannot be underplayed.",
      "As reported by the Manchester Evening News last month, United are planning to become more proactive in the seller's market, meaning their could be a record number of sales. There are players in the ranks who are highly unlikely to have futures at the club beyond the end of this season, such as Hannibal Mejbri, Donny van de Beek and Facundo Pellistri, all of whom are currently out on loan. Jadon Sancho's future could depend on Erik ten Hag's while Mason Greenwood could be in a state of limbo, though would represent pure FFP profit should he be sold.",
      "Along with Varane, Evans and Martial, Tom Heaton is also out-of-contract this summer, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Lindelof are out-of-contract in June 2025. Lindelof has regularly been linked with an exit in the last couple of years.",
      "Scott McTominay, despite his contributions this season, is a sellable asset, even more so than he was last summer amid his exploits in front of goal so far this term. He could command a fee that could assist with remaining within the boundaries of the Profit and Sustainability rules.",
      "Maguire, too, could also be an attractive signing for several Premier League clubs. He has once again been linked with West Ham United. Marcus Rashford, meanwhile, is understood to be of interest to Paris St Germain and Arsenal, and - like Greenwood - would also give United a monster FFP boost if he was sold. Cashing in on the two of the homegrown players could bring in around £120million.",
      "However, Ten Hag revealed last week that United don't want to sell the forward. \"We did not sign him last season for five years with the intention to sell him now,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"He should be part of this project. So it is not a subject we don't talk about.\"",

      "Man Utd need to balance the books to meet the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules and they will have the chance to do that with two deadlines.",
      "The story of Nottingham Forest's 2023 summer transfer window is laid bare in the independent commission's verdict into their breach of the Premier League's financial rules, which was issued on Monday.",
      "It details the interest in Brennan Johnson and the club's attempts to sell him during the window. From a €50million offer from Atletico Madrid, which was contingent on the La Liga side selling another player, to the £47.5million move which eventually took Johnson to Tottenham, it is all in there, including attempts to drum up interest in the forward by offering him to Manchester United.",
      "The reason Johnson forms such a key part of the 52-page written verdict is because of a date in the calendar that has essentially become a second deadline day. June 30, 2023, was D-day for Forest and it was one they missed. That is why they have been deducted four points.",
      "As key figures at Forest pointed out in evidence submitted to the panel, they knew a player trading profit of around £30millon was required by June 30, 2023, the final day of the financial year, to avoid falling foul of the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR). They also knew academy product Johnson was the only player who could deliver that.",
      "This verdict should really be the beginning of the end for PSR as it stands. Making the sale of academy players a shortcut to avoid falling foul of the rules and imposing a deadline at a point when the summer transfer window is yet to get going makes them a sham, but right now there is no sign of change coming.",
      "That makes June 30, 2024, another key date for clubs sailing close to the window and that includes United. The end of the 2023/24 financial year is a key one for the club under these rules because it takes into account the previous three years and it is the point at which a £150million loss from 2021/22 will fall off the monitoring period. Until then, things remain tight, with the £33million loss from last season adding to the problems.",
      "United will be allowed to lose £105million across that period and some of the existing losses can be offset against what the Premier League considers 'healthy' expenditure, such as investment in academies, women's football and infrastructure. Even with that included, they are going to face some challenges to meet it, which could make this forthcoming window one of two deadline days.",
      "Clubs are in regular discussions with the Premier League over their exact position and by the time the transfer window opens earlier in June, United will know where they stand. They will know if they need to make a sale and how much they need to bring in.",
      "The issue that Forest discovered is that the market doesn't tend to swing into life until July and that doing a deal earlier in the window often means selling players for a fee below their optimum value. There is also a greater profit to be had by selling academy graduates, who have no book value remaining so any incoming fee is declared as 'pure profit' in the results.",
      "If the situation gets desperate at Old Trafford then United could be forced to look at an early sale for someone like Scott McTominay. The midfielder was on the market a year ago but has proved to be a valuable squad member this term. Any offer of £35million could prove to be incredibly valuable, however, especially if it arrives before the end of June.",
      "That might be a decision United have little option in, with the decision against Forest another example of the Premier League's strict interpretation of the rules. United are also paying the price for the absence of any European football in the second half of the season, which is putting a major dent in their revenues. However, there is an expectation the financial position around the rules will improve once the loss from 2021/22 drops off the three-year monitoring period.",
      "There will remain challenges for Ineos to confront after that. United continue to post record-breaking revenues that aren't producing profits and a failure to reach the Champions League next season will have a major impact on the summer transfer budget, but it might be a case of trying to sell a player or two before June 30 and focus on the incomings from July onwards.",

      "MEN Sport reported this week that the INEOS founder is an admirer of Southgate after impressing with the Three Lions. The former Middlesbrough boss holds a close friendship with both Sir Dave Brailsford and the incoming director of football Dan Ashworth having worked with both men in the FA set-up.",

      "It doesn't take much money to shift the bookies' manager markets, but Southgate is now their front-runner for the job following a report claiming he is Sir Jim Ratcliffe's priority target.",
      "That hasn't gone down well with the majority of United fans, who don't want to see Southgate manage at Old Trafford after his tenure with England. The 53-year-old hasn't won a trophy in his managerial career and he relegated Middlesbrough in his last club job.",
      "LISTEN: Would you like Southgate at United? Our writers discuss",
      "Ratcliffe has said all the right things since acquiring a minority stake and appointing Southgate would be his most controversial decision yet, so what do our writers think?",
      "They have given their thoughts on the links to Southgate below...",
      "Steven Railston",
      "It seems fans are split on whether Ten Hag should leave at the end of the season, but even those who'd prefer him to part ways would rather he stay over appointing Southgate.",
      "Southgate simply does not have the credentials to manage United and his last experience of club management saw Middlesbrough relegated from the Premier League.",
      "Although he's done an excellent job with England, the demands of international management are different and success in that realm often doesn't translate into club football. Southgate has been perfect for the England job because of his personality. He is a statesmanlike figure, he speaks well on issues in football and wider society and he spent three years as the Three Lions Under-21 manager, so he understood how nuanced the job was.",
      "However, England's squad is stacked with attacking quality and Southgate's approach to games is often pragmatic, overly cautious and defensive, which wouldn't work at United. Southgate is not the right manager to replace Ten Hag. You must win trophies at United and the bottom line is he's never won silverware.",
      "Dom Booth",
      "Southgate isn't a popular name with United fans. There's a general consensus among them that if the club are to replace Ten Hag in the managerial hotseat, they should seek a truly elite name in world football. The problem is, who fits the bill? The really big names are all either occupied in jobs, associated with United's fierce rivals or seem ill-suited to the Old Trafford job. So why not Southgate?",
      "What holds back his case, of course, is his lack of big club experience. Southgate's credentials in the Premier League are thin to say the least. But as a statesman and a figurehead, he ticks all the boxes and you can actually see him galvanising players and getting them to enjoy the responsibility that comes with the United shirt, in the same way that he's made players relish playing for England.",
      "It might be an unpopular opinion, but Southgate could be a decent fit in Ratcliffe's new-look United regime – so long as the club make the right appointments in terms of his support staff. He can handle the pressure of United, he'd get the best out of players but tactically he's more akin to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer than Pep Guardiola.",
      "George Smith",
      "As someone who recently said United should stick with Ten Hag for at least one more season, the prospect of Southgate replacing him is underwhelming. If Ratcliffe does decide to pull the trigger on the Dutchman, Southgate would not be considered an upgrade - and that is not a direct criticism of him.",
      "I am one of Southgate's biggest supporters, constantly finding myself backing him when others have called for him to be sacked as England boss. I think he has done a terrific job on the international stage, resurrecting the country's interest in the national team over the last few years.",
      "However, Southgate is a pragmatic coach, often playing it a little bit too safe. That outlook is unlikely to be welcomed by United supporters, who turn up at Old Trafford expecting to be entertained.",
      "Of course, Southgate has done a good job with England, but international management is very different to managing at club level. Furthermore, the 53-year-old has not managed a club since 2009. All in all, if Ratcliffe does decide to sack Ten Hag and head down a different path, it needs to be made to feel worthwhile. Appointing Southgate would lead to negativity and criticism that can be avoided.",
      "Tom Doyle",
      "There is no doubt that Southgate has done an impressive job with England, but United is a very different beast. Southgate has one of the most talented squads in the game to pick from at England, but that will not be the case at United until Sir Jim Ratcliffe has the club's finances in order.",
      "Southgate has a strong working relationship with Dan Ashworth from their time at the FA and Ashworth is Ratcliffe's No.1 candidate to become United's first sporting director. Ratcliffe's recent comments on United looking for the \"next Mbappe\" rather than signing the PSG superstar himself point towards a more measured approach to transfers for the short-term, with the focus on ensuring the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo flourish - and have like-minded teammates of a similar age profile to build a core around.",
      "Southgate boasts impressive man-management skills and the ability to instil a playing identity in a young group of players, which would align with such an approach.",
      "Still, it is difficult to shake the doubts over Southgate's tactical ability as an in-game coach. His time as England manager is defined by near misses, of what could have been had Southgate decided to twist rather than stick against the likes of Italy, Croatia and France. United is a club in flux, but very much defined by the famous chant from the Stretford End: \"Attack! Attack! Attack!\" Does Southgate have the force of personality and the cast-iron belief to make bold decisions in the heat of the moment?",
      "Southgate may have to win the Euros to convince United fans he has the stomach for a job that has chewed up and spat out the likes of Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal.",

But he was always a really nice guy to be around; he just wanted people to do well and succeed.",
      "“He just had this great eye for a player; he could spot potential in someone just like that, and he always seemed to know what to tweak to get the best out of someone. It's no coincidence he was a success at West Brom, then moved on to Brighton and signed the players he did, and why he's now at Newcastle, and why Manchester United are looking to bring him in. The reason he's respected so much in the game is because he's constantly improving things.",
      "“He's a really good guy to have around the place; I've no doubt he'd fit in at any football club. Wherever he goes now, it's fully deserved.”",
      "Long did however share some reservations over a problem that Ashworth may face should he complete his move to United. “It's an interesting move for him, though, to work with these top, top teams,” he added.",
      "“I think it would be more accepted at a club like West Brom or Brighton, where you can spend £8-10 million on a player and maybe it doesn't quite work out. Whereas, if you go to Man United, you know, I don't think you can get away with buying unproven talent, unless you're just going down the route of getting young, 17/18-year-olds in and bringing them into the club that way. But their fans want the best players in the world, already at the top of their game, so it's definitely going to be a harder role for him.”",
      "“But Dan's an experienced guy who probably knows every player in the game. He's well-rehearsed in what he's doing, and he's had great experience working at the top, because he's with a team who are looking to challenge on all fronts over the next few years. And the main reason they're going to be able to do that is because of depth in their squad, and that's something Dan would play a huge part in.”",

      "At 17, Dayot Upamecano had the world at his feet with some of Europe's biggest clubs wanting him to join their project.",
      "Among them were Manchester United who had the stature to comfortably turn the head of the teenager. \"I was a young boy. I wanted to sign for them straight away,\" Upamecano admitted in an interview with The Athletic.",

Upamecano rose through the Red Bull ranks representing Salzburg and Leipzig before eventually signing for Bayern Munich in the summer of 2021.",
      "Fast forward to the present day and with 107 appearances for the Bavarian giants under his belt, Upamecano finds himself at a crossroads.

      "It is believed his profile is sought after by Premier League clubs and it would not be beyond the realms of imagination to suggest that United will be looking at him. Should they get him at the right price, Upamecano would be a solid addition to a defensive line which needs fresh blood.",
      "Raphael Varane's future remains uncertain as we inch closer to the summer and at 25, Upamecano would fit the younger mould which Sir Jim Ratcliffe is happy to invest in. While his form may not have been exceptional in Munich, a change of scenery would undoubtedly be beneficial for his future growth and could well improve on what Erik ten Hag has at his disposal.",

      "Although United can still win the FA Cup and qualify for the Champions League again this season, the pressure has mounted on Erik ten Hag and he faces an uncertain future.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has become a co-owner of the club and gained control of football operations. There is a feeling Ratcliffe might want his own managerial appointment in charge and that Ten Hag is essentially auditioning to keep his job from now until the end of the season.",

      "Erik ten Hag could be forced to surrender at least some control when it comes to recruitment at Man United this summer.",
      "The trip to Brentford after the international break will mark the beginning of a final audition period for some members of Manchester United's squad to save their Old Trafford careers.",
      "Following the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe in M16, ruthless changes are expected to be made ahead of next season. Ratcliffe has wasted no time in making sweeping changes at boardroom level, meaning big changes within the squad are also on the horizon.",
      "As reported by the Manchester Evening News, player sales could reach double figures, with the club planning to become more proactive in the seller's market. United have been guilty of holding onto players for too long and Ineos need to start righting that wrong.",
      "Though Ratcliffe, earlier this week, hinted that sorting out the club's off-field structure will initially take priority over beefing up the squad, there is no doubt that United need to strengthen on the pitch this summer, regardless of who the manager is. They are still missing quality and depth in some areas.",
      "Not for the first time in recent years, United are going to have to assess their midfield department. Less than two years after signing Casemiro for an initial fee of £60million, they are already at a juncture where they need to be actively pursuing a long-term replacement.",
      "United, of course, bolstered their defensive midfield options last summer, drafting in Sofyan Amrabat from Fiorentina. He arrived on deadline day, signing on loan for the duration of the season, with the deal featuring an option for United to sign him permanently this forthcoming summer for €20million, plus a further €5million in add-ons.",
      "At the time, most United fans were delighted with his addition to the squad, purely because it provided cover in the defensive midfield berth in the eventuality of Casemiro being unavailable through injury or suspension.",
      "However, he has failed to make his mark when opportunities have come his way. It looked as though another opening would have presented itself against Liverpool at the weekend, with Casemiro ruled out with a recurring hamstring issue, yet he watched the FA Cup quarter-final classic from the bench.",
      "Erik ten Hag selected Scott McTominay instead, tasking Kobbie Mainoo with dropping that little bit deeper. As brilliant as Mainoo was, his desire to get forward left United exposed, though it did not end up costing them too dearly.",
      "Considering Ten Hag sounded out Amrabat as his preferred defensive midfield signing last summer, the fact he overlooked him against a side of Liverpool's quality spoke volumes about how his loan spell has gone. Ten Hag worked with Amrabat at FC Utrecht, meaning he was another signing with connections to the Eredivisie.",
      "Since becoming United boss, Ten Hag has signed Andre Onana, Lisandro Martinez, Tyrell Malacia, Christian Eriksen, Wout Weghorst, Antony and Amrabat, all of whom either came from the Eredivisie or had experience in the division. None of them, regardless of the different levels of impact they have each had in M16, are players United fans would have necessarily identified as future signings prior to the 2022 summer transfer window.",
      "As a result of Amrabat being overlooked against Liverpool, it once again raises questions about how much control Ten Hag should have over recruitment. The manager, regardless of the club or division, must have a say in the players he will coach, but there is a feeling that Ten Hag's stranglehold on recruitment should be loosened, despite him admitting prior to taking over in 2022 that he wants control when it comes to signings.",
      "\"I set requirements in advance about how I want to work,\" he told Dutch outlet Trouw, speaking in April 2022. \"If they aren't granted, I won't do it.",
      "\"I am ultimately responsible and accounted for the results. I don't want to be the sole ruler, I stand for cooperation, but control in transfers is a condition for me.\"",
      "Ten Hag addressed the topic of recruitment again last month, doubling down on the importance of manager having a say on signings, saying: \"Yes, I am sure. It's control. And I have had the talks with them (Ineos) about it.",
      "\"They will not bring in players who the manager doesn't want, because that will not work. We will work there together, with suggestions, bringing players in and discussing. Then it is about picking the right players, it is about cooperation and togetherness. That is the way they want to work.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has made it crystal clear that United need to change their outlook on recruitment, meaning Ten Hag is unlikely to have as much power as perhaps he would have liked. But as Amrabat has proven, that might not be a bad thing.",

Cambridge United earned over £1million in 2015 after taking Manchester United to a replay at Old Trafford, with other sides following suit in earning lucrative sums as a result of their heroics displays.",
      "There were previously replays at every round of the FA Cup, though they have not been staged from the fifth round of the competition onwards since 2018/19 in a bid to reduce the number of fixtures clubs are participating in each season.",
      "Replays are expected to be axed altogether to coincide with a new TV deal, expected to begin in 2025/26, and could also see two-legged Carabao Cup semi-finals ditched. Such changes are viewed as necessary by many due to adjustments to European football from next season, which will see sides competing in more fixtures than before as the number of clubs involved in the Champions League and Europa League first phases rises from 32 to 36.",
      "Of the opinion removing FA Cup replays is the right way to go, Neville said on The Overlap's Stick To Football Podcast: \"They have to take replays away in the FA Cup. They have them in the early rounds, but they have to get rid of them. It’s all or nothing.",
      "“I get it [the argument about keeping them for the lower clubs] but to save the competition [replays need to go]. I like to think I talk on lower clubs, and they can get a home draw and if you think about a lower club getting a home draw, and it has to finish that day, you’ve got a chance of a shock. Whereas if it goes to a replay at a big ground, you get the money but where’s the shock?”",
      "One of those who has been calling for this shift in approach for some time has been Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, who hasn't been afraid to make his opinion known on the topic.",

      "The report claims that AC Milan are hopeful of being able to secure a deal to sign Zirkzee but adds that United are also in the running. It has been stated that Zirkzee himself plans on playing in the Premier League in the future, although it's not expected for a couple more years.",
      "Despite this, United are still claimed to be an option for Zirkzee if he leaves Bologna in the summer. The striker is reported to have a €40 million (£34 million) release clause in his contract that can only be activated by his former club Bayern Munich, meaning other clubs such as United would need to match that fee or offer an increased bid in order to convince Bologna to do business.",
      "Elsewhere, United are also reportedly interested in signing Fenerbahce midfielder Sebastian Szymanski. According to Tutto Juve, the Reds are one of a host of clubs that are in the running to sign Szymanski this summer.",
      "It has been claimed that United will face competition from Juventus for the midfielder. Premier League rivals Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur have also been credited with an interest.",
      "The report claims that Fenerbahce would only consider doing business over Szymanski's future if an offer in the region of €25 million (£21 million) is made. The article adds that Spurs have already made an offer for Szymanski, but do not state the exact fee.",

      "Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has joined up with England to continue his rehabilitation from a muscle injury.",
      "Shaw sustained a fresh muscle issue in last month's win against Luton Town and it was confirmed he could be ruled out for the remainder of the campaign with the problem.",
      "A brief statement issued by United said: \"Luke Shaw has sustained a muscle injury and will be out for an extended period. Further assessment is still needed to determine the severity but we expect him to be absent for a few months.\"",
      "Shaw has begun rehabilitation on his injury at Carrington and his injury meant he couldn't be selected in the England squad for the international break, but he's been invited to St. George's Park to continue his recovery around the England camp, so he can still be involved regardless.",
      "The defender has been first-choice at left-back for a large part of Gareth Southgate's reign as England manager and he scored the Three Lions' only goal in the Euro 2020 final.",
      "Southgate was recently asked if Shaw's chances of making the England squad for this summer's Euros in Germany are uncertain and he told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Well, we'd have to say yes is the answer to that because the timelines would suggest he will only be available in the dying embers of the season. You don't know what version of the player you're going to get.\"",
      "Southgate also talked about how tough it is to play in a big tournament like the Euros, and the physicality needed. He said: \"Clearly, going into a seven-game tournament... one of the great things we've been able to learn in two of the three tournaments we've played in, we've played all seven matches and the physical demands that that brings are notable.",
      "\"We might have everybody that's currently injured back and available but how fit and how match fit and how robust to get through a tournament, we're going to have to work that out as well in the next few months.\"",
      "If Shaw's rehabilitation goes well, he could return for United before the end of the season and that would increase his chances of starting for England this summer.",

      "Man United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.",
      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand.

      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Raphael Varane sees his contract at Old Trafford expire at the end of next season and Man United appear to have begun searching for a replacement",
      "Louis Saha has urged Manchester United to sign Leny Yoro this summer. The 18-year-old centre-half has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League recently as he continues to impress for LOSC Lille in the French top flight.",
      "Yoro, who sees his contract at Stade Pierre-Mauroy expire in 2025, has burst onto the scene and enjoyed a meteoric rise to superstardom this season. The France Under-21 international has featured 25 times in Ligue 1, helping Paulo Fonseca's side keep 14 clean sheets.",
      "Not only has Yoro played a crucial role for Lille domestically but he's also helped Les Dogues progress into the Europa Conference League quarterfinal. Next month, Lille will face Aston Villa over two legs in the quarterfinal – and the teenage defender will be looking to impress.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, as quoted by CaughtOffside, Manchester United have been monitoring Yoro's progress – and they're big admirers. With the Red Devils said to be in the market for a new defender this summer, Louis Saha has told Betfred four reasons why the youngster would be the ideal replacement for Raphael Varane.",
      "\"I think he could have an immediate impact if he moved to the Premier League because he's a big boy, very confident, technically and quick,\" said the former Manchester United striker. \"He has all the ingredients that a modern day centre-back possesses.",
      "\"It’s incredible how trusted he is at his age and I’m sure he could adapt very quickly to the Premier League. Raphaël Varane moved to Real Madrid when he was 18 and Yoro is a similar type of defender that brings calmness to a defence.",
      "\"With the right manager and the right teammates, he can have an amazing career. Yoro’s a really exciting player and I’m sure that Manchester United won’t be the only club looking to sign him.\"",
      "Last month, Angel Gomes heaped tremendous praise on Yoro, who's currently valued at £42.7million. Speaking to Eurosport, as quoted by SportWitness, the former Manchestester United and Lille midfielder said: \"As soon as he arrived in the group, I understood that he was going to reach the summits.",
      "\"When I discovered the pros at the age of 16 at Manchester United, I understood that it was different. He already had the right temperament. And that’s not normal for a 16- or 17-year-old player arriving.",
      "\"It’s like he’s already an experienced player. And it showed in the way he trained, the way he behaved. His progress was obvious.\"",

      "Man United midfielder Bruno Fernandes is determined for the club to succeed under the guidance of Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has confirmed he has met with members of the Ineos Group to inform them that he wants to be part of their project to take the club forward.",
      "The petrochemical giant, spearheaded by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, secured a 27.7 per cent stake in United last month. As part of the deal, they have secured control of the club's football operations.",
      "Ratcliffe has wasted no time making his mark, raiding Manchester City for Omar Berrada, who has been installed as United's new chief executive, while targeting a move for Dan Ashworth. The latter is currently on gardening leave from Newcastle United after informing the Magpies of his desire to become United's inaugural sporting director.",
      "Ratcliffe plans to get United back on an even keel with Manchester City and Liverpool, vowing to knock the two clubs \"off their perch\" within three years. Though that means trying to win the Premier League title and other trophies, all Fernandes demands is that United, at the very least, can be more competitive than they have been.",
      "\"I've always told the club that I don't want to be promised that we're going to be champions because whatever club I go to, I don't expect to be promised something that they can't fulfil from the start,\" Fernandes told A BOLA.",
      "\"What I've always asked for and what I want from the club is for us to be competitive. This year we haven't been and we don't have to hide it. The season has been below our expectations, below my expectations, at least.",
      "\"And I think the club's too, because they're not used to being in these positions. I want to be competitive, I want to compete, I want to win.\"",
      "Fernandes continued: \"I've already had a meeting with the new owners. They want to meet with the players and have already done so individually, and that was exactly the message I sent.",
      "\"I want to stay here, I want to be part of a project that has feet, legs, torso and head, everything that is needed so that we can compete with Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool, which are the clubs that have been in the best shape. City and Liverpool above all, and Arsenal, which in the last two or three years has also been growing.",
      "\"After last year, when I think we had a good season for the expectations that existed and for my expectations... I was aware that I wasn't going to be at the same level as Liverpool and City, I was aware of that, but I was also aware that we could compete or be closer, and we were closer to competing with them, we reached two finals, we won one, we lost another, we reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League.",
      "\"But from last season to this one there wasn't that continuity that we should have here, which would have made us even more competitive, a team more in line to be in the top places.\"",

Ratcliffe and members of the Ineos Group have secured control of football operations.",
      "After a catalogue of errors on that front in recent years, Ratcliffe has wasted no time in trying to correct those wrongs. He has already taken Omar Berrada from Manchester City, appointing him as the club's new chief executive, and he wants to secure the services of Dan Ashworth to become United's inaugural sporting director.",
      "As well as trying to fill the boardroom with football minds and experience, he also has grand ambitions for Old Trafford. He said in a podcast released on Tuesday that there is an 'opportunity' for a stadium to be built that could hold up to 100,000 supporters.",
      "With that said, Ratcliffe's ambition cannot be questioned. He is making it clear that he wants to return United to the top step of the podium, both domestically and in Europe, as quickly as possible.",
      "To achieve that dream, however, United are going to have to improve their hit rate when it comes to recruitment. The club has signed more failures than successes in recent years, blowing millions of pounds on players who have simply not lived up to expectations.",
      "In the eyes of many, that is a result of not having the correct football structure in place. But as Ratcliffe has proven with the appointment of Berrada and planned move for Ashworth, he is trying to right those wrongs.",
      "As a result, Ratcliffe has all but confirmed that trying to implement a sound and sensible structure will take priority over initially splashing the cash in the transfer market.",
      "Ratcliffe, speaking on the Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast, said: \"It's not where our focus is; the solution isn't spending a lot of money on a couple of great players. They have done that, if you look at the last 10 years, they have spent a lot of money on a couple of great players.",
      "\"The first thing we need to do is get the right people in the right boxes who are managing and organising the club. And make sure we get recruitment right, it is such a vital part of football today.\"",
      "Ratcliffe's outlook on the situation is likely to be music to the ears of former United captain Gary Neville, who has repeatedly banged the drum in recent months about the importance of a proper football structure being put in place. Back in December, the former defender suggested strengthening the off-field department should initially take priority over bolstering the squad.",
      "\"I honestly think that there are a lot of things they will look at before the squad,\" Neville said, speaking on his Sky Sports podcast. \"They have to try and correct the playing side of things as quickly as possible, but there are some gaping holes in the club.",
      "\"There isn't a CEO. There isn't a sporting director. There isn't a capable head of recruitment. They are the top three jobs in a football club, outside of a manager. They are the top three jobs in a football club and then you have got a manager making the fourth, meaning that quartet is very, very strong and tight.",
      "\"If that quartet are very successful, then the team on the pitch will likely be successful. The first thing that will be sorted will be people, because there is a lack of those major roles in United that are actually in existence, at this moment in time.\"",
      "Neville's dreams now appear to becoming a reality, with Ratcliffe insisting that putting the right people in place will lead to a better recruitment policy. United have been missing an elite-level football structure and are now in the process of finally putting one together.",

Cox has helped oversee the teenager's development with the youth teams at Carrington, and has explained the talent that the United midfielder possesses that puts him alongside the best in the world - his ability to 'play with a joy and freedom'.",
      "\"Our fans are naturally really supportive of the young players and give them great encouragement, but ultimately, you’ve got to show you’re deserving of being in the team,\" Cox told United's club website. \"The manager is quite vocal about the fact that he doesn’t do favours; you have to earn it and you only get there because you deserve it.

      "Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag has given five young players their debuts, something which Sir Jim Ratcliffe will appreciate.",
      "Youth. Courage. Success. The three pillars of Manchester United.",
      "United have a rich history of believing in young players and Erik ten Hag's promotion of talent at Ajax was one of the reasons his interview at Old Trafford was a success. During Ten Hag's time in charge of United he's given five players - Charlie McNeill, Kobbie Mainoo, Dan Gore, Willy Kambwala and Omari Forson - their debuts for the first-team.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was handed his bow by Ralf Rangnick, but he's broken into the first-team under Ten Hag's guidance and the Dutchman been the manager responsible for his impressive development, which has seen the winger make 20 starts in the Premier League this season.",
      "Garnacho is an established first-team player and a huge academy success story. He was signed for a pittance from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2020 and he's proved to be a bargain. The 19-year-old has matured this term and his relocation to the right wing, a position which he'd never played before prior to facing Aston Villa, has gone seamlessly.",
      "There was always a suspicion Garnacho would be as effective on the right and he's made that position his own, starting ahead of £86million purchase Antony. Garnacho was the only outfield player not to be given a single minute on the pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia in Ten Hag's first summer in charge but the Dutchman has been the perfect manager for a youngster who perhaps needed more guidance than others.",
      "Ten Hag deserves huge praise for developing Garnacho and he's overseen the emergence of Mainoo, who has started 11 of United's 12 games in all competitions in 2024. Mainoo is an exceptional prospect and the footage of Ten Hag putting his arm around him after the Carabao Cup final at Wembley has resurfaced over the last few weeks.",
      "The 18-year-old was not involved in the squad, but he was invited to take part in the celebrations and Ten Hag's gesture hinted at his future role. He was subsequently named on the pre-season tour of the United States and was the breakout star of last summer.",
      "Mainoo was superb in those pre-season friendlies and his breakthrough into the first-team this season was only delayed by the ankle injury he sustained against Real Madrid in Texas. The midfielder passed every test after returning from injury - facing Everton, Galatasaray, Newcastle and Liverpool away - and his call-up to the England squad is deserved.",
      "It's likely Mainoo would have broken into the United team regardless of the manager, but Ten Hag has shown trust in him and the player has gone on record with his appreciation. Ten Hag has previously said only the best youth prospects will be given meaningful opportunities, and Garnacho and Mainoo are the most recent academy success stories.",
      "United are closing in on the milestone of the 250th academy player to be given their senior debut and that's a remarkable achievement, although unlikely to be met this season. Forson, Kambwala and Gore were the latest players to receive their debuts. Gore has been sent on loan to Port Vale, while the others have been kept around the first-team squad.",
      "McNeill spent the first half of the season on loan at Stevenage, but was recalled in January and he's spending time with the Under-21s to get back up to speed again. Garnacho, Mainoo, Gore and McNeill all started in the FA Youth Cup final in 2022 and it's been tremendous to see them progress to make their senior debuts at the club.",
      "Ten Hag has fulfilled his remit in that regard and that can only bode well for a decision on his future made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has reiterated the importance of developing young players. His record of giving young talent a chance is something INEOS will appreciate.",

      "This week's Man Utd academy notebook on the youth set-up ongoings, brought to you by the Manchester Evening News.",
      "Manchester United's academy continues to thrive, with a raft of players supporting the first-team squad in recent weeks due to injury, while another glut have had loan spells since January.",
      "The next player from the famed academy to appear for the first-team will be the 250th graduate to have done so, a great achievement by the club. Omari Forson - more on him below - was the 249th when he featured against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup in January.",
      "While another graduate, Kobbie Mainoo, continues to hit the headlines with his England call-up, here's a round-up of the news from the youth set-up.",
      "Lacey set to sign new deal",
      "Last year, Shea Lacey signed a scholarship deal at the club, with an agreement in principle to sign professional terms when he turns 17 and his birthday is now just around the corner.",
      "Lacey's first professional contract will be announced after he celebrates his birthday on April 14, and the deal is the reward for his excellent and continued progression in the youth set-up.",
      "The youngster is regarded as one of the most exciting talents in the academy and while he's been limited to just eight appearances this season due to injury, he's close to a return. It's understood that issue is the first injury of note in Lacey's time in the academy and fans who follow the youth set-up have been eagerly awaiting his comeback.",
      "Lacey was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter.",
      "Forson features for the U21s",
      "When Travis Binnion spoke to the MEN for an exclusive interview in December, he suggested Omari Forson could be the next youngster from the academy to be given his debut.",
      "Forson was handed his senior bow a month later and he's since been given a handful of opportunities by Erik ten Hag, who started him against Fulham in the Premier League. The forward is out of contract at the end of the season and although sources indicated he was expected to sign a new deal, talks stalled and he could leave the club this summer.",
      "United want to keep Forson and Ten Hag has expressed that by giving him first-team appearances. He was on the bench against Liverpool last Sunday and a day later, he started for the Under-21s against West Brom as they comfortably won 3-0 in the Premier League 2.",
      "Having a ball",
      "Also in the team for the Baggies victory was Willy Kambwala, another who had been on the bench for that Old Trafford thriller 24 hours earlier. He had clearly got over his celebrations with matchwinner Amad just 24 hours earlier.",
      "Forson and Kambwala, meanwhile, were recently rewarded for their Premier League debuts. They each received a Debut Ball from the Premier League, to mark their recent top-flight bows.",
      "The ritual, which first happened in 2015/16, sees all homegrown debutants who have been developed at an academy of a club in the English football pyramid for three years or more prior to their 21st birthday receive the memento. United’s director of academy Nick Cox and technical director Darren Fletcher presented the items to the pair at the Carrington training ground.",
      "Who will be the next United recipient?",
      "Gore yet to return from injury",
      "Dan Gore was kept around the first-team squad for the first half of the season and he made his senior debut, but due to the competition in midfield, he was sent on loan in January.",
      "Gore signed for Port Vale on loan for the remainder of the season, however, he sustained an injury immediately after signing and he's been unavailable since.",
      "At the start of the month, sources said Gore, who has stayed at Port Vale during his recovery, should be close to a return to action, but he's yet to return from that injury and it will be interesting to see if he makes the matchday squad against Burton Albion this weekend.",
      "The U18s' title charge",
      "The words \"Manchester United are top of the league,\" haven't been heard for a while, but the Under-18s have dominated their division this season and are likely to win the title.",
      "They had a flawless record - no defeats - until losing against Manchester City this month, a result which meant City are now 10 points behind, with two games in hand to play.",
      "Adam Lawrence has done an outstanding job in his first season as U18 boss and everybody connected with the club is hoping the league title will be won come May. The U18s are back in action on April 13 against Stoke City.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has become a mainstay in the Man Utd midfield and on international duty he will link-up with players he could have played alongside at club level.",
      "Over the next few months, it feels almost certain that at some stage Kobbie Mainoo is going to share the centre of a pitch with Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham. It's a matter of time until it happens and the only question after that is for how long that triumvirate will make England's midfield their personal playground.",
      "Mainoo feels like the missing link - metaphorically and literally - between Rice and Bellingham in the Three Lions' engine room. Without wishing to pile too much pressure on an 18-year-old with just 23 first-team appearances to his name, Mainoo should slot in perfectly into that midfield and have a long international career ahead of him.",
      "His rise at United this season has been astronomical, a feat even more impressive given the difficulties the team has endured during a season damaged by injuries and beset by on-pitch difficulties. Mainoo has risen above it to run the midfield at times, outshining Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes.",
      "He is proving too difficult to ignore and that was proven on Tuesday when Gareth Southgate promoted him from the Under-21s to the England senior squad. After his performance against Liverpool on Sunday it was clear he was going to have to skip the age group and go straight into the squad for friendlies with Brazil and Belgium at Wembley.",
      "Mainoo will almost certainly make his debut in one of those games, although there is no guarantee yet he will play alongside Rice and Bellingham. These are friendlies, after all. But there is clearly a midfield place up for grabs in Southgate's team and previous incumbents Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips are seeing their grip on it weaken.",
      "Those who have watched him regularly for United this season wouldn't be surprised if Mainoo made that position his own by the time the European Championships begin in Germany in June. A midfield of Rice, Mainoo and Bellingham would be feared across the continent and what's more, they are 25, 18 and 20. This is the present and the future.",
      "If they do line up together, there will be a few staff members around Old Trafford wondering aloud about what might have been. United deserve great credit for nurturing a talent of Mainoo's considerable gifts and Erik ten Hag deserves praise for throwing him in at the deep end this season, but it's not a significant stretch to say they could have had Rice and Bellingham in red as well.",
      "Rice was of regular interest to United during his time at West Ham and in his final couple of years at the London Stadium he was usually the best midfielder on the pitch when the two teams played. But United never quite committed to making their move, despite the obvious need for a player of Rice's gifts.",
      "When he joined Arsenal for £105million this summer it was a transfer battle being conducted by the top two teams in the Premier League at a time when the budget was stretched at Old Trafford, but United had their chance in the years before that. In 2020 they signed Donny van de Beek for £35million, in 2022 they moved for Casemiro for £70millon and last summer it was another £55million on Mount. In hindsight, some of that cash could have been put to better use in making a push for Rice.",
      "Van de Beek has flopped at United and they will be lucky to recoup even a third of the sum spent on signing him for Ajax. Casemiro was excellent last year but has struggled more this season and Ineos could cut their losses and get his wages off the books this summer. The jury remains out on Mount, but Mainoo's emergence has forced him out of the team with no obvious route back in.",
      "But in the list of players to get away from United, Bellingham is at the top. He has lit up La Liga this season and is on the fast track to becoming one of the best footballers in the world. In March 2020, the then 16-year-old was given a tour of Carrington as United rolled out the red carpet to try and sign him from Birmingham City, even drafting in the help of Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "The sales pitch failed to win over the Bellingham family, with father Mark heavily involved in plotting the next steps of his son's career at that stage. Instead, Bellingham joined Borussia Dortmund and the family will certainly hold no regrets over that call, given the trajectory Bellingham has been on since moving to the Bundesliga.",
      "Regrets will certainly be prevalent at United. A midfield of Rice, Mainoo and Bellingham looks outstanding on paper. By the time the summer is over, we might get to see how good it is on grass as well.",

      "The 18-year-old has risen to the fore for United and earned a maiden senior Three Lions call-up in the aftermath of his stand-out performance against Liverpool in the FA Cup. Mainoo displayed his midfield qualities against one of the favourites for the competition before receiving a standing ovation after being sacrificed after 80 minutes.",
      "Maguire, who has over 60 caps for England, heaped praise on his club and now-international teammate, tipping the youngster to be on the plane to Germany as a member of the Euros squad and comparing him to Jude Bellingham. Despite only making his first Premier League start in November, Mainoo has made a big impression at United and Maguire is certain that academy product is prepared and won't be scared going into the tournament.",
      "\"I don't see why not,\" said Maguire. \"To play at a major tournament, obviously, it's big to have experience but also the young boys do come in and sometimes they play with no fear and they can excel in that way.",
      "‌\"I don't have any concerns whatsoever. It's incredible he's (only) 18, he's so mature. He's a bit like Jude was when he was a young boy. He's got a mature head on his shoulders. I had no concerns.",

      "\"Listen, we have a lot of good centre-mids in this country at the moment, a lot of players who have been there and done it, and shown that they can do it in the big, major tournaments. He'll keep working hard, I'm sure he will, because he's a great lad. It's exciting times for him and his family. We will see where it goes.\"",
      "The 31-year-old added: \"I told him if he needs anything just to ask me, give me a text, about anything, schedule, he thoroughly deserves it. He has been excellent for us this season.‌",

      "Graham Potter, the former Chelsea and Brighton boss, has reportedly been added to Ajax's list of potential managers, alongside Liverpool assistant Pep Lijnders and Manchester United's Erik ten Hag.",
      "Alex Kroes, the new chief executive at Ajax, was surprised to learn that Potter might be open to a move to Holland to revive his career after being let go from Stamford Bridge nearly a year ago. Potter, who is 48 years old, has some supporters at the Amsterdam club due to his work at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Some people have even suggested to Kroes that he should consider an English model for the club, especially after Ajax's 4-0 loss to Aston Villa in the Europa Conference League last week. The Mirror reports that Ajax are keeping an eye on Lijnders and their former coach Ten Hag.",
      "Lijnders will be leaving Anfield when Jurgen Klopp steps down this summer, while Ten Hag is trying to secure his position at Old Trafford. Interestingly, Potter is also being considered as a possible replacement for Ten Hag at United.",
      "Kroes has been given the job of turning things around at Ajax after a disappointing season that saw them end up at the bottom of the Eredivisie table for the first time ever. Kroes has visited both United and their rivals Manchester City as he plans to create a new structure at the Dutch club.",
      "He was reportedly very impressed with the multi-club model he saw at the Etihad, as well as City's academy system and the playing style used by Pep Guardiola. John van 't Schip, the current boss of Ajax, will be leaving the club at the end of the season despite only taking on the role in October.",
      "Now, Kroes is looking for a new manager, with Lijnders being seen as the best choice. Lijnders will be leaving Anfield with Jurgen Klopp when the season ends and he's gained a good reputation as an assistant manager.",
      "But, Ten Hag might also get an offer from Kroes to leave United. The Reds have had a tough second season under the Dutchman and new co-owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, is thinking about other possible managers.",
      "Ajax are adamant they won't pay for a new manager. But, this doesn't mean Ten Hag can't be approached as it is reported he might leave his contract at Old Trafford if Ratcliffe doesn't promise him enough control.",

      "Man United went into the international break on a high after a 4-3 win against Liverpool but Erik ten Hag's future remains uncertain.",
      "Erik ten Hag is currently the most popular he's been among Manchester United fans in the last six months for two reasons: he oversaw a special victory against Liverpool last weekend and, most importantly, England manager Gareth Southgate is the bookies' favourite to replace him.",
      "The fanbase is split on whether Ten Hag should remain at Old Trafford, but even those who prefer him to part ways would rather he continue than Southgate be appointed.",
      "Southgate is underqualified to manage the biggest side in England and his last experience in club management saw Middlesbrough relegated from the Premier League.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made an excellent start to life as co-owner of United but hiring Southgate would be a spectacular backward step, and it would risk his goodwill with supporters.",
      "United fans must have spat their lunch out in shock when seeing links to Southgate yesterday because although he's done an admirable job with England, he's not close to the calibre of manager the club should be courting following Ratcliffe's investment.",
      "The problem is the list of potential candidates to replace Ten Hag is uninspiring. It's easy to pick holes in the other market leaders - Graham Potter, Thomas Tuchel, Ruben Amorim, Zinedine Zidane and Simone Inzaghi - and they make the Dutchman's case to keep his job stronger.",
      "However, the elephant in the room is that if Ten Hag is only keeping his job because there is a lack of alternatives, then he is staying in his position for the wrong reasons.",
      "Ten Hag was appointed on merit after an excellent three-and-half years with Ajax and shouldn't keep his job by default, despite the managerial landscape appearing tricky to manoeuvre.",
      "United's win against Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last weekend will be remembered for decades and it meant there's still hope of winning a trophy this season.",
      "Although the first half of the campaign was bleak, it could still be salvaged and it looks increasingly likely that fifth place in the league will be enough to qualify for a Champions League spot.",
      "Ten Hag will argue this season has been a success if the FA Cup is won and United qualify for the Champions League again, but how the team has travelled to their destination matters and those outcomes might not be enough to earn him another crack of the whip.",
      "The biggest reason to part ways with Ten Hag this summer is the team's lack of identity. He's been in charge for over 18 months now, he's spent over £400million on players he wanted, and yet he's been unable to implement a distinguishable style of play, which is damning.",
      "Of course, there have been injuries to contend with, but other teams, like Tottenham, have visited Old Trafford without their best players and their tactical plan was unchanged.",
      "\"We will never play that football. Because those were different players,\" Ten Hag said in October, when asked why the style that was successful at Ajax hasn't been seen at United.",
      "\"This is also not why I came here. We are playing different football than I showed at Ajax because I have to because I can't play the same way. The players decide how you play.",
      "\"Ajax has a very typical and characteristic style of play, with United I will always show different football, I did so last year as well. We play much more direct football here because I have the players for that.\"",
      "He attempted to clarify a week later: “The explanation from my point of view was totally wrong that I can’t play like Ajax because I have different players.",
      "\"I came here with my philosophy based on possession but also [I want] to combine it with the DNA of Manchester United and combine it with the competencies and the characters of the players. We have seen what it was. We played very good football last season.”",

      "When he called his family in Stockport to tell them the good news, they were \"buzzing\". And so, Mainoo's rapid rise continues.",
      "\"The games have been coming so fast at United I've not really had the time to think about it,\" he said about the chance of playing for England's senior team. \"I have not really thought about it too much.",
      "\"Obviously I knew the international break was coming up, so thought about it a bit but, still, we had so many big games that I couldn't really take my eye off the ball.",
      "\"But now I'm here, obviously I am taking it all in and it's been amazing.\"",
      "He also shared his personal aim to make his England debut in one of the upcoming games and show Southgate he deserves to be in the squad going to Germany.",
      "\"Yeah, I think that's the end goal for the season, to get into that squad,\" Mainoo mentioned. \"But obviously I've got to focus on club football in the meantime, and hopefully that'll figure itself out.\"",
      "Mainoo knows he's not the only young star to get a chance with Southgate, as Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka became England regulars quickly.",
      "When asked if he wants to be like them, he told talkSPORT: \"Yeah, definitely. To follow in the footsteps of them, they've been amazing. They've come up and stayed up so quickly and they're both great players.\"",
      "Mainoo is thrilled about this \"amazing opportunity\" with England and spoke proudly of his Ghanaian roots through his parents.",
      "The 18-year-old said his family taught him to be a good person, and mentioned that playing with Manchester United teammates Casemiro and Bruno has helped him grow as a player.",
      "\"I'd say maybe Casemiro or Bruno (have been the biggest influences),\" he shared. \"Playing in midfield with them two has definitely helped me a lot.",
      "\"They have so much experience, they are great players and had great careers, so to pick up things from them is the best.\"",
      "The young player looks up to Ronaldinho because he played so freely, while also naming his Manchester United icons.",
      "\"I'd say (Wayne) Rooney, Paul Scholes as well,\" he added. \"And King Eric (Cantona). It was a bit before my time, but I still appreciate it.\"",

      "He couldn't wipe the smile from his face as he attempted to explain what had just happened. “It was an unbelievable day for me,\" he said. \"I want to celebrate this moment with my family and the fans, who supported us all game. I think today was one of the best games for United.",
      "\"I scored a last-minute goal against Liverpool. It was an unbelievable moment for me. It is very special because it was my dream to play for United. I was in Sunderland last season and I waited for my chance. To score my second goal for United was very important for me.\"",
      "Amad is still only 21 and despite his English being limited, he was able to express how he felt through his words and through the beaming, wide smile etched across his face.",
      "He made an immediate impact when coming on from the bench with five minutes of normal time remaining and he produced a winning goal that will be remembered forever.",
      "Although it seemed like the move was about to fizzle out due to Alejandro Garnacho's slightly overhit pass, Amad scored with an excellent finish and found the bottom right corner.",
      "He'd already been shown a yellow card and received a second booking when removing his shirt in the celebrations, which meant he was sent off and forced into the dressing room.",
      "Amad must have received the best reception for a sent-off player in Old Trafford history as he left the pitch. \"I forgot the first yellow,\" he smiled when asked about the red card.",
      "The winger was informed in the January transfer window he would be kept around the first-team squad this season and Sunday's substitute appearance was the chance he'd been waiting for.",
      "Before the Liverpool game, Amad had played just over 60 minutes in cameo appearances against Nottingham Forest (twice) and Fulham and he'd been overlooked in other fixtures.",
      "He was an unused substitute in the fourth round of the FA Cup against Newport County in January and he's been forced to watch on as others, like Omari Forson, have been given opportunities, but he grabbed his chance against Liverpool with both hands and it could be his turning point.",
      "When asked whether it's been difficult to watch games from the bench, he diplomatically said: “I train hard every day and waited for my chance. The manager believes in me.",

      "\"I wait for my chance and, for me, every game is like a Champions League final. Whether I start or I am on the bench, it is important for me to be ready every time.”",
      "Amad deleted United from his social media accounts a few days before facing Liverpool but kept posts involving Sunderland, who he spent a successful 12-month loan spell with.",
      "He later clarified his social media clean-up by suggesting he wanted to focus on Ramadan, however, many fans believed it was evidence of his frustration over a lack of minutes.",
      "It would be concerning if Amad wasn't frustrated over his lack of game time and it's hoped now he will be considered a serious option to influence matches from the bench, at least.",
      "Since Amad's return from injury in December, he's been an unused substitute six times in the league and supporters have been desperate to see more of him.",
      "While Amad's loan with Sunderland was a resounding success, his ceiling remains unknown and he can provide something different in wide areas, or even play down the middle.",
      "Amad said Ten Hag 'believes in him' and fans want to see more proof of that from now until the end of the season.",

      "Victor Osimhen is reportedly expected to leave Napoli at the end of the season and has been linked with a move to Manchester United who are in the market for a new striker",
      "Manchester United have been tipped to make a huge move for Napoli striker Victor Osimhen by an Italian agent.",
      "Osimhen, 25, may leave Napoli soon, even though he just agreed to stay until 2026 in December. The forward has been touted for a summer exit, with Chelsea or Paris Saint-Germain mentioned as possible destinations.",
      "However, Manchester United are expected to need a new striker when Anthony Martial's contract expires in June. That would leave Rasmus Hojlund as the only recognised striker in the United squad and, despite his recent scoring streak, the Reds would reuire reinforcement in attack. This has led Ialian agent Roberto De Fanti to discuss United's reported interest in Osimhen.",
      "When asked which clubs are interested in the Napoli striker, De Fanti told Tuttomercatoweb: \"I could say everyone, but the truth is that United above all are looking for a centre forward. Hojlund is doing reasonably well, but the classic number No.9 - the [Erling] Haaland of the situation - could be Osimhen.\"",
      "That would require United to activate the release clause in the striker's contract, reported to be around £110m. That would go against Sir Jim Ratcliffe's recent plan for the club to find the next generation of superstars in the transfer market but signing Osimhen would instantly transform the team's prospects.",
      "The 25-year-old forward has admitted that he already has a plan in mind ahead of next season. \"I have already made my decision on the next step to do at the end of the season,\" he said. \"I already made up my mind. I already have my plan, I know what I want to do, the next step I want to take.",
      "\"I think 60% of the people mention the rumours about me linked with the Premier League. The Premier League is one of the biggest leagues in the world. I want to finish the season with Napoli strong then come up with the decision I've already made.\"",
      "PSG are thought to be the current frontrunners as they plan for life beyond Kylian Mbappe, though Osimhen could be tempted by an English side. From Napoli's perspective, club president Aurelio De Laurentiis is reluctant to lose the striker that fired the team to the Serie A title last season, but is aware that every player has a price.",
      "\"Victor is another good player that Napoli have. We had (Edinson) Cavani, (Gonzalo) Higuain, (Ezequiel) Lavezzi and we had (Dries) Mertens, we had a lot of people who were fantastic,\" he told Sky Sports. \"And there are others who are attracted by Real Madrid, by Paris Saint-Germain, by Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea. So you cannot stop them, especially when they have a fixed amount of money where they can be bought.",
      "\"Osimhen is a very great player - but you know Napoli is a fantastic place. There are certain players who fell in love with Napoli and stayed, like (Marek) Hamsik for 11 years. Or like others for eight years.\"",
      "\"[Osimhen] has a release clause. It's a very big amount of money. Who knows who will leave, we will see. The money is the last problem for Napoli. We always made very good acquisitions as we did in the past. We will do (so) in the future.",
      "\"The problem is just sentimental problems. When you see a player leave, it's like a son. You are also happy if this son has fantastic success everywhere else.\"",

In recent years, he has been the best coach in the world,\" Fernandes told A Bola. \"He is probably the coach who most changed the game of football. Nowadays, everyone wants to be Guardiola, there's no need to hide that.\"",

      "Wolves midfielder João Gomes has already outlined his desire to sample the taste of Champions League football amid reports linking him with a move to Manchester United.",
      "The Reds, according to a report by the Mirror, are 'weighing up' a move for the Brazilian ahead of this summer's transfer window. It is claimed he has been identified as a 'potential replacement' for Casemiro.",
      "The latter, despite joining United less than two years ago, could be sold this summer. He has regressed this season, failing to hit the standards he consistently reached last term.",
      "Turning 32 last month, it is both clear and obvious that United need fresher legs at the base of their midfield. Following the emergence of Kobbie Mainoo this season, they need an elite-level destroyer to provide him with the license to strut his stuff and make progressive runs without fear of leaving his team exposed.",
      "Gomes, who is 23, has developed impressively since joining Wolves from Flamengo in January 2023, making 39 appearances for the club so far. He has played 28 times his term, chipping in with two goals.",
      "As a result of his development, which includes him having won the third-highest number of tackles (83) in the Premier League this season, it is hardly surprising that United are being linked with his signature. However, if the Reds are to stand any chance of signing him this forthcoming summer, they will most probably need to include Champions League football within their sales pitch.",
      "Prior to joining Wolves, Gomes expressed his craving to play in Europe's premier club competition, though he cited Liverpool as a club he dreamt of playing for.",
      "Speaking in the summer of 2022, Gomes, as quoted by ESPN Brazil, said: \"Liverpool is a team I would play for. I have the greatest desire to play. Playing in the Champions League is my biggest dream and that of my family, my biggest dream in football.\"",
      "With 10 Premier League games remaining this season, United's Champions League hopes for next season are currently out of their hands. They are nine points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa and are six shy of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "However, the Premier League could be granted five places for next season's new-look Champions League, meaning a fifth-placed finish could be enough to secure qualification. United are desperate to qualify for the competition because of the financial benefits and the way in which that can support them in their battle to remain within the guidelines of Financial Fair Play.",
      "Furthermore, participation in the Champions League will allow them to attract players of a better calibre. Ahead of the end of last season, as United closed in on a return to European football's top table, manager Erik ten Hag highlighted that as a key element within their recruitment plans.",
      "\"All the big players want to play in the Champions League,\" Ten Hag told Sky Sports in May last year. \"Manchester United is a big club. In the period I've been here, I've noticed everyone wants to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"Now it looks like we are in the Champions League, there is even more interest because they know we are in the Champions League and the Premier League at a high level. So, qualification will be important.",
      "\"In the Champions League you face the best teams across Europe, the best managers, in the best stadiums. For the players, they face the best players and [as a team] you are in a better league schedule, that is also important. It's very important for the rebuild of this club that we are in the Champions League.\"",

      "The two clubs continue to try and reach an agreement that will see Ashworth take control of the Ineos project at Old Trafford sooner rather than later, but Newcastle's demand for upwards of £15million has been laughed off publicly and privately in Manchester. While a stalemate ensues, Ashworth remains on gardening leave, catching up on Netflix perhaps, or more likely dreaming up the ideas that he believes will take this club back to the top.",
      "You can see why running the football operations at Manchester United would appeal. It doesn't quite feel right to describe United as a sleeping giant, but this is a behemoth of a football club that is significantly underperforming, based on reputation, history, investment and potential. The rewards for those who finally get it right will be golden.",
      "Ashworth will head up a much more detailed football structure that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford are putting in place, with the 53-year-old then reporting to new chief executive Omar Berrada, who will start in the summer when his period of gardening leave ends.",
      "Having held similar roles with West Brom, Brighton and Newcastle, as well as being the technical director at the Football Association, Ashworth's methods aren't entirely a mystery, even if some of his philosophies will have to change when he is in charge of a club of this size. One area he is always keen to focus on is a club's academy and at United it is a rich source of potential.",
      "Erik ten Hag has promoted Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho to the first team and others have got their chance this season thanks to an injury crisis. But United still carry a bloated squad and there could be an exodus this summer, with as many as a dozen senior players potentially departing.",
      "Don't expect all of them to be replaced. For starters, they don't need to be replaced, while Ashworth's view, as laid out in a fascinating interview with the Training Ground Guru in December 2020, when he was at Brighton, is that Premier League clubs should look to youth more and avoid the temptation of using the financial resources they have compared to other European leagues.",
      "\"Of all my roles, the one I’m most passionate about is opening up pathways for young players. Sometimes I've seen clubs work in silos and the academy is working all hours god sends to try and develop players for the first team and the recruitment department is working all hours god sends to try and sign players,\" Ashworth said.",
      "\"In that scenario the recruitment department might be busy looking at a right-back from overseas when there's one right under their noses in the Academy.",
      "\"From a Premier League point of view - and I have been guilty of this - because you have so much money in relation to the majority of the other leagues in the world you can compete for most players in the world. That applies to Brighton too, even though we’re not a top six club.",
      "\"When you are trying to put together a squad that can survive and thrive in the Premier League, the temptation is to go with proven players that are able to come in and are ‘here and now ready.'\"",
      "United's academy will be confident of being able to supply players who can fill gaps in the squad. Willy Kambwala has had first-team experience this season and might be able to fill the role of fourth or fifth-choice centre-back next season, for example.",
      "Finding gems from the academy is even more valuable in an era of strict financial controls. United are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules at the moment, so promoting from within after a sale might be an area they can benefit from this summer.",
      "Ashworth won't be directly in charge of recruitment, but he will overseeing football operations at the club, which essentially means everyone will be reporting into him. He can set the tone for a club that should be focusing on signing star players and then bolstering the squad with the pipeline of talent that Manchester United has always produced.",

      "Man United Women's boss Marc Skinner has yet to meet the Ineos chief but hopes his arrival could help propel the club to success",
      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner hopes the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be a \"springboard\" for the club's success but says he hasn't yet had the chance to meet the INEOS chief.",
      "Ratcliffe's purchase of a 27.7 per cent stake in United was officially completed last month and he has since outlined his ambitions to restore the Reds to their former glory. Speaking to the media last week, the 71-year-old did not go into any great detail about his plans for the women's team, but admitted, “if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.”",
      "It is a sentiment that was echoed by Skinner in his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, with the United boss fully aware the next few months will be hugely decisive in deciding his own future at the club. “We (he and Ratcliffe) have not managed to meet yet, I know it’s on the horizon very soon,” he said ahead of this weekend's trip to West Ham United.",
      "“But we have our constant kind of feed through our bosses anyway in terms of kind of how we want to go forwards, what’s going to work and there’s a lot to do. I see it as a real positive move. I think if you know me as a character, my energy is full in, I’m all in, so with my energy, coupled with the fantastic movement of the INEOS investment, I think it’s a real positive moment.",
      "“We have to capitalise on that, we’re going to try to do that, we’re going to put all our behaviours in place for that. It’s hopefully a springboard for everybody to find the success that everybody wants for Man United.”",
      "Ratcliffe first met Erik ten Hag nearly a year ago, while the pair were pictured together at Carrington in January following the completion of the Ineos chief's investment. Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos sporting director, is currently conducting an extensive audit of all levels at the club and has stepped away from his work with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team to concentrate on this task.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first orders of business as part-owner is to decide the best course of action for Old Trafford, with the fanbase currently divided on whether the iconic venue should be renovated or replaced with a brand new stadium. The INEOS boss suggested last week that, should the men's team relocate, Old Trafford could be used to house both the women's and academy teams, who currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village.",
      "But Skinner admitted such a move is unlikely to happen in the near future. “I’m sure that’s a little bit away,” he said. “We love playing at Leigh Sports Village, it’s become a fortress but obviously it’s a special occasion when you play at Old Trafford.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“We’re excited about any of the plans that come. It feels like a real positive movement. Whatever the plans may be, we have to continue to align our positive energy towards that movement. That’s our aim. If it comes down the line and that’s what happens, then I’m sure there will be some fantastic games at the stadium.”",
      "Skinner, who joined the Reds from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer and has been under scrutiny this term following a string of disappointing results. United, who finished second in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season and reached the FA Cup final, are currently in fourth place, seven points off a European spot.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a number of issues to resolve at Old Trafford for both the Men's and Women's sides, and Marc Skinner's team must not be left behind",
      "As the final whistle blew at an overcast Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, Erik ten Hag cut the figure of a man well-acquainted with the potential repercussions of Manchester United’s 10th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Head down, hands in pockets, the Dutchman headed for the tunnel, stopping briefly to offer a customary, consolatory round of applause for the supporters that remained inside the stadium. He wore an air of dejection that mirrored the despondency his counterpart, Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner, had exuded during his own commiseratory lap around the pitch at the Emirates Stadium just seven days prior.",
      "In north London, Skinner's side had been thoroughly beaten by title-chasing Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL), their hopes of European qualification this term left hanging precariously in the balance. \"I'm here to try and win for Manchester United and to continue to grow the team that's needed to win for Manchester United and I think that's really important,\" Skinner insisted after the game. It was a defiant, determined sentiment not too dissimilar to the one evoked by Ten Hag after Saturday's defeat to Fulham.",
      "\"When we get the injuries back we will be more in balance in the team,\" the Dutchman said. \"We also need to strengthen the squad in the transfer windows and then there are many good players, with high potential coming up. Definitely we are going in the right direction. So when everyone is available we have a very good team.\"",
      "In their respective post-match assessments, both Skinner and Ten Hag seemed to allude to a Manchester United of the future, to two projects still in their infancy and two teams that require patience and time to ensure their potential is fully realised. But, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now officially installed as the club’s part-owner, time does not appear to be the friend of either manager.",
      "Speaking to the media last week, Ratcliffe remained non-committal on Ten Hag’s future, telling reporters: “I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that.” It was not exactly a ringing endorsement of the Dutchman who, despite insisting he “doesn’t care” about the growing noise surrounding his United future, will be fully aware of the significance of the coming months and how they might shape the trajectory of his Old Trafford career.",
      "While Ten Hag was also keen to highlight he remains under contract at the club until 2025, Skinner does not have that same luxury. The 40-year-old, who joined United from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer.",
      "And though it is understood he is not in immediate danger of losing his job, it is clear the women’s team, too, is at a crossroads as Ratcliffe and co. seek to restore United to a footballing superpower. The INEOS chief did not go into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during his hour-long discussion with the press last week, but it is clear he harbours ambitions of the Reds one day earning a seat at Europe’s top table.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“The only thing I would say,” he told those in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, “is that if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.” It’s worth noting there has already been confirmation of one prominent departure on the Women’s side of operations, with head of Women’s football Polly Bancroft set to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town at the end of the current season.",
      "Bancroft was brought in from Brighton & Hove Albion, where she worked as general manager, in October 2022. In her newly-created role at United, Bancroft was tasked with implementing a cohesive strategy for the Women’s first team and academy, overseeing both day-to-day operations and long-term performance.",
      "But, though there have been some successes - chiefly her facilitating of a move to a new state-of-the-art training facility at Carrington - the past 16 months have not always been easy for Bancroft. She was, of course, charged with helping tie down first team stars Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new contracts last term.",
      "And, while she was by no means the only figure involved in the handling of those negotiations, the fact Russo and Batlle both left the club last summer - for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively - was viewed in some quarters as a damning indictment of her abilities. Certainly, United will be aware they run the risk of losing yet another of their big names on a free transfer this summer, with goalkeeper Mary Earps also out of contract in June.",
      "The England shot-stopper - who has been voted best goalkeeper in the world for two consecutive years - was the subject of a world-record bid from Arsenal last summer. As they did when the Gunners came calling for Russo in January 2023, United refused to sanction Earps’ exit, though there is every chance she joins her Lionesses teammate in north London in a few months' time, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona also being touted as other possible destinations for the 30-year-old.",
      "Then there are other behind-the-scenes matters to address, with United Women still in the market for a permanent head physio after the former incumbent Ibrahim Kerem moved over to Ten Hag’s side in November. There is also a growing sense the departure of Martin Ho, Skinner’s assistant, last summer has had a detrimental effect on the Women’s team's recent form.",
      "Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner on a two-year deal in July, guiding them to the group stages of the Women’s Champions League and thus making them the first Norwegian outfit in history to achieve that particular feat. And while there is an element of uncertainty about the futures of a number of key United personnel, recent discourse over the future of Old Trafford has also raised questions about the long-term home of the Women’s team.",
      "Skinner’s side currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village though, with Ratcliffe stating a preference to build a new industry-leading stadium for the men’s team, there seems to be scope for United Women to one day relocate to the club’s spiritual home. “If you use that as a centre of regeneration, a bit like the Olympic Village, then I think what you probably finish up doing is Old Trafford would finish up being reduced in size - in the same footprint but a smaller facility - which can be used for all sorts of community things, be it a concert or whatever,\" Ratcliffe said last week.",
      "\"The ladies teams could play there. The academy teams could play there. Some of the local teams could play there and Old Trafford could sort of become a community asset and then you'd have this world-class stadium next door to it.”",
      "With the 71-year-old's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in United having only been officially ratified by the Premier League and the FA earlier this month, it is clear that only time will bring clarity on several of the club’s myriad unresolved issues. However, with Skinner’s side having so far fallen short in their quest for domestic and European success this term, it is imperative the Women’s team is not left behind as United seek to emerge into Ratcliffe's brave new world.",

      "Man Utd have confirmed that Polly Bancroft will step down as the club's head of women's football at the end of the campaign.",
      "Manchester United have announced that Polly Bancroft - the club's head of women's football - will step down from her role at the end of the season.",
      "Bancroft, who has worked at Old Trafford since October 2022, will leave the club to become Grimsby Town's new chief executive. She has played a starring role in overseeing the development of United's women's team and helping them become a strong force in the women's game.",
      "Her highlights include United Women reaching their first-ever FA Cup final last season and achieving a second-place finish in the Women's Super League [WSL]. The club also clinched UEFA Women's Champions League qualification for the very first time during her tenure.",
      "As well as providing support to head coach Marc Skinner, she also played a key role in significant improvements in infrastructure for the women's team, featuring a new training facility at Carrington. The popularity of the women's game in England has been on a sharp rise since the Lionesses' European Championship success in the summer of 2022.",
      "United Women, as recently as last weekend, played in front of a record-breaking WSL crowd at the Emirates Stadium against Arsenal, with 60,160 people in attendance. United, however, were beaten 3-1 by the Gunners.",
      "Though Bancroft will continue in her role for the rest of this season, Grimsby, who are currently trying to avoid the threat of relegation to the National League in League Two, are delighted to have her on board ahead of the 2024/25 season. Chairman Jason Stockwood is delighted with the appointment, insisting the club is 'thrilled' to have secured her services.",
      "He told the Mariners' club website: \"We are absolutely thrilled for Polly to be joining us. There was a tremendous amount of interest in the role and to have someone of Polly's calibre and background join us is a real testament to how the club is regarded.",
      "\"We look forward to welcoming Polly and her family to the area and for her starting once the WSL season has concluded. We'd also like to thank Dave Slemen and the team at EPP who helped us conduct the search.\"",

      "Manchester United were beaten 3-1 by Arsenal in the Women's Super League at a sold-old Emirates Stadium in what could prove to be a huge blow to the Reds' Champions League hopes",
      "If last season's triumph at the Emirates was evidence of Manchester United's burgeoning Women's Super League (WSL) pedigree, then it was on the same stage that all of the Reds' deficiencies this term were brought into sharp focus.",
      "It was back in November 2022 that Alessia Russo's late strike helped Marc Skinner's side come from behind to claim all three points against the Gunners. But, on Saturday afternoon, the England forward was a second-half substitute for the hosts as they romped to a 3-1 victory in North London, putting United's hopes of European qualification this season of life support.",
      "In truth, the damage was done long before Russo entered the pitch, as a Geyse own goal and efforts from Cloe Lacasse and Kim Little had Arsenal in firm control of the contest before the break. \"We have to be the one to get under the skin and we have to be the team that doesn’t just try and win one way,\" Skinner asserted pre-match.",
      "But from the moment the Gunners got their noses in front at a sold-out Emirates, it was United who looked unnerved by their opponents' intensity. The Reds had started well enough, with Nikita Parris seizing upon a fumbled clearance from Sabrina D'Angelo and flashing an effort just wide of the post.",
      "READ MORE:I wanted to buy United but now I've got a $20bn offer to make to Ratcliffe",
      "But Skinner's side were made to pay for the spurned opportunity when Katie McCabe's low corner deflected off their no.23 and into the back of the net to give Arsenal the lead inside 10 minutes. The hosts nearly doubled their advantage when Beth Mead's curling shot deflected narrowly wide of Mary Earps' far post, and again when Stina Blackstenius was played through on goal by Cloe Lacasse but, on both occasions, the interventions of Millie Turner proved decisive.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, United came close to restoring parity when Ella Toone's strike ricocheted off the leg of Laia Codina and bobbled just off target. But it wasn't long before the Gunners were back on the front foot; Lacasse nodding home after Katie Zelem's miscued clearance arced straight into her path.",
      "The hosts' grip on the contest was further strengthened on the stroke of half-time, when captain Kim Little coolly dispatched the penalty after Beth Mead was upended by Gemma Evans inside the area. With Eidevall's side threatening to run away with it, Skinner unsurprisingly made an attacking change at the break, as Leah Galton was brought on in place of Gemma Evans.",
      "But it was Arsenal who looked the likeliest to find the back of the net; Blackstenius drawing a smart stop from Earps before Mead's strike cannoned off the post. The look of despondency on the face of Parris after she was, for what must have felt like the hundredth time on Saturday afternoon, called offside, spoke volumes about the meekness of United's showing in the capital.",
      "Lucia Garcia's instinctive finish in the final minute of stoppage time proved to be nothing more than a scant consolation prize for the visitors, who will know that only a flawless end to the season will be enough to keep their hopes of winning a Champions League spot alive.",
      "\"I don't think the word 'damaging' is the conversation,\" Skinner reflected post-match when queried on the potential repercussions of the result. \"We're still chasing. We're seven points behind Arsenal. We have to chase and that's what our team are resilient enough to do.\"",
      "On the criticism coming from some quarters of the United fanbase, Skinner added: \"It's part and parcel of the job. Some people love what you do, some people hate what you do. But we would never stop people from having an opinion. That's not what I'm here for.\"",
      "Though Skinner was keen to stress otherwise, Saturday's defeat is hugely detrimental to United's European ambitions. Of course, it is not just the manager who should be held accountable for the result: the Reds failed to perform to their full capacity and the players will know much more is required if they are to prevent this season from going out with a whimper.",
      "For the United boss, though, it is a defeat that raises further question marks around his own future ahead of the expiration of his contract this summer. Certainly, the voices crying for Skinner's removal will continue to grow louder in the days ahead and, at a time where the club as a whole is at the start of a brand new era, it feels like a period of change for the women's team, too, is inevitable.",

      "Gareth Southgate is preparing to lead England into the fourth major tournament of his tenure, having reached the quarter-finals, final and semi-final of the previous three; England boss has been linked to Manchester United job with Erik ten Hag's future uncertain",
      "By Melissa Reddy and Rob Dorsett",
      "Friday 22 March 2024 20:43, UK",
      "Gareth Southgate has been linked with replacing Erik ten Hag at Manchester United this summer - but would he be a good fit at Old Trafford?",
      "The England manager dismissed the rumours as \"disrespectful\" in a press conference on Friday, and said he \"wouldn't entertain speaking to anybody else\" before the Euros this summer.",
      "But with speculation increasing this week, Sky Sports News senior reporters Melissa Reddy and Rob Dorsett analyse Southgate's spell with England and whether he could succeed in club football.",
      "Sky Sports News senior reporter Melissa Reddy:",
      "When the initial whispers of Gareth Southgate being on a shortlist to become Manchester United manager circled at the start of March, several at the club shot down the links as \"easy to make\" due to Dan Ashworth's impending appointment as sporting director.",
      "The pair worked together through the FA, maintain a strong existing relationship, and shared aligned thoughts on the mechanics behind a successful football operation.",
      "The murmurs have now morphed into ear-splitting noise, with Sir Dave Brailsford, who has also collaborated with Southgate through the INEOS Leaders in Sport programme, reportedly endorsing the England manager.",
      "United have not commented on any of the rumours given Erik ten Hag is still in post, no definitive decision has been taken over his future, and there is still the FA Cup plus securing Champions League football to play for. The club are planning for next season with Ten Hag, including with potential recruitments and for summer tour plans.",
      "There is great annoyance that the high point of their season - the late, galvanising 4-3 victory over Liverpool at an enraptured Old Trafford - has been so quickly followed by such speculation.",
      "Some feel Ten Hag is being undercut and there is certain division in some quarters over the suitability of Southgate for the position.",
      "The greatest concern is how someone who hasn't been involved in the club game for 15 years - he was fired from Middlesbrough after overseeing their relegation from the Premier League in 2008-09 - can walk into its biggest job when he's not even in the conversation for any others.",
      "As one source put it: \"Would any other top club be looking at him this summer? Would Liverpool hire him? Bayern Munich? So why would Manchester United?\"",
      "The reaction to the links from a variety of supporters - fan media, forums, social discussion - has been negative. The local paper carried a piece saying \"Ten Hag's popularity has soared\" and that \"even those who prefer him to part ways with the club would rather he continue than Southgate be appointed.\"",
      "There is a framing, whether rightly or wrongly, of the England manager being too pragmatic, risk-averse and failing to truly maximise the depth of attacking talent at his disposal.",
      "Rewinding through World Cups and the Euros, a cautious approach has tended to be a triumphant one, but that wouldn't wash at United.",
      "There is also scepticism over Southgate given his poor record against the strongest international teams, which was reiterated in the defeat to France at the 2022 World Cup. England have won just seven of their 22 matches (32 per cent) against the current world top 10. How England react when they concede first, the manager's substitutions and a lack of ruthless edge have all been criticised.",
      "Appointing a manager that the fans are apprehensive of, and are not all in on from the start doesn't tend to be a wise choice.",
      "However, Brailsford and Ashworth reportedly believe that Southgate's transformation of the culture, quality, and buy-in around the national team is exactly what United need and that his work can be translated to a day-to-day environment.",
      "There's the benefit at England of fielding players already steeped in the reset having represented the youth teams, although Southgate did heavily contribute to the 'England DNA' directive, the fact that much of the squad come in from environments of excellence - Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal - and that a few camps a year is not the same as a blueprint to be implemented daily.",
      "Southgate's authenticity, empathy and honesty would register well as a representative of the club. He would have supporters in the dressing room from the England contingent. Counterpoints have been made over if he would attract elite foreign players in the market, and if those who don't wear the Three Lions shirt at United would be enthused or underwhelmed by his appointment.",
      "Southgate has received a nod of approval from Gary Neville, Ian Wright and Roy Keane.",
      "United haven't made their decision yet. They have to be conscious of financial parameters and compensation for the England manager would be shy of a lowly £1m.",
      "Southgate, whose contract expires in December, has not made any declaration over his future yet either. A choice will need to be communicated before the end of the season to help the FA, United and any other potential opportunity plan.",
      "While everything is still up in the air, one thing is certain: Southgate to United would not be a universally popular appointment.",
      "Sky Sports News senior reporter Rob Dorsett:",
      "From the very start, when he took over as manager of the national team in 2016, Southgate's mission was two-fold: to make the nation fall in love with the England team again and to make the players fall in love with the idea of representing their country.",
      "He felt that if he could achieve those two things, along with the obvious quality in the ranks of the playing staff, England would have a real chance of winning a major trophy for the first time since 1966.",
      "His entire ethos has been based around trying to make the England squad, and St George's Park, replicate what it's like for a player in their club environment. His philosophy has worked perfectly. Apart from the trophy bit.",
      "When Southgate took over, the England camp was too often split along club lines. There were, at times, cliques within the squad - those that got on and those that didn't. It wasn't uncommon for players to withdraw from the England squad with minor ailments or simply make an excuse not to be there.",
      "The FA staff have encouraged players to spend time together, at work, at play and at mealtimes. What is obvious now is just how well the vast majority of England players get on. That's why Ben White's request to be omitted from England call-ups going forward stands out as unusual.",
      "The evidence of Southgate's success in this area has been obvious when the summer internationals have come round - usually within days of the Champions League final. In 2019, Tottenham and Liverpool - with nine opposing players included in the England squad - went head to head in Madrid. England's Nations League semi-final against the Netherlands was just five days after the final.",
      "The same thing happened in 2021 when Chelsea and Manchester City met in the final in Istanbul. Seven England players featured in that final four days before England played their first Euros warm-up game against Austria.",
      "Southgate knew those would be incredibly difficult situations, with one set of players elated and the other devastated, with club rivalries exposed for all to see. But on both occasions, those players re-bonded immediately once they met up, united by a shared mission to succeed with England. That is no small achievement from the manager.",
      "A big part of Southgate's plan to make the players motivated to go away with England, rather than go to a beach in Dubai, has been a sense of fun. Enjoyment is at the heart of every camp, with the serious business of preparing for elite-level matches weaved in cleverly.",
      "Remember Harry Maguire and Jesse Lingard messing around on inflatable unicorns in the hotel pool during the World Cup, the day after England had beaten Tunisia. Take a glance at the FA social media pages while the players are in camp to see them playing basketball, competing in a silly quiz or taking on a challenge to roll a ping pong ball into various plastic cups, avoiding an outstretched tape measure.",
      "By and large, the England players enjoy their time away with their country. During Euro 2020, when Conor Coady didn't get a minute on the pitch as England made it to the final he described it as \"the best experience of my life\". He just loved being part of the collective. Even though it cost him four weeks of his summer holiday. Extraordinary.",
      "The FA photos and videos of the players arriving at the National Football Centre are always full of smiling faces, warm greetings, players and friends reunited. New additions to the squad are welcomed in, shown around and integrated quickly.",
      "Overall, it's clear Southgate and his staff have created an incredibly positive, welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere for the England players. They have revolutionised England camps, and the mood among the players, and they've seen a massive jump in success on the pitch as a result.",
      "The question is, could that be replicated at one of the big European clubs like Manchester United?",
      "The same fatherly care for the players - both in public and in private - would be a given if Southgate were the manager at Old Trafford, reminiscent of Sir Alex Ferguson's bond with his players.",
      "The same clever motivational techniques and determination to treat the players with respect would also be easily transferrable and roundly welcomed for sure.",
      "But would Southgate's other techniques work so well?",
      "Some England players have told me that being away with their country sometimes feels like a holiday, a break from the club routine. Would that work so well if those activities were the daily club routine?",
      "There are obvious question marks over Southgate's record as a club manager. When he spoke to Sky Sports in December, he was adamant that his time at Middlesbrough was a much bigger success than he was given credit for.",
      "Southgate has been repeatedly criticised by pundits for his tactical prowess or lack of it. Many will never forgive him for the lack of attacking substitutions during extra time at Wembley in the Euro 2021 final when it seemed Italy's ageing defenders were vulnerable.",
      "So, the jury is out. Southgate has done a quite brilliant job with England, but there are doubts whether he would be able to do the same at a club like Manchester United.",

      "Former Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique speaks exclusively to Sky Sports about how the game needs to change to stay relevant; Pique won nine league titles in Spain and England, four Champions League trophies, as well as a World Cup and European Championship",
      "Thursday 21 March 2024 07:54, UK",
      "\"It's always good to be back,\" announces Gerard Pique with fondness as he declines the offer of a pause between interviews. \"I love being in the UK as I spent four years growing up here. The weather is always grey but at least it's not raining.\"",
      "Osterley's overcast sky is a far cry from Barcelona. But for a man so decorated from an illustrious playing career, not even a deluge could dampen the spirits of someone fresh from an early flight who has won it all. That his medals totalling over 30 are boxed in an office back home betrays an individual in touch with the present.",
      "As welcoming a guest as he was gracious on the pitch, Pique is a world champion turned visionary hell-bent on creating a version of the game that is more in keeping with the demands of the modern world.",
      "There have been other, less successful, ventures but having hung up his boots following 18 years at the sharp end of the professional game, Pique is confident he has backed another winner.",
      "The Kings League is just over a year on from its launch in Spain, an offbeat seven-a-side game where team owners are content creators expanding to the Americas with Mexico hosting an inaugural World Cup in May.",
      "Where late goals count double in 40-minute matches, draws don't exist and audiences are larger than some LaLiga games, what drove one of the greatest defenders of all time to pursue what has been described as the Twenty20 of football?",
      "\"I felt there was a need to appeal to the next generation,\" Pique explains to Sky Sports. \"There's a lot of young people who are attracted more to entertainment that is short and exciting.",
      "\"It was important to find something where they couldn't lose focus. What is happening with traditional football is that 90 minutes is too long for the new generation.",
      "One manager who has been linked with heading to the Premier League is the Bayer Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso.\n\n\n\nPique played with Alonso at international level and says his step into management was an inevitability.\n\n\n\n\"For sure, I could see he had what it took to be a successful manager. He absolutely loves football. He understands how to play the game and it's very similar to Sergio Busquets.\n\n\n\n\"Busquets is still playing but he will be another incredible coach. Xabi has demonstrated at Bayer Leverkusen why he is so highly regarded.\n\n\n\n\"He is having the perfect season in not losing. Let's see next year what he's doing. Everyone says Liverpool will be an option after Klopp leaves, so let's see.\"",
      "\"That's not the case for the semi-finals, the final of the Champions League or the last games of the league but there are too many games and people get lost in all the competitions.",
      "\"We wanted to create a product that is similar to football as there are a lot of people who like football and they also like the Kings League.",
      "\"It's a different product with crazy rules but the key is that I see it as being complementary.\"",
      "Penetrating a Spanish-speaking audience is perhaps unsurprising given Pique's global reach. Three Champions Leagues and nine LaLigas with Barcelona, a World Cup and a European Championship with Spain is being put to good use.",
      "The Kings World Cup which runs from May 28 through to June 8 is expected to build on the capacity crowds witnessed at the Camp Nou and the Wanda Metropolitano last year.",
      "Ronaldinho, Andrea Pirlo, Andriy Shevchenko and Sergio Aguero have all brought extra kudos to this form of chaos, but Pique is keeping his cards close to his chest when pressed on future guest appearances.",
      "\"The presidents love to make big signings - legends of the game have played,\" the 37-year-old outlines with the promise of another stellar cast.",
      "\"For the World Cup, top players are being signed. Next Monday, there's a huge player we'll announce is playing in the competition.",
      "\"He's someone who has played in the Premier League and it's very recent that he retired so I think you'll love the name.\"",
      "The culture of player fandom has exploded since the advent of social media and clubs are acutely aware of how page views and following can swell exponentially if footballing talent is matched by off-field marketability.",
      "For a growing number of football aficionados, satisfying that appetite for a deeper connection with the game's biggest stars feels increasingly inaccessible. Pique feels that disconnect has to be addressed.",
      "\"Clubs nowadays are trying to protect players,\" he admits. \"There's good intention behind it as they don't want them to be exposed. So if you really want to get to know a player... what he likes, his dislikes, his personality, it's very difficult.",
      "\"There are young lads coming through at Barcelona but you don't know much about them because they're overly protected.",
      "\"In our world with the Kings League, what we want to do is the opposite. The players create their own channels on Twitch and YouTube. They talk a lot to their communities, and they want to be famous.",
      "\"This is the big difference from traditional football. In our ecosystem, every day there's a lot of content. On Twitch, you can see a coach talking to a player of another club or a president of another club discussing transfers.",
      "\"Football will forever by the king of the sport and the most followed but it's impossible that this could happen in the game we all know.\"",
      "While football's tradition and what Pique describes as a \"fractured\" ecosystem means altering any rule is met with robust opposition, the Kings League is built around the audience voting for changes themselves on a weekly basis.",
      "Recently, 200,000 streamers voted over a change to the colour of the artificial pitch. Green became black.",
      "\"If there is a rule that doesn't work, we change it the next weekend,\" adds Pique. \"The audience feel the Kings League is owned by them as we give them the power to vote on change.",
      "\"You want offside, or you don't? You want 40-minute or 30-minute games? Now, our grass is black. So, it's real football but in a way it's a video game. There's this mix and this balance that works very well.\"",
      "Some critics have labelled the concept a \"circus\" for TikTokers and YouTubers, and Pique would be inclined to agree.",
      "\"In a way, it's true. We are a mix of sport and entertainment. We want to put on a show. But it is very well balanced because they really care about winning.",
      "\"I see a lot of players and presidents crying when they don't reach the finals. But, at the same time you're having fun. The fact finals are being held at a big stadium tells you the interest is there.",
      "\"The players have never been in front of that many fans so for them not to qualify for the finals is very painful. You can see that they really care about winning and that's very important.\"",
      "While Barcelona find themselves eight points adrift of Real Madrid in LaLiga, their presence in the Champions League quarter-finals offers the promise of something greater.",
      "The same cannot currently be said of Erik ten Hag's United, and the man whose departure from Old Trafford in 2008 was described by Sir Alex Ferguson as one of his \"biggest regrets\" believes more trust needs to be instilled in the club's academy products.",
      "Reflecting on his two former clubs, Pique says: \"The difference with Barcelona is that this period of transition at Manchester United has been going on now for quite a long period of time.",
      "\"It's been quite a few years that they've not been able to win the title. I think that after Sir Alex left, they lost a little bit their focus and guidance.",
      "\"They didn't know where to go. Little by little, they are trying to put everything back together in order to compete for titles.",
      "\"I still believe Ten Hag is a very good coach. I don't really know if he will be able to turn things around but the win against Liverpool [in the FA Cup] was incredible.",
      "\"It's the sort of victory that will give them power for the rest of the season. Then, I would say they need to trust more in the people coming through from the academy.",
      "\"It happens when you are suffering as a club. It was the same at Barcelona, but you have to trust in the academy players. We saw Sir Alex Ferguson show this with the Class of '92 and they have to trust in the next generation in the same way.",
      "\"In the last few years, they've spent a lot of money, and it hasn't worked out. So why not try to give the new, young generation the chance to at least try and perform.\"",

      "Who is the Premier League's most improved team? And who has had the biggest drop off? We take a look at how each Premier League team compares to where they were at this stage last year...",
      "By Ella-Esrene Frederick",
      "Thursday 21 March 2024 18:19, UK",
      "With the Premier League reaching its final stretch of games,  we take a look at where each team were at this stage last season and how they compare to this year with 10 games remaining.",
      "Arsenal find themselves in the same spot as last season, top of the table after five consecutive wins. However, they are five points worse off with 64 points rather than the 69 they collected at this stage last season.",
      "Last season they had an eight-point cushion on Manchester City (who had a game in hand). This year the advantage on Liverpool is just goal difference, with City a point back.",
      "With more experience after a disappointing ending to last season's title race, the Gunners will be hoping they keep their place on top this time.",
      "Liverpool have made the biggest leap of any team from last season, now looking like the Jurgen Klopp teams of old that have gone head-to-head with Manchester City in title races past.",
      "At this stage last season, Liverpool only had 43 points and were facing an uphill battle in their chase for a top-four finish. This season they find themselves back on top with 64 points and only second on goal difference.",
      "Despite the drop-off last season, Liverpool did finish in good form, winning seven of their last 10 games and narrowly missing out on the top four. They will be hoping for similar form in their remaining 10 games in the quest to give Klopp a dream farewell.",
      "Treble hangover? City are only a point off the 64 they had at this stage last season - and much closer to the summit, being a point off top with league leaders Arsenal coming to the Etihad, live on Sky Sports, next.",
      "To City's advantage this is where they usually find their best form. They won an astonishing nine out of the last 10 in the 22/23 season, while also winning the Champions League and FA Cup. A formidable side who will be confident of landing a fourth Premier League title in a row.",
      "Unai Emery's first full season with Aston Villa could not be going much better. After ending last season in the European places, the progress continues with Villa pushing for a Champions League spot.",
      "They have progressed significantly in terms of points, with four more wins than at this point of last season with nine games remaining.",
      "There's a good feeling around Tottenham with Ange Postecoglou bringing excitement back to the club with his attacking style of play - but they are just four points better off than they were towards the troubled end of Antonio Conte's tenure.",
      "However, improving the points total and challenging for Champions League qualification despite selling star man Harry Kane will be a decent return for Postecoglou in his first season in charge.",
      "Are United going backwards? Erik ten Hag had a good first season at Manchester United, beating Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final and securing a top-four finish. With a slow start to this Premier League season, losing three of their first five Premier League matches, United find themselves six points adrift at this stage, 47 to last year's 53.",
      "With a top-five finish possibly securing a Champions league place, Manchester United remain in touching distance but will have to show their best form if they want to overtake Tottenham and Aston Villa.",
      "The Europa Conference League winners were battling relegation at this stage last season, with just 27 points to their name with nine games to go. But this year they have found a better balance between their Premier League and European commitments. The Europa League quarter-finalists sit in seventh place domestically with a much healthier points total.",
      "Brighton were one of the success stories of last season, displaying excellent football under newly appointed manager Roberto De Zerbi and securing a Europa League place in reward for their efforts.",
      "But after losing their midfield duo of Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool and Moises Caicedo to Chelsea, it was always going to be difficult to replicate. Brighton have struggled to find consistency in this campaign, but only sit four points worse off with 10 games to go.",
      "Gary O'Neil has led Wolves to a really good Premier League campaign so far in his first season at the club, earning impressive wins against the likes of Manchester City and Tottenham, despite having to offload some big names for financial reasons in the summer.",
      "After being dismissed by Bournemouth at the end of last season despite keeping the club from relegation, O'Neil has led Wolves to 41 points so far, sitting in ninth place. It's a huge improvement from the 27 points at this stage of last season when they were in the lower end of the table.",
      "The biggest fallers among the top sides, Newcastle's tally of 40 points is an alarming 13 fewer than they had with 10 to play last season. With European football to contend with this season and injuries to key players such as Nick Pope, captain Kieran Trippier, Callum Wilson and Joelinton, Newcastle have not been able to produce the standards of last season thus far. They sit in 10th and will be hoping for a big finish.",
      "After a turbulent first season under Chelsea's new ownership and multiple managerial changes, Mauricio Pochettino has only managed to edge the Blues up by one point so far this term, gaining 39 points to last season's 38 with 27 games played. With the money spent in the summer and Chelsea sitting in 11th place, Pochettino will be hoping to drive his side up the table with the remaining 11 fixtures - as well as delivering FA Cup success.",
      "Marco Silva's team have had a similar season in terms of points in comparison to last year. Despite losing their top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, they are only slightly down on last year when they had 39 points.",
      "Bournemouth have found improvement, led by a sharp-shooting Dominic Solanke who has 15 goals this campaign. The Cherries find themselves with 35 points and have a top-half place in sight - a big step up on their relegation battle last season.",
      "Crystal Palace have remained largely consistent with 29 points compared to last year's 27 - the managerial changes of Roy Hodgson replacing Patrick Vieira and Oliver Glasner replacing Hodgson steering them away from relegation in both seasons.",
      "Brentford were pushing for the European places this time last season. This season, the aim is to avoid relegation. It's the biggest drop in terms of points from any team, with the absence of the banned Ivan Toney not helping.",
      "Everton are one point worse off than they were at this stage last season - but that includes the six-point deduction they've been handed by the Premier League for financial issues. They remain in the relegation scrap, four points above the drop zone. They were just two points above the bottom three with 10 to play last season.",
      "A four-point deduction for financial issues from the Premier League has dropped Nottingham Forest into the relegation zone, where they are six points worse off than at the same point last year under Steve Cooper, who ultimately led them to safety.",
      "With 10 games to go, last season's relegated sides all had more points than Sheffield United (14 points), Burnley (17 from 29 games) and Luton (22 from 19 games) do right now.",
      "Southampton were on 23 points, with Leicester (25) and Leeds (26) marginally better off.",

      "Ratcliffe, whose INEOS company has taken control of football operations at Old Trafford, wants to move away from the approach of trying to buy success, as has been the case under the Glazers.",
      "United have spent more than £1bn on signings since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 but failed to challenge for the Premier League title, coming closest when finishing 12 points behind Man City in 2020/21 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Ratcliffe, though, made clear he will not rush plans to return United to the top as he shed light on INEOS' overhaul of the club's recruitment strategy.",
      "\"I'd rather find the next Mbappe than spend a fortune trying to buy success,\" Ratcliffe told The Geraint Thomas Cycling Club Podcast. \"It's not that clever, is it, buying Mbappe, in a way?",
      "\"Anyone could figure that one out. Much more challenging is to find the next Mbappe or Jude Bellingham or the next Roy Keane.\"",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford, the architect of Great Britain's success in cycling, is overseeing the creation of the new-look football operation at Old Trafford and has already brought in Omar Berrada from Man City to become the club's chief executive.",

      "Ratcliffe says getting the right structure in place is the key to solving United's issues in the transfer market.",
      "Asked if he would like to sign Bellingham, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not where our focus is, the solution isn't spending a lot of money on a couple of great players. They've done that over the last 10 years.",
      "\"The first thing we need to do is get the right people in the right boxes who are managing and organising the club and make sure we get recruitment right. It's such a vital part of running a football club today, finding new players.\"",

      "\"You need the right organisation structure. In the days of Sir Alex Ferguson, he was the manager. We don't have managers today, we have a coach. And the coach would report to a sporting director and they would report to the chief executive.",
      "\"You need to figure out where you put recruitment and strategy, you need to get your organisation right and then populate it with people who are best in class.\"",
      "He added: \"It's not a light switch at Man Utd, it's a much longer road to travel, because there's so many aspects of that club and that game that you need to get right.\"",
      "Brailsford is at the heart of this process, but Ratcliffe insists his role will not stretch to identifying potential signings.",
      "\"Dave wouldn't profess to ever say, 'we need to buy that player because I think he's a very good player', Dave would never do that, it's not his skill set. But we need that skill set at Manchester United,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "Asked how hands-on he will be, Ratcliffe added: \"We all talk on a daily basis, there's a group of us involved in Manchester United but the two people most focused on it would be Dave and myself.",
      "\"We've now got Omar Berrada, of course, who's on gardening leave at the moment but he's become a big part of a trio when he settles in. He's come from Man City and will be the chief executive.\""

      "Kobbie Mainoo and ‘the arrogance of timing’ – former Man Utd coach explains why midfielder now called up by England appears to have so much time on the ball.",
      "Tuesday 19 March 2024 14:47, UK",
      "Speaking to Erik ten Hag about Kobbie Mainoo earlier this season, his verdict was as follows: “He looks very composed,” he told Sky Sports. “He is very mature for his age. What he brings to the team is his composure and his game understanding.”",
      "Composure. Ten Hag reached for variations on that word twice in just three sentences. Watching Mainoo, 18, it makes sense. He appears to have time when others do not, finds space where others do not. But why is that? What is it that he is doing differently?",
      "Every player at the top level of the game should be able to control the ball and pass it in a straight line. Much of Mainoo's work looks that simple. And yet, doing that in the heat of the midfield battle, when the opposition are pressing him, should not be this easy.",
      "Paul McGuinness, the former Manchester United academy coach, has an explanation. \"It is how he prepares before he receives the ball,\" he tells Sky Sports. \"What he does off the ball makes it seem like he has time on it. To receive it, he has to look before it comes.",
      "\"Amateur players look up after they have received the ball and then decide what they are going to do. The top professionals, and that is a good phrase for Kobbie, they are efficient and everything they do has a flow to it. All the connections are flowing.",
      "\"There is a lot to it. He has to have the picture beforehand. He has to show for the ball quickly and that means making two or three quick steps. That is what gives him more time. If he just waits for the passes to come to him, he will not have that time.",
      "\"As the ball is coming, he has to be looking again, to be on the half turn to know whether he will be able to turn or not.",
      "\"Because he knows what he wants to do before he gets it, what he does is that he makes sure that the first touch gets the ball into the right place to set up the next pass. It looks like he has time because he does not need two or three touches, he has set it up with one.",
      "\"That saves those milliseconds when people are pressing him.",
      "\"He has prepared the space, lost his marker, already had a look when the ball is coming so that he can take it away from the man. Now, it looks like he has time on the ball. But it is all those little things that have to come together. He is a really clever player.\"",
      "But there is another key difference between Mainoo and many other Premier League players. \"He keeps the ball really close,\" says McGuinness. \"That is deceptive. If you keep the ball close to you then it means that you can play the ball at any time.\"",
      "It goes against some of the received wisdom. \"People say that you should get the ball out from under your feet but if the ball is two or three yards away from your feet then the opponent knows that they can press you because you cannot pass it.\"",
      "Former United academy chief Jim Ryan had a phrase for this. \"He used to call it the arrogance of timing,\" adds McGuinness. \"Kobbie has that. He can wait until that last moment and use the press against them.\" His first senior goal highlighted that.",
      "Mainoo's timing when scoring the 97th-minute winner at Wolves was exquisite in more ways than one. As Max Kilman went to close him down, he nutmegged him. \"When he stuck the ball between the lad's legs, that was a perfect example,\" says McGuinness.",
      "\"It looks like he is going to pass it again but he can just turn his foot at the last second and play the ball through the legs.",
      "\"There is that little bit of disguise to it. You are making an illusion that you are going to play the ball forward. To do that, you have to have poise, confidence in your own ability, and the disguise has to look perfect. You are like a magician doing an illusion.\"",
      "As well as his tidy use of the ball, Mainoo is a dribbler. Indeed, he completed six dribbles in the recent win over Luton - the most by a Manchester United player this season or last. That is unusual for a central midfielder but it is a product of his close control.",
      "\"Being able to keep the ball close, it gives you more options. You can play it around the corner and go against the flow, beating them with a change of speed. He does not look an outstandingly quick player, so he is doing it with real efficiency, to change the direction.\"",
      "More often than not, Mainoo does keep it simple. That works in his favour too. \"Because he is doing that a lot of the time, he is difficult to read. It looks like a pass to the wide man but at the last second he can play the ball behind the full-back,\" says McGuinness.",
      "\"Ninety per cent of the time, he plays the simple pass, keeps it moving, does the right thing. But because he is doing that, he has then got that element of surprise to his game every now and again when he does try to do something out of the ordinary.\"",
      "When Ten Hag talks of composure and maturity, he is also talking about decision-making. Mainoo looks mature because he does the right things. It was noted how he responded to being caught in possession for a West Ham goal earlier in the season.",
      "\"He has the personality,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"That is what you need if you want to play here.\"",
      "When the game at Luton became frantic, Mainoo was the one who maintained his calm even as more senior players appeared caught up in the frenzied atmosphere. Sometimes the bravest thing in football is not to run around but to put a foot on the ball.",
      "\"The ball carrier is in charge of the game,\" says McGuinness.",
      "\"He looks like that. It is as if he is saying, I am in charge, I will decide.\"",
      "The football style of the future, perhaps? \"It has become a bigger feature because of what the defenders are doing at Brighton. They are baiting them, drawing them on like a matador and then using the space that they have left behind them.\"",
      "Whether Manchester United are going to be at the vanguard, among the better exponents of the possession game, remains to be seen. It looks a long way off right now despite the best efforts of Mainoo. Those patterns are not quite there in their game.",
      "For McGuinness, it brings to mind a comment from Danny Welbeck when the former Manchester United forward was on England duty.",
      "\"I remember him saying when he was in the squad with Marcus Rashford that even though he had not really played with him, they could connect easily because they were looking for the same things. That is why you need stability in a club.",
      "\"Clubs try to buy success but if you do not have a core of players who are on the same wavelength, you are not going to have success. That is why having homegrown players can be really useful because they have grown up together. The timing is right.",
      "\"That was a big feature with the Class of '92. In the last few years, Manchester United have not only been changing players and coaches but changing styles. That makes it really difficult. A player like Kobbie can keep that connection to the United style.\"",
      "The hope is that Kobbie Mainoo will define it over the next decade.",

      "\"Incidents of tragedy chanting will not be tolerated and will be dealt with robustly.

      "Erik Ten Hag praises mentality and attitude of Man Utd players after late goals in normal time and extra time help them edge FA Cup quarter-final and book Wembley semi vs Coventry; Jurgen Klopp loses cool with TV reporter after \"very hard\" game for his Liverpool side amid \"intense season\"",
      "Monday 18 March 2024 15:36, UK",
      "Jurgen Klopp was ruffled by a reporter's \"dumb question\" after Liverpool lost an FA Cup epic to Manchester United, while counterpart Erik ten Hag declared that his side \"can beat anyone\" after their 4-3 win at Old Trafford.",
      "United knocked out their great rivals with the help of late goals in normal time and extra time to grab victory in a thrilling contest, setting up a semi-final with Coventry at Wembley.",
      "Klopp had been philosophical about coming out on the wrong end of an at-times wild contest when he took questions after the game.",
      "\"We were nearly there in normal time and nearly there in extra-time and then we lose the game, that's alright,\" he said. \"I cannot ask for much more.",
      "\"We have had a much more intense season so far, everybody knows that, you just have to count the games. Today was hard, very hard. The longer the game goes, the decision-making doesn't get any better.",
      "\"Congratulations to United, going to the semi-final. We have a game less, or have two games less, and we [will] try to use that in the next few weeks.\"",
      "But while Klopp was measured in his response to much of the media after his side's defeat, he had little time for a reporter from a Scandinavian TV network who questioned why Liverpool appeared to lose intensity in extra time.",
      "Below is a transcript of what was said between Klopp and Niels Christian Frederiksen. As a note, Liverpool have played 18 matches in 2024 to Man Utd's 12.",
      "Reporter: \"Normally intensity is the name of your game, so how come it became so difficult in extra time?\"",
      "Klopp: \"Bit of a dumb question, I have to say. We played I don't know how many games recently, I don't know how many games United exactly played. That's sport.",
      "\"Really disappointed about that question, but you thought obviously it's good.\"",
      "Reporter: \"So too many games?\"",
      "Klopp: \"Oh, ah come on, you are obviously not in a great shape, and I have no nerves for you. What is wrong with you?\"",
      "Frederiksen has since given his reaction to the feisty exchange, insisting he understands Klopp's frustrations.",
      "\"I interpret it mostly as an expression of his terrible frustration that they lost to Manchester United in the manner it happened, where they were ahead twice and should have sealed the deal,\" Frederiksen told Danish sports magazine Tipsbladet.",
      "\"His dream scenario was to play an FA Cup final at Wembley in his last match in England, and that's been taken from him now. So I can understand he's super frustrated.",
      "\"Then he got a question he didn't think was appropriate. It's been a theme for them that they've had many injuries and many matches, which he has complained about. Then he got a question about why they didn't have intensity in the game, and then he snapped.",
      "\"That's fair enough. I have absolutely no problem with that. There will be absolutely no problems in the future. I can't imagine that at all.",
      "\"When I interview him again, we'll still be good friends - professionally speaking. I don't think he holds a grudge, and I certainly don't.\"",
      "Ten Hag refused to be drawn on whether it was his best win - \"I have had some more very good wins, I can tell you\" - but insisted the victory showed the capability of his team to overcome any challenge.",
      "\"This could be that moment where we get the belief, the energy that we can do amazing things,\" said Ten Hag. \"I think that if we can beat Liverpool the way we did, we can beat anyone.\"",
      "For the Dutchman, this display was a vindication of his repeated comments this season about the path his team are on.",
      "\"I've said for many weeks we have a team for the future that's very good,\" he told ITV. \"You can see the potential.\"",
      "Until the final minutes of the first half, when Liverpool, invited on, scored two in quick succession, United had been outstanding and played on the front foot. In extra-time, Ten Hag threw caution to the wind, taking off defenders for attackers and finishing with a backline of Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes and Antony.",
      "This was a win which owed plenty to his coaching and in-game decision-making, as well as the individual moments of quality from his players.",
      "He couldn't hide his satisfaction at how it had all paid off.",
      "\"The first 35 minutes I think was the best minutes from our season,\" Ten Hag told ITV.",
      "\"We were really there, acting as a team. But then gaps in between the lines and you can't allow this against Liverpool. Then they outplay you. And also after half-time, it continues.",
      "\"We had to change. We went into the risk, we went into one against one, and the players were wonderful - the mentality, the attitude was so great.",
      "\"They had strong belief to win this game. We went for it and we got it.\"",
