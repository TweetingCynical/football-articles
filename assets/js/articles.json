      "Ollie Watkins has made it clear he will never be one of those players who his \"happy to sit on the bench\" after Aston Villa rejected an advance from Manchester United to land the striker.",
      "The Red Devils are on the lookout for a No 9 and have shortlisted three players with the England international among them. Villa signed Watkins several years ago after he impressed in the Championship and he's since proven himself in the Premier League.",
      "Villa, who lost Jhon Duran back in January, have made it known that they have no interest in selling their forward despite interest from those on the red half of Manchester. Watkins will hope to return to the club's first choice striker after a difficult few months to end the season.",
      "Ironically it was the loan arrival of Marcus Rashford from United that saw Watkins' playing time suffer as a result. Rashford has since left and joined Barcelona on loan, but it means Watkins will face less competition as things stand.",
      "Last term Villa enjoyed a run to the last eight of the Champions League, beating Club Brugge, before running PSG close in the quarter-finals. For that tie Unai Emery opted for Rashford over Watkins - which was not well received.",
      "The ex-Brentford striker made it clear that was not a role he wanted. Watkins said last season: \"He's the manager at the end of the day and you've got to respect his decision, but I'm not one of those players that's happy to sit on the bench. I was fuming I wasn't playing and I let him know that.\"",
      "Emery also had Marco Asensio as a loanee for the second part of the season, but he and Rashford have since left. Villa are yet to make any major attacking additions this summer and the Spanish manager has rejected the prospect of Watkins leaving with Arsenal keen on him back in January.",
      "Emery said: \"I don't want (to sell Watkins). It is good news to have offers from other clubs. We want to keep our sporting objective through the players we have in the squad.\" He also maintained: \"Watkins is our striker.\"",
      "United are also thought to have considered moves for PSG's Randal Kolo Muani and Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic. Ruben Amorim though has claimed that he would be happy to go on with his squad as it stands, claiming: \"If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha says he does not feel the pressure of hauling fallen giants Manchester United back to the top after last season's disastrous campaign. United signed Cunha for £62.5million and followed that up with the £71m capture of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford to strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Cunha scored 12 Premier League goals last season and there will be a huge onus on him to solve United's goalscoring crisis, but the 26-year-old played down the pressure.",
      "“I really think the pressure at this club is not really pressure it's a privilege, because this is one of the biggest clubs in the world,” said Brazil star Cunha.",
      "“When Ruben comes to me and shows all the pressure that I have to help put the club back in the perfect times again, I feel like it's a challenge that I want to do for me and my career.",
      "“United is always one of the clubs that needs to be there and to be someone who can be a part of the process is something that, like I say, is a big privilege.",
      "“So I don't think about being perfect at the start, honestly. I think to be myself and to help the team. I have started to feel that I'm part of the group, we start to do everything very well and then start thinking about doing everything well.",
      "“So I'm very comfortable to be here, I'm very comfortable with the pressure right now, and I hope everything can be better too - don't think about the bad times.”",
      "Asked why he chose United, when he could have joined a club that could offer him Champions League football next season, Cunha said: “United was always my dream club and when you can make a dream come true, it's an easy decision to make.",
      "“But of course he [Amorim] was one of the big parts, he talked to me always, and then showed how important I am for him, and of course I felt very well about that.”",
      "Earlier this week, Bryan Mbeumo said he's overjoyed to have the chance to follow in Cristiano Ronaldo's footsteps at the “biggest club in the world”. After seven weeks and some tense talks between the clubs, the 25-year-old finally completed his move from Brentford on Monday for £65million plus a potential £6million in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo has signed a deal until 2030, with the option of a further season, at what he calls the “club of my dreams” – one whose shirt he wore as a kid growing up in France. “From the start I wanted to join this club, this massive club, and now I’m here and I’m just really happy,” the Cameroon international told club media.",
      "“For me, it’s the biggest club in the world, in England as well. I think the fans are crazy, the stadium is amazing, and I think every player wants to play here. I think my first top was a Manchester United top with Ronaldo behind. It’s just such a big club and, yeah, I’m really happy to be here.”",
      "Mbeumo says he idolised Ronaldo and Lionel Messi growing up, as well as admiring Neymar and Eden Hazard, and joins Cunha in bolstering what has been a blunt United attack. The forward says the Brazil international will “bring something new” to a team that he is excited to get to know better when they head to the United States for their pre-season tour on Tuesday.",
      "“I think it’s really important for me joining a new club,” Mbeumo said. “It’s important to create links as soon as possible, automatism as well with the team-mates, so in and out the pitch.",
      "“The spirit is really important. Yeah, create a group, being involved as soon as possible, for me, it’s something really important.”",

      "Amorim has been unable to land the striker it was reported he wants whilst he is yet to sign any specialist wing-backs, which will aid his system. The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss though has been given the opportunity to work consistently on the training ground, which he wasn't afforded throughout last season.",
      "But in an effort to close the gap on the country's leading sides United have been expected to sign more than two new player, yet Amorim maintains he is happy with what he's got.",
      "He said during the club's pre-season tour: \"In the moment we need to be careful when we sign a player. If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",
      "The club recently wrapped up a deal for Mbeumo after negotiating with Brentford for weeks, before their third bid was finally accepted. Earlier in the summer they were able to land Cunha, owing to a release clause in his Wolves contract.",
      "United have fallen foul in the past of signing players who have not produced. Amorim is clearly keen to avoid a repeat but believes the group he currently has have developed an understanding. He claimed: \"You feel the bond between the players in the best teams. We remind ourself how special it is to be at the best club in the world. I really like to be in a group that is healthy. We are going to suffer but that feeling of bonding is really important. The spirit is positive.\"",

      "Wrexham's chief executive previously worked at Inter Milan in several senior roles between 2014 and 2018. While Williamson had already left by the time Eriksen arrived in 2020, the American is understood to be making the most of his Italian contacts to aid the Red Dragons' recruitment.",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",
      "But does it have a dedicated, quality source of information piped through to your inbox each week, free of ads but packed with informed opinion, analysis and even a little bit of fun each week? That's where Wrexham is the Game steps in...",
      "Available every Wednesday, it provides all the insights you need to be a top red. And for a limited time, a subscription to 'Wrexham is the Game' will cost fans just £15 for the first year.",
      "Sign up for Wrexham is the Game here",
      "Eriksen is not the first big name star to be linked with Wrexham this summer, with Leicester legend Jamie Vardy and Fulham skipper Tom Cairney also said to have been targeted by the club. Eriksen has made 144 appearances for his country during his career, scoring 46 goals in the process.",
      "He was signed by United in 2022 after shining for Brentford in the Premier League. The Bees brought Eriksen in following his recovery from a cardiac arrest, which he suffered on the pitch at the Euro 2020 tournament.",
      "Eriksen made 107 appearances and scored eight goals during his three seasons at United, including a penalty against Aston Villa in his final outing in May. While Wrexham were unsuccessful in their bid to lure him to the Racecourse Ground, their transfer activity is expected to continue in the coming weeks as they prepare for life in the Championship, with Wales and Sheffield United striker Kieffer Moore claimed to be their latest target.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",

      "Alexander Isak's potential departure from Newcastle United could jeopardise Manchester United's pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. Despite securing the services of Matheus Cunha in early June and recently finalising the signing of Bryan Mbeumo, United are still on the hunt for attacking reinforcements.",
      "After Viktor Gyokeres rejected a reunion with Ruben Amorim to join Arsenal, the Red Devils' focus has reportedly shifted to Sesko. With the north Londoners close to sealing a deal for Gyokeres, United seemed to have had a clear path to the towering Slovenian forward.",
      "However, if Newcastle offload Isak, who has been linked with Liverpool and Saudi Arabian outfit Al Hilal after informing Eddie Howe's side that he would like to explore an exit from St James' Park, the Magpies will be expected to move for Sesko. This could spell trouble for United, who have already missed out on many striking targets this summer.",
      "According to The Athletic, Newcastle are considering a move for Sesko, who boasts a record of 27 goals and seven assists in 64 Bundesliga outings for Leipzig. The Daily Mail have also claimed that Newcastle have approached Leipzig about the possibility of signing Sesko, who could command a fee in the region of £60m to £70m.",
      "With Isak seemingly looking for an exit, Newcastle might decide to capitalise on what could potentially be a Premier League record transfer fee for a player. If this happens, they will likely speed up their chase for another prolific goal-scorer and Sesko seems to fit the bill.",
      "Given that the Magpies are competing in the Champions League this season, United may struggle to lure Sesko to Old Trafford. Furthermore, having already splashed out around £132.5m on Mbeumo and Cunha, United will probably need to offload players before they can make a serious offer, while Newcastle could have ample funds to spend if Isak's departure is accelerated.",
      "After netting only 44 goals in the Premier League last season, United are still in dire need of a lethal striker. Cunha and Mbeumo are both sharp finishers, with 35 goals and 14 assists between them for their respective clubs last year.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, neither are traditional centre forwards, which United have been searching for this summer. The Red Devils have already missed out on Delap, Gyokeres and, most recently, Hugo Ekitike, who secured a £79m move to Liverpool this week.",
      "United reportedly held discussions with the representatives of Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson, who is now thought to carry an £80m price tag. It's now understood a bid for the Senegal international from the Red Devils is unexpected.",
      "French outlet Foot Mercato also reported that Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani, who spent last season on loan at Juventus, is another potential target for United. However, Sesko could be the preferred choice for United.",
      "German media suggests he carries a price tag of around £60m - £12m less than what United shelled out to Atalanta for Rasmus Hojlund in 2023 - making the 22-year-old an attractive prospect.",
      "United still have Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee in their squad, but neither have proven they can lead the attack. The loan move of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona has freed up space and about £12m in wages, but United will still need to generate funds first before they can entertain bidding for another forward.",
      "Resolving the futures of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, who the club are openly willing to sale, will likely be top of Amorim's agenda, especially now Newcastle are putting pressure on them in the race for Sesko.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United have signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer for a combined total of £133.5million and know they need to sell players in order to balance the books. Marcus Rashford has been sent on loan to Barcelona, who are covering his wages, but Antony remains on the books along with Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Amorim has jetted off to Chicago to start United’s pre-season tour without the exiled foursome, who have been told to look for new clubs. Antony spent the second half of last season on loan at Real Betis and had hoped to move to Seville permanently.",
      "The Brazilian winger got nine goals and five assists in 26 games for Betis last season, reviving his career and earning many new fans in the process. Betis are keen to re-sign him for the 2025/26 season, but want another loan, rather than a permanent deal.",
      "United have different ideas and are seeking a club who will sign Antony, who cost £85m from Ajax in 2022. They have received some interest from Atletico Madrid, but the Spanish side have not followed up on it yet.",
      "It is understood that Antony would prefer to stay in Europe’s top leagues, rather than move to the Middle East. Erik ten Hag – the man who oversaw his best form at Ajax and authorised his big-money move to United – is now in charge of Leverkusen, but he has distanced himself from a transfer.",
      "“He has great quality,” he told BILD recently. “I signed him twice. He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.”",
      "Antony has returned just 12 goals and five assists in 96 games for United and is a major drain on resources. He earns £200,000-a-week at Old Trafford, where he is under contract until June 2027.",
      "After a miserable time at United, he loved his stint at Betis, who he helped reached the Conference League final. “Yes, I'm very happy. I found myself,” he said at the time. “I needed to find myself and be happy. My family needed to be happy too. Every day that passes confirms it was the best decision and as you said, I'm enjoying the city and the club every day.”",

      "Manchester United icon Rio Ferdinand has advised the club to avoid RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko in their quest for a new striker. The Red Devils have already secured the services of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer to bolster their attack.",
      "Last season, Ruben Amorim's team lacked a reliable goalscorer, with Amad and Bruno Fernandes leading the scoring charts with a mere eight league goals each. United have been linked with a move for Sesko as the club attempt to improve their striking options.",
      "The 22-year-old, who has also been on Arsenal's radar, scored 21 goals across all competitions last term. Yet, Ferdinand has warned United that they need a more experienced forward than Sesko.",
      "\"I think you've got to look at the here and now at the moment with Man United. That's what I said about a number nine,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel. \"I'm not really doubting [Sesko] as a player. I'm saying Man United need experience at the top of the pitch.",
      "\"They've got Hojlund, they've got Zirkzee, they've got Chido. Young, inexperienced players. They need someone to look at and go, 'That's how you play as a number nine.' That's how you do it. When you're going to buy somebody who hasn't got as much experience as I'd like, I think that's another risk. Is it worth taking with inexperienced players at this level?\".",
      "Ferdinand has hinted that Ollie Watkins, who is on United's radar, could be the perfect fit due to the Aston Villa striker's Premier League pedigree. While Ferdinand has emphasised the need for a new striker, the former defender confessed he'd be willing for United to overlook a forward in favour of splashing out on Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "\"If I don't get a striker, I'd go midfield. There's only one name I'm thinking about, I've got to be honest, who I think fits the bill for what we need,\" Ferdinand explained. \"An Amorim-type player as well. Physically great, can drive with the ball, can take it in all areas, very good tactically, great energy, great legs, Premier League experience, centre midfield. Baleba.",
      "\"That's who I go and get. That's my man. That's the one I go and get. I go and break the bank. So if I got the money for the four players that are surplus to requirements now, would I get a number nine or would I get Baleba?",
      "\"Would I get a number nine I'm not sure about, who's a bit young, inexperienced, or would I get Baleba with Premier League experience and know what he can do here? I'm going Baleba, sorry.",
      "\"I'm going to go with Baleba. I think he'll have a huge impact on this squad, on this team. You free up a few people in that midfield area as well to have a little less responsibility defensively because I think he's all-action. He can do it all.\"",
      "Baleba was signed by Brighton from Lille for approximately £26million (€30m) in 2023. The young midfielder, aged 21, made 34 appearances in the league for the Seagulls last season.",
      "Meanwhile, United's current striking options, consisting of Rasmus Hojlund, Josha Zikzee and highly-rated prospect Chido Obi, managed to score a total of seven league goals last season. United are hoping to boost their transfer budget through the potential sales of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia, who have all been omitted from the club's US pre-season tour.",

      "Shaw, 30, appears ready to accept that his Red Devils career is coming to an end. The Southampton academy product is reported to be aware of 'serious' interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "The England international still has two years remaining on his contract and is in the United squad that travelled to the United States for their pre-season tour. Shaw will be in contention to face West Ham on Sunday and played against Leeds as Ruben Amorim's side returned to action for pre-season.",
      "Shaw will have to battle for his place in the team come the start of the season. While the full-back started in the Europa League final against Tottenham last term, he is set to face competition from the likes of Diogo Dalot, January arrival Patrick Dorgu and summer signing Diego Leon.",
      "Dorgu is perhaps favourite to be Amorim's first option at wingback for the new season. There are high hopes for £3.3million man Leon who joined from Cerro Porteno of Paraguay too.",
      "The 18-year-old played in the opening half of the draw with Leeds and was praised by head coach Amorim. “He did really well,\" said the Portuguese boss.",
      "\"He’s learning things, he’s powerful, he’s going to be a very good player.”",
      "Amorim is said to be in no rush to lose Shaw from his squad, despite the injury-plagued star carrying £150,000-a-week wages. But the versatile defender is keen to secure playing time having missed out on a number of opportunities due to his injury record.",
      "If Shaw decides to leave in the coming months, it appears unlikely that United would stand in his way. The defender has only made 27 appearances across the last two seasons.",
      "The 13-times Premier League champions will hope to earn fees from the exits of the likes of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia. United have already facilitated a move for Marcus Rashford but only on loan, despite wanting to bolster their transfer funds.",

Last summer, it was rumoured that United were contemplating a £50million swoop for Ferguson, with Chelsea also reportedly showing interest.",
      "However, a move to Old Trafford never materialised and Ferguson's career hit a rough patch last season due to a lack of goals and persistent injuries. The 20-year-old spent the second half of the campaign at West Ham on loan after finding opportunities hard to come by at Brighton, but only managed to start one game for the Hammers.",

United are on the hunt for a new striker this summer but abandoned their pursuit of him at the turn of the year, which may well come back to bite them if his debut performance is anything to by.",

      "Erik ten Hag's former Manchester United assistant Mitchell van der Gaag has admitted his main \"disappointment\" from his time at Old Trafford was the team's poor display in the Europa League.",
      "United endured mixed fortunes under Ten Hag as they won the Carabao Cup in his first season, finishing third in the process, and the FA Cup in his second campaign.",
      "But the 2024-25 season proved to be the end for Ten Hag as he was axed in October after leading United to their worst start in the club's history, with Ruben Amorim replacing him.",
      "Van der Gaag said he had positive memories from his time with United despite his turbulent spell working under Ten Hag, saying the team proved they could be a force in cup competitions.",
      "But he said he regretted their lack of impact in the Europa League after only reaching the quarter-finals in 2022-23, losing to eventual winners Sevilla 5-2 on aggregate.",
      "Speaking to Give Me Sport, he said: \"I look back on my time at Manchester United positively. I think it was two wonderful years. They were very positive and I learned a lot.",
      "\"The first year was very positive because we finished in third place, won the Carabao Cup and went to the FA Cup final. I think the only disappointment, in my opinion, was that we could have been better in the Europa League. But I think the first year was very positive, so everyone expected that we could improve in the second season.\"",
      "He reflected on a \"strange\" second campaign that saw the team suffer a terrible run of form that saw Ten Hag come close to the sack before winning the FA Cup, which bought him more time despite finishing eighth. Van der Gaag said he \"learnt a lot\" and enjoyed coaching with United even though it ended on a sour note.",
      "\"That was a very strange season [2023-24],\" he added. \"We were not good enough in the Premier League or Champions League. There were very strange results as well because there were games we were winning comfortably and then drawing or losing.",
      "\"But, in the end, we won the FA Cup. It puts everything in a positive way, so that was important. They were two years when I learned a lot, especially about the way the Premier League functions, the way football is played and the tactical variations. It was something that I really enjoyed.\"",
      "Ten Hag has since become the new manager of Bayer Leverkusen, but Van der Gaag decided not to join his backroom staff. Instead, he has taken up management himself by becoming the new manager of FC Zurich.",
      "It's set to be a tough start for Ten Hag's new team after selling two of their best players in Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool in a record £116.5m deal, while right-back Jeremie Frimpong also moved to Anfield.",

      "He said: \"It's been couched around Wrexham as Phil's d******* test. Is he going to fit in, or is he going to upset the dressing room culture? The dressing room culture plays such a big part in the success of any team so background checks will be done. Some will be good, some will be bad.\"",

      "It has been 12 days since the two clubs struck an agreement over the top line transfer figure, but talks have continued over the structure of the deal. Finally, everything is in place and Gyokeres has already picked his shirt number.",
      "The 27-year-old is used to talisman status, having worn the No.9 shirt and scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season as they won the domestic double. And he certainly doesn’t appear worried about the expectations on his shoulders in north London having selected the No.14 shirt at his new club.",

      "Mason Mount says Manchester United's players have targeted an immediate return to Europe next season.",
      "United missed out on qualifying for the Champions League after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham in Bilbao back in May. Ruben Amorim's side were also responsible for United's worst league finish for 51 years, ending the season in 15 th place in the Premier League.",
      "With no European football at Old Trafford next season for only the second time in 35 years, attacking midfielder Mount said getting back there is the primary aim for next season. “We obviously want to be back in Europe,” said Mount. “That's a massive, massive thing for the club.",
      "“That's the focus. The Champions League would be amazing for us. As a group - and as players - we want to be playing in that competition. So that's the goal. We know how difficult that is now in the Premier League. There are so many teams that are investing and playing very good football at the moment.”",
      "Mount, 26, said Amorim and his coaching staff analysed in detail what went wrong last season in a bid to ensure United hit the ground running when the new campaign gets under way. “It's the small details here and there that really affect that at the top of the league,” said Mount. “It's small little details that the manager sees.",
      "“When we do analysis on games, like the first game we played or even in training, it's just seeing those moments and everyone understanding that that matters. That small little movement, the pass, appreciation, this all counts and these small wins in the game will help create chances and will help us be more dominant with the ball. So that's what we've been looking at.",
      "“From day one of pre-season, it's about standards and details within training, on and off the pitch, and really focusing on what we need to do to be better and to perform better. We haven't done loads of analysis of last season. We looked at a few areas that we can improve on, but this is a new season, it's like wiping the slate clean.",
      "\"Coming into this season with a different kind of attitude and a feeling about it and we're ready to go. The vibe around the group is very energetic. In training, it's been a few kicks here and there, because we want to win in games. That's what you want as a group. You kick your mate, but after training, it's all good.”",

Mount's two seasons at United have been blighted by injury following his £60million move from Chelsea, but he said he is determined to prove himself under Ruben Amorim.",
      "“The whole season hurt,” said Mount. “But this is a new slate now. We're looking forward to performing. We want to perform as a group. We know last season wasn't good enough so now it's about kicking on.",
      "“Going away in the summer, you're always looking at what you can do better, how you can be better for your team-mates and perform as a group, how we can all perform better. Last season it wasn't good enough. We know that, but we're kicking on now. We're ready to put right that wrong.\"",
      "Mount was out for four months midway through last season but returned to the starting line-up towards the end of the campaign and is determined to make himself a regular under Amorim. Despite United spending £133.5m on attacking duo Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Mount has backed himself to compete with them for a starting place next season.",
      "“When you're at a club like Manchester United, there has to be that competition there to perform and as a group we want to win and we're all in that together,” said Mount. “The new lads who have come in have been brilliant in training so far and the first couple of weeks is never easy.",
      "\"It's about integrating them into the group and making them feel as comfortable as possible and I think we've all done that. They've been brilliant in training and we'll be working together to get to that goal. They know what's coming with the Premier League and the games and how difficult it is now. What they've done in the Premier League already, the amount of goals they've scored, the amount of assists they've created, that's exactly what we need in the team.",
      "“We're working together to try and improve that, because last season we didn't hit those goals or assists as much as we could have done.” Asked how long it took him to get over United's 1-0 defeat to Spurs in Bilbao, Mount said: \"Quite a long time. I've had quite a few losses in finals, so it's not easy. It never gets any easier, for sure.",
      "“But it's about looking at what we could have improved on. In finals, little things that happen in the game, it's like they have a bigger impact. It was tight. But it's about looking forward now and really using this pre-season to work on a lot of things that maybe we didn't get enough time to do last season.",

      "Since joining Villa from Brentford in a £33m deal five years ago, Watkins has scored 75 goals and registered 34 assists in 184 league games. The England international was the subject of a £60m bid from Arsenal in January but Villa immediately rejected it.",
      "The Telegraph report that Villa have no plans to sell the 29-year-old and insist that he isn't for sale at any price. It's not the first conversation that United have had with Villa Park chiefs this summer.",
      "Earlier this month, the Red Devils made a surprise loan offer for goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez which Villa instantly turned down. Unlike with Watkins, they're willing to let Martinez go if a club meets their £40m asking price.",
      "It's been suggested that United could offer Alejandro Garnacho to Villa in a swap deal for Watkins. Garnacho is on the chopping block at Old Trafford but he wants to remain in the Premier League, with Villa reportedly among his admirers.",
      "The winger wouldn't be a like-for-like replacement, though, and Villa don't have a recognised backup striker in their ranks. They offloaded Jhon Duran to Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr in January for a cool £65m and Unai Emery was delighted to keep Watkins in Birmingham.",
      "\"But even when he's not doing both, he's working for the team. Defensively, the commitment was always high. He is in the press to the opponent. His commitment and behaviour is always a very good example for others. His power is his mind. His mentality is the best quality he has.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is prepared to reintegrate the Manchester United 'bomb squad' back into the team if they are not sold.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been training separately from the first team and are not on the pre-season tour of the United States amid their wish to leave.",
      "United agreed the season-long loan of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona in midweek but are seeking fees for Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia. Sancho and Malacia are both out of contract next year, Garnacho would represent a pure profit under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules and Antony excelled on loan at Real Betis last season.",
      "However, Amorim warned potential buyers that United chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox have set a specific valuation for each player that they will not budge on.",
      "\"There are different reasons for the players,\" Amorim said. \"Some players have to find a new place to have more space in the team and other players clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams. We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide.",
      "\"If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players. I know for a fact, these people, Omar, Jason and the club, have a number for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.",
      "\"I understand that clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I’m ready to receive the players, they have more competition, more competition. If you want to play in the World Cup next year you need to play.",
      "\"So I'm really happy with that because I have more options. If they have to fight each other to play (laughs), for me it’s perfect.",
      "\"In any team, if you see the best teams in the world, you feel the bond between all the players and that is really important. Then I think we need to remind ourselves how special it is to be at Manchester United. That is my feeling, it’s the best club in the world and it should be for everyone on the pitch and everyone at the club and I really like that feeling. I really like to be in a group that is healthy.",
      "\"We are going to suffer, we have problems but that feeling of bonding from everybody, from the staff, from the players, with the technical staff is really important and can help us win some games where we are not playing so well because we are positive.\"",
      "Amorim stressed how happy he was that United secured the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in time for the pre-season tour. United bought Cunha from Wolves last month after triggering his £62.5million release clause and Mbeumo officially completed his transfer from Brentford in a £71m deal on Monday.",
      "\"Really pleased. It’s really important to sign new players as soon as possible,\" Amorim added. \"Sometimes it’s not possible but I’m really pleased.",
      "\"Because they have already proved in Premier League, that is already really important in the moment. Matheus can play in different positions so you have more mobility to change the starting XI, so I’m really pleased.\"",

      "Liverpool have bought Hugo Ekitike, Viktor Gyokeres is on the verge of completing a move to Arsenal and Newcastle United goalscorer Alexander Isak is of interest to Liverpool amid his desire to leave.",
      "United have recorded a minus goal difference in the past two seasons and Amorim was unconvinced by the £108.5m duo Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee last season. However, the Portuguese is content with his existing options.",
      "\"They can play as a striker,\" Amorim said of Cunha and Mbeumo. \"We have Josh, we have Rasmus, so our focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the positions are there for them. They have to work.",
      "\"They have other players that are fighting for that position. But again, I'm really pleased. Because they proved that the goals that they have, they are really humble. That is really important.",
      "\"And the best thing is that they chose to be here. They had other options, Champions League options. And they read everything people say about our club in the moment. But they chose to be here and that is a key point for me.\"",
      "United have been linked with several strikers on the market. Aston Villa denied United had enquired about Ollie Watkins, RB Leipzig frontman Benjamin Sesko was of interest to United three years ago and Chelsea have tried to whip up interest from United in some of their forwards.",
      "Amorim has stressed United have to be \"careful\" who they recruit. \"I think our club in the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player. So if we have to start the season with this squad, I'm happy. Because all the players that are here want to be here.",
      "\"And that for me is the most important thing. And Matheus and Bryan, also Diego (Leon). But Diego is a different situation. He is a potential player. But with Bryan and Matheus, we are clearly a better team.\"",
      "Amorim also confirmed the appeal of Cunha and Mbeumo was that they were Premier League-proven. \"I think you can also understand if you look at our team last year, we need experience. Matheus is young still, but with experience. And you watch every, every weekend, Matheus doing things against the players that you are going to face, that can help you have to have more certainty when you choose players.",
      "\"That was a policy we try to use this season. So I can say yes, it’s not just that, because they have characteristics that we need but we focused to get players who can come here and face this kind of pressure since the first day.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim admits he is \"always on top\" of Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo to increase his rhythm and pace on the ball.",
      "Mainoo endured a difficult 2024-25 season as he missed around four months of the season through two separate injury lay-offs and lost his place in the starting XI after Amorim was appointed in November.",
      "The 20-year-old was trialled as one of the two playmakers in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and even started up front in the 2-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace in February.",
      "United have a surfeit of No.10s following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo and Mainoo could have to fight for his place back in midfield.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "\"I think he can play in both positions, in the midfield,\" Amorim said. \"Last year, he played more in front. I think his perfect position is more near the ball, always with the ball.",
      "\"I think he is a big talent, and you guys know better than me that he is a big talent. I think he needs to increase the rhythm, the pace. I'm always on top of that with Kobbie, because he is so good sometimes but he can be better.",
      "\"So I have big plans. But again, like I said, one game per week, the competition is going to be huge, and everybody has to be prepared to play one game, or play all the games. That is a key point in our season.\"",
      "Mainoo rejected United's opening offer of a new contract at the start of the year and his current deal has a maximum expiry date of 2028.",
      "The academy graduate last signed a contract with United in February 2023 when he was 17-years-old and had only made two first-team appearances.",
      "Mainoo's fellow England international, Luke Shaw, was billed as \"world-class\" by Amorim despite playing 27 games in the past two seasons. Shaw, who turned 30 earlier this month, still has two years left on his United deal but there has been recent speculation that he could leave.",
      "United have five specialist centre backs and Noussair Mazraoui is also experienced at playing in Amorim's back three. Shaw is unlikely to be under consideration to play on the left wing due to his injury record.",
      "\"I think Luke Shaw is a world-class player, that is my feeling,\" Amorim added. \"When he touches the ball, the ability to play one against one, and you can feel in the small things.",
      "\"England had two finals, and he had issues during the season, but in the final, he's always there. That means something. But he needs to be fit, he needs to train always in the limit. I think he's doing that at the moment, so he's a great player but he has competition this season. So I'm really pleased also with Luke.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will speak to the media today to preview his side's opening game of the Premier League Summer Series in the United States.",
      "United will face West Ham United in their opening game of their pre-season tour at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday morning (12am BST).",
      "After drawing 0-0 with Leeds United in Stockholm in their first friendly of the summer last weekend, United will be hoping to take their pre-season preparations up a notch against the Hammers.",
      "New signing Bryan Mbeumo could make his unofficial debut for the Reds against the Londoners after arriving from Brentford earlier this week. It remains to be seen if Amorim will throw him straight into the starting XI.",
      "This afternoon's press call will mark Amorim's first interaction with journalists since the post-season tour in May, meaning he is expected to be quizzed on a variety of topics.",
      "We will bring you updates of everything he has to say via the LIVE blog below...",
      "Thanks for following our live press conference blog. We'll be bringing you live updates of United's friendly with West Ham over the weekend to stay tuned for more United coverage.",
      "We need experience. Matheus is young but with experience. You watch every weekend, Matheus doing things against players you are going to face, that can help you when you choose players, so that was a policy that we tried to use this season, so I can say yes. It's not just that, they have characteristics that we need but focus on players that can face the pressure.",
      "Cunha:",
      "It's the most important part of the game to score goals and help the game. I will do what I need to help the team, like score goals. I come here, I understand why I am here - goals, assists and everything around it - and I hope I can do my best.",
      "He can be. We can change in the game but we miss Bruno as a No.10.",
      "Sometimes when he is playing as a No.10 he comes to get the ball and nobody is a No.10. I really like when Bruno has the ball and if you have threats like Rasmus, Matheus, Bryan in the spaces, if you have a player with the quality of Bruno on the ball I think he is really important. He can play in front also.",
      "I think that is not the case, there are different reasons for the players: some players have to move to make space in the team, others want a new challenge and want a new team. We are giving them time to think and if they reach a point where they have to join the team they will because they are our players.",

I have more options and if they have to fight each other to play that is perfect.",

      "I don't think about being perfect, I just want to help the team. I am comfortable to be here and with the pressure. I hope everything can be better so I don't think about the wrong time.",
      "Cunha:",
      "When we arrive we were very welcomed and it helps you a lot to feel part of the group already. It's been two weeks already with the group, there's a lot of physical things to do in pre-season but I feel completely fine with the tactics, everything. Any time he (Amorim) has time to explain a few things he does. It is important to adapt but with time everything will go off and we will show what we do.",
      "You feel the bond between the players in the best teams, that is really important. We remind ourself how special it is to be at Manchester United, the best club in the world. I really like to be in a group that is healthy. We are going to suffer, we have problems, but that feeling of bonding from everybody is really important. It can help us to win games where we didn't perform so well.",
      "The spirit is positive.",
      "Cunha:",
      "It's an easy question to answer: United was always my dream club. When you can make your dreams come true it's an easy decision.",
      "Ruben was a big part, he talked to me and showed how important I was to him so it was easy to make the choice.",
      "He is a world class player. You can feel in the small things, England have two finals and he has issues in the season but in the final he is always there, that means something but he needs to be fit, he needs to train to the limit and he is doing that. He's a great player but he has competition this season so I'm pleased with Luke.",

They've proved already in the Premier Legaue, that is really important in the moment. Matheus can play in different positions so you can change the starting XI so I'm pleased.",

      "We started with 4.45pm, then it was 5pm and now it's 5.30pm. Hopefully you're still with us!",
      "Amorim will be up in less than 15 minutes' time. Let's hope the wait has been worth it and he's got some good news for us.",

      "United still have plenty of work to do in the transfer market this summer, with outgoings expected to be prioritised before any further signings can be made.",
      "Ruben Amorim will no doubt be asked for an update on United's quest to move on a number of players this summer. Marcus Rashford has already sealed a loan move to Barcelona, but Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia all remain at the club having expressed their desire to leave.",
      "Let's hope Amorim has an update on any of the aforementioned quartet today.",

Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself. I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that.\"",

      "There will be no extra-time or penalty shootouts during the competition.",
      "This pre-season tour feels crucial for Rasmus Hojlund. He missed the tour in 2023 after arriving from Atalanta too late and he went off injured in the opening game of last summer's tour against Arsenal.",
      "With United desperate to sign a striker, but so far making no progress, he needs to use this delay to his advantage and make his mark. A full pre-season campaign could be exactly what he has been in such desperate need of.",
      "There is no denying United need to recruit a proven goalscorer this summer, but they shouldn't turn their back on Hojlund just yet. He deserves the opportunity to benefit from a full pre-season campaign.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog from MEN Sport on Thursday, July 24.",
      "Now that Bryan Mbeumo is through the door, the priority at Old Trafford is now a striker. After missing out on Liam Delap, Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen, United are now considering alternatives.",
      "Ollie Watkins is one of the standout names linked with a move to Ruben Amorim's side. The Aston Villa striker boasts an impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League and has been linked with a move away from Villa Park in the past three windows.",
      "Meanwhile, United have been linked with Valencia's Javi Guerra. The midfielder has recently turned down a new contract at the Spanish club and reports have suggested that the Reds are working on a deal behind-closed-doors.",
      "For more signings to come in, players will have to be sold. Fortunately, United have already managed to get Marcus Rashford's wages off their books after he completed his season-long switch to Barcelona.",

      "\"With the lack of strength we had in midfield and the lack of ability to finish our opportunities, there are definitely a lot of weaknesses that need to be addressed, and having the striker gives you confidence because whenever you’re not playing well, he’s able to actually score his own goals. He’s able to score the goals that are important and can change the nature of the games.",

It was confirmed on Thursday that defender Cristhian Mosquera has left the club to complete a permanent move to Arsenal. In a statement released on their club website, Valencia confirmed that Mosquera has joined the Gunners after informing the club of his desire to move to the Emirates Stadium.",

Garnacho is keen to stay in the Premier League and play Champions League football, though no move has materialised yet despite reported interest from Chelsea.",
      "While any deals for Watkins and Garnacho would be handled separately, a significant player sale by Villa could help fund a move for the United winger.",
      "According to Marca, Man United are prepared to submit an offer for Valencia star Javi Guerra, who is currently in a contract standoff with the Spanish club.",
      "United have already agreed personal terms with the midfielder and are prepared to offer up to £21.6million.",
      "However, Valencia have set a price tag of £23.4m, as they aim to secure at least £17.3m from Guerra’s sale -after accounting for a 30 percent profit share owed to his former club, Villarreal.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Aston Villa have no intention of selling the 29-year-old and have made it clear he is not available at any price.",
      "This isn’t the first time Man United have held talks with the Villa Park hierarchy this summer. There has been speculation that Manchester United could offer Alejandro Garnacho to Aston Villa as part of a swap deal for Ollie Watkins.",

      "United are keen to sign a new attacker this summer following the underwhelming campaign from Rasmus Hojund and Joshua Zirkzee. Hojlund has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "But any hopes of signing Wilson will need to see United accelerate their efforts after BBC Sport reported on Thursday that the Hammers are interested in a deal.

      "Juventus have reportedly begun to consider other attacking options like Hojlund and Liverpool's Darwin Nunez.",

      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko continues to be linked with a summer move to Manchester United.",
      "United are in desperate need of a reliable goalscorer up-front after netting just 44 goals in the top-flight last term, comfortably their lowest ever in the Premier League era. It's a problem they have to fix if Ruben Amorim is to enjoy any form of success in 2025/2026.",
      "United have been frustrated so far in their efforts to land a new striker this summer. Indeed, they missed out on a transfer for Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea, and have been linked with Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen; who look set to join Arsenal and Galatasaray, respectively.",
      "But there could still be an opportunity to sign Sesko. United are likely to have a better chance now of landing the Slovenian with most of their top-flight rivals now looking at other targets.",
      "The CIES Football Observatory - a research group which specialises in the statistical analysis of football - currently value Sesko at €107million-€124million (around £108million). It's an eye-watering amount, while United will have to sell some of their wantaway stars if they are to raise the funds for such a deal.",
      "Attention is likely to turn to a deal for Sesko - or another new striker - once they raise more cash from sales.",
      "Newcastle are also said to be interested amid uncertainty over Alexander Isak's future, which could lead to an interesting decision for the forward. Does he join a club competing in the Champions League or one that holds greater historical appeal?",
      "It would sum up Newcastle's frustrating summer if Sesko chose a team that finished 15th last season ahead of them. And - yet - Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo's arrival at Old Trafford shows that United still hold some appeal. It would surprise no-one if Sesko followed suit.",

      "Mason Mount has backed Manchester United signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to lift the team to \"another level\".",
      "United invested £133.5million to sign Cunha from Wolves and Mbeumo from Brentford and sharpen an attack that has recorded a minus goal difference in the past two seasons.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has repeatedly said he \"loves\" Mount, who is well versed at playing in a 3-4-2-1 formation, having lined up as one of the two playmakers in the 2021 Champions League and European Championship finals.",
      "Mount scored three goals in May after returning from a three-and-a-half-month lay-off with a groin problem but United have since brought in Cunha and Mbeumo, two prospective playmakers.",
      "\"Any time you do get that opportunity to be on the pitch, you want to do something,\" Mount stressed. \"You want to affect the game. That's always the way I've looked at it.",
      "\"Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself. I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that. Obviously with the new signings coming in, they (Cunha and Mbeumo)'re going to elevate us to another level and we all need to be at that level to really perform.",
      "\"He (Amorim)'s definitely given that confidence to me from the first day he came in, speaking to me, and I know what he wants, and I feel like I know how he wants the team to play. And, obviously, I've had some experience in that role as well.",
      "\"So that helps with the younger lads coming in and me helping them understand the positions of the formation and everything. So yeah, it's been brilliant and definitely having that confidence, the manager has that confidence in me to go out there and perform, it definitely helps as a player.\"",
      "Mount revealed United players are intensifying their pre-season training sessions by kicking each other more often. Amorim complained about a \"lack of aggression\" from the squad last season and Mount admitted there has been an edge to the pre-season sessions.",
      "The 26-year-old conceded he got \"far too many yellow cards for my liking\" when he came on in games after recovering from injury for the run-in last season but he is encouraged by the way his teammates are applying themselves.",
      "\"The vibe around the group is very energetic,\" Mount said. \"In training, it's been a few kicks here and there because we want to win in games. Little games here and there.",
      "\"That's what you want as a group. You kick your mate, but after training it's all good. He knows it was in the right mind frame.",
      "\"I think I've always had that (fouling) in me. It's just when you're at the end of last season, I was coming back. At the beginning I was obviously not starting games. I was watching games and when you have that opportunity to come into the game, you want to have an impact and you want to get straight into the action. You want to do something.",
      "\"Yeah, I got too many yellow cards and I had too many fouls. Sometimes they get you into the game and get you focused there and you're ready to receive the next ball. And then, yeah, don't get any more yellow cards after that. So, yeah, that's the way I look at it.\"",
      "\"It's been brilliant. We're all doing stuff together away from the training pitch, spending time with each other. That's massive for a long season where you're about to go in and fight against other teams. We're in a really good place and there's still time for us to work at things and everything like that. But we're good and we'll be ready for it.\"",
      "Mount started in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho, who complained about his demotion after the loss in Bilbao. The result marked the sixth time that Mount has been on the losing side in a final with Chelsea, United and England.",
      "He was unable to quickly move on from United's crushing disappointment against Spurs, which confirmed they would not play any European football this season for the second time in 35 years. \"I've had quite a few losses in finals, so it's not easy. It never gets any easier, for sure,\" he added. \"But as I said already, it's about looking at what we could have improved on.",
      "\"Any little thing that happens in the game, it's like a bigger impact, especially in a final. I think obviously it was tight. We looked at why these things could have happened, but as I said before and many times, it's about looking forward now and really using this pre-season to work on a lot of things that maybe we didn't get enough time to last season.",
      "\"With the schedule, with the games, and obviously with the gaffer coming in halfway through, this period is so vital for us to be as a group and work on things.",
      "\"So, yes, this is important. Finals are never easy to take when you lose. But when you're in that next one, you remember that feeling. It takes some time (to get over such a defeat), for sure. For sure. Because as a player, you're just thinking about little things in the game.",
      "\"I started the game, so it was like, what could I have done in that situation? Or could I have made that pass better? I think you don't look too much into it, because you would drive yourself crazy, looking into loads of detail.",
      "\"But it hurts and the whole season hurt. But this is, as I said before, a new slate now. We're looking forward to performing. And that first game of the season is a great opportunity for us to do that.\"",
      "Mount is targeting a return to a European competition, minimum. \"I'd say Europe. I think that's the focus. The Champions League would be amazing for us. And as a group, we want to, and as players, we want to be playing in that competition. And that's the goal.\"",
      "United bought Mount from Chelsea for £55m rising to £60m in 2023 to play in midfield alongside Casemiro. That experiment lasted two games and Mount has only played 47 times during two injury-plagued campaigns.",
      "\"We've looked at it and looked at why,\" Mount said of his persistent injury issues, \"and I feel we're in a really, really good place now going into this season.\"",

      "With just over five weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, Manchester United still have plenty of work to do.",
      "Ahead of facing West Ham United in their opening game of their pre-season tour of the United States this weekend, United have had a successful summer thus far, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "After scoring 35 Premier League goals between them last season, United have taken a huge stride towards solving their attacking problems. Cunha and Mbeumo were among the best players in the division last term and each bring a wealth of quality to M16.",
      "United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings this summer after finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference. However, they are yet to source the natural No.9 they desperately need.",
      "Having signed Cunha and Mbeumo for an overall package that could eventually be worth up to £133.5million, United need to rely on sales to fund further incomings. With that in mind, MEN Sport has had a close look at what United should still be striving to achieve ahead of the window closing.",
      "As already documented, United want to sign a striker before the window closes. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea from Ipswich Town last month, they are struggling to source an alternative.",
      "Set to miss out on the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, who is poised to join Arsenal, and Victor Osimhen, who is set to join Galatasaray on a permanent deal from Napoli, United are being forced to look elsewhere for a goal-getter. They are now being heavily linked with Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig.",
      "The elephant in the room is that United need to sell in order to be able to buy. Marcus Rashford's loan switch to Barcelona ensures United will save millions on his wages, but that package will not be enough to fund the addition of an elite-level goal-getter, meaning United need to raise more money via sales (more on that later).",
      "In addition to signing a striker, which has to be their top priority, United also remain keen on recruiting a midfielder and a goalkeeper. However, the Reds are unlikely to be able to swoop for a midfielder for as long as they are stuck with Casemiro.",
      "Despite signing Manuel Ugarte last year, United need an upgrade in midfield. It is understood head coach Ruben Amorim wants a midfielder who is equally comfortable on the ball and defensively.",
      "As far as United's interest in signing a goalkeeper is concerned, they want someone who can compete with and challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. They continue to be linked with Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens.",
      "Rashford became the first high profile departure of the window on Wednesday, but United need to oversee several more outgoings before September 1. It has been well-documented in recent weeks that Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony all want to move on.",
      "The quartet have been left out of the squad that has travelled to the US, highlighting they have no place in Amorim's long-term plans. It would in United's best interests if they could sell all four of them on permanent deals.",
      "Garnacho is the most valuable asset United are looking to sell this summer, and if they play their cards right, they should be attracting offers of at least £50m for him. He has enormous potential and United should try and secure every penny they possibly can for him.",
      "In addition to trying to offload their four wantaway stars, they should be looking to sell Altay Bayindir, but that will depend on if they can source a new goalkeeper first. As jittery as the Turkish international can be, United can ill-afford to leave themselves short.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Casemiro are two more players United should be striving to offload permanently. The former could find regular game time hard to come by after the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, while the latter is likely to suffer from a lack of European football this season.",
      "Casemiro saved his best performances last term for the Europa League and that is a luxury United will be without this term. The Brazilian has entered the last year of his contract, meaning this summer is the perfect time for him to be sold.",
      "He earns around £300,000-a-week and United need to sell him for £15m to avoid a loss and the profit and sustainability. He is currently competing with the likes of Toby Collyer, Kobbie Mainoo, Ugarte and Fernandes for a starting berth.",
      "Meanwhile, United need to try and get Ethan Wheatley out on loan once again after a disappointing time at Walsall in the second half of last season.",
      "Incomings: goalkeeper, midfielder & a striker.",
      "Outgoings: Altay Bayindir, Tyrell Malacia, Casemiro, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Joshua Zirkzee & Ethan Wheatley (loan).",

      "With just over five weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, it remains to be seen who Manchester United will turn to in their pursuit of a centre-forward.",
      "United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings this summer and have already added Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to head coach Ruben Amorim's squad. However, they are still missing arguably the most important piece of the jigsaw.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap last month, United's striker search has been delayed. They have been linked with a crop of goal-getters, ranging from Viktor Gyokeres to Ollie Watkins, but they yet to have lodged an official bid for a new marksman.",
      "After news emerged on Thursday of Alexander Isak's desire to leave Newcastle United, some United supporters were brave enough to start believing they could swoop for the Swedish international.",
      "Isak, who scored 23 Premier League goals last season, is reputedly valued at £150million, meaning United will be priced out. They have already spent north of £120m on Cunha and Mbeumo and will be reliant on sales to fund further new arrivals.",
      "Signing a striker is a must for United this summer, but who they will end up turning to is anyone's guess right now. It would not be a complete surprise if they are still on the hunt for the No.9 as the window enters its final week.",
      "United accepted at the time of expressing a keen interest in Delap that attainable strikers are few and far between this summer. Those who went into this summer anticipating moves have either already been snapped up or are on the brink of moving.",
      "United have been linked with some of the usual suspects, such as RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, but they are yet to have made an official move. A lack of European football on offer for next season could prove to be problematic.",
      "The same could be said if United decide to rekindle their interest in Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani. United have expressed interest in the Frenchman twice in the past, most recently as January this year.",
      "After struggling to make his mark at PSG, whom he had joined from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2023, Kolo Muani enjoyed a fruitful loan spell in Turin, scoring a respectable ten goals in 22 appearances. He also contributed three assists.",
      "As a result, Juventus are continuing to be heavily linked with the prospect of re-signing him on a permanent basis. It has been claimed Kolo Muani wants to leave the French capital.",
      "With three years remaining on his contract, PSG will attempt to dig their heels in amid their ambition of securing the highest possible price for the 26-year-old, who must be keen to try and put down some roots elsewhere after failing to settle at the Parc des Princes.",
      "Interestingly, using DataMB's player similarity generator tool to bring up players with similar characteristics to Isak, Kolo Muani is one of the five similar players to the Newcastle striker.",
      "Despite scoring 15 goals fewer across all competitions than Isak last season, scoring 12 for PSG and Juventus combined, Kolo Muani scores similar levels to Isak in other areas of his game, according to the data provided.",
      "For example, in terms of non-penalty goals, 91 per cent of Isak's efforts were from open play and 86.7 per cent of Kolo Muani's were from open play. Additionally, Kolo Muani had a higher goal conversion rate (97.3 per cent) than Isak (85.5 per cent) last term.",
      "With Newcastle said to value Isak at £150m, Kolo Muani could be a good alternative for a fraction of the price. Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport recently said he could be available for as little as £39m.",

      "Ruben Amorim sits at the front of the Manchester United team bus. This is a season that demands a start on the front foot.",
      "The opening fixture against Arsenal at Old Trafford will evoke memories for many United fans of the sun-kissed 4-1 thrashing of the champions in 1989. United invested strikingly that summer, too, yet lost three of their first five matches.",
      "After Arsenal visit, United are at Manchester City and host Chelsea in September. David Moyes complained that the fixture computer had pitted United against Chelsea, Liverpool and City in his first five fixtures. That defeatist attitude was one of innumerable reasons why he was always ill-suited to United.",
      "Amorim’s first full season begins similarly (Liverpool are also lurking around the corner in October). United were actually unbeaten in three games with City last season, two of their best performances were against Arsenal and they narrowly lost at Chelsea five days before the Europa League final.",
      "United will not look markedly different when they line-up against Arsenal. The best-case scenario is there will be three new starting signings: Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and a new striker. The sight of his former Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres with a cannon stitched to his shirt rather than a devil may cause Amorim to drop to his haunches sooner than usual.",
      "Gyokeres was never a realistic target. The top-tier strikers on the market want to stay or play in the Champions League. United do not have the clout or wherewithal to move for Gyokeres or Alexander Isak. There was concrete competition for Cunha and Mbeumo but United were never going to be a tough sell for players at Wolves and Brentford.",
      "Every Premier League club last season possessed a superior striker to United, bar sorry Southampton. Southampton looked at signing Rasmus Hojlund a year before he joined United.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s director of football, has overseen a shift to focus on Premier League recruits after United bought only one senior player from a Premier League club in nearly six years. At the time of writing, Ollie Watkins and Jean-Philippe Mateta are realistic options who would fit the bill up front: two centre forwards in their late 20s whose value is bound to dwindle after this summer.",
      "Unai Emery’s curious handling of Watkins when Marcus Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa piqued the striker. Mateta caused United plenty of grief at Selhurst Park and Old Trafford in two memorable Palace victories.",
      "Watkins has never broken the 20-goal barrier for Villa, though. Mateta hasn’t for Crystal Palace, either. It would be a stretch to bill either as 'proven'. They would still have a worthy support cast of Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad, Bruno Fernandes et al. and represent an upgrade on Hojlund.",
      "After successive seasons where they recorded a minus goal difference and their worst campaign in 51 years, United need a frontman they can get behind. That extends to the players, too. Plenty have always been unconvinced by Hojlund, a signing destined to fail through his exorbitant £72million fee and ties to Erik ten Hag’s agent, Kees Vos.",
      "Between the sticks is a goalkeeper lacking confidence from supporters. Andre Onana is set to continue as No.1 by default as United have focused their investments at the top end of the pitch.",
      "Onana is at least shielded by a quintet of centre backs with a promising blend of youth and experience. United signed a centre half in seven of the past nine summer transfer windows. They will not be acquiring one this summer and what has been one of their weakest areas of the squad in recent years is now one of their strongest.",
      "Leny Yoro has found his feet, Harry Maguire has become a captain without the armband, Ayden Heaven has been a revelation and Matthijs de Ligt looked to have got to grips with the Premier League before injury. Lisandro Martinez - when he has recovered from injury - could be more influential in Amorim’s back three than he was for Ten Hag.",
      "There is a potential midfield minefield, though. Bruno Fernandes seems likely to be permanently relocated to a deeper role and you could play him in goal and he would still be the most influential player in the United side.",
      "But beyond him there are glaring issues. Manuel Ugarte’s form towards the end of last season was so poor he was benched for the Europa League final. Casemiro’s good form was reserved almost exclusively for the Europa League, so he could become redundant with no European football. Kobbie Mainoo has been primarily recognised by Ruben Amorim as a playmaker and Toby Collyer has started three games in his career against teams from League 1, Scotland and Romania.",
      "United would like to strengthen in midfield but the issue is the unshiftable Casemiro. Sources say four different figures were given mandates to sell him yet he seems certain to see out the final year of his United contract.",
      "Casemiro is valued at £15million and, realistically, no club is forking out that fee for a 33-year-old who will be free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement in January. Casemiro has regained his place in the Brazil squad after an 18-month exile but it helps matters that his former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti is in charge.",
      "United have valuable assets in midfield in Fernandes and Mainoo but the former rejected the opportunity to move to Saudi Arabia. The concern would be that United could cash in on Mainoo if a late bid comes in and frees up funds.",
      "There would be parallels with Scott McTominay, only this time last year Fulham’s interest in McTominay and United’s interest in Ugarte were well documented. McTominay was a sellable asset and always seemed likely to leave.",
      "Mainoo’s future is uncertain but there has not been a lot of noise around him so far this summer. His contract has a maximum expiry date of 2028 but he rejected United’s initial proposal of a renewal at the start of the year and it has been quiet on that front.",
      "Realistically, United could get through a lighter season with the aforementioned midfield quintet. A new midfielder should be at the top of the shopping list in 12 months.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon are imperfect options on the left wing but there are senior auxiliary alternatives. Mbeumo has to operate on the right-hand side, a problem position that United have struggled to solve for upwards of a decade. Mbeumo represents the best of both worlds in that he is adept at attacking and defending but United have to play to his strengths after a 20-goal season.",
      "Senior figures at United are targeting a top six finish. That is not pie-in-the-sky stuff when recent history shows clubs have shot up the table without European commitments. Newcastle United nabbed Champions League qualification in 2023 and 2025. Liverpool nearly won the league in 2014. Leicester City did win the league in 2016. So did Chelsea a year later.",
      "The exception is United. The last time they were out of Europe, they scraped fourth under Louis van Gaal in 2014-15, winning one of their final six fixtures. Van Gaal’s tenure got off to a startling start with defeat to Swansea City.",
      "He was never one to play on the front foot, though.",

      "United travelled to the USA on Tuesday and will be primarily based in Chicago. They are set to take on West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "The players seemed in high spirits during their flight and they trained for the first time since touching down on American soil on Wednesday at the Endeavour Health Performance Centre.",
      "So, here are four things we spotted from the first USA training session...",
      "The signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for £65m plus £6m in add-ons was announced on Monday evening, just in time for Mbeumo to join his new teammates on the USA plane.",
      "Club figures admitted they were delighted to have their top targets, Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, signed in time to travel on the pre-season tour, meaning Ruben Amorim has the chance to work closely with his new additions and convey his expectations for the season during an intense schedule.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are tremendous signings and should provide creativity and goals to the front line. United are in the market for a striker, which feels like the missing piece of the jigsaw for a formidable attack.",
      "United's new signings were pictured smiling during the session and it will be exciting to see them play alongside each other in the States, which could happen for the first time against West Ham.",
      "United often play small-sided games during training at Carrington and the photo of the 'winning team' is shared on social media. That looked to be the case again on Wednesday, as an eight-man team spearheaded by Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro posed for a celebratory picture.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Tom Heaton were the other senior players involved in the team, with youngsters Tyler Fredricson, Reece Munro, Bendito Mantato and Ethan Williams also playing a role.",
      "The pre-season tours are a brilliant chance for players to bond, given the time they are spending in close proximity to each other over a fortnight, and those benefits will be reaped later in the campaign.",
      "Leny Yoro grew in confidence each month last season. He was excellent after being moved to the left side of the three-man defence and could reach another level in his second year.",
      "Yoro has become comfortable in Manchester and spoke in the mixed zone after the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds. The Frenchman was also pictured conducting an in-house interview with MUTV after the training session and it's encouraging to see him speaking to the media more regularly.",
      "The 19-year-old has the qualities to become a leader in the United dressing room.",
      "Williams joined Cheltenham Town on a six-month loan in the January window and he was one of the most successful loans at United, making 17 appearances for the League Two side.",
      "The 19-year-old can play at left-wing back, or in one of the No.10 roles, and will be hopeful of making a strong impression during the USA tour, as he was picked ahead of a handful of other promising players.",

      "Manchester United are yet to add a new striker to their squad, despite links to Benjamin Sesko, with the new Premier League season set to kick off at home against Arsenal on August 17.\"",
      "A host of players have been linked with a move to Old Trafford, including Viktor Gyokeres, Ollie Watkins, and Nicolas Jackson. On Thursday, talkSPORT reported that United had made fresh contact with Aston Villa regarding Watkins, but the 29-year-old is believed to be valued at around £60million.",
      "But the club hierarchy are also keeping a close eye on Sesko’s situation after Arsenal abandoned negotiations for his services. The Gunners have instead chosen to pursue a deal for Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "Here, MEN Sport takes a look at the latest developments surrounding Sesko.",
      "According to journalist Christian Falk, Leipzig could consider a sale if an offer around the €70million (£60.6m) mark. Speaking to Caught Offside, Falk revealed United are closely monitoring the situation.",
      "\"When one door closes, another opens! Arsenal have withdrawn their pursuit of Benjamin Sesko, which creates an opportunity for Manchester United,\" he said. \"The Red Devils weren’t in the front row for the club and player. However, there’s a key executive involved in all of this – Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting.",
      "\"He’s previously worked for RB Leipzig, and he’s now supporting the potential deal. Vivell’s also been watching the situation develop since April. He was at the match between Leipzig and Wolfsburg to scout Sesko again. The striker (22) is still very, very young. He can leave with a good offer; I think Leipzig are willing to talk if they receive a fee closer to €70m [£60.6m].\"",
      "United could now be facing tough competition for Sesko, following the news that Alexander Isak is considering a move away from Newcastle United. On Thursday Fabrizio Romano reported that Newcastle were alert to Sesko's situation at Leipzig and have been informed about what it would take to sign him.",
      "Meanwhile, The Athletic's David Ornstein added that the Magpies are 'exploring a move' for the 22-year-old as a potential replacement for Isak. Eddie Howe's side have had a long-standing interest in the Slovenia star.",
      "However, it's said that a deal is challenging from a financial perspective.",
      "However, United hold a secret weapon over Newcastle. Recruitment director Christopher Vivell is now based at Old Trafford, but he previously worked with Sesko during his time at Leipzig.",
      "Vivell not only understands the strengths and weaknesses of pursuing a deal for Sesko, but he also has existing relationships with the player and his representatives - connections that could help facilitate a smoother negotiation process if United decide to make a move.",
      "\"Our striker Sesko, I was really impressed, to be honest,\" Ridle Baku, who joined Leipzig from Wolfsburg in January told FourFourTwo in March. \"The first training session, I knew already that he's a good player. But I'm speaking about potential, probably he's not [currently at] potential he could be, but right now, what I saw already, very impressive. He has everything to be a world-class player.\"",
      "\"He's still young, he still needs to learn, not the technical things about being a striker but maybe more the finesse side. He has everything, strength shooting, technique, everything. I like working with him and I'm trying to get him there – he'll go on and score a lot of goals for us and some point go to the club he'll love to play for.\""

      "Manchester United remain alert to opportunities that could arise in the summer transfer window following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Those two players have cost United £133.5 million, but more spending could follow with a new striker among the club's priorities. The likes of Benjamin Sesko, Nicolas Jackson and Ollie Watkins are players to have been linked with a move to Old Trafford in recent weeks.",
      "On the pitch, United are stepping up their pre-season preparations and are currently in the United States for the Premier League Summer Series. They are set to face West Ham, Bournemouth, and Everton before hosting Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9.",
      "Here, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest headlines.",
      "The 29-year-old England international is believed to be one of a number of strikers the club have looked at, including Nicolas Jackson and Benjamin Sesko from Chelsea and RB Leipzig respectively.",
      "Watkins is thought to be valued in the region of £60m by Villa.",
      "MEN Sport says: There are better options out there. Watkins, who will turn 30 at the end of the year, doesn’t quite align with the club’s push for emerging talent with high res-ale value. In contrast, targeting someone like Benjamin Sesko makes far more sense at this stage.",
      "Not only does he fit the youthful profile United are prioritising, but with Arsenal no longer in the race the path to securing him is less congested - making it a smarter, more strategic move for the club.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe claims the Reds are one of several clubs interested in Senegalese striker Idrissa Gueye. The 18-year-old is expected to leave FC Metz just months after joining from Generation Foot.",
      "The report adds that Metz are looking for a fee of €20m (£17m) to part ways with the youngster. United are said to have followed him for 'several months' as well as Borussia Dortmund.",
      "The pair have reputedly entered discussions with his entourage.",
      "MEN Sport says: The 18-year-old perfectly embodies the type of young, high-potential talent United are targeting as part of their long-term strategy. His profile aligns with the club's wider vision of building a squad that can deliver now while also laying strong foundations for the future.",

      "Well-placed sources say four intermediaries had a mandate to try and sell Casemiro, who has entered the last year of his United contract and earns around £300,000-a-week.",
      "United would require a fee of £15million to avoid a loss on Casemiro under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules but an offer is unlikely to be forthcoming.",
      "Casemiro, 33, shone during United's Europa League knockout ties but the club were seeking buyers for the Brazilian in the winter transfer window when he went a month without playing.",
      "United want to reinforce their central midfield but Casemiro is one of five existing options. The club would have to generate significant funds or shift a high earner to have the leverage to bolster the area.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is set to be relocated to central midfield permanently and United committed to spending £50million on Manuel Ugarte last August. Kobbie Mainoo has been used as a playmaker by head coach Ruben Amorim while Toby Collyer has only started three games in his professional career.",
      "Mainoo rejected United's initial proposal of a new contract at the start of the calendar year and Ugarte's form in last season's run-in was so poor he was benched for the Europa League final at the expense of Casemiro.",
      "United released Christian Eriksen last month and have prioritised sharpening their attack with the £133.5m outlay on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with a centre forward also wanted.",
      "The club have scoured goalkeeping options but Andre Onana's recent injury has complicated matters in that area. United are not actively looking to sell Onana, either.",
      "Casemiro joined United from Real Madrid in August 2022 for £60m rising to £70m. After a superb first season, his influence waned considerably until he returned to the starting XI for the Europa League round-of-16 tie with Real Sociedad in March.",
      "Amorim admitted after the second leg with Sociedad that \"I’m improving the way I use a player like Casemiro\". The Brazil international returned to the national team squad last month after an 18-month exile.",

      "Newcastle are linked with two Premier League strikers and a Manchester United target as the consider the prospect of life after Alexander Isak…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🔽 Emi Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited have been heavily linked with the Villa keeper, but their intent was limited to a pitiful loan offer which the Villans, understandably, laughed off. Reports in Argentina suggest that’s as far as United will go, and Martinez will instead consider cashing in over in Saudi.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Luke Shaw – Manchester United to Saudi\nThis hasn’t reached the stage yet of a suitor being named but reports suggest Shaw has seen the writing on the wall for his United career and he’s willing to make the best of it by taking the Saudi coin. Sadly, Ruben Amorim will have taken the view that Shaw’s fitness cannot be relied upon, and he is now well-stocked for left wing-backs. There is no urgency here – it could be one for January.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nIf Isak goes then Newcastle will want two strikers and, according to the Express & Star in the Midlands, one they have a ‘strong interest’ in is Larsen. Not strong enough to actually pick up the phone to Wolves yet. All in good time…",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nUnited are ready to get a deal done quickly, apparently, at around £20million for the Spain Under-21 midfielder who has just rejected Valencia’s latest offer of a contract renewal. Reports suggest Guerra is hoping for a better offer from Valencia so this could simply be a case of his representatives using United and the oldest trick in the agents’ book.",
      "",
      "16) 🔼 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nNo sooner had we reports of renewed interest from United in Watkins did we have the rebuttal from Villa. The England striker is considered by the Villans as ‘not for sale’. Which is what anyone looking to sell for top dollar would say at first. Watkins is valued at £60million by Villa. United would doubtless seek to negotiate down from there but we’re struggling to see where the two clubs find common ground here if this was a deal done in isolation.",
      "",
      "15) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko seemed to be going nowhere while Leipzig were demanding in excess of £75million but in news sure to grind Arsenal’s gears, reports in Germany suggest that demand could have fallen to £59million, which would make the Slovenian much more appealing to United.",
      "",
      "14) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, reaffirming somewhat that the winger has a higher opinion of himself than most others do. Chelsea and Spurs have been linked but it has always been tentative. The noise has been building around Villa’s interest in Garnacho, but like United’s view on Watkins, they can’t pay the amount requested. With all the accounting sorcery prompted by PSR, we’re sure there’s a workaround here that leaves everyone happy.",
      "",
      "13) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Sancho’s agent has been in Turin this week to attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "10) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "9) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. Only problem now is they need to deal with Brentford. Wissa reportedly returned early from the Bees’ pre-season training camp for talks over his future – he is unlikely to have liked what he was told. Quite reasonably, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa – the suggestion was he was only ever viewed as back-up to Isak – then they are going to have to try a lot harder than £25million.",
      "",
      "8) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and he is the first on their list should Isak get his wish.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Viktor Gyokeres is in London, which means Arsenal can ramp up their pursuit of the Palace star, which they intend to do…",
      "",
      "6) Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nThis one doesn’t seem to have moved in since Forest saw their arse over Spurs randomly plucking the same number out of the sky that appears on Gibbs-White contract under the buy-out clause. Forest threatened legal action and since then… nothing. The player missed the start of Forest’s pre-season trip to Portugal to stay behind with his heavily pregnant partner but joined up on Wednesday. What now? For this to go through, Spurs must suss that they are legally on solid ground and pursue the deal at the cost of their original offer; or they sweeten the deal for Forest to sell a player who wants to move.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way. The latest: the two clubs are ‘in dialogue’.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe didn’t think this done just because Newcastle had told Liverpool that Isak was not for sale. Their stance hasn’t changed – but everything else has after Isak agitated for a move. If only he had done it sooner, Liverpool might not have spent the money on Hugo Ekitike, who might have filled the Isak void at Newcastle. Instead, the expectation is the pair will team up at Anfield. It won’t happen quick – Newcastle are determined to dig in and their worst-case scenario has to involve a British transfer record fee – but it’ll probably happen.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThe Netherlands defender’s agent is quite open about talks that have taken place with Chelsea, who have also been in touch with Ajax. Hato has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Real Madrid, but he’s apparently already ‘said yes’ to Chelsea, who seem intent on getting to the teenager first. Hato was left out of the Ajax squad for Thursday night’s friendly against Celtic in Como.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nPoor Newcastle. They are having a shocker, and City haven’t helped. Newcastle took forever to finally agree a deal with Burnley for the England goalkeeper, only for City to exercise their option to match any offer. Trafford will re-join City for £27million to compete with Ederson. Who, no doubt, is delighted at the prospect.",
      "",
      "1) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nArsenal have only gone and bloody done it! Gyokeres is on his way to London for a medical on Saturday after which he’ll sign to take the no.14 shirt, as worn by Gunners legends like Eddie Nketiah and David Hillier."

      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with Manchester United unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "While no deal completed this summer can challenge the biggest overpays in Premier League history, plenty have already been made well in excess of a player’s reported market value.",
      "A few factors go into that assessment. Age, performance level and experience are inevitably taken into account but the number of interested teams, general market trends and the reputation and status of the leagues the selling and buying clubs belong to can also heavily dictate that that market value.",
      "And when it comes to those increasingly expensive intra-Premier League transfers there is basically a £10m surcharge applied before talks even commence.",
      "It is no coincidence that seven of the ten biggest supposed overpays – going by the numbers crunched by the fine folk at Transfermarkt – involve a pair of Premier League clubs both trying to orchestrate PSR-friendly deals.",
      "Nor that Real Madrid account for two of the others when they signed Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono, while Saudi side Al-Qadsiah apparently went overboard bringing in Mateo Retegui.",
      "But those eight Premier League overpays, made by five of the Big Six plus Newcastle, do beg the question as to who has been most royally screwed.",
      "",
      "Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool)",
      "Fee: £69m rising to £79m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £82.9m",
      "The Liverpool spin puts Ekitike firmly in the Haaland and Mbappe bracket in terms of potential at his age. And there is certainly an element of speculating to accumulate after committing such sums on a striker with 44 goals in 136 appearances",
      "It could all go quite Darwin Nunez, with an enticing European reputation, add-ons destined to remain unfulfilled and the hints of beautiful chaos not quite enough to sustain a career at a competent club ultimately driven by numbers.",
      "But it is notable that far less of the final value of the Ekitike signing is tied up in those performance-based clauses, while the guaranteed portion is higher too. Liverpool clearly feel he is the real thing who can be carefully nurtured, developed and moulded over time at Anfield.",
      "That does not make it a certainty that Ekitike will come good – no such thing exists in the world of transfers – but everyone is at least on the same page this time at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United)",
      "Fee: £65m rising to £71m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £47.7m",
      "It is little wonder an ‘angry’ Manchester United ‘slammed’ Brentford once the deal to sign Mbeumo was finally completed 44 days after their opening bid.",
      "That came in at around £45m plus £10m in add-ons, which the Bees were never going to accept but a testing of the waters was entirely necessary.",
      "Once a second offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons was rejected Ruben Amorim’s side had a choice to make: begrudgingly accept that various taxes from a Manchester United one to a general Premier League levy was going to be applied; or walk away from a deal for their priority target who they had already invested a large amount of the transfer window on pursuing.",
      "There was at one stage an insistence that Manchester United would not be held to ransom but they excel at few things more than baulking at a fee while paying it.",
      "This is their new transfer policy and it costs a pretty penny.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m rising to £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",
      "As the most recent scorer of a Champions League knockout stage goal for Manchester United, Elanga even brings a degree of experience to a stage Newcastle are still adjusting to.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Spurs)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £39m",
      "There is always a quirk in the system and the idea Spurs overpaid for Kudus seems curious.",
      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",
      "Thomas Frank pinpointed Kudus as his main transfer target because of the “unpredictability” the Ghanaian can provide in attack at “almost the perfect age to perform and hit the next level”.",
      "While moving a player with those characteristics across enemy lines was always going to require some intricate negotiations, Spurs pushed it through at a price both parties could sell as a win.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal)",
      "Fee: £48.5m rising to £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £34.7m",
      "If you listen to Arsenal supporters, which is medically inadvisable at the best of times, the Madueke signing is not only an egregious use of club funds but an act so deeply objectionable as to prompt petitions, protests and defaced murals.",
      "That the line for those deeply ‘entitled’ fans is drawn at their favourite football club making what they deem to be an underwhelming signing, rather than the shameful handling of the Thomas Partey debacle, is a cripplingly damning indictment on the modern world.",
      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United)",
      "Fee: £62.5m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £52m",
      "The spotlight which comes with a move to Manchester United cannot have surprised Cunha but being scapegoated by Newcastle for their lack of signings and blamed by Sporting for their valuation of Viktor Gyokeres seemed curious.",
      "It is unknown precisely how far Manchester United would have gone in the bidding if Cunha wasn’t accompanied by a release clause which specified his price tag – or indeed if they would have targeted him at all without one.",
      "A multi-functional 26-year-old Brazilian international forward with 42 goal contributions in 82 Premier League appearances does, after all, come with a premium.",
      "And if all else fails, Manchester United will simply continue Cunha’s career trend of being sold for £18m profit every two years.",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea)",
      "Fee: £55m rising to £60m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £43.3m",
      "From the competition Chelsea faced for Pedro to the remuneration Brighton were due for their work in developing a former club-record £30m signing, the Brazilian was always going to cost a pretty penny.",
      "Throw into the equation the fees Chelsea consistently pay for forwards in particular – and what is effectively the antithesis of a discount at their favourite shop as Brighton are still making them pay for the Moises Caicedo mess – and it could be suggested that the Blues paid over the odds.",
      "But rarely if ever before has a player paid back their fee so quickly and specifically as with Pedro, whose first three Chelsea goals helped win the Club World Cup and earn Enzo Maresca’s side an extra £30m or so.",
      "Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive the players” that Manchester United are actively trying to offload – if they don’t secure moves this summer.",
      "Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice has hit out at the Gunners fans that criticised the signing of Noni Madueke before he even arrived at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "An ex-Arsenal striker has urged the Gunners to sign a free agent forward after sealing the £63m deal for Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",
      "Marc Cucurella has questioned the timing of Noni Madueke’s transfer to Arsenal, calling it ‘strange’ and a missed opportunity.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "A former Arsenal player has backed Noni Madueke to become a starter, while criticising fan reaction and comparing him to Kai Havertz."

      "Rashford has fallen on his feet as he’s secured a move to La Liga champions Barcelona. He has joined the Spanish giants on loan with an option to buy for around £26m.",
      "The Man Utd outcast is fortunate to get this move as he has been heavily criticised for his poor form and attitude over the past couple of years.",
      "Ruben Amorim could not inspire the England international to return to form at Old Trafford as they butted heads before he joined Aston Villa on loan in January.",
      "Rashford boosted his reputation during his brief stint at Villa as he grabbed six goals and four assists in 17 appearances.",
      "READ: Manchester United make hilarious transfer ‘decision’ over Alexander Isak after ‘transfer request’",
      "His recent upturn sparked interest from elsewhere and Barcelona eventually decided to take a calculated punt on him after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams.",
      "Former Premier League forward Stan Collymore thinks Barcelona are “getting the best of the deal”, which is “poor” for Man Utd.",
      "“I think this Rashford deal is poor for Man United. For a player at the peak of his career that they’ve nurtured to possibly only get £25m for him if Barcelona buy him next summer, having paid an absolute arm and a leg in wages over the years, isn’t recompense at all,” Collymore told Caught Offside.",
      "“For the player, it’s quite unbelievable. He had a poor last season at Man United, goes to Aston Villa. Cameo appearances that were not particularly great, but by the way that Gary Lineker talks, you’d thought it was Lionel Messi playing for Villa last season.",
      "“For Barcelona, what do they get? They get a player on the cheap whose wages will be nowhere near the £300k mark if they were to buy him permanently next summer.",
      "“But they get the best of the deal, quite simply, because they’re going to get a player that’s motivated to play for them. All that was coming out through the season last season was, Marcus Rashford won’t sign for Aston Villa permanently because he’s waiting for Barcelona.”",
      "Collymore has also explained why a move to a Championship team would make more sense for Rashford at this stage.",
      "“I think the greatest story here is how players can effectively be so poor for a couple of seasons, basically, including the loan at Villa, and still dictate where they want to go to a club that’s playing in the Champions League and arguably among the four or five biggest clubs on the planet. And I find that remarkable,” Collymore continued.",
      "“I think that from a Barcelona perspective, it’s only because they’re still coming out of that negative financial situation that they were in, so that they were doing lots of wheeling and dealing in the last three or four years.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford, make no bones about it, he’s a very, very, very lucky boy, because if football had any logic, he would probably be getting a move to Blackburn, Norwich or another aspirational championship club – certainly not one of the top four or five clubs in the world.”",
      "Lamine Yamal reportedly feels he has been ‘deceived’ by Barcelona over the signing of Marcus Rashford, and is angry that he was not ‘involved’ in the transfer decision, like Lionel ...",
      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Man Utd.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford should’ve departed Manchester United a hero. Instead, his exit prompts barely a shrug as he gambles on Barca levers…",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford was reportedly told what he must to do succeed at Barcelona in a meeting with Hansi Flick."

      "Manchester United are ‘squeezing’ to sign a Barcelona star ‘ideal’ for Ruben Amorim’s system and ‘believe’ they can land him for £34.8m this summer.",
      "The Red Devils completed early deals for Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon this summer before a long-drawn-out negotiation with Brentford saw them finally land Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United chiefs are currently scouring the market for a new No.9, but Amorim also wants to add a new midfielder to his ranks, despite being ‘prohibited’ in that move by Casemiro remaining at the club.",
      "‘Well-placed sources say four intermediaries had a mandate to try and sell Casemiro, who has entered the last year of his United contract and earns around £300,000-a-week.",
      "‘United would require a fee of £15million to avoid a loss on Casemiro under the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules but an offer is unlikely to be forthcoming.’",
      "Despite that block, United are thought to be eyeing up Barcelona’s Marc Casado as a possible addition.",
      "Arsenal have been linked with a move for the midfielder, but a report earlier this month claimed United have  identified the La Masia graduate as a ‘key target’ with the Premier League side ‘preparing massive offer’ of €100m (£87m) for the midfielder.",
      "The report claimed Casado is ‘viewed as an ideal long-term alternative to Manuel Ugarte’, and while it was at that point thought that the only way to sign the Spaniard was to trigger his €100m release clause as Barcelona would ‘prefer to retain’ the defensive midfielder, the Red Devils are now of a different mind according to Spanish outlet Nacional.",
      "The report claims Amorim sees the 21-year-old as ‘the ideal profile for his style of play’, with United ‘evaluating presenting a formal offer in August’, having hopefully moved on a number of their surplus stars.",
      "Barcelona’s ‘position is firm’ with Casado’s ‘sale not contemplated, at least not in the short term’, and ‘the player himself has no intention off leaving’ despite significant competition for a spot in the team.",
      "But United ‘squeeze’ for his signing and ‘believe’ a €40m [£34.8] bid will be enough to convince both the player and club to sell.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Manchester United will not give up easily. Amorim is a coach who insists on the profiles he considers important for his system, and Casadó is one of them. At Old Trafford they think they can convince both the player and Barça with an offer close to 40 million euros, although they know that it will not be easy.",
      "‘Meanwhile, Casadó continues to work with humility and ambition, aware that this may be the season that marks his definitive leap to the elite. In the club they see him as a natural relief for key positions in the midfield and a piece with a lot of future. United squeezes, but Barça and the player, for now, stand firm.’",
      "Man Utd are ‘preparing’ to make bids for their next two targets after they wrap up a deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports.",
      "Premier League giants Liverpool and Chelsea have both submitted offers for Barcelona defensive midfielder Marc Casado, according to reports.",
      "Mikel Arteta could smell opportunity as Arsenal look to exploit Barcelona’s financial crisis as the Gunners’ rebuild rolls on.",
      "Arsenal have made a £34m ‘offer’ for the 21-year-old and are now ‘waiting for an answer’ from Barcelona, who are thought to be open to his transfer this summer.",
      "Arsenal have ‘taken the first step’ towards signing a Barcelona star for £51m after Mikel Arteta made an ‘express request’ over the midfielder’s transfer."

      "Manchester United face a ‘dilemma’ over the future of Kobbie Mainoo amid interest from Tottenham amid claims the midfielder’s agent is ‘not asking for too much money’.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with the Old Trafford exit for the last year, with Chelsea approaching the Red Devils last summer and again in January over a move for the England international.",
      "United initially insisted Mainoo was ‘untouchable’ and then slapped a £70m price tag on his head amid their PSR woes and the midfielder’s dip in form.",
      "TBR Football claimed on Thursday that Tottenham have made a ‘shock enquiry’ to sign Mainoo and ‘actually stand a chance of signing’ the England international.",
      "Spurs ‘have asked about signing’ Mainoo as the north Londoners ‘appreciate the 20-year-old and are keeping abreast of his contract situation, which still hasn’t been agreed’.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is ‘keen to add another’ midfielder this summer and Mainoo could fall down the pecking order at Old Trafford with the World Cup just around the corner.",
      "With that in mind, Mainoo ‘will be eager to be playing regular football’ and that ‘could open the door for Spurs and Chelsea’ as TBR Football ‘sources suggest he could still move this summer’.",
      "Talks over a contract extension have stalled after it was claimed Mainoo’s representatives were asking for £180,000 per week for him to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "Those reports were later refuted, but with Mainoo currently earning just £25,000 per week and with two years left on his deal, as Dean Saunders explains, United face a ‘dilemma’.",
      "Saunders told talkSPORT: “I know his agent, and he’s not asking for too much money in comparison to what the players are earning at Man United.",
      "“But it’s a dilemma for the football club, what do you do with Mainoo? How much money do you pay him?",
      "“Because he’s actually not done much in the game but gets in the England squad and now he’s in Man United’s team and there’s players earning three times more than him, four times more than him.",
      "“So to protect their asset, how much money have you got to give him to get him to sign a new contract?",
      "“Or, if he’s not going to sign it, they’re going to have to sell him, otherwise he walks out on a free. But I think he’d get in Spurs’ team.”",
      "Tottenham have made an approach to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo as his contract saga drags on, according to reports.",
      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Only three Premier League players are on offer…",
      "Mainoo is so much more than ‘pure profit’ and the very idea of selling him is an indictment of Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes."

      "Luke Shaw is ‘ready to listen to offers’ amid ‘serious interest’ in his services this summer amid ‘fears’ over a lack of game time at Manchester United this season.",
      "Shaw made just 12 appearances for the Red Devils after missing the first three months of the campaign with a calf problem and his Old Trafford career in general has been continually blighted by injuries.",
      "United have worked to strengthen the left side of defence since Ruben Amorim’s arrival, with Patrick Dorgu joining from Lecce for £25m in January and Diego Leon added this summer in a £3.3m move from Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno.",
      "Leon played the first half of United’s 0-0 friendly draw with Leeds last weekend and Amorim was impressed with what he saw from the 18-year-old.",
      "“He did really well. He’s learning things, he’s powerful, he’s going to be a very good player,” Amorim said.",
      "Shaw is therefore facing the possibility of being fourth choice left wing-back in Amorim’s favoured 3-4-3 system, behind Leon, Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, who was a regular starter in that position last term, though Shaw has also operated as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "The Sun claim the 30-year-old ‘is aware of serious interest from Saudi clubs and is ready to listen to offers’ amid ‘fears his Red Devils career might be nearing an end’ despite having two years left on his contract, though Amorim is ‘in no hurry’ to get rid of him.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Shaw is seen as a popular and influential figure within the dressing room and Amorim is in no hurry to dump him or his £150,000-a-week wages. But the player himself is determined to make up for so much lost time and knows he faces a tough decision on his future over the coming months.",
      "‘Should he decide to leave it is unlikely United would be difficult to deal with in terms of a fee considering all those injuries and his lack of appearances – only 27 in the last two campaigns.’",

      "Rio Ferdinand has told Manchester United to “break the bank” to sign a “Ruben Amorim-type player” in the Premier League over an “inexperienced” striker.",
      "So far this summer, Man Utd have invested around £130m to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are upgrades on United’s other No.10 options, but they still need reinforcements in other positions and are crying out for a new striker after Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee underperformed in 2024/25.",
      "However, Amorim’s side have already missed out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, while their limited funds could prevent moves for Alexander Isak, Nicolas Jackson and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Ollie Watkins has been mentioned as an alternative, though Aston Villa have reportedly made a big decision on his exit amid interest from United.",
      "Ferdinand thinks Watkins would be a “very good addition” for Man Utd, but there is one “drawback”.",
      "“I think he would be a very, very good addition to the Manchester United squad. He scored 17 goals last season, 14 assists in 54 appearances,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“He’s 29, that’s the only drawback for Manchester United. There’s not going to be any sell-on value which I understand is an issue, but you’ve got to look at the here and now with Manchester United.”",
      "READ: Every Premier League club’s transfer priority: Rodrygo to Arsenal, Isak, Liverpool, Chelsea clear-out",
      "He added: “Manchester United need experience at the top of the pitch. They’ve got Hojlund, Zirkzee and Chido… young, inexperienced players.",
      "“They need someone to look at and go, ‘That’s how you play as a number nine, that’s how you do it!’, and when you buy someone who hasn’t got as much experience as I’d like, I think that’s another risk.",
      "“I think Watkins would be a very good addition for the younger ones to look at and go,’Yeah, that’s the benchmark of someone who knows how the play the role’.",
      "“He’s done it consistently at the top level for the last few years, he’s scored goals, Champions League football as well.”",
      "Ferdinand has also argued that the Red Devils should “break the bank” on Brighton star Carlos Baleba if they had the choice of signing him or an “inexperienced” forward.",
      "“Would I be happy with Manchester United going into the season as we are now? No. I want one more, I’m being greedy. I want a striker and if I don’t get a striker, I’d go midfield,” Ferdinand continued.",
      "“You’re probably thinking, ‘Who would you go and get?’, and there’s only one name I’m thinking about, I’m going to be honest, guys, who I think fits the bill for what we need.",
      "“He’s an Amorim-type player as well. Physically, he’s great. He can drive with the ball, he can take it in all areas, very good tactically, great energy, great legs, Premier League experience, central midfield… Baleba.",
      "“That’s who I would go and get, that’s the one I would go and get. I’d go and break the bank.”",
      "He went on: “If I got the money for the four players [Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Jadon Sancho] that are surplus to requirements now, would I go and get a number nine or would I go and get Baleba?",
      "“Would I get a number nine I’m not sure about, who is a bit young, inexperienced, or would I get Baleba who has Premier League experience? I’m going Baleba.",
      "“That’s who I’d get, I think he would have a huge impact on this squad and on this team.",
      "“It would ease up a few people in that midfield as well because they would have a little less responsibility defensively because he’s all-action, he can do it all.”",
      "Manchester United have quickly been told that a striker from a Premier League rival is ‘not for sale’, though there’s still a chance they land his team-mate.",
      "Man Utd are “not actively pursuing” Sesko as he didn’t “tear it up” for RB Leipzig last season and have been told a second striker target is ‘not for sale’.",
      "Arsenal are signing Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool have signed Hugo Ekitike, but Alexander Isak has become the best striker available this summer.",
      "Man Utd have held ‘fresh talks’ over a move for a Premier League striker but may ‘pivot’ to a Saudi Pro League star.",

      "The Denmark international was in a difficult situation during his debut campaign in 2023/24 as he spent most of the season as United‘s only fit striker, but he earned plaudits as he scored 16 goals in all competitions.",
      "However, the 22-year-old regressed last season and was heavily criticised for his dire performances, as he struggled to perform the basics. He only scored four Premier League goals in 32 appearances as Joshua Zirkzee outshone him during the run-in.",

      "READ: Premier League Bomb Squad XI includes Manchester United trio and Newcastle’s PSR pawn",
      "It has been suggested that Hojlund’s exit could fund a move for a new striker, as Man Utd do not currently have the financial means to buy before selling pricey assets.",
      "United are currently sixth in our ranking of this summer’s biggest spenders in Europe as they have invested around £130m to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "But they are struggling to recoup funds through player sales as Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan, while Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony remain contracted to Man Utd.",

The Newcastle striker’s transfer request came at the worst time for the Gunners, while Liverpool might already be feeling some buyer’s remorse after spending big on the versatile Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Madueke gives Mikel Arteta a new wide option, but he’s not a significant upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli on the left. He offers outstanding depth for Bukayo Saka and, considering Liverpool just won the title with Luis Diaz, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota as their left-wingers – after City dominated with Jeremy Doku, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez – it’s a smarter signing than most realise.",
      "Martinelli’s development has stalled, scoring just 14 goals across the last two seasons after netting 15 in 2022/23, and Leandro Trossard is more bench spark than starter. The next big-money addition for the Gunners after Madueke, Gyokeres and Martin Zubimendi should be a top-tier left-sided forward.",

      "They made two smart January loan signings, Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio, who contributed to 29.3% of their goals from February onwards. Both have returned to their parent clubs, and that output now needs replacing. Only Fulham (£0) and Crystal Palace (£2m) have spent less this summer.",
      "Villa are in their best position in decades, but they risk falling behind as the teams around them strengthen. Clubs that finished above them are pulling away again and those below, like Manchester United, Spurs and Brighton, are closing the gap.",
      "Back in April, we said Emery needed a right-back. That still hasn’t happened. Once that’s sorted, they can get moving on the rest. They’ll need an attacker and a goalkeeper if Emiliano Martinez departs.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Defensive recruits\nIt’s rare to lose four of your back five in one summer, but that’s where Bournemouth find themselves. They’ve already lost 60%, and PSG target Illia Zabarnyi could soon make that 80%, joining Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and on-loan goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga out the door.",
      "They’ve signed a goalkeeper in Djordje Petrovic and a left-back in Adrien Truffert, but they’re yet to add a centre-back, when they might actually need two. And just like Villa, the one position that needed addressing most going into the window (right-back) still hasn’t been sorted.",

      "Mbeumo scored 20 league goals last season before joining Manchester United for an initial £65million. That’s a massive hole to fill, but Brentford have the money and are one of the savviest recruitment teams in the league. Their most impressive work came in the Championship, but they’ve earned trust.",

      "",
      "10) Juventus – £91.84m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",

      "",
      "8) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £136.7m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",

      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",
      "An inability to replace his productivity and knack for stepping up in the biggest games has played a significant role in Manchester City’s recent plight. Jeremy Doku wishes he was as good as peak gloves Mahrez.",
      "",
      "6) Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOne Irish newspaper at the time of a transformative summer for Manchester United wrote that ‘along with Karel Poborsky and Jordi Cruyff, Scandinavian duo Ronny Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Sloksjar signed for a combined fee of £2.7 million’ to ‘make up Fergie’s team of flash continentals’.",
      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",

      "It was preposterously good business for Chelsea, who had been routinely rinsed in the market as selling clubs formed an ordinarily queue to see their exploitable riches coming a mile off. They certainly benefited from a situation of their own making with Cole, whose bridges back to Arsenal had been summarily torched, but still.",

But it opened the door to a record-breaking hijack which shaped the club’s future and heralded a glittering and often contemptuous spell.",

      "Arsenal are signing Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool have signed Hugo Ekitike. The latter are still in for Alexander Isak, while the former are surely full of regret after discovering the Newcastle United striker’s shock transfer stance. He rams through the opposition to take top spot in our ranking of the best centre-forwards available this summer.",
      "We also have the best available attacking midfielders, centre-backs, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African striker’s move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers can’t be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football could do a lot worse, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",
      "",
      "9) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Naturally, Manchester United are a solid option for Kolo Muani, while Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldn’t be ruled out either, having sent Marcus Rashford back to Old Trafford and returned Marco Asensio to PSG.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping £80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but he’s only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. He’s been a colossal flop but there’s still hope for Kolo Muani.",

      "",
      "8) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, while the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford don’t want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning £65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting £27m for David Raya and £40m for Ivan Toney. Somehow though, Craig Hope reckons the Bees will accept ‘a fee in the region of £30m’.",
      "If that’s true, we should see Wissa holding up a Newcastle United top in no time.",
      "",
      "7) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nOn a list containing two Leipzig players, here is a former Leipzig player. During his time in Germany, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino’s team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. There is talk of Newcastle targeting him after missing out on Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If he’s available for under £40m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors.",
      "",
      "6) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nThe Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him. But who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli were very interested but showed no intention of paying £60m and signed Lorenzo Lucca instead, so the Reds are now anxiously hoping a Saudi Arabian club offers big bucks for Darwin to help fund the signing of Alexander Isak.",
      "Darwin is only 26, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leave a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",

      "",
      "5) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him – it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "4) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface could be part of a summer exodus at Bayer Leverkusen, but head coach Erik ten Hag has said there have already been too many sales since his arrival. That spells bad news for Sunderland target Granit Xhaka.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "3) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentford’s Wissa. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Probably from Manchester United.",
      "",
      "2) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nPredicting Benjamin Sesko’s future is essentially pointless at this stage.",
      "There is a lot of hype surrounding the young Slovenian and a move to Arsenal looked likely before they prioritised Viktor Gyokeres. Now, it’s anyone’s guess where he’ll be playing next season. Manchester United have been linked but need sales before even considering bidding for him, while Saudi Arabian champions Al Hilal have tried and failed already this summer.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite forward, but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could become the best striker in the world.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nWell, well, well. Isak has reportedly told Newcastle he wishes to explore his options this summer, just days after Arsenal received a Viktor Gyokeres ‘Here we go’, and Liverpool confirmed the signing of Hugo Ekitike. It’s very telling that the Reds have been briefing that Ekitike can play wide, with Fabrizio Romano reporting they’re still interested in Isak.",
      "That’s despite having already spent over £100m on Florian Wirtz, £70m combined on full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and now an initial £69m on Ekitike. My oh my, they mean serious business.",
      "Isak is one of the best strikers in world football, and his transfer stance has shocked many and rightly upset Newcastle fans, who are now dreading the loss of their talisman. The Swedish international has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances for the Magpies and is valued at around £130m.",
      "",
      "Newcastle have ‘offered’ potential Alexander Isak replacement Benjamin Sesko an ‘important salary’ to convince him to leave Leipzig, according to reports.",
      "Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan believes Newcastle United should sell Alexander Isak after the striker’s transfer request.",
      "According to reports, an ‘ideal’ replacement for Alexander Isak has decided his ‘stance’ on a potential £70m move to Newcastle United.",
      "Liverpool have been told what they will have to pay to sign Isak this summer by ‘people close to the situation’ as his Newcastle teammates now expect him to leave.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United star Alexander Isak has ‘set a condition’ for him to ‘accept an offer’ amid interest from Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United have chosen not to sign Alexander Isak and that is their call, but one player has dropped a ‘bombshell’ with their decision to ‘QUIT’."

      "The Athletic‘s Ornstein has confirmed that United have held ‘talks’ over a move for Sesko, along with Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson.",
      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "Bild journalist Christian Falk revealed on Wednesday that Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting, could be ‘key’ to Sesko’s transfer having previously worked at RB Leipzig, and was seen watching the striker in action for Leipzig in April.",
      "It was claimed earlier in the window that the Bundesliga club were looking for a fee of at least £70m for their prized asset amid strong interest from Arsenal, but Bild now believe Leipzig will settle for a more ‘realistic price’ of £59m for Sesko.",
      "But journalist Ben Jacobs claims that United are once again considering a move for Watkins, though Villa are staying firm in their £60m valuation of the England international.",
      "Jacobs wrote on X: Manchester United have held fresh talks over Ollie Watkins. Villa’s £60m valuation currently deemed as too high, but #MUFC prepared to advance things if price drops.

      "Jacobs told Inside Devils: “There are a few names that leap out as United discuss internally about their targets.",

      "“So he’s a longstanding target for Man United and now you’ve got Chris Vivell who is the director of recruitment – effectively the No.2 to Jason Wilcox – and he knows Sesko from his own time at the Red Bull group.",
      "“So at the right price that’s a deal Manchester United would like to do, but Arsenal struggled to drive his release clause down, which is over €80million (£69m) and that’s why if Sesko to Manchester United is to develop there may be some patience required.",
      "“There’s a lot of talk about Nicolas Jackson and my understanding there is that at the moment Manchester United have no plans to bid, and that’s partially because Chelsea’s asking price is quite high.",
      "“If that was to change I think Chelsea might have to escalate their own pursuit of Garnacho and then maybe there’s some mutual business to be done, but all signs as of now are that Man United don’t think Jackson is feasible.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are exploring moves away from Manchester United this summer; United won't sell them if their asking price isn't met, says head coach Ruben Amorim; Marcus Rashford has been offloaded to Barcelona on loan",
      "Friday 25 July 2025 23:34, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's wantaway players could have a future at the club if their transfer asking price is not met.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are exploring moves away from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Asked if the club was concerned about losing value on those players in order to sell them, Amorim said: \"That is not the case because there are different reasons for the players [wanting to leave]. Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",
      "\"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.\"",
      "United agreed the season-long loan of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona this week having brought in forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as Amorim looks to revamp his front line.",
      "\"At the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player,\" said Amorim. \"If we have to start the season with this squad, then I'm happy because all the players want to be here. That is the most important thing.",
      "\"With Bryan and Matheus, we are clearly a better team.\"",
      "United have always been in the market for a striker, but their focus is on player sales.",
      "Amorim said: \"They (Mbeumo/Cunha) can play as a striker. We have Josh (Zirkzee) and Rasmus (Hojlund), the focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the position is there for them. They have to work. They have other players fighting for that position.",
      "\"I'm really pleased. They are really humble, that is really important, and they chose to be here. They had other options, Champions League options, they read everything people say about our club, but they chose to be here. That is a key point for me.\"",
      "Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have been training separately from the first team and are not on the pre-season tour of the United States amid their wish to leave.",
      "United are understood to believe Garnacho wants to remain in the Premier League.",
      "Juventus' move for Sancho is on hold until sales are made after they signed Francisco Conceicao this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Malacia spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven while Antony thrived at Real Betis.",
      "A move to Real Betis is looking unrealistic at this stage of the window while several clubs from across Europe, including Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich, have been monitoring his situation.",
      "Sancho and Malacia are both out of contract next year while Garnacho would represent a pure profit under the Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules after coming through the club's academy.",

      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",

He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 14:33, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Already linked with Manchester United and West Ham, Parma's Zion Suzuki is one of the great young goalkeeping talents. Adam Bate speaks to those who have worked with the Japan international to find out why clubs are so excited about his potential...",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:19, UK",
      "It seems inevitable that Zion Suzuki will move to the Premier League one day. Already courted by Manchester United and West Ham, it is just a matter of when. The hype is justified. This 22-year-old Japan international is seen as a new breed of goalkeeper.",
      "It is by design. Japan have been throwing resources at football with a specific target in mind. Project 2050. The aim is to win a World Cup by then. Frans Hoek, the legendary goalkeeping coach, has been tasked with identifying the traits of the goalkeeper of the future.",
      "In Suzuki, back when he was sat among the substitutes for Urawa Red Diamonds, Hoek spotted all the ingredients required to do it all. \"I saw him in a camp and said, 'This guy has to go to Europe as soon as possible. It does not matter what league it is. He has to play.'\"",
      "And so, Suzuki embarked on the adventure that has taken him to Belgium with Sint-Truiden, onto Italy with Parma and now linked with some of the richest clubs in Europe. Still only 22, the only question is when to make the leap. Those who know him do not doubt his talent.",
      "\"He is a really quiet guy, a really calm character. That is him off the pitch.\" On the pitch, Suzuki becomes something else entirely. He dominates. \"He is really aggressive because he has massive physical strength.\" He is 6'3\" but looks bigger. \"He is so powerful, so dynamic.\"",
      "That physicality clearly underpins his potential. \"It is like his body is just made of muscles. And I have never seen in my life a goalkeeper who can jump higher. His physical tests were off the charts.\" But it is what this physicality enables him to do that is particularly intriguing.",
      "Rudel enjoys telling the story of one of his first sessions with Suzuki. As the goalkeeper coach, he was setting up a drill. \"I said to him, 'Okay, now show me how far you can throw.' I looked away and then saw this ball flying 20 metres over the halfway line,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I turned around and said to him, 'I told you to throw it not kick it.' He just smiled back at me and replied, 'But I did throw it.' I told him to show me again because I could not believe that someone had that much power in their body that they could throw the ball that far.\"",
      "Rudel rates Suzuki as \"above average\" with his feet but as has been seen with Ederson at Manchester City, the tactical significance of being able to pass short and long has increased. Suzuki ranked third for long passes in Serie A last season and second for throws.",
      "In Belgium, Rudel remembers some stunning saves away to Club Brugge, with one stop in particular becoming his trademark. \"It is those low saves because he is so dynamic and so quick to get down. He has unbelievable reflexes. For me, that is his biggest strength.\"",
      "There have been many examples of that for Parma. One down to his left to keep out Tijjani Reijnders' shot for AC Milan in the San Siro stands out, while the save away to Empoli against Ismael Konate was similar. Denying Como's Marc Kempf a headed goal was even better.",
      "The pick of the lot came against Roma in February when he produced an outrageous double save that defied belief. After keeping out Matias Soule's shot, he somehow scrambled to claw away Anass Salah-Eddine's follow-up. It was the save of the season.",
      "\"With those low power saves, his arms are so strong,\" says Rudel in reference to the technique behind it. \"Sometimes when goalkeepers go down fast and get their fingers to the ball, it still goes backwards. That never happens to him. He has crazy power in his hands.\"",
      "What makes Suzuki so fascinating is that he combines these reflex stops with a commanding presence. Think of the great goalkeepers and they tend to favour one or the other. But Suzuki does more than get down low to make saves, he gets high to snuff out the danger.",
      "He caught 55 crosses for Parma last season, 21 more than his nearest rival in Serie A. Across Europe's five major leagues, only Joan Garcia, snapped up by Barcelona this summer, claimed more crosses. Outside the area, Suzuki ranked second in Serie A for sweeping up.",
      "There are still things to work on, as one might expect of a goalkeeper who is still only 22 years old. He also dropped nine catches - a Serie A high - reflecting the fact that this desire to be proactive comes with risk. But he continues to progress, a theme of his short career.",
      "\"That is another of his strengths and why I am convinced that he can perform in the Premier League,\" says Rudel. \"He went from Japan to Belgium and then Belgium to Italy. Those are big adaptations but he did it really quickly. That is what separates the really good ones.\"",
      "Asked if Suzuki will go to the very top, Rudel has no doubts. \"One hundred per cent.\" The only question is how best to manage the journey. Some advise him to wait and play one more season with Parma. But sooner or later, Zion Suzuki will make a very big move.",
