      "Arsenal's failure to sign Ollie Watkins could come back to haunt them after Manchester United made contact with Aston Villa to discuss a move. Watkins, 29, has been added to the Red Devils' shortlist as manager Ruben Amorim looks to bring in new striker.",
      "United's list of options already includes Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres and Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike, both of whom have interest from elsewhere. The Red Devils are focussing on their attack in the summer transfer window, having spent £62.5million to sign Matheus Cunha last month and bidding up to £63m for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "To fund their business, Amorim would be willing to part ways with the likes of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho. United's talks to sign Watkins began through Rashford, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa.",
      "The Athletic report that ahead of Rashford's move to Villa Park, talks took place regarding a potential swap deal involving Watkins. Now contact has been made to explore the conditions of a separate deal after Villa - who remain at risk of breaching Premier League Profit and Sustainability Rules - confirmed that Rashford's loan wouldn't be made permanent.",
      "Had Arsenal been successful in their pursuit, though, Watkins wouldn't be on the market. The Gunners made a bid for the England international, who Villa were willing to let go while fellow striker Jhon Duran was still at the club.",
      "But Arsenal's £50m offer was rejected and Duran was the one to be sold, joining Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr. Speaking in April, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher revealed the reason why Watkins didn't sign for Arsenal.",
      "\"When we talk about Arsenal going for Ollie Watkins, someone told me that Aston Villa offered him to Arsenal,\" Carragher said on The Overlap podcast. \"I know that. I don't think it was Arsenal phoning Villa saying they want to sign him.",
      "\"Arsenal didn't sign him because they didn't offer a lot of money. They offered around £50m. However, this is the information I had. If I know that then I'm sure his agent knows that.",
      "\"Villa have spent a lot of money, and they need to get something back. In an ideal world, you probably would sell Ollie Watkins and keep Jhon Duran because he is the younger player - he is only 21.\"",
      "Arsenal are no longer focussed on Watkins, with Gyokeres and RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko emerging as their top striker targets. United could therefore have a free run at the 29-year-old, who Villa could demand less for amid their concerning financial predicament."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has made it crystal clear that he doesn't want to become a manager after retiring. Ronaldo, 40, will play for at least another two years after signing a lucrative contract extension with Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr which runs until 2027.",
      "The five-time Ballon d'Or winner will earn an obscene £488,000 per DAY, earning him an eye-watering £492million over the next couple of seasons. Al-Nassr gave him £24.5m just for renewing his contract after his existing deal was due to expire last month.",
      "Ronaldo is already the highest-paid athlete in the world, earning £206m annually. No wonder, then, the ex-Manchester United superstar plans to live like a 'king' after he hangs up his boots instead of going into management.",
      "After putting pen to paper on his new two-year deal, Ronaldo was asked if he plans to work on his coaching badges and his response was firm.",
      "\"I can tell that right now, I'm never going to be a coach,\" the Portugal captain proclaimed. \"Never is a strong work, but it's not in my plans in five years, 10, 20.\"",
      "Ronaldo evidently hasn't changed his tune from January 2016. Back then, the Real Madrid talisman told Spanish magazine Papel: \"There is another life after football. I think at first it will be tough, but if you ask me now if I want to coach, I would say no - neither as a club manager nor a president.",
      "\"You can say you have the best job, money, cars, houses... but that is not everything. One example: On Saturday, there's boxing on in Las Vegas and I would like to take my family and friends, but I can't because I have no time. But after (I retire) I want to live like a king.\"",
      "Fast forward to 2025 and Ronaldo's future plans are rooted in Saudi Arabia, declaring that he 'belongs' the gulf state. \"Projects and to be part of the growth of the country, to be on the side of the country, for sure I will be beside the country,\" he affirmed.",
      "\"Because I'm not coming only to play football, I'm playing for change of the country, a cultural country. I'm a part of that process. As I say, so many, many times, I belong to Saudi Arabia. I'm Portuguese, but I belong to Saudi Arabia.\""

      "After initially spending big under their Saudi ownership, PSR restrictions have meant three relatively quiet windows on the spin. But now finding themselves in a significantly stronger position in that regard, money is available - and Howe made it clear he wanted signings quickly.",
      "“Speed is key for us, which I’ve reiterated many times internally,” he said before the window opened. “Speed is key because we have to be dynamic, we have to be ready to conclude things very quickly, because good players don’t hang around for long.",
      "“That is what we will be trying, but the reality is it is not always in your hands. We will be doing our best to do things early.”",
      "And while the intent has been there for Newcastle, the execution has been lacking. As the calendar turns to July, the Toon are still waiting for their first arrival, although goalkeeper James Trafford is closing in on a move.",
      "It could have been a very different summer, however, had they landed some of the targets they had shortlisted.",
      "It often felt like a formality that the Wolverhampton Wanderers talisman would swap Molineux for Old Trafford. The Brazilian made it very clear he wanted to leave the Black Country, with the club equally willing to reciprocate.",
      "But according to reports back in April, it was Newcastle who also made him their top target. With the lure of European football it was hoped they would be at the front of the queue. But the forward instead signed for the Red Devils - labelling it a dream come true.",
      "A very similar story. And a story which appears almost certain to have the same ending.",
      "As with Cunha, Newcastle joined the queue for the services of the Brentford forward along with Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "It is understood Newcastle pulled the plug on a deal due to the Cameroon international’s wage demands. Nevertheless, it appears Mbeumo’s preference was always to head to Manchester.",
      "Despite being part of an Ipswich side that were relegated, Delap earned himself plenty of admirers after an impressive season at Portman Road. Howe was one of those, going public with his praise for the striker.",
      "“He's got big strengths, very strong, powerful runner. Certainly knows where the goal is. I think he's had a really good season. He's always had a lot of potential.”",
      "Delap held talks with a number of clubs, Newcastle amongst them, before ultimately deciding to join Chelsea in a £30m deal.",
      "Newcastle's latest transfer defeat, is set to chalk up another victory for Chelsea. The Brighton forward is now closing in on a move to Stamford Bridge with a medical imminent.",
      "But Newcastle made a big play for Pedro - only to see a £50m offer rebuffed by the Seagulls.",
      "Chelsea then upped their bid to £58m, getting the green light to pursue a move and to leave Howe facing even more misery.",
      "It’s not all bad news though…honestly. James Trafford is expected to sign for the Magpies. The deal for the goalkeeper is understood to be at a very advanced stage and a transfer in the region of £30m could be completed soon.",
      "Trafford was a priority target for Howe and Newcastle…that doesn’t always mean a deal can get done, however. But the Magpies boss will be hoping that Trafford’s arrival sees their luck change and more players can be secured before the start of next season.",

The 27-year-old climbed the ranks of the Red Devils youth academy between 2014 and 2016, even earning a nomination for Tuttosport's Golden Boy award alongside Marcus Rashford - despite being restricted to just three starts and four substitute appearances under Jose Mourinho in his debut season.",

Despite being nominated for the award, which is typically a good indicator of a promising future, Fosu-Mensah's career has largely failed to meet expectations.",

A knee ligament injury in April 2019 while on loan at Craven Cottage also kept him out for the better part of a year, further hampering opportunities to make an early impact in his career.",

      "His final outing for Leverkusen was an 11-minute cameo against RB Leipzig in April 2023, and he didn't feature at all during Leverkusen's title-winning 2023/24 season. Despite this, Fosu-Mensah is optimistic about reigniting his career in 2025/26 provided he finds the right club.",

I would say like 80 per cent of the agents who were approaching clubs and people I didn't even know, who I didn't even had contact with. I think that was a big mess.\"",

Elsewhere, Fosu-Mensah shared an enduring affection for Manchester United, saying that despite his career taking a different path from the north west.",
      "He added: \"I came there when I was 16, I left when I was 23. I've had many nice moments, won a couple of trophies, especially in my first season. We all know United, we all know the history of United, we all know what United stands for.\""

      "United have confirmed that Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen will all exit the club when their playing contracts run out on 30 June, although United have now confirmed that Evans has retired from playing and will become the Head of Loans and Pathways for the club's academy.",
      "The trio will depart Old Trafford as free agents and will be eligible to sign with a new club from Tuesday (1 July). Tom Heaton was also potentially leaving United this summer as his original contract was due to expire.",
      "However, earlier this month it was announced that the seasoned goalkeeper has inked a one-year extension to stay at United for another season.",
      "As part of their retained list, United also revealed that six academy stars would be exiting the club. Hubert Graczyk, Jack Kingdon, Sam Murray, Tom Myles, James Nolan and Tom Wooster will all leave when their contracts end by close of play on Monday.",
      "United have also announced that Ashton Missin has been offered a new contract to prolong his tenure at the club. If an agreement isn't reached, the young forward would depart once his existing contract expires.",

      "The Brazil international arrived from Wolves in a £62.5m deal, which is the amount United’s latest offer for Mbeumo came to when add-ons were included.",
      "But Brentford are understood to have rebuffed that approach, just like a previous offer worth up to £55m, and talks continue over a move that the player is understood to have expressed his desire to make.",
      "Spurs, now managed by Mbeumo’s ex-Bees boss Thomas Frank, are also interested in the Cameroon international. The forward’s contract at Brentford expires next summer, although there is an option to extend by a further year.",

      "While Matheus Cunha has already walked through Manchester United's doors, Bryan Mbeumo could soon follow – and supporters will be hoping to avoid a repeat of past failings in the transfer market.",
      "The Red Devils signed Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers for £62.5million at the start of June and are trying to wrap up a move for Mbeumo, despite recent interest from Tottenham Hotspur – now managed by his former boss Thomas Frank. Ruben Amorim is desperate for new recruits, after losing the Europa League final and finishing 15th in the Premier League.",
      "United are always busy in the transfer window, but their success record in recent years has not been strong.",
      "The likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Antony have each arrived for huge money, but have failed to hit the heights they did at their previous clubs. While many United fans will pick holes in various deals that have been made, they will be equally disappointed with the targets who have got away.",
      "In his final season at Tottenham Hotspur, Harry Kane overtook Jimmy Greaves to become Spurs' record goalscorer, before stating Alan Shearer's Premier League record was next in his sights. With Manchester City signing Erling Haaland, Liverpool buying Cody Gakpo at the time and Spurs generally being reluctant to sell star players to Chelsea and Arsenal, United looked to have a clear route to Kane.",
      "However, Benni McCarthy, who was part of Erik ten Hag's backroom team at Old Trafford at the time, revealed the club were put off by his nine-figure transfer fee.",
      "Speaking at Ladbrokes' launch of the Gaffer of all Accas, McCarthy said: \"Harry Kane was Erik's No.1 target. Erik really wanted him. Kolo Muani was also very high on that list. Victor Osimhen was also on that list. But I felt that if you're going to want to spend that kind of money – £100million-plus – then you want the complete package. And Harry Kane, for me, was the complete package.",
      "\"But unfortunately, the club didn't see it that way. They looked at it as Rasmus Hojlund in the long run would be a more prized asset than investing in both Rasmus and Harry Kane. So we stopped pursuing Kane and we ended up getting just Rasmus.\"",
      "Kane left for Bayern Munich that summer, having scored 213 Premier League goals – just 47 short of Shearer's record of 260.",
      "In 2015, Muller was heavily linked with a move to United, who were managed by Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman was one of Muller's first managers at Bayern Munich and a reunion was potentially on the cards.",
      "However, the German international was one of Bayern's most important players. Even a world record equalling £80m bid from United did not budge the Bundesliga heavyweight's resolve.",
      "Looking back on the rumours, Muller has previously said: \"Things were serious when Van Gaal came in [for me] in 2015, for all sides involved. I could imagine going to United then.",
      "\"But the club said, 'We want you to stay.’ I wasn’t out of contract, that’s why it was pretty clear-cut in the end.”",
      "Very briefly, Declan Rice was the most expensive transfer in Premier League history when he decided to join Arsenal in 2023. Before he moved to the Emirates Stadium, United were constantly linked with him.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously revealed that he and other officials at the Red Devils discussed a move for the ex-West Ham United captain.",
      "The Norwegian previously told The Stick to Football podcast: \"We discussed him a few times and I think we would have done well with him in midfield.",
      "\"I think he improved a lot on his playmaking as well. Obviously he would have cost some money, but we could have and should have gone for him.”",
      "United had inside-knowledge of Erling Haaland when the forward was still a little known teenager in Norway. That came courtesy of Solskjaer, who was managing Molde when Haaland was a barely known young prodigy.",
      "Before he even returned to Old Trafford, Solskjaer told his former side to snap him up as soon as possible. The ex-United boss said: \"I had him in Molde, for two seasons more or less. The summer before I got here [in Manchester], I rang the club and said, 'You’ve got to sign this boy. He’ll be absolutely top class.'",
      "\"That was June, July 2018, and they said, 'No.' Then I became caretaker manager and Molde had sold Haaland to RB Salzburg. I told the club, 'Buy him straightaway, before he plays,' because he didn't play for them for three or four months. 'Just sign him now because he's got a release clause.'",
      "\"We knew that then, and no-one else would’ve paid that money – €20m (£17.2m) it would’ve been a bargain. It was the club’s decision to not go for him then. We never made bids or went in for him, until after they realised, when he started scoring for Salzburg. By then Dortmund were there, Juventus were there, everyone was there.”",
      "After a disappointing first transfer window as United manager, David Moyes started looking towards the future, where he envisioned a starting eleven with Toni Kroos in the midfield. Moyes missed out on many top targets in his first summer, including the likes of Gareth Bale, Cesc Fabregas and Arturo Vidal, and had to settle with just Marouane Fellaini arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "In 2014, Moyes started a charm offensive with Kroos, that worked, as they agreed a verbal agreement for him to join. Kroos said: \"I knew that Manchester United wanted me and Moyes underlined that absolutely. It was a really nice afternoon with very nice people. We talked a lot about United’s footballing plan which convinced me. In the end, we agreed verbally. So it was close, I almost went to United.\"",
      "Unfortunately for Moyes, he would go on to be sacked before the end of his first campaign. His successor, Van Gaal, opted against signing Kroos and instead bought Ander Herrera to strengthen their midfield.",

While injury limited his game time during his debut campaign, the versatile centre midfielder has made 39 appearances this season and impressed for Dortmund at the Club World Cup, which could prompt a return to the Premier League.",

      "The club want to bring in a new No 9 after seeing Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee - two men who could leave the club - fail to live up to expectations. Kean has been identified as a possible signing following an impressive year with Fiorentina.",
      "He scored 19 goals and added three assists in 32 Serie A games last season as the Florence club secured a European place. They are hopeful of retaining Kean but the Italian has a release clause, but it is only active in the first two weeks of July, reports Corriere dello Sport.",
      "It means United are on the clock if they want to lock in his price. After that Fiorentina would be free to name their own figure, which would complicate negotiations.",
      "Old Trafford bosses have already seen how simple a transfer can be made by a release clause having activated the £62.5m fee that was in Matheus Cunha's Wolves contract. As a result they were able to quickly strike a deal with the Brazilian remaining their only summer recruit.",
      "Conversely Brentford have been able to dig their heels in when it comes to Bryan Mbeumo, who is also on their radar. The Bees have already rejected several bids for the Cameroon forward and United will have to pay more than they did for Cunha if they want to land him.",
      "An out and out striker is also on their radar, hence their interest in Kean. The forward previously endured a miserable time in England when he was on Everton's books. During his time with the Toffees he managed just four goals in 39 games between 2019 and 2022.",
      "He's since rebuilt his reputation with PSG and then back in Italy. His exploits have also attracted attention from Saudi side Al Qadsiah, but it remains unclear if he would be open to a move to the Middle East, whilst Amorim is yet to table a bid for a striker. He was keen on Liam Delap before he headed to Chelsea.",
      "One of Kean's lowest moments on English soil came at Old Trafford when then-interim Everton manager Duncan Ferguson substituted him just 18 minutes after bringing him on during a match against United that finished in a draw.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "The transfer window is set to hot up with Premier League clubs waiting for this week until they ramp up their recruitment, as they hold fire until the next year of accounts.",
      "We've just entered the new reporting year under the Premier League's financial rules and it means any deals can now be posted on the 2025/26 accounts, rather than those from 2024/25. Any clubs who were on the limit of this year's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) may have been holding fire on a number of transfers.",
      "The powers that be have already shown that breaching PSR rules can result in points deductions and some teams had been putting their business on pause to avoid adding any numbers to their 2024/25 balance sheet, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "But anything from Tuesday onwards will go against a new account, where clubs will have a lot more room for manoeuvre. As a result spending is likely to ramp up.",
      "This summer we have already seen the British-record transfer broken by Liverpool, who have spent close to £200million to land the likes of Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez. That said, the Reds hardly spent anything last summer so will have had the room to invest.",
      "Manchester United spent £62.5m to add Matheus Cunha but he is their only summer signing thus far despite their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo. They've had several offers for the Brentford man rejected but the deal is expected to get over the line.",
      "Manchester City have added three new faces with Rayan Cherki among them. Pep Guardiola is eyeing a rebuild and their summer recruitment will be aided by the millions they receive from the Club World Cup, where they have advanced to the knockout stages.",
      "Newcastle have been somewhat hampered by PSR in the past but this new accounting year could give them space to invest. They're going after Brighton's Joao Pedro whilst they have also expressed their interest in goalkeeper James Trafford and Nottingham Forest's Anthony Elanga.",

      "After watching some of their Premier League rivals strengthen in the early part of the summer, Manchester United are aiming to do the same. Liverpool have announced record signing Florian Wirtz and Manchester CIty made a number of early additions ahead of the Club World Cup, but it's been slower going for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "There was an early bit of business, with Matheus Cunha completing his permanent move from Wolves. United have also handed Tom Heaton a new contract, but the veteran goalkeeper won't be offended if we say fans will likely hope that's not the last announcement of the summer.",
      "One thing which won't be happening this year is an Old Trafford return for Paul Pogba. The French midfielder had been touted for a third spell during his time as a free agent, but has instead opted for a move to Monaco.",
      "Head coach Amorim is looking to freshen up in a number of areas as he aims to build a squad capable of playing to his tactical preferences. Bryan Mbeumo is a major attacking target, while further investment could hinge on an ability to offload some out-of-favour high earners.",
      "Timothy Fosu-Mensah broke into Manchester United's first team at the same time as Marcus Rashford, and believes the forward needs to ensure he can find a club where he feels good. The Dutch defender made his Premier League bow on the same day as Rashford, and was speaking as he continues his own search for a new club after leaving Bayer Leverkusen in 2024.",
      "“I just want him to be happy. Everybody just wants him to be happy,\" Fosu-Mensah told The Independent. \"The most important things is for him to feel good, for him to feel happy. Look, the quality is definitely there. Nobody needs to say anything about this quality, because he’s a top player.”",
      "Rashford looked to be enjoying his football during a loan spell at Aston Villa last term, earning an England recall. However, he left at the end of the season after Villa missed out on Champions League qualification.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Joshua Zirkzee both appeared to green-light a move for Bryan Mbeumo with their social media activity. The pair 'liked' a report indicating United are poised to continue talks over a move for the Brentford star.",
      "Cameroon international Mbeumo has been eyed by both United and Tottenham. The latter are managed by former Brentford boss Thomas Frank, and can offer Champions League football, but those might not end up being deciding factors.",
      "Mbeumo has a year left on his current deal in West London, and Brentford hold an option to extend it until 2027. He is due back in pre-season training if no agreement can be reached before then, but exit talk persists.",
      "Manchester United are ready to sanction a loan exit for Andre Onana, according to The Sun. The former Inter Milan star has had ups and downs since moving to Old Trafford in 2023, and a difficult second half of the 2024-25 season has led to increased chatter around an exit.",
      "Monaco are said to be among the interested parties, though their financial situation has prompted some doubt over a permanent switch. Philipp Kohn and Radoslaw Majecki shared goalkeeping duties at the Ligue 1 club last term as they finished third and qualified for the Champions League",
      "Emi Martinez remains an option to replace Onana if United do move for an alternative. If they are to pursue a cheaper alternative, Botafogo keeper John is said to be an option.",

      "United are priced at 30/1 to win the Premier League in 2025/2026. The bookmakers should probably have United priced at 60/1 to win the title because a Leicester-esque miracle would be required for the Reds to clinch league glory, but that doesn't mean they won't have a much-improved campaign.",

      "The players are currently enjoying the final week of their holidays and Amorim will welcome his squad back to Carrington on Monday morning, where routine fitness tests will take place.",
      "Club staff will gauge where the players' bodies are. The likes of Leny Yoro and Kobbie Mainoo have trained together during their time off and should be marginally ahead of the curve when they report to Carrington.",
      "The majority of players nowadays continue to train during their time off and building strong fitness levels this summer will be crucial ahead of a make-or-break season at Old Trafford.",
      "United must qualify for European football this term and salvage some dignity by finishing high in the Premier League, and Amorim will hope for further signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "Matheus Cunha was the first signing through the door this summer and all eyes will be on the Brazilian when he enters Carrington on Monday, so check the club's social channels for imagery.",
      "Cunha should be a tremendous addition and that statement can be copied and pasted about Bryan Mbeumo, who wants to move to Manchester and has been the subject of two bids from United.",
      "United would like to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo as soon as possible so he can report for the beginning of pre-season at Carrington, but that would require a breakthrough this week.",
      "The pre-season schedule begins with a trip to Stockholm, Sweden, to face newly promoted Leeds on July 19, and United will hope Mbeumo is at least onboard for that opening friendly.",
      "Amorim's side will then travel to the United States, where they will play West Ham, Bournemouth and West Ham in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "The Leeds game will be an opportunity for a large number of academy players to impress, and then a handful will be taken to the USA to supplement the first-team squad for the friendlies.",
      "It will also be fascinating to see when Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford will report to Carrington. Aston Villa have not triggered their option to sign Rashford for £40million and Garnacho fell out with Amorim at the end of last season.",
      "However, Garnacho and Rashford are still paid wages by United and will be expected to train at Carrington until sales can be arranged, although that doesn't mean they will travel on tour.",
      "United will end their pre-season tour against Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9, which will see David de Gea return for the first time since leaving upon the expiry of his contract in 2023."

      "The 17-year-old signed his first professional contract when he celebrated his birthday in April. Only the most talented young players are given pro deals at the earliest possible date and Ibragimov has first-team potential.",

      "\"I’ve played the game myself and I know being great at that age is good and it’s something to be proud of, however, if the end goal is reaching the first team, you have to keep yourself humble and working. I think he can get there.",
      "\"Hard work beats talent and he’s got both. He can be guided to become even more successful and we’re one big family. He was shy at first, but if he knows you, you’ll see the real Amir. He was going to be a little reserved, to begin with.\"",
      "In April 2023, the MEN reported that Ibragimov had trained with the first-team at 15 years old, which was highly unusual for a player of his age and a clear indicator of his huge potential.",
      "Ibragimov is expected to predominantly play for the U21s in the new season and his next challenge will be attempting to make a first-team debut."

      "“My biggest and most heartfelt thanks must go to the fans who have supported me during every step of the journey. It’s been an honour to be on the pitch and feel your passion home and away; I will be eternally grateful for every ounce of support.",
      "“I am looking forward to working with the next generation of talented players to support them to reach their potential. Having had experience of loans myself, I know the crucial role that they can play within a player’s development. I am excited to help further develop the pathway to our first team and continue the legacy of young players thriving at Manchester United.”",
      "Man United have secured the future of exciting youngster Jayden Ngwashi.",
      "Academy staff discussed a pathway to the first-team with Ngwashi and his family during discussions. Ngwashi's passing ability is exceptional and he's a ball-playing defender who is a huge asset to build-up play. His stature is impressive and he is considered a potential future star.",
      "Jonny Evans will stay at Manchester United and work as head of loans and pathways at the club, it has been confirmed.",
      "The former defender will lead on loans for United's young players and work to 'further enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first team.'",
      "Napoli will reportedly invite Victor Osimhen for medical tests ahead of pre-season in July despite Man United continuing to be linked with the striker.",
      "Osimhen has had an uncertain future in Italy since last summer when the forward was initially pushing for a move away from the Serie A club. Unfortunately for both parties, a combination of less than lucrative offers saw the Nigerian remain in Naples beyond the transfer window deadline.",
      "However, Osimhen rejected this deal and, with July around the corner, he is no closer to securing an exit. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Serie A champions will invite the 26-year-old to a medical on either July 14 or 15 ahead of pre-season.",
      "It is not yet clear if Osimhen will accept this invitation but it is seen as being in both parties' interests for him to attend. After that, the goal is believed to remain the same - find a suitor for the striker. The report claims that Galatasaray are willing to do 'crazy' things to ensure Osimhen returns permanently.",
      "Meanwhile, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Al Hilal will return to make another bid but, at present, the forward is still no closer to making a transfer.",
      "Following Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas' recent comments on Viktor Gyokeres, Portuguese outlet Record have claimed that the striker is furious with the situation.",
      "The newspaper has claimed that Gyokeres and Varandas exchanged messages, in which Gyokeres set out three ideas to the Sporting president, including the president 'leaves him no other alternative than to come forward to clarify the controversy surrounding his departure, with his respective points of view on what is at stake'.",
      "Gyokeres has also told Varandas he will not travel to Lisbon on July 6 or after for training and that he is 'tired' of the Sporting president speaking to the media 'intending to divert the focus from a solution'.",
      "Dutch international defender Tyrell Malacia will return to Manchester United next month after PSV confirmed they would not be making his loan move permanent.",
      "Malacia spent the second half of last season on loan in Eindhoven and made 12 appearances as they won the Eredivisie title.",
      "‌But the 25-year-old did not do enough to convince PSV to make the loan deal permanent and they have now confirmed he will return to United on July 1.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Darren Fletcher is in talks to become the clubs new U18s manager.",
      "Fletcher is being discussed as an option after it was revealed in May that the youngsters' previous coach Adam Lawrence was leaving.",
      "The ex-midfielder is currently a first-team coach for the Reds and now his sons Jack and Tyler have progressed beyond U18s, he is believed to be open to taking on the role.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "According to Caught Offside's Christian Falk, United remain the only club to have contacted Eintracht Frankfurt over the possibility of signing Hugo Ekitike this summer.",
      "However, this could soon change should Liverpool manage to sell Darwin Nunez.",
      "If the Uruguayan was to leave, Falk suggests Arne Slot's men will be in a better position to negotiate with the Bundesliga club.",
      "According to Caught Offside, there is a growing belief that Gyokeres will be leaving Sporting this summer despite the drama surrounding his future.",
      "It is understood that United, along with Arsenal, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Barcelona and PSG are all being informed of the current situation surrounding the striker.",
      "While Sporting are attempting to fight for a good deal, it is felt there is a consensus that he will eventually depart.",
      "United are continuing their talks with Brentford over the signing of Bryan Mbeumo after a second bid was rejected.",
      "MEN Sport understands that the second bid was in excess of £60m but this still fell short of the Bees' valuation.",
      "Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to sign for United and the Reds are working hard to make that happen.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "If things could not have got any more difficult between Gyokeres and Sporting, their president has come out and tried to justify his valuation of the striker by attacking United's business.",
      "Frederico Varandas explained, as quoted by The Mirror:",
      "We have been watching the market and I saw [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, leave for €65million (£55.5m). I saw Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both forwards but who, in my opinion, do not have Viktor's market value or quality, being negotiated for around €75million (£64m). Given the demands we consider fair, I believe Viktor could leave – unless he has the worst agent in the world, which is hard for me to believe, because he is one of the best footballers in the world.",
      "Speaking during the last England camp where Toney was recalled for the first time since his move to Al Ahli, the former Brentford striker insisted that he was never worried about receiving a call-up back to the national team ahead of the World Cup.",
      "You see with me I think if you're just doing the right thing, playing football, playing well and scoring goals - a striker's job, that's what you're in a team to do - it doesn't matter where you play in the world, I feel like you should still get the chance. I think it's been proven me being me being back here and being back amongst the boys. It feels good to see the faces again and it feels good to get stuck in."

      "And United fans will remember Kean's time at Everton where he struggled to find the back of the net. Kean was much younger then but it is a risk to sign a player who has already failed to impress in the Premier League",
      "If £44million guarantees goals then the move is a no-brainer. But if he struggles to make the adaptation to English football for a second time then United will be back to square one.",

No fan will ever be able to forget the Antony saga back in 2022. United refused to meet Ajax's valuation of the Brazilian, before returning to the table on deadline day and paying more than the Eredivisie outfit had demanded earlier in the window.",

      "The club are still in talks with Brentford over Bryan Mbeumo having seen a second bid rejected last week. A third bid could soon be submitted, but it's imperative United show they're no pushovers.",
      "It must be added that the pursuit of Mbeumo is far more logical than the decisions to spend big on Antony and Hojlund. Neither Antony nor Hojlund were proven in the Premier League and splashing such vast amounts of cash on two young players who had never experienced English football was a disaster waiting to happen. Mbeumo has Premier League experience and his 20-goal haul in the league last season goes to show he is as close to a risk-free transfer as it's possible for a club of United's stature to find.",
      "But that doesn't mean they should simply roll over and give Brentford anything they ask for.",
      "United will have set themselves a limit when it comes to how much they are prepared to pay for Mbeumo, and as long as they're within that limit then they're absolutely right to continue talks with Brentford.",
      "If talks continue to drag on with no clear sign of a breakthrough then United need to walk away.",
      "It might pain them to move on from a player who would so obviously improve the squad, but if United want the 'United tax' to be a thing of the past then it might be for the best in the long run."

      "The future of striker Viktor Gyokeres has become a hot topic filled with drama recently, as rumours persist about a possible move to Manchester United.",
      "The 27-year-old forward has been associated with a transfer to the Premier League for some time, with hopes that he would attain his dream move. However, such hopes are diminishing.",
      "Last Sunday, during Sporting's General Assembly at Estadio Jose Alvalade, queries regarding Gyokeres' future became a focal point. \"Sporting is very calm about Gyokeres, Sporting does not need to sell Gyokeres,\" Varandas proclaimed.",
      "\"We have already passed the stage where we had to sell our best assets. We do not have to sell him. In the same way that we do not have to sell him, we are still sensitive to Viktor's dreams. Sporting has a commitment, made by the president, not to ask for the value of the termination clause and to be reasonable in relation to Viktor's performance last season. If you ask me today, there is a strong possibility that Viktor will leave.",
      "\"We have been keeping an eye on the market, I saw a player like [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go to Arsenal for €65million (£55m). I saw two players being sold in the Premier League - Matheus Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo - forwards who do not have the quality of Viktor, in my opinion, were sold for around €70m. We are talking about players who are 26 years old. So, given the demands we are making in relation to Viktor's value, I believe he could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world. Which I find hard to believe. I won't say what the price we asked for. It was communicated to the agent.",
      "Varandas continued: \"But I can guarantee that Viktor will not leave for €60million plus €10million. Viktor already knows and I want Sporting fans to take advantage of this summer, in which they are two-time champions, in which they have a double, to celebrate, to be calm. There are only two scenarios: one club respects the price requested by Sporting and Viktor will fulfil his dream, and from that moment we will be ready to attack the targets, or that club does not want Viktor, and Viktor, with a three-year contract, stays at Sporting and we will be very happy.\"",
      "However, these remarks reportedly haven't sat well with Viktor himself, with Portuguese newspaper Record covering the latest developments in the saga.",
      "The newspaper underscores that Varandas' comments about the transfer process have deeply upset the Swedish striker, who, it is claimed, 'directly confronted' the Lions' president.",
      "During their message exchange, Gyokeres is said to have communicated three main points. The striker reportedly feels that Varandas has 'left him no alternative' but to publicly clarify the situation.",
      "Record understands that Gyokeres informed Varandas he will speak to the media as he allegedly believes this is the appropriate time to do so.",
      "The second point Gyokeres is said to have raised in his message exchange with Varandas was the issue of returning to Sporting.",
      "As reported by Record, he has no intention of reporting back for pre-season and in one of his messages sent on Sunday afternoon, he firmly informed the president that he will not return to the club.",
      "Specifically, he is believed to have stated he will not travel to Lisbon on July 6 or report for training the following day, as originally scheduled.",
      "Finally, the third message Gyokeres reportedly shared with the Sporting president after hearing his earlier remarks was that he is 'tired' - a term a source close to the player used when speaking to Record.",
      "It was understood that the reported 'gentleman's agreement' in place to allow Gyokeres to leave for £60million isn't valid with Sporting holding out for around his £84m release clause.",
      "Earlier in the month, Sporting Clube de Portugal's president Varandas refuted suggestions of a €60m (£51m) plus €10m (£8m) in add-ons departure this summer. \"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for €60+€10m (in add-ons) because I never promised him that,\" he stated.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United have been admirers of Gyokeres since Ruben Amorim's arrival at M16 last November.",
      "Reports this week have claimed that Gyokeres has made a U-turn on United after previously preferring a move to the Emirates Stadium. Now, with the new financial year approaching on July 1, Gyokeres' move could finally be about to materialise."

      "Manchester United will be unable to replace Andre Onana with OGC Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka this summer due to an agreement with UEFA.",
      "United are understood to be in the market for a new number one this summer after Onana's second year at the club ended with serious doubts over his position. Ruben Amorim is said to want a new goalkeeper that fits his system but the position isn't one of priority for the Reds at the moment.",
      "Onana is keen to remain at United and turn things around but the Cameroon international is running out of time to convince senior figures inside the club that he should be the first choice. Reports over the weekend claimed that the possibility of a loan move was now being considered by United to clear the path for a new goalkeeper to be signed.",
      "Emiliano Martinez and Diogo Costa have both been tentatively linked with moves to Old Trafford but Nice's Marcin Bulka has emerged as another candidate to replace Onana. CaughtOffside have reported that sources have stated that United have been keeping a close eye on the Poland international.",
      "Bulka, who has been linked with a return to Chelsea, produced a number of fine performances in France last season and is expected to leave this window. However, he won't be going to United.",
      "Last summer, United and Nice, both owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos, were banned from signing players from each other as part of their negotiations with UEFA. The two teams were forced to seek clarity from the governing body 12 months ago when they both qualified for the 2024/25 Europa League.",
      "As part of the agreement, United were allowed to play in the European competition alongside their sister club but had to agree not to 'transfer players to each other' until September 2025. A statement from UEFA read: \"Furthermore, as additional evidence of their independence, the concerned clubs committed to the following.",
      "\"The clubs will not transfer players to each other, whether Post permanently or on loan, directly or indirectly, from July 2024 to September 2025, with the exception of pre-existing transfer agreements that had been entered into before the opening of the CFCB proceedings;",
      "\"The clubs will not conclude any kind of cooperation, joint technical or commercial agreements between each other; and the clubs will not use any joint scouting or player database.\"",
      "United previously had been keen on Jean-Clair Todibo but the defender joined West Ham. Ratcliffe revealed in an interview with Bloomberg that United had been blocked from signing a player, suspected to be the French centre-back.",
      "Bulka is reportedly also being lined-up for a move to Saudi Arabia side Neom SC. The Saudi Pro League newly-promoted side have already signed Alexandre Lacazette and are reportedly in pole position to sign Bulka."

      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane appears set to be on our screens for the foreseeable future after Gary Neville confirmed his old teammate has signed a new contract.",
      "Keane, along with Neville, Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and others, has cut out an impressive career in broadcasting after leaving Old Trafford. The Irishman has been a particularly popular figure on our screens thanks to his iconic rants and rapport with fellow pundits including Ian Wright.",
      "However, there was some concern that Keane may soon decide to call it a day after comments on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, in August 2024 that he was setting his sights on retirement. \"I love football, but the hassle of matches, getting to games, and the hassle of fans – I was in court a few months ago with somebody head-butting me – do you think I enjoy that side of it? Absolutely not,\" he explained.",
      "\"The games are fine. Getting to the games, parking up, people shouting your name – good stuff, bad stuff – it's a nuisance. Being a pundit in 10 years, not [going to happen].\"",
      "Despite setting his departure timeline for some point in the next decade and already having one eye on life away from the spotlight, Keane will not be retiring in the next two years it seems. This is after Neville confirmed on a behind the scenes episode of the Stick to Football podcast that the former midfielder had signed a new two-year deal to stay on Stick to Football with the rest of the team.",
      "\"The exciting thing about today is we've just, in the last week, agreed with Roy, Jill, Carra and Wrighty for another two years,\" Neville explained in the latest episode. \"Whether you like it or not, you're going to get another two years of Stick to Football.",
      "\"I think if one of them left, I think I'd close it like you know. Obviously sometimes, you know, Carra's not there because of the Champions League, but I do feel like, you know, you lose something when one of the group isn't there.\"",
      "Stick to Football continues to be popular among audiences with 1.47m subscribers amassed on YouTube to date. The podcast is expected to return in July as the team begin to gear up for the return of domestic football and the culmination of the Club World Cup and Euro 2025."

      "As temperatures soar across Greater Manchester, Manchester United's current squad are preparing to return from all corners of the globe for pre-season.",
      "Tuesday marks the start of July and a month which brings plenty of excitement for supporters. Due to the Premier League season beginning in mid-August, United will play their first pre-season fixture against Leeds in Stockholm on July 19.",
      "Before they step out onto the pitch in Sweden in just over two weeks' time, United will be hopeful of completing some important business. Fortunately, the beginning of July also means that free agents will leave their current clubs and will be available to make moves elsewhere.",
      "One of those set to see their current contract expire on July 1 is Jonathan David. The Canada international has already confirmed that he will be leaving Lille for a new challenge this summer and at 25, he will be seen as a viable option for many clubs.",
      "United have been linked with David previously and his 25 goals this season, including seven in ten during the Champions League, will appeal to the Reds. His next club is not currently confirmed although Juventus are thought to be pushing hard for his signature.",
      "Over the weekend, reports in Italy suggested that David's agents were pushing for £13m in the deal which is thought to be difficult for the Turin club to sanction. So, with that uncertainty ever-present, United could look to jump in and snap up a talent who is worth a gamble.",
      "The other problem which is perhaps not a priority right now, but could soon become one, is in left wing-back. Patrick Dorgu was signed in January and has done well considering the difficult circumstances he found the club in.",
      "However, there is a lack of support around him to enjoy greater squad depth. Question marks still remain surrounding Luke Shaw's fitness but, even at 100 per cent, it is unclear whether he fits that role perfectly.",
      "Therefore, a good addition could be Crystal Palace's Tyrick Mitchell. The full-back was considered an option for United in January and on a free, he would be an even better addition.",
      "He will be a free agent on Tuesday too unless something changes. Unusually, there has been little talk surrounding his future online albeit there is a push from Fenerbahce fans for their team to snap him up.",
      "That being said, even the lure of working under Jose Mourinho would not be enough to stop United signing the 25-year-old if they want him. With money tight and players needing to be sold, concluding deals for the likes of David and Mitchell could ease tensions for United fans with the pre-season schedule looming large."

      "The new 2025/26 Premier League season kicks-off in just over a month's time and by the time Manchester United face Arsenal, Ruben Amorim's team could look incredibly different.",
      "United were handed a tough start to the new campaign with title challengers Arsenal visiting Old Trafford on Sunday August 17. Improving on last year's 15th-place finish is a matter of urgency for everyone connected at United and Amorim has already been handed the tools to do.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already been signed from Wolves for £62.5million and Bryan Mbeumo is expected to follow him through the door at Carrington for slightly more. It's understood that more players are likely to be signed before the transfer window closes, although there is a desperate need to sell players.",
      "Excitement is building around how United will line-up against the Gunners in August. Here, MEN Sport has taken a look at how the Reds could line up to take on Mikel Arteta's men in a best-case scenario.",
      "Goalkeeper - Lucas Chevalier",
      "Previously, there was an expectation that Andre Onana would leave United unless something drastically happened. That drastic trigger may have finally landed with reports stating United are open to loaning him out to make room for a new goalkeeper.",
      "Emiliano Martinez and Diogo Costa have both been mentioned but Lille's Lucas Chevalier is available and a financial option. Aston Villa have been tipped to make a move but United could improve their goalkeeper with the £40m arrival.",
      "Defenders - Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Despite having their critics, United have worked a fine line in their recruitment of defenders. Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro came in last year and when fit, slot perfectly into Amorim's back three.",
      "Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are all competent options to fill the final slot but the move to place natural full-back Noussair Mazraoui at right centre-back has worked perfectly.",
      "Wing-backs - Amad, Diogo Dalot",
      "United are also well-stocked in wing-back. While there's the option to play Mazraoui at right wing-back, that place falls to Amad. The signings of Mbuemo and Cunha make it difficult for him to demand a place in attacking midfield and the Ivory Coast international is capable of playing as an attacking wing-back.",
      "On the left, Patrick Dorgu has six months of English football under his belt and Diogo Dalot's is relied heavily on by Amorim. It would be a fight between those two to start.",
      "Midfielders - Bruno Fernandes, Felix Nmecha",
      "Fernandes starts every game he is available for, there's no doubt about that. The United captain will take up a deeper No.8 role next season with a constant eye of being a creative threat behind the front three.",
      "Alongside him, we've gone for a new signing in Felix Nmecha. The Borussia Dortmund ace is a midfield powerhouse who has dominated Bundesliga midfields and has been linked with United.",
      "His arrival would spell the end of one of Casemiro or Kobbie Mainoo, with Manuel Ugarte the solution from Amorim's squad if needed.",
      "Attacking midfielders - Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha",
      "No doubter, perhaps the most obvious selections here. Mbeumo takes up his slot on the right with his traditional cut in and shoot trademark set to excite United fans.",
      "Cunha is perfect to play behind the striker and having signed so early in the window, he'll have enough to understand the tactic and form partnerships with his teammates. Them two alone bring 35 Premier League goals.",
      "Striker - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "Talking about goals, not many players can boast a record in front of goal like Gyokeres. Since moving to Sporting CP, the striker has scored 97 times in 102 appearances. Them numbers are sensational, even if you don't like the fact that it's in the Portugal top-flight, you can't not want that at Old Trafford.",
      "Gyokeres is still at Sporting and the more it goes on, the more confidence United will be of landing him."

      "Manchester United's transfer plan between the start of July and August has been clear for some time. After signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves, the intention has been to sign Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United confirmed the arrival of Cunha on June 12 after they triggered his £62.5million release clause. Immediately after, news broke of the Reds' ambition to swiftly add Mbeumo to Ruben Amorim's squad. As we enter July, a deal is still in the works.",
      "Two bids have been rejected by Brentford, the latest worth up to £62.5m. The Bees are understood to want that fee up front and more in add-ons for their talisman, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season.",
      "United are continuing talks over a potential deal and would like to wrap it up as soon as possible so he can report for the beginning of pre-season.",
      "At Old Trafford, the plan is to get Mbeumo over the line, sell players and then go all out for a new striker. Alongside the saga involving Mbeumo, United have been linked with a handful of No.9s with it widely reported that Viktor Gyokeres is a key target. However, issues with Sporting CP and the striker's price tag have delayed that move.",
      "It has left United's aim to give Amorim a new centre-forward in limbo with pre-season starting next week. Alternatives continue to be drawn up with names like Moise Kean, Mehdi Taremi and Dusan Vlahovic all reportedly on their radar.",
      "This week, a new name has entered the fray in Ivan Toney. Spanish outlet Fichajes has reported that United made contact with Saudi Pro League side Al-Ahli and Toney's representatives regarding the possibility of a return to England.",
      "Toney left the Premier League last summer for Saudi and scored 30 goals to help Al-Ahli win the AFC Champions League. Brentford received around £40m for the England international but the report in Spain has claimed a figure close to £30m could be enough to bring him to Manchester.",
      "In three seasons in the Premier League, Toney scored 36 goals, including a 20-goal campaign in 2022/23. At 29, the former Brentford star is in his peak and his arrival at United could be perfect news for Mbeumo.",
      "The pair worked brilliantly together at Brentford across 119 games. After the Bees came close to promotion in 2020, Mbeumo and Toney played huge roles in their rise to the Premier League a year later with 63 goal contributions. In the top-flight, Toney scored 12 goals and assisted five while Mbeumo scored four and assisted a further seven.",
      "Toney's value sky-rocketed in the 2022/23 season with 20 league goals with Mbeumo improving on both goalscoring fronts with nine goals and eight assists. The 2023/24 campaign was hampered by Toney's eight-month ban for betting offences yet the duo still produced 22 goal contributions in the Premier League.",
      "The statistics show that the duo have been directly involved in 16 goals (Mbeumo assisting Toney or vice versa). United supporters will remember the 4-0 drubbing at the Gtech Community Stadium in August 2022 and it was Toney providing for Mbeumo to score Brentford's fourth in the 35th minute.",
      "Altogether, the pair created 187 goals across their time at Brentford and were both, alongside Yoanne Wissa, the club's two best players. Toney moving to United may seem like a transfer little sense around it but it could be the perfect signing gift for Mbeumo.",
      "The Cameroonian international is set to come to United with an unknown sense of reality. He will come with pressure and will have to work with either Rasmus Hojlund or a premium centre-forward with no relationship formed. Signing Toney to line-up alongside Mbeumo and Cunha in Amorim's attack, United will have a forward line packed with Premier League goals and experience."

      "Barcelona have signed goalkeeper Joan Garcia for £21m and are on the verge of sealing a deal for Athletic Club’s Nico Williams for £50m. Like a man in debt patting his pockets, they don’t have the money on them, and are making those signings in the desperate hope that they can later balance the books by selling some ‘sacrifices’.",
      "They’re not exactly hard up for talented footballers, which means there are some quality players reportedly up for grabs.",
      "It’s been claimed by various outlets – both dependable and otherwise – that Barcelona are willing to listen to offers for these eight surplus stars, whom we’ve reassigned to Premier League suitors ahead of next season.",
      "",
      "Marc-Andre ter Stegen – Manchester United\nThe 33-year-old has been told to find a new club as Wojciech Szczesny showed during Ter Stegen’s injury absence last season that he can quite capably be the back-up to new goalkeeper Garcia, and Barcelona reportedly believe they can break even by selling the German for around £21m.",
      "That feels more than a tad optimistic given Ter Stegen’s age and a Transfermarkt value of €12m [£10.2m] and surely rules out a move to Chelsea, who baulked at AC Milan’s £20m asking price for Mike Maignan, who’s significantly younger (29) and arguably better, albeit with just one year left to run on his current deal compared to Ter Stegen’s three.",
      "But Barcelona need not search for a transfer patsy as Manchester United are also keen on Ter Stegen as an upgrade on Onana. Having already overpaid for Matheus Cunha and looking as though they will do again to sign Bryan Mbeumo, United could well be Barcelona’s knight in gold-encrusted armour.",
      "MAILBOX: Is Bryan Mbeumo ‘worth’ £63m? Well he is to Brentford…",
      "",
      "Andreas Christensen – Newcastle\nThe 29-year-old has supposedly told his close circle that “next season I’m going to play for FC Barcelona”, as though he’s Eden Hazard breaking social media by announcing his move to Chelsea from Lille in 2012, but reports suggest the Catalan bean counters would much rather he wasn’t going to play for Barcelona next season.",
      "We’re very much here for a footballer digging their heels in and refusing to leave while under contract, and we totally get the desire to stay in Barcelona even without any sort of guarantee of game time, but we also think footballers should be playing football and we can see Christensen playing a pretty significant role at Newcastle as Fabian Schar turns 34 in December.",
      "Eddie Howe was keen on signing Christensen in January and with Champions League football back at St James’ Park next term, a guy with 45 appearances in Europe’s showcase competition who played a key role in Chelsea winning it in 2021 is surely worth more to Newcastle than what they would have to pay – around £15m.",

      "Ronald Araujo – Manchester United\nAraujo’s release clause take an ever-so-slight dip between July 1 and July 15 from €1bn [£860m] to €70m [£60m]. Why? It’s claimed the Barcelona bosses see this window ‘as an opportunity to either keep a motivated Araujo fit and ready for the season or receive a substantial transfer fee that would help balance the wage bill and fund other squad signings’.",
      "We strongly suspect they would much rather the latter as that’s an absurdly risky motivational tool for a player you want to keep at your football club.",
      "The club captain missed a good chunk of last season through injuries but only played about half the games after returning to fitness thanks to the ascension of teenager Pau Cubarsi.",
      "Araujo wants to stay (spoiler: they all do) but Bayern have made noises over a move and so too have United amid reports that Barcelona may actually accept offers of £38m, which makes more sense for a good but not great centre-back.",

      "Marc Casado – Arsenal\nWe’re guessing Brentford’s Christian Norgaard wasn’t on too many Gooners’ transfer wish lists this summer, though the wholly predictable He’s Actually Very Underrated chatter has arrived in force. We don’t necessarily disagree, and as a back-up? Fine.",
      "But he’s not about to provide too many midfield headaches for Mikel Arteta and knowing without doubt which three players will start in midfield for Arsenal at the start of next season isn’t necessarily a good thing.",
      "That would also be the case if their slightly dubious interest in Casado becomes more concrete and they land the 21-year-old, but at least he could usurp Martin Zubimendi in that defensive midfield role in time, whereas that’s just not going to happen for Norgaard unless Zubimendi is laughably unsuited to the Premier League.",
      "Casado enjoyed a breakout season for Barcelona in 2024/2025 but faces a rather more difficult fight for game time next term following Marc Bernal’s return from injury to compete with Frenkie de Jong for a starting spot alongside Pedri, and Barcelona are reportedly open to cashing in on their academy graduate.",
      "",
      "Fermin Lopez – Manchester City\nA report claiming that Barcelona, while not actively pushing Fermin out, are open to his sale ‘if a great offer arrives’ cites Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United as the Premier League clubs interested. We have absolutely no idea why as we can’t see how he fits into any of them.",
      "Playing ahead of Cole Palmer or Florian Wirtz? Not going to happen. And Ruben Amorim already has one square peg in a round hole in Bruno Fernandes; he doesn’t need another one. But we could see him at City.",
      "Pep Guardiola responded to Rayan Cherki’s frankly awful debut for Manchester City at the Club World Cup by revealing “the club decided” to sign him, and although he caveated that shirking of responsibility by claiming “I am really pleased he’s here”, the City boss could be placated by a signing for him in Fermin – who was thought to be near the top of his list to replace Kevin De Bruyne – after Cherki was one for them.",
      "",
      "Ferran Torres – Aston Villa\nTorres got 19 goals and seven assists in comfortably his best season for Barcelona in 2024/2025, scoring those goals at an impressive rate of one every 101 minutes.",
      "It can’t feel great then to have a €50m [£43m] price tag slapped on your head as Barcelona welcome all-comers to take you off their hands and for Aston Villa to then baulk at that price tag and walk away from negotiations that you’re not privy to and have no interest in as you don’t want to join them anyway.",
      "We imagine Unai Emery’s a very hard man to say no to though. All we need is for the pair to be in a confined space for an hour and for Barcelona to drop that asking price by £10m or so for the deal to go through.",
      "",
      "Pau Victor – Everton\nTorres’ self esteem hasn’t taken the same battering as that of Victor, who’s reportedly had his €20m [£17m] asking price slashed to €5m [£4.2m] by Barcelona to ensure they can find a buyer for him. Predictably, as many as eight La Liga clubs have reportedly approached them over a move for the 23-year-old at that price.",
      "We’ve gone with Everton for no reason other than them needing a striker after Dominic Calvert-Lewin dropped the very quiet bombshell that he’s leaving this summer,",
      "",
      "Robert Lewandowski – Liverpool\n“There’s no difference between a few years ago and now in terms of my stats,” Lewandowski said in March, insisting “I want to play at the top level for a few more years” amid reports Barcelona may be in the market for a younger model.",
      "They’re not – they can’t afford one – but they’re also not in a position to turn down decent offers for a 36-year-old, and we’re pretty convinced he would score a bundle for Liverpool, because Lewandowski’s right, he’s not all that different a player to what we saw from him in his prime on the back of 42 goals in 52 games last term.",
      "With Mohamed Salah, Florian Wirtz and whichever other forwards Arne Slot opts to play alongside his central striker, all he really needs is someone to put the ball in the back of the net.",
      "Barcelona ‘would study offers’ for a top Man Utd target this summer, opening the door to an astonishing triple swoop for the Red Devils.",

      "Matheus Cunha should be used to overpriced accusations, but having the finger of blame pointed by Newcastle and Sporting should help Manchester United.",
      "",
      "As the most pivotal summer transfer window at Old Trafford since the last stumbles into a second month under the duress of impasses and ‘huge blows’, it seems important to take stock.",
      "Ruben Amorim implored his employers to be “brave”, and solving problems in attack by spending £62.5m of a thoroughly limited budget on a forward who has reached double digits for goals in three of eight seasons as a professional, while absurdly overvaluing a problem winger and three other players in the same position when selling to buy is imperative, arguably ticks that box.",
      "The hope is that Matheus Cunha is at the absolute least a character upgrade on Alejandro Garnacho and his fellow bomb squad members; the Brazilian needs to be a solider willing to make sacrifices rather than a sulk who disrupts the dressing room.",
      "But Wolves supporters might be interested in what results any due diligence on and personality assessment of Cunha returned after the disciplinary issues and social media shenanigans which threatened to derail their season.",
      "It would be entirely on-brand for Manchester United to not only adopt a new recruitment strategy about half a decade after their contemporaries first implemented it, but for them to also a) part with the individual responsible for it within a year, and b) then completely ignore it.",
      "Does signing a potential ‘knob-end’ count as a violation of the ‘no-dickheads’ policy which has formed the foundation of many of modern sport’s great teams? It is certainly a grey area.",
      "But if Cunha did not already sense a suffocating pressure upon securing his “dream” move to a fallen giant, the weight of responsibility for distorting the entire market could be felt soon.",
      "It would be foolish to pretend Sporting president Frederico Varandas and the contacts of a prominent Newcastle journalist do not have ulterior motives, and that the mere mention of Manchester United does not magnify a story tenfold.",
      "Yet an elite athlete can only take those two separate instances of scapegoating personally. Cunha has been specifically cited as both a case study for Sporting when increasing the asking price for Viktor Gyokeres, and the exorbitant reason for Newcastle not yet signing a single player.",
      "Whether being used as the justification for external avarice or incompetence, it seems a little harsh considering Cunha’s age, Premier League pedigree and established history of gradually rising in value to hold him as 2025’s Neymar, the signing against which all others should be measured and inflated.",
      "A forward with 42 goals and assists in 82 Premier League appearances, who turned 26 in May and is a fixture in the Brazil national team, having a release clause activated which ranks him around 20th in terms of the most expensive British signings ever, seems relatively standard fare.",
      "Yet the addition of Manchester United to the equation inevitably makes Cunha either a yardstick, a stick to beat his new club with or preferably both.",
      "It is an accusation the player should be used to. His £44m move to Wolves in January 2023 seemed a flagrant waste of money when it produced two goals in 17 games in his first half-season, but Cunha soon realised his potential at Molineux under Gary O’Neil, the future of Manchester United coaching.",
      "The ‘overpriced’ label is one thing, but the lowest bar in terms of hope and expectation is that Sir Jim Ratcliffe does not feel compelled to name Cunha as one of the “overpaid” players the club is still paying for years later.",
      "Those instalments have hampered Manchester United in this critical transfer window and increased the need for Cunha to hit the ground sprinting; Newcastle and Sporting pointing the finger is just added motivation.",

      "The former most expensive African player in history was a one-time Southampton club-record signing who was twice transferred for more than £20m in his 30s after reaching his peak at Liverpool.",
      "Bayern Munich weren’t to know, as the Ballon d’Or clause in one of the bids Liverpool rejected suggests. But one really quite poor season in the Bundesliga was enough for Mane to hop aboard the Saudi bandwagon within a year.",

But in the first couple of decades of the new millennium it was almost a legal obligation for a European super club to rub shoulders with Ibrahimovic.",

      "This year United have returned to the larger sums with Cunha and potentially Mbeumo both costing around £63m each. While its easy to consider this ‘same old United’ overpaying for players I see it more as a reaction to a 15th place league finish and Europa League loss. The club has to have a good season this time, and by good I mean not nearly as shit. They need to move significantly up the table to at least the European qualification positions so they need impactful low risk signing to enable this. That means buying from among the best players in the Premier League.",
      "Like buying a pint in London signing players from other Premier League clubs just costs more. There are logical economic reasons why it costs more but it’s hard to reconcile when the sums are so large. This isn’t not a uniquely United problem though. Grealish, Nunes, Caicedo, Fofana, Lavia, Rice, Van Dijk are just some of the names that spring to mind. Arguments of overpaying aside its easy to imagine these players costing two-thirds or even half what clubs paid if they had been from the continent.",
      "The money that has made the Premier League so strong from top to bottom also insulates smaller clubs from selling their best players. A club’s position in the league will always be more valuable to them than any one transfer fee. Brentford keeping Mbeumo might ensure they avoid relegation which could be worth hundreds of millions over the next few years. That the player has expressed his desire to move and a need to avoid asset value loss are the only reasons they are entertaining United’s interest.",
      "Buying anything from someone who doesn’t want to sell and doesn’t particularly need to sell will always result in overpaying. Mbuemo probably isn’t worth £63m in comparison to others signed from Europe, he might have been £40m if bought from an Italian or Portuguese club, but if he meets expectations and has the immediate impact required then he probably is worth it to United. Paying more isn’t ideal but for significantly reduced risk, for a player who won’t need months to adjust to the league, I don’t think it’s unreasonable.\nDave, Manchester",

      "Chelsea > Arsenal actually\nF365 world: Arsenal are ahead of Chelsea in the football transfer food chain\nReal world: Gittens rejects Arsenal for Chelsea, Andrey Santos rejects Arsenal for Chelsea move, Mudryk joins Chelsea after strong interest from Arsenal. Meanwhile, no player has ever chosen Arsenal if there was an interest from Chelsea too.\nRahul (Please rename Football365 as Arse365)",

      "Worried about the Toon\nSo another transfer target drops off Newcastle’s radar. I never thought Pedro to Newcastle would be on as soon as Chelsea expressed an interest. London is a more attractive place for footballers, and Pedro is already down south, it’s a logical and understandable outcome.",
      "What do Newcastle do now? We’re still intent on overpaying for a 22 year old GK with no Premier League experience when we’re short handed outfield. It feels like Newcastle will have to grit their teeth and get Elanga done just to avoid looking like the summer has been a complete waste of time. Guehi is going to Liverpool, we can’t compete, so we’re back to square one with a centre back target.",
      "I think Isak will stay but maybe only one more season as the way things are shaping up we’re making a choice to leave easy for him with the lack of ambition to build a squad capable of being more than only occasional Champions League entrants, before crumbling across all fronts under the weight of games on a threadbare squad.",
      "To be honest it does already look like the summer is a disaster for Howe and that he’s really screwed the pooch in taking the reins himself. If you insist on you and your son doing all the business and nothing gets done, maybe Mitchell had a point after all? Excellent coach and manager he may be, but we were warned that transfers were not Howe’s strength from his time at Bournemouth – this part of the job, the negotiation and finalisation of deals, should have been kept away from him.",
      "It’s now about disaster management and trying to salvage the season before it begins. We’re not going to get first team additions in – they’ve all been taken and there’s no plan B. So we need depth to cover a very good first XI and that means warm bodies in asap.",
      "My two cents are that we get Calvert-Lewin on a free. With his injury record he could be another crock like Wilson, but when fit he’s a good option off the bench, Howe could work some coaching magic, he’s a different option to Isak, and he has to be more reliable than Wilson who we’re trying to re-sign.",
      "If Charlie Cresswell is keen on the mackems he’d step over his mother to play for Newcastle and has an affordable release clause which means no ‘Saudi’ tax so there is a CB sorted who can cover and also develop. Gomez from Liverpool would be a utility player who would get a lot of starts and wouldn’t cost the earth. Again, with his injury record it’s a gamble but he won’t be first choice playing 45+ games, he’ll cover for injuries across the backline and give breaks to older legs. This isn’t just recency bias based on the U21s, but Harvey Elliott can play on the right wing and the middle. He will be more expensive now but if we were willing to go to £50m each for Pedro and Elanga surely Liverpool will come to an agreement there within that scope if he’s not wanted? All that might leave some headroom for Trafford who we appear fixated on.",
      "Those players fit the profile Howe seems to be after – young, English, and with the exception of Cresswell and Trafford, plenty of Premier League experience. I know anyone can make these transfers sound easy but if Sunderland are doing their business surely we can get something done which will save what could be a catastrophe in the making.\nJames, Leeds",

      "PSR never about fairness\nBeen away for a while so I might be late to the party on this one.",
      "The topic seems to be why do we bother with PSR? They say those who don’t remember history are doomed to eat peanut butter and chicken sandwiches…or something.",
      "So let’s refresh why they were created. Originally there was no restrictions on who could own a club. It was how Magnier and the other guy bought their way to success with United. It was how Jack Walker bought his way to success with Blackburn.",
      "We got warning signs when Leeds nearly went belly up after spending way more than they should and then failing. So the FA introduced the fit and proper test, which was a laughably easy to trick PR campaign designed to stop silly owner behaviour. But it was a few years later when that chap who bought Portsmouth for a quid waltzed past the fit and proper test and proceeded to almost bankrupt the club by not knowing what the f*** he was doing and also not having the money to cover the debts which was part of the agreement for the £1 sale.",
      "So they ripped up the woefully inadequate fit and proper test and created a newer more strict version of it which was supposed to ensure owners actually wanted to succeed with the club and not just flip it like a meme coin rug pull.",
      "That’s why PSR exists. It’s not for fairness, it’s not to gatekeep the top 6 or shut out the average working class Joes of…Saudi royal family. It was just to stop silly behaviour. Because there was Leeds, Liverpool, Portsmouth, Derby…and many more who flirted with bankruptcy and that looked f***ing awful for the Premier League as it essentially said their product was awful.",
      "PSR was invented for that purpose. Somewhere along the line people got the idea it was about fairness..it never was. And more importantly absolutely nobody gave a shit about fairness for 120 years of football prior to that. Loads of teams have had their dynasties and each time it’s mostly done by buying other team’s best players.",
      "In light of this we should all go back to realising those rules are just to stop bankruptcies and stop thinking it’s some measure of fairness which nobody seems to really want anyway.",

      "World Cups are doomed to one hemisphere\nWe will all remember 20 years ago, when warnings were issued about how climate change would render future summer football tournaments completely unsuitable for the extreme heat and humidity that would be expected.",
      "Well, it seems that moment has finally arrived. The farce of the Club World Cup being played by knackered players shuffling around a baked football pitch, played in front of stands dotted with people melting in the heat. Not to mention, the two and a half delays for weather conditions.",
      "Give it another 10 years and the whole of the Northern Hemisphere would be unable to stage any sporting tournament, leaving the only option to hold tournaments in the Southern Hemisphere where it is their autumn/winter.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is “happy to stay to stay at Brentford” according to director of football Phil Giles as Manchester United ‘make contact’ with Aston Villa over an alternative forward.",
      "The Red Devils have already secured the signing of Matheus Cunha to bolster Ruben Amorim’s attacking options after triggering his £62.5m release clause to sign him from Wolves and have been pushing to add Mbeumo to their ranks after the Frenchman’s 20 goals and eight assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "Brentford rejected an opening bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons from United and then knocked back an improved offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons on Friday, although that latest bid being ‘much closer’ to Brentford’s demands.",
      "It’s thought the Bees are holding out for £65m for their prized asset, who has reportedly told the club that he wants to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "But in a blow to the Red Devils, Giles suggested Mbeumo wouldn’t down tools to force an exit as he believes the 25-year-old would be “happy to stay at Brentford next year”.",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews insisted he’s desperate for Mbeumo to stay.",
      "“It’s a massive boost if he stays,” Andrews said.",
      "“He’s such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "“I want the most talented players in the building. I’m very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.”",
      "Reports suggest United remain in talks with Brentford and still hope to get the deal done for Mbeumo, but The Athletic claim the Red Devils chiefs have ‘made contact’ with Aston Villa over a possible move for Ollie Watkins.",
      "A move for Watkins is likely entirely separate from the proposed transfer of Mbeumo as it’s claimed he’s ‘on the list in the event that Rasmus Hojlund leaves the club’ amid interest from Serie A.",
      "It’s claimed talks between Villa and United concerning Marcus Rashford at the end of the season ‘included the prospect of Watkins being involved in any possible summer transfer’, and although Rashford has snubbed Villa, Watkins moving to Old Trafford remains a possibility.",
      "Concerning the possible transfer fee, the report adds:",
      "‘In January, Arsenal held talks over Watkins with Villa seeking a £60m fee. Arsenal valued him at the £40m mark, however, and the deal never got close to completion. Villa feel Watkins is still worth that larger figure, following another productive season and with three years left on his contract. Such a price would be a major consideration for United given Watkins is unlikely to have much resale value.’",
      "Man Utd are closing in on the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with the deal set to “speed up soon”, according to an insider.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal are in a ‘new bid’ for a ‘key’ striker target and this move is dependent on the ‘only’ remaining ‘issue’ to overcome.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘much closer’ to landing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo as they have set a deadline to ‘wrap up a deal’.",
      "Manchester United have a rare chance to end a ‘vicious cycle’ with their transfers, while there is praise for Sir Lee Carsley and his ‘mustard’ England U21s.",
      "According to reports, Man Utd have made a shock £30m ‘offer’ for a Bryan Mbeumo alternative as the club bosses deem Brentford’s demands ‘excessive’.",
      "Including Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo and Liverpool star Harvey Elliott, these 11 Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer."

While they’re insisting on £85million, they need the market to look as busy as they can make it appear. And it does Arsenal no harm while they continue to barter with other clubs over other strikers.",

The Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training next week.

Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "11) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "9) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United.",
      "",
      "7) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "6) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nNice and easy, this, because of the £5million clause in his Chelsea contract. A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper. Apparently, Kepa has done his medical and put pen to paper on a deal that should give David Raya the heebie-jeebies.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",
      "",
      "4) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – and Quansah is now in Germany to get it all done.",
      "",
      "3) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Chelsea\nThis one moved fast over the weekend, when Newcastle and Chelsea both had bids rejected before the Blues went back with something more acceptable to the Seagulls. Apparently, the Brazilian will undergo a medical in the the United States before joining Enzo Maresca’s Club World Cup squad.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London a week ago to complete his move, but Arsenal won’t be rushed this summer. This week, surely…",
      "at long last, the midfielder was in London a week ago to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we expected an unveiling by now, but we may have to wait for next week."

      "The report adds: ‘The president understands that Ter Stegen’s time at the club has come to an end, and that now is the time to regenerate a squad that needs a new lease of life. Although the German isn’t considering an immediate exit, market pressure and his new role within the team could tip the balance.’",

      "There is certainly an argument that Monaco belong here instead, as Paul Pogba would attest.",
      "",
      "19) Bournemouth\nBy making their unspoken role as a transfer stepping stone a part of their actual identity, Bournemouth have established themselves as a destination worth considering for any aspiring player.",
      "A self-described “platform club” who have proven capable of not only coaching and developing to an elite standard but also being willing to sell when the time is right is particularly appealing, not least to agents who might project bigger moves down the line.",
      "And there is an undeniable pull to working with Andoni Iraola, who could deliver European football next season and crucially stay for that part of an exciting journey.",
      "",
      "18) RB Leipzig\nIt is a similar situation at Leipzig, whose very purpose as the finishing school of the Red Bull institution is to polish the gems inherited elsewhere from within their multi-club ownership model and move them on to Europe’s elite for ludicrous profit.",
      "“We are confirming it every single summer in every transfer window, we are the perfect club for young players, to help them for a certain time in their career and then to bring them to absolutely top clubs,” said Leipzig managing director of sport Marcel Schafer last year.",
      "There is now also the remote prospect of at least entering the same orbit as that massive sell-out Jurgen Klopp.",

      "17) Spurs\nThe notion of a Big Six remains contentious for many but it has almost never been the actual best six because that isn’t the point.",
      "The crisis baton is passed and often shared between Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs, whose competence levels have rarely converged over the last decade. Yet they remain far and away the richest clubs in the Premier League with the clearest in-built advantages. Spurs lag behind the other five in that respect, but in the same vein every other club in the country – and most across Europe – cannot touch Spurs in terms of infrastructure.",

      "This remains a team in transition, with uncertainty over their manager, sporting director and a transfer policy still contingent on player churn and loans with various clauses attached.",

Diego Simeone is their ace, their only feasible edge in any transfer race competed on even footing against other Champions League regulars. And he is going nowhere, probably even when Arsenal come calling.",

      "12) Napoli\nThe lure of sitting under the Scott McTominay learning tree cannot be sniffed at but there is a definite elephant in the room when it comes to Napoli’s transfer lure.",
      "Antonio Conte is simultaneously their biggest pull and most prominent red flag for prospective signings. Napoli have won Serie A twice in three seasons but with a managerial ticking time bomb liable to go off any time soon, and the volatile Aurelio De Laurentiis still in a position of power, it would be a risk to join even with their renewed offering of Champions League football.",

But it doesn’t really apply anymore, with free agent Raphael Guerreiro the only player since 2016 to cross the divide and leave Germany’s second-biggest fish for the bona fide shark.",
      "Dortmund cannot even lay consistent claim to being the country’s perennial bridesmaid. They have finished 3rd, 4th or 5th more often than they have 2nd in the last nine Bundesliga seasons.",
      "They are still Dortmund and the idea of following in the footsteps of Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham works in their favour. But the further smaller those examples in the rear window, the better chance Leverkusen and others have of usurping them.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea\n“I don’t know why as a player I would look at that Chelsea project and think I would sign,” said Jamie Carragher last August. But really the reasons are numerous and obvious when looking past the instinct of laughing at how batsh*t it all is: money, a long-term contract, a chance to work with excellent players and coaches, regular European football, trophy-winning pedigree and life in London.",
      "There might be an element of reticence to join a club which has shown such scant and consistent disregard for players it no longer deems of value, but that rather ignores the ingrained egotism of professional athletes who believe they are so good that such treatment will never befall them.",
      "",
      "8) Inter\nChampions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, Inter have been meticulously and impressively rebuilt in the image of Simone Inzaghi and Beppe Marotta. But throwing any sort of financial weight around has not really been their thing since the ludicrous spending of the 1990s.",
      "While they have some obvious incentives to offer, Christian Chivu has a rebuild on his hands and it ultimately tends to come down to money; Inter are perfectly happy to target players eager to join them for sporting reasons instead.",
      "",
      "7) Bayern Munich\nThere isn’t really a box Bayern don’t tick. They have a ridiculous economic advantage in a league they are favourites to win each season, with a raft of brilliant players, a wonderful stadium, the guarantee of Champions League football every year and a charismatic coach.",
      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles too.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these constant near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through, as evidenced by this summer splurge.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against has been meticulously erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "But if Arsenal are to go just one better this time, they’re surely going to need another entry in this list of the top 10 signings ever made by Premier League clubs in response to a second-place finish.",

      "Since the minute they brought Fernandinho to Manchester, City have been scouring the planet for his replacement.

Kalvin Phillips, it turned out, was not quite the replacement Pep Guardiola had in mind.",

      "Not a bargain then, but still value. A signing that sits alongside the likes of Alisson and Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool: hugely expensive but entirely necessary and correct. The exact player needed in the exact position needed to maintain and improve a challenge against the City machine. And in Rice’s case now, also against the likes o[f Alisson and and Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool. Will it be third time lucky?",

      "“I cannot understand what is going on. I have not spoken to anyone who, when £18.6million became available, would have spent that on Michael Carrick.”",
      "That was the reaction in 2006 of Mark Longden of the Independent Manchester United Supporters’ Association to the news that the Red Devils were signing Carrick to fill the void left by Roy Keane. Tottenham fans were similarly minded. Bernie Kingsley of Spurs fanzine Cock-a-Doodle-do gloated: “For that sort of money, and with midfielders like Tom Huddlestone and Didier Zokora at the club, it has got to be good business.”",
      "Indeed it was – for United. Carrick took Keane’s No.16 shirt and won the title in his first season with United. Then he won four more and everything else there was to win in 12 trophy-laden years at Old Trafford.",

      "6) Robin van Persie\nFuelled by losing the title in the final seconds of the 2011/12 season to their noisy neighbours, Sir Alex Ferguson began his Premier League last hurrah by taking Van Persie off Arsene Wenger’s hands, a switch for which he was never forgiven by Arsenal fans.",
      "Reflecting on his defection, the reigning PFA Players’ Player of the Year blamed ‘the little boy inside of me’ for turning his back on the Gunners. “That boy was screaming for Manchester United.”",

      "5) Kevin De Bruyne\n“It takes a special player to improve our squad,” said Manuel Pellegrini in 2015 when City paid a club-record £55million for the Belgian, though few people really understood just how special De Bruyne was.",
      "Chelsea certainly didn’t spot it before they sold the Belgian to Wolfsburg for £16.7million a year and half before he returned to the Premier League to tear it up in a City shirt.",
      "It took De Bruyne three seasons to win his first title winner’s medal, which came a year after Pep Guardiola rocked up at the Etihad. Since then, he’s won five more to add to a Champions League, five League Cups and a couple of FA Cups.",
      "",
      "4) Sol Campbell\nEven if Campbell’s free transfer had been a disaster, it would have been worth the £100,000 spent per week on the defender’s wages just for all the p*ss it boiled across north London.",
      "But Wenger’s swoop for the England centre-back was actually a masterstroke. Campbell was a perfect replacement for Tony Adams and his arrival was the catalyst for Arsenal to end three seasons of living in Manchester United’s shadow as the bridesmaids of the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal won the title in his first season at Highbury before Campbell became an Invincible two years later. Though he was largely responsible for the end of the unbeaten run by blatantly and brutally hacking down Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford in match 50…",
      "",
      "3) Didier Drogba\nRoman Abramovich took a year or so after buying Chelsea in 2003 to get his feet under the table before really splurging. Finishing as runners-up to Arsenal’s Invincibles in 2003/04 wasn’t enough for Claudio Ranieri to keep his job so Jose Mourinho was appointed immediately after he’d led Porto to the Champions League.",
      "Following Mourinho – Petr Cech and Ricardo Carvalho too – through the door was Drogba, who joined from Marseille for a club-record fee of £24million. Abramovich flexed his financial muscle by offering OM double what Juventus were prepared to pay. It was money extremely well spent.",
      "Drogba went on to score 164 goals in 381 appearances across two spells with the Blues. The Premier League title in his and Mourinho’s first season was the first of four for the Ivorian, who also won four FA Cups, three League Cups and the Champions League.",
      "",
      "2) Alan Shearer\nNewcastle blew up spectacularly in the 1995/96 title race, chucking away a 12-point lead to allow Manchester United to win the title and, subsequently, the Double. But the Toon won the summer transfer battle for the previous season’s top scorer…",
      "Shearer bagged 31 goals for seventh-placed Blackburn who allowed the striker to move on for a British record transfer fee of £15million. United and Newcastle were both willing to cough up so it was a straight choice for the England centre-forward.",
      "“I had to make a decision and at one point, I was 90 per cent certain I was going to go to Manchester United,” he reflected in 2020. “But then I got another call from Kevin Keegan and I thought ‘I’m going to go to Newcastle, it’s a club I’ve supported all my life’.”",
      "Despite all the pots United won in his absence, Shearer was content with making himself a legend in his hometown with 206 goals, making himself Newcastle’s leading scorer of all time.",
      "",
      "1) Thierry Henry\nArsenal reacted to losing the 1998/99 Premier League title race on the final day to a Treble-winning Manchester United by signing two World Cup strikers in two days at the start of August.",
      "On August 2 1999, Davor Suker joined the Gunners. He was followed a day later by a 22-year-old France forward who’d fallen out of favour at Juventus.",
      "Henry’s status at Juve didn’t deter Arsene Wenger from paying a club-record £11million fee, with Henry and Suker joining Kanu, Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars in Arsenal’s front line.",
      "“Thierry Henry is a valuable addition to our squad, he will be a great asset to Arsenal Football Club,” said Wenger, playing it cool when he signed the World Cup winner. Henry went on to earn himself a statue by scoring 228 goals for the Gunners, winning two Premier League titles along the way, even if he had to wait three seasons for his first."

      "According to reports, it is a ‘matter of time’ before Viktor Gyokeres secures a transfer, while Arsenal and Manchester United have learned his ‘total cost’.",
      "Gyokeres hoped that his summer exit would be seamless, as it’s consistently been reported that he had a gentleman’s agreement over a transfer with Sporting Lisbon.",
      "This would have enabled Gyokeres to leave for a below release clause fee, but Sporting Lisbon have gone back on this arrangement as they look to maximise their income from the 2025 top scorer in Europe contender.",

      "READ: Manchester United must abandon Mbeumo move and end ‘vicious cycle’",
      "On Sunday, Sporting president Frederico Varandas blamed Arsenal and Man Utd for missing out on a cut-price deal for Gyokeres.",
      "Varandas claimed: “If you ask me today, there is a strong possibility that Viktor will leave. We have been keeping an eye on the market, I saw a player like Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go to Arsenal for €65 million (£55m).",
      "“I saw two players being sold in the Premier League – Matheus Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo – forwards who do not have the quality of Viktor, in my opinion, were sold for around €70m.",
      "“We are talking about players who are 26 years old. So, given the demands we are making in relation to Viktor ‘s value, I believe he could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world. Which I find hard to believe.",
      "“I won’t say what the price we asked for. It was communicated to the agent. But I can guarantee that Viktor will not leave for €60+€10 million.”",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Burnley – £46.81m\nThere has been a slew of converted loans and then the first ‘new’ signing has arrived in the form of goalkeeper Max Weiss, perhaps precipitating James Trafford’s move to Newcastle. Quickly followed by the improbably named Quilindschy Hartman.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Borussia Dortmund – £48.9m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could add Jason Sancho.",
      "",
      "8) Brighton – £51.3m\nPerhaps in an effort to ensure Fabian Hurzeler has enough of an age gap over at least some of his squad, Brighton have spent a fair whack on three exciting teenagers from Sunderland, Daejeon Hana Citizen and Olympiacos, and the 21-year-old Diego Coppola.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea – £99.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £100.5m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £196m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m."

      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised, \" Giles said.",

      "\"It's a massive boost if he stays,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",

      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."

      "Manchester United have admired Bryan Mbeumo for some time and feel he is a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system; Mbeumo keen on move but Brentford not under pressure to sell; United had an initial bid worth up to £55m rejected; Spurs held initial talks with Brentford in June over Mbeumo",
      "By Mark McAdam",
      "Friday 27 June 2025 20:27, UK",
      "Manchester United have made an improved bid of more than £60m for Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United have, as expected, gone back in with another offer for Mbeumo after having their initial bid worth up to £55m rejected.",
      "Brentford value Mbeumo, who effectively has two years left on his deal, at more than £60m and are willing to listen to offers.",
      "Mbeumo is a player United have admired for a while and he is seen as a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."
