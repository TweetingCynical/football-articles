      "Manchester United may be about to take a huge financial hit on Aaron Wan-Bissaka with an Old Trafford exit potentially on the cards five years after his £50m move",
      "Manchester United are willing to take a £35million hit on Aaron Wan-Bissaka amid a potential summer exit.",
      "The right-back has endured a mixed time at Old Trafford since moving north from Crystal Palace back in 2019. He was the first major signing of the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer era and set the club back £50m as they pounced following a huge breakout year for the right-back.",
      "Originally a regular, Wan-Bissaka has been in and out of the first-team with Diogo Dalot often preferred. He has played in notable games under Erik ten Hag, but the club are still willing to sanction his departure.",
      "West Ham are among those keen and could land the former Palace defender for £15m. The Hammers and United are reportedly locked in talks over a potential deal, according to talkSPORT, with the Red Devils triggering a 12-month extension in his deal to stop him leaving for nothing this summer.",
      "He has made 190 appearances for United, scoring twice, but he could soon find himself at the London Stadium as the Red Devils look to get players off their books to help finance their summer business with more new signings on Ten Hag's wish list.",
      "This time last year the United boss admitted that Wan-Bissaka \"was out in the cold and looked like he was on his way out of Manchester United\" before his performances landed him another season.",
      "The former Palace man, who was once tipped for England but is yet to land international recognition, has admitted he thought his career in Manchester was up as soon as Ten Hag arrived before knuckling down to extend his time at Old Trafford.",
      "He said previously: \"It was a hard time and the only thing you can do during a hard time is keep working. I got my head down and then got the chance and was able to help the team. You can just sit there and complain about it and not care, or you can actually try and I thought the best way was for me to try.\"",
      "Last term Wan-Bissaka started 20 times in the Premier League but United are attempting to bolster their backline as they close in on the £52m capture of Leny Yoro from Lille. Matthijs de Ligt and Jarrad Branthwaite are also on their shortlist.",

      "The Frenchman, 29, became a free agent at the start of the month after running down his contract at the Allianz Stadium and will officially announce his departure from the Italian giants this week.",
      "That decision is likely to lead to a number of top European clubs making their move - and the midfield maestro will explore a move to the Premier League amid interest from two of England's biggest clubs.",
      "Rabiot intends to speak with all of his suitors as he weighs up his next move, as outlined by Football Italia, including Liverpool and United.",
      "Newcastle are another club who are set to hold discussions with Rabiot, while AC Milan and Napoli, now managed by Antonio Conte, will attempt to persuade him to remain in Italy.",
      "Rabiot is looking for a contract worth £7.5m a year: a sum that may be too rich for clubs in Serie A. Juventus offered a base salary of £5.8m in their final contract offer.",
      "Rabiot has been regularly linked with a move to the Premier League in recent years and Manchester United are long-term admirers of the midfielder.",
      "Rabiot was in talks with the Red Devils when he was still on the books at Paris-Saint Germain before then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decided against pushing ahead with a deal. And Rabiot was back on the club's radar following the appointment of Erik ten Hag, but again, a deal failed to materialise.",
      "United are in the market for midfield reinforcements this summer and are believed to be pursuing Manuel Ugarte. However, the club have a limited transfer budget and as the close on Leny Yoro, will likely need to sell before being able to complete a deal for the Uruguay international - and the fact that they could land Rabiot without have to pay a transfer fee could appeal.",

      "Manchester United are closing in on defensive target Leny Yoro, with the Lille defender headed for the UK for discussions, but Erik tan Hag has more work to do this summer",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag may be forced to abandon one of his other defensive targets if the club completes a deal for Leny Yoro, with the Dutchman also facing a selection dilemma.",
      "French teenager Yoro had appeared to favour Real Madrid over an Old Trafford switch, but things have taken a turn with Los Blancos failing to match United's £52m bid. The Lille starlet is on his way to Manchester for a medical, with a deal seemingly imminent.",
      "This was always likely to be a busy summer for the Premier League club, with defenders Raphael Varane and Willy Kambwala both leaving and Victor Lindelof linked with a move away. Yoro is one of a number of players targeted, along with Matthijs de Ligt and Jarrad Branthwaite, but his arrival could well see one of those names drop off the list.",
      "Mirror Football understands Ten Hag has told De Ligt he plans to offer him regular first-team football, something the ex-Ajax star isn't guaranteed at current club Bayern Munich. However, with Lisandro Martinez one of the first names on the teamsheet under Ten Hag, it could be left-sided defender Branthwaite who ends up staying put.",
      "Former Premier League midfielder Remy Cabella has been among those to bang the drum for Yoro. The 34-year-old, formerly of Newcastle United, played with the teenager at Lille last season.",
      "\"At Marseille, I knew Boubacar Kamara, at Saint-Etienne, William Saliba and Wesley Fofana, and now there's Leny Yoro,\" the French international said, per Goal. \"He has all the qualities and potential to do something huge. He's very humble, and that's another of his strengths.\"",
      "Despite only turning 18 in November, Yoro developed into a regular at Lille last term. He played 44 times in all competitions, scoring three times, as Les Dogues finished fourth in Ligue 1 and reached the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League.",
      "United, who finished in eighth place in the Premier League last season, have already begun their summer rebuild. It is their first transfer window of the INEOS era, with part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe hiring Dan Ashworth, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox to take charge of the club's business.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has already joined, with a £36.5m move from Bologna completed over the weekend. The former Bayern Munich forward will provide competition for Rasmus Hojlund up front following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and Anthony Martial during Ten Hag's two years as manager.",
      "“He’s a player who can link up the game, who can be available, hold up the ball, have good ideas, be creative and who can dribble in combinations,” Ten Hag said of Zirkzee. “So that's a different type [of player] and always what we are looking for, so it gives us more options tactically, which is good.",
      "“Particularly up front, we have many players who can play very direct, so they can take a big benefit for his skills.”",

      "Here's the latest transfer news coming out of Old Trafford.",
      "A deal has been struck for Lille star Yoro, who has flown in from France to undergo a medical after a £52million deal was struck. The stumbling block looked to be the player's desire to move to Real Madrid, who were also in the race to sign him.",
      "Los Blancos were keen on waiting until he was available on a free, but Lille's agreement with United means that Yoro will now head to the north west of England to finalise personal terms, reports the Athletic. The Red Devils have the young centre-half on their shortlist and the French club were looking to sell with Yoro's contract winding down.",
      "The Ligue 1 side had strongly favoured a deal with the Red Devils as they looked to cash in on their asset. United are hoping to secure a player in Yoro who is regarded across the game as being a generational talent.",
      "The Red Devils will land 50 percent of any future transfer fee as part of Mason Greenwood's move to Marseille. The two clubs have agreed a £23.3million deal for Greenwood, who spent last season on loan at Spanish side Getafe and has a host of European clubs now eyeing him.",
      "The forward last played for United two-and-a-half years ago before he was arrested and subsequently suspended by the club. Those at Old Trafford acknowledge they cannot allow Greenwood to play for the club again but want to maximise their profits.",
      "They are conscious though of Greenwood maximising his talent and eventually become a world star, which would see his value skyrocket. United want to ensure they would be rewarded financially if the 22-year-old does move on to even bigger and better things.",
      "United face the prospect of having Casemiro on their books for a third year as they struggle to source a buyer. The Brazilian's debut year saw him earn huge plaudits, but last term he endured a huge drop off and copped major criticism as the sums involved in signing him began to haunt them.",
      "Despite his quality and a CV that includes a haul of Champions League successes whilst in Spain questions were asked when United signed a 30-year-old to a five-year deal on astronomical wages.",
      "Now with Casemiro poised to turn 33 next season - and no longer a guaranteed starter - United have an expensive asset on their books which they can't rid off. The MEN reports that no Saudi Arabian interest has materialised, which some expected to be the case, and United may have to keep hold of the Brazilian.",

      "Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant was asked who he prefers out of footballing greats Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with the two-time NBA champion barely giving his answer a thought",
      "NBA legend Kevin Durant has weighed in on the Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo debate by declaring the Portuguese star as the \"goat\".",
      "Durant, who now plays for Phoenix Suns after stints with Golden State Warriors and the Brooklyn Nets, was being interviewed by YouTuber Speed, and then later by Logan Paul & Mike Majlak on their podcast 'Impaulsive'. On both occasions when asked who he thought was better, the basketball icon took a slight pause before stating that Ronaldo was his preferred choice.",
      "Discourse over who is the better player out of the two has been raging for years with pundits and fans alike often unable to seperate them. There was no such issue with Durant though with the two-time NBA champion, double MVP, and triple Olympic gold medalist knowing a thing or two about what it takes to make it as a sporting great.",
      "The 30-year-old, who has also been selected for the All Star team 14 times in his storied career on the court, was approached by Speed, who pops the question about Ronaldo or Messi. Durant then takes a step back and ponders the query for a very brief moment before confidently stating it's Ronaldo he favours.",
      "Speed then laughs before declaring that \"KD is a Ronaldo fan\" and that the former Oklahoma Thunder player \"knows who the goat is\". If you want to contextualise the argument over just who is the best ever between Ronaldo and Messi it's worth looking at the trophy hauls, both for team and individually, throughout their careers.",
      "The Argentinian has won an astonishing eight Ballons d'Or compared to Ronaldo's five, eight of FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four, making him the most decorated player in the history of the game. Messi's unrivalled haul of 45 senior titles will seal the debate for most, and after he led Argentina to victory in the 2022 World Cup, a number of commentators and players have settled on Messi. But that's not the case according to Durant.",
      "While Messi currently plays for Inter Miami, he spent the bulk of his professional career with Barcelona where he won 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the Champions League four times. Ronaldo has played for several clubs throughout his career although trophies have often followed wherever he played his game.",
      "His trophy cabinet, despite being slightly smaller than Messi's, is still nothing to be sniffed at with the Real Madrid and Manchester United legend winning 33 trophies in his career. This includes seven league titles, five Champions Leagues, Euro 2016 with Portugal and the UEFA Nations League.",

      "Manchester United fans have called on Erik ten Hag to reinstate Harry Maguire as captain after being reminded of his leadership skills in a behind-the-scenes video.",
      "Maguire is one of few senior United players training at their Carrington complex after missing out on Euro 2024 due to injury. The 31-year-old defender was cut from Gareth Southgate’s squad after failing to shake off a calf injury and has been working hard to regain full fitness for the 2024/25 campaign with United.",
      "He was not a part of the United squad which travelled to Trondheim to play Rosenborg on Monday and instead stayed behind to train alongside some of the club’s youngsters. And in a clip from MUTV, Maguire was shown saying hello to and shaking the hands of every player in the gym on training bikes.",
      "Maguire goes along the line of academy players, who look delighted to get recognition from a senior player. The centre-back was stripped of the United captaincy by Erik ten Hag in July 2023, with the Dutchman opting to hand the armband to Bruno Fernandes, but he clearly still commands respect among the players.",
      "The video clip went viral on Twitter, with many United fans posting praise for Maguire – with some suggesting he should replace Fernandes as skipper. “Acting like a leader,” one fan wrote. Another wrote: “That's my captain there”. “A captain’s attitude,” a third added.",
      "Another wrote: “You always hear from many players in and around the squad how Maguire makes them feel welcoming and at home right away. This is a nice example of this in training this week greeting all the young lads. A class act and great leader.”",
      "Maguire joined United in a £80million transfer from Leicester in the summer of 2019 and was made captain by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January 2020. Solskjaer revealed earlier this year that he had doubts about Fernandes’ suitability for the role.",
      "“I knew Bruno Fernandes had captain qualities when I was manager at Manchester United,” he said on the Stick to Football podcast. “He’s got the personality and quality – but he knows and I’ve told him – that he’s too passionate at times and he loses a bit of control. I loved Harry Maguire as a captain, he was the leader in that group for me when I was at the club.”",
      "He added: “The way that Harry Maguire has handled himself with everything happening to him at Manchester United is top class and just shows the character he’s got, that I want in players.”",
      "Ten Hag is very unlikely to go back on his decision, especially given that Maguire is not guaranteed a place in the starting XI. United have spent £52m to bring in Leny Yoro, who could partner Lisandro Martinez in defence, while Matthijs de Ligt could also be arriving this summer.",

      "And Premier League rivals have attempted to take advantage of that with a move. Fulham have reportedly tabled their opening bid for the Scottish midfielder.",
      "But according to Mail Online, that offer has been rebuffed by the Red Devils. It is suggested that Fulham’s bid is lower than a £30m offer that Man United turned down from West Ham last summer.",
      "McTominay looked set for an Old Trafford exit 12 months ago but enjoyed a dramatic u-turn under current boss Erik ten Hag. The 27-year-old scored a career-best 10 goals last term despite a tricky season from the Red Devils’ perspective.",
      "Ten Hag regularly underlined how crucial McTominay had been. Speaking last season, the Dutchman said: “Every player has a price but he has a big value, sporting and also economic.",
      "“I want to have a player like Scott McTominay in the squad. He is Manchester United in every faith. Every minute he will fight for the match. He is Manchester United in everything in his heart. When you are coming on and giving this to the team it tells a lot.”",

      "Jadon Sancho has been welcomed back into the fold at Manchester United by Erik ten Hag, but the winger's former Borussia Dortmund manager foresees more problems",
      "Erik ten Hag is to blame for the difficulties between him and Jadon Sancho – and they are likely to continue at Manchester United, according to Sancho’s former manager.",
      "Sancho was exiled by Ten Hag after a public falling out and spent the second half of last season on loan at former club Borussia Dortmund. He enjoyed his time back in Germany, but has now returned to his parent club with Dortmund likely unable to afford to sign him permanently.",
      "The winger has been handed a second chance by Ten Hag, who has allowed him to return to first-team training ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. The Dutchman has said they have “drawn the line” under the falling out and want to move on.",
      "But Lucien Favre, who managed Sancho for two years during his first spell at Dortmund, has suggested that the ill-feeling between the two may linger – and that Ten Hag is to blame, given Sancho’s professionalism under his tutelage.",
      "“Sancho is undoubtedly a top player. I remember when he continued working on the pitch after finishing training sessions at Borussia Dortmund,” Favre told Tuttosport. “He wanted to improve in everything. Shooting, passing, crosses. It was a pleasure to see him during those extra 20 minutes on the pitch.",
      "“I’ve heard that there have been problems, big problems, between him and Ten Hag. When somebody like Sancho, with his strong commitment, arrives late for training sessions, it means that somebody is not working properly.”",
      "Ten Hag and Sancho fell out after the Dutchman publicly called him out for poor displays in training. The Englishman responded on social media, denying the allegations while effectively accusing his boss of lying.",
      "Sancho was banished from first-team training and hasn’t played a competitive match for his club since August 2023. He refused to back down and eventually found an exit route to Dortmund in January. But now back at United, he has attempted to mend his relationship with Ten Hag.",
      "“As we said, we've drawn the line,” said Ten Hag, when asked about Sancho. “Manchester United needs good players and Jadon is a good player. We have drawn that line and we move on.”",
      "Sancho was not a part of the United squad which lost 1-0 to Rosenberg on Monday, but will be involved in the upcoming friendlies against Rangers, Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool on their pre-season tour before the Community Shield against Manchester City next month. The 24-year-old is understood to have wanted to stay with Dortmund, but he still has two years left on his United contract, which pays around £290,000-a-week, making a transfer difficult.",

      "Manchester United saw two bids rejected by Everton for Jarrad Branthwaite earlier this summer and the £52m signing of Leny Yoro will complicate negotiations further",
      "Manchester United appear to have sacrificed their chances of landing Everton star Jarrad Branthwaite by splashing the cash to sign Leny Yoro.",
      "United have committed to signing Yoro from Lille for an initial fee of £52million, which could rise as high as £62m with add-ons. The 18-year-old Frenchman is poised to sign a five-year contract with United after flying in to finalise terms and complete a medical on Wednesday.",
      "The agreement comes as a surprise, with many in the industry, including Liverpool, believing that Real Madrid were in pole position to sign Yoro. He is set to become the second summer signing for United after striker Joshua Zirkzee, who cost £36.5m from Bologna.",
      "The need for central defenders was clear for United this summer after Raphael Varane was released at the end of his contract. The club have since sold Willy Kambwala to Villarreal and are open to offers for Victor Lindelof, increasing the need for reinforcements in the position.",
      "However, it seems United have burned their bridges with Everton over the potential addition of Branthwaite. Manchester Evening News reports that the Toffees have been emboldened in their stance on Branthwaite, having previously rejected two offers from United for the defender.",
      "United saw bids worth £43m and £50m rejected earlier this summer, with Everton insisting they value the 21-year-old at a minimum of £70m. Having seen United spend £52m on an 18-year-old who has no Premier League or international experience, they are convinced they have taken the right approach in negotiations over Branthwaite.",
      "Erik ten Hag’s side had tried to play hard ball in talks over the centre-back, insisting they only had a limited transfer budget due to profit and sustainability considerations. Yet United have since committed to spending a combined £88.5m to sign Zirkzee and Yoro to undermine their negotiating position.",
      "Everton are selling Amadou Onana to Aston Villa for £50m and are therefore under no financial pressure to also let go of Branthwaite, who impressed last season alongside James Tarkowski. United have previously annoyed Everton by submitting a joint £28m offer for Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini in 2013 and will likely have to look elsewhere if they want another centre-back this summer.",
      "United have been in talks with Bayern Munich over signing Matthijs de Ligt, but that deal has already potentially been complicated by Yoro’s arrival. Mirror Football understands that Ten Hag has told De Ligt that he wants him to play alongside Lisandro Martinez – a promise he might have to break now Yoro is on the scene.",
      "Ten Hag has been able to boost his transfer budget by allowing Varane and Anthony Martial to leave on free transfers, while selling Kambwala, Donny van de Beek and Alvaro Fernandez. The club are hoping to net a further £30m for Mason Greenwood, which can be reinvested in new players.",

      "Reports have suggested he was attacked after exchanging insults with a fellow reveller. Punches were then thrown, leaving Kanchelskis, 55, needing first aid from staff.",
      "An ambulance was called but the former forward did not need a hospital trip. He has since shared a few updates on his condition - including a gruesome selfie showing his swollen and bruised eye.",
      "Speaking to Russian outlet SE about the attack, Kanchelskis said: \"I’m fine now. A small conflict, we clashed over interests after the final match of the Euros. I want to note that the conflict did not happen because of the football match - but a personal matter.",

      "But after the La Liga champions decided against moving this summer, having already put resources into bringing in France superstar Kylian Mbappe, United have snuck in to complete a deal worth up to £52m with Lille. It's understood Liverpool were under the impression that Madrid were favourites - and decided against stepping up their interest this summer.",

      "He is expected to sign a five-year deal, while United remain interested in another Dutch player, Bayern Munich ’s Matthijs de Ligt, and have had two bids - the most recent of which was £45m - rejected by Everton for up-and-coming England international Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "Centre back has been earmarked as the area needing the greatest overhaul by head coach Erik ten Hag. Raphael Varane left the club at the end of last season, while they are open to offers for Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof.",

      "As Manchester United look to have secured the signature of another talented young player, it appears he may endure a similar issue to William Saliba",
      "Leny Yoro may need to follow a similar path to William Saliba if he is to become a success at Manchester United.",
      "Yoro, 18, is one of the most sought-after central defenders in world football, having also been pursued by Real Madrid and Paris Saint Germain. But the Lille teenager is set to join Erik ten Hag's side and has flown into the red side of Manchester for a medical.",
      "This has pleased many United fans, including club legend Rio Ferdinand, who recently told the United hierarchy to sign the centre-back during a recent podcast appearance. Yoro is not the first young French defender to sign for a Premier League club with a huge reputation.",
      "In the summer of 2019, before Mikel Arteta even became the manager of Arsenal, the Gunners signed a then 18-year-old Saliba from Saint Etienne for £27million. He would not make his Premier League debut until 2022 when Arteta was finally convinced he was ready. Yoro may have to be similarly patient at Old Trafford.",
      "After signing, Saliba was immediately loaned back to Saint Etienne by the Gunners. He would then be sent on loan to Nice and Marseille before he was finally integrated into the first team. When his first loan came to an end, it looked like he might not have a future in North London, as he was left out of Arsenal's Europa League squad.",
      "When he was loaned to Nice, a furious Saliba told French media: \"The coach immediately told me that I was not ready. I would have at least liked to have had a chance to rediscover my rhythm. But this is football, it's like that.\"",
      "He also added: \"He judged me on two-and-a-half matches. I would have liked for him to play me more. But he told me I wasn't ready. I was waiting for him to give me a chance, but football is like that.",
      "\"When I initially came to Arsenal the league looked very good so I showed up to training and wanted to train on my own to show the coach I was ready. I am happy now, I want to play for Nice. The idea when you're part of a team is a better feeling for me.\"",
      "In his first week back at Arsenal after returning from Marseille, Arteta completely gave him the cold shoulder. Saliba addressed this in an interview with the Daily Mail last year when he said: \"I was so excited to do a pre-season with the team and to try to play in the Premier League and the Europa League.",
      "\"He said hello to me the first day, and then after he didn't speak with me.\" The French international added: \"I told myself to be good on the pitch, to give him a solution, to tell him: 'Yeah I'm ready'. To tell him on the pitch is the better way… I knew one day he'd come to speak to me.\"",
      "Saliba is now one of the first names on every Arsenal team-sheet. Saliba has also managed to change the mind of France manager Didier Deschamps. The World Cup-winning manager was not convinced by Saliba at first, but the central defender went on to play every minute of France's Euro 2024 campaign, which saw them reach the semi-final.",
      "At present, it is currently unclear what United plan to do with Yoro. The centre of defence has appeared to be a priority area for United, having already lost Raphael Varane, whose contract expired at the end of June.",
      "They have also been linked with a move for Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt, who starred under Ten Hag at Ajax. United also still have Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Victor Lindelof within their defensive ranks.",

      "Manchester City will go into the 2024-25 Premier League season chasing a fifth successive title, and predictions from a supercomputer have backed them to do just that.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side were run close last season. Liverpool topped the table at the start of April before falling away, while Arsenal were still in with a chance of top spot going into the final round of fixtures.",
      "There has been plenty of change over the summer, with several clubs appointing new managers. Among them are Liverpool and Chelsea, who are both chasing improved performances after bringing in Arne Slot and Enzo Maresca respectively.",
      "Last season saw all three promoted sides drop straight back down to the Championship, but Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton are all hoping to avoid a repeat. And, according to Grosvenor Sport's supercomputer, two of them will stay up by the skin of their teeth.",
      "The supercomputer, essentially a probability model, simulates each Premier League game 1,000 times over to predict results for each game. With those results, based on factors including team strength and betting markets and incorporating an element of randomness, a final table is generated.",
      "It gives Manchester City a huge 90 percent chance of the title at this stage, though it acknowledges predictions can change as teams sign new players and other factors change. Last season's runners-up Arsenal are second favourites, after finishing two points adrift last term.",
      "The final table has City in top spot with 94 points, three points more than last season. It places Arsenal second, with three points fewer than last term, leaving the gap at eight, with Liverpool third above Manchester United despite Erik ten Hag's side winning the league in more simulations than Arne Slot's men.",
      "At the other end of the table, the supercomputer believes Ipswich Town will finish bottom. The Tractor Boys, who finished second in the Championship last season, have retained the services of manager Kieran McKenna despite reports of Chelsea interest but are being backed to struggle.",
      "The other relegation spots, however, are filled by teams who played Premier League football last season. Wolves are predicted to finish 19th with 29 points - 11 more than Ipswich - with Nottingham Forest in 18th.",
      "Forest's predicted tally of 32 points is just two fewer than the 34 predicted for Leicester, who have Forest's former manager Steve Cooper in the dugout. Just one point above the Foxes sit Southampton and Brighton, who the supercomputer is tipping to fall away after the departure of manager Roberto De Zerbi.",

      "Manchester United legends Teddy Sheringham and Roy Keane did not see eye to eye during their time as team-mates, with the latter admitting he never liked the former England striker",
      "Teddy Sheringham has been hailed by Roy Keane as the finest captain he's ever played under, despite their infamous scuffle at Manchester United.",
      "The pair were team-mates for four trophy-laden years at the Red Devils, clinching three Premier League titles and completing an historic Treble in the 1998/99 season.",
      "Their time together was marked by success on the pitch, but off it they weren't exactly the best of friends, with Keane openly admitting his dislike for Sheringham, a revelation that came to light during an exchange with Gary Neville on The Overlap, reports the Manchester Evening News.",
      "In a viral social media snippet, Neville, brandishing a photo of Sheringham, teased Keane with hints about the mystery man's identity as the ex-United captain joked: \"You didn't like him... that could be anybody. Jeez, I've got a list\" leading Keane to correctly guess: \"No, you shouldn't say I didn't like him... Jordi [Cruyff]? Or Teddy?\"",
      "The Irishman later sought to clarify the nature of their relationship, stating: \"That's wrong. I didn't mind Teddy, I just didn't get on with him. We had a fallout but that's just working\".",
      "In an interview with Online Poker, the Englishman spoke highly of his former team-mate despite a rather heated past as he said: \"I always respected Roy, he was our captain and our leader and was one of the best players I ever played with. I loved having him in my football teams I played with him at Nottingham Forest as well as Manchester United and there was no better leader in football that I'd played for.",
      "\"Players within big squads will always have differences in opinions, but in terms of what he did on the pitch in the years that I played with him, he was the best captain that I ever played under.\"",
      "Sheringham previously opened up about the tense fall-out he had with Keane, which is detailed in the book '1999: Manchester United, the Treble and All That', during which they didn't exchange a word for three-and-a-half-years after a fierce spat.",
      "\"I'm sitting behind the driver, Keany was next to the driver,\" he explained in the book. \"Steve Bruce is next to me, [Gary] Pallister, Denis [Irwin], a couple of others in there. Bit of banter flying about in the car. Suddenly, Keany said: 'Why don't you f*** off back to London in your f***ing red Ferrari and your penthouse?",
      "\"I was taken aback and asked: 'Eh? '; and he insists: 'Yeah, f*** off back to London'. I was stunned and said: 'Are you coming for me, Keany? Why are you coming for me. What the hell?!'\"",
      "\"And he went: 'f*** off', and he goes on: 'f***ing red Ferrari, penthouse...' Then he jumped round, still with his bad leg, got me by the tie, pulled me towards him, grappling with him. Suddenly everyone's going: 'What's going on? ' and pulling us apart.\"",

      "West Ham have struck a deal to sign Nice centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo, who had previously been wanted by Manchester United before the Red Devils were blocked from landing the Frenchman by UEFA",
      "West Ham have agreed a deal with Nice to sign highly-rated central defender Jean-Clair Todibo, though their chances of completing the transfer are understood to be doubtful. The agreement that has been struck is an initial loan with the inclusion of a £26.85million (€32m) buy-option that would hand the Hammers the chance to make the move permanent next summer.  However, there is still work to do on personal terms as Juventus remain in the race and sources suggest the 24-year-old would favour a transfer to Turin over east London meaning his arrival at the London Stadium is by no means a formality. Nice are understood to be pushing the player to join the Irons as Juventus are yet to table an acceptable offer for the former Manchester United target.",
      "United were recently blocked by UEFA from signing Todibo under their multi-club ownership rules after both teams were cleared to compete in next season's Europa League.  He had previously been high on their transfer agenda but could now end up lining up against United for the Hammers, providing they're able to get the ambitious swoop over the line. West Ham have refused to give up on their target after seeing at least one offer rejected by Nice earlier in the window. Sources close to Nice also claim West Ham floated fellow centre-backs Kurt Zouma and Nayef Aguerd to the Ligue 1 side during negotiations.  Todobi recently told The Daily Mail that he was open to testing himself in the Premier League, stating: \"It's nice to hear all the compliments. I'm trying to stay focused on my game and my team-mates - but for sure I am open to playing in the Premier League.\"",
      "Julen Lopetegui's side have already landed Wolves captain Max Kilman in a £40m deal having also signed Brazilian attacking talent Luis Guilherme from Palmeiras for £25.5m.  But their window is evidently far from done with attacking reinforcements also in the offing for technical director Tim Steidten. In the past few days, the Hammers have generated further cash to spend following the £18m sale of midfielder Flynn Downes to Southampton.  Downes had been part of West Ham's pre-season training camp in Austria before being given permission to seal a permanent switch to St Mary's, where he spent last season on loan. His former employers Ipswich Town had also shown a strong interest.  A striker remains top of Lopetegui's to-do list with Aston Villa's Jhon Duran among the key names of interest. There is nothing currently in links to Villarreal's Alexander Sorloth, however, despite rumours of a bid for the Norwegian.",

      "Mason Greenwood is closing in on a permanent transfer move to Marseille after Manchester United decided to cash in on the forward, who hasn't played for the Red Devils since January 2022",
      "Manchester United will land 50 per cent of any future transfer fee as part of Mason Greenwood's move to Marseille.",
      "Both clubs have agreed an initial £23.3million deal for Greenwood, who spent last season on loan at Spanish side Getafe. The forward, 22, last played for United two-and-a-half years ago before he was arrested and subsequently suspended by the club.",
      "In February 2023, Greenwood had charges of attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm - all of which he denied - dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service. Following a six-month internal investigation and fierce backlash over his potential return, United decided that it was best for the one-time England international to continue his career away from Old Trafford.",
      "His loan spell with Getafe was a success, registering 10 goals and six assists over 36 appearances, mostly coming from the right-hand side of midfield. Greenwood's form piqued the interest of clubs across Europe but after keen interest from Lazio, it is French side Marseille who have reached an agreement with United and are set to win the race.",
      "The total fee could rise to £26.7m if certain add-ons - relating to personal and team success - are activated. But United have also secured a deal which entitles them to 50 per cent of whatever fee Marseille receive should they sell Greenwood in the future.",
      "Marseille have been criticised for moving for Greenwood, but boss Roberto De Zerbi recently expressed his admiration for the 22-year-old's talents, saying in a press conference: \"He is a champion, an international-level player. I don't know his past, I don't know exactly what happened. I don't like to interfere in the private lives of players.",
      "\"The only thing I can say is that when a player signs for the club where I work, I consider him as my child. I protect him through thick and thin, even if I can pull his ear in private, I will defend him publicly. My players are like my sons.\"",
      "Marseille's club president, Pablo Longoria, also defended the move, saying: \"For a year-and-a-half we have put in place a social program among the strongest in Europe and it was a personal idea that Marseille would be invested in all the subjects where football has a place – in education, in women’s football, the work of the foundation.",
      "\"What is certain is that no matter which player comes to Marseille, he must share our values and the ones we want to have in common with society.",
      "\"At Marseille, there is no religion, no social class, we want Marseille to be a vector of social unity and for all players to share this vision. We want people with values and good people.\"",

      "The Inter Miami forward played 64 minutes of the final versus Colombia as La Albiceleste prevailed to lift the trophy at Hard Rock Stadium. Having left the field through injury, the team's talisman was left sobbing on the bench. But his sorrow quickly evaporated as his teammates finished the job with a 1-0 win.",
      "This is the third major tournament in a row where Argentina have reigned victorious as the current crop of players under Lionel Scaloni continues to make history. Following another glorious night for the country, Garnacho was among those to pay tribute to his skipper for his contributions to the triumph.",
      "The Old Trafford ace was an unused substitute in the showpiece, having only featured for 66 minutes across the competition in the United States. Taking to Instagram, the 20-year-old spoke glowingly about Messi as he took to the replies after a post from the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner to remark: \"Thank you for so much captain.\"",

I'm doing well, thank God, and hopefully soon I can be on the court again enjoying what I love doing most.",
      "\"I'm happy, a lot, especially because we achieved the goal we had and Fide leaves us but with another Cup. The biggest ones, like him, Ota or me, we live it with special excitement, with other teammates who already have several tournaments and add their experience as well, and with a litter of young people who give their all in every ball.\"",
      "Paying tribute to his teammates, Messi appeared convinced that the best is yet to come for this Argentina team, as he added: \"We are a team and also a family, a spectacular group. Thanks to everyone who was supporting us, this national team has a lot of present and a lot of future too. Let's go Argentina.\"",
      "Team head coach Scaloni also purred about his players' efforts stateside, asserting: \"In the second half I think we improved and deserved to win and then always in extra time, in the long run the team always finds something extra, so it's gratifying to see them play and I'm eternally grateful for the way they give their all,\"",
      "With Messi potentially facing a spell on the sidelines after an ankle injury in the final, Inter Miami confirmed: \"After a medical evaluation, it has been determined that Leo Messi has suffered a ligament injury in his right ankle. The captain's availability will be determined by periodic assessments and the progress of his recovery.\""

His England side endured yet more heartache last Sunday by losing the Euro 2024 final 2-1 to Spain, extending their wait for a trophy to at least 60 years.",

      "Neville, however, sees his former England team-mate staying in the international game as opposed to returning to club football after a 15-year absence since being sacked by Middlesbrough. \"I would like to think Gareth will stay in international management,\" the United legend told Sky Sports.",

The 53-year-old has already been tipped to manage the USA while he could succeed Eddie Howe at Newcastle if the current Magpies boss gets the England job.",
      "Neville would be happy to see Howe given the role, and the same goes for ex-Brighton and Chelsea boss Graham Potter. \"There is no science in terms of what works and there are obvious contenders,\" Neville added.",
      "\"Graham Potter and Eddie Howe will get mentioned and I think it will definitely be an English manager. Moving to St. George's Park was to promote and develop English coaches. To take that away from an English manager and give to an international manager would be wrong.\"",

      "\"When I knew him in his beginning when he was 16, he was a very complete player, but a little bit tender. As a young defender, it is normal. He has a good reading of the game, he is very good technically, can play short and long passes, is good in duels and he is more ready now than in the beginning. He is fast, has height, is in good in duels, both in the air and on the ground, he is good technically and is intelligent. He is always calm. He is a little bit like Jules Kounde. I had Jules Kounde at Bordeaux and I put him in the starting XI. He was the same; intelligent and very calm.\"",

      "\"I hope for him that he can go there and perform in that way, with that personality, I really hope so. Tonight he was unbelievable, he was dribbling everybody.\"",
      "Speaking to German TV channel Sport1, Lothar Matthaus addressed the futures of Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Kimmich at Bayern Munich. He said: \"For me, Matthijs de Ligt is someone who has the Bayern Munich gene.",
      "\"Joshua Kimmich is also someone for whom I don’t really need a new number six. But these are decisions made by the club and the player. Everyone thinks a little differently.\"",

      "\"The history. It’s a heritage. You can feel the soul of the club, you can feel the energy of the past strongly. It’s very important. I cannot imagine Manchester United without Old Trafford. I cannot imagine Liverpool without Anfield or Real Madrid without the Santiago Bernabeu.",
      "\"I think some clubs change their stadiums and lose their soul, like Arsenal for example. When they left Highbury, they lost the soul of this club.\"",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands that Leny Yoro has agreed to join United in a deal rising to €70m (£58.7m). It's believed that the Red Devils had a €62m (£52m) offer accepted by Lille last week and the 18-year-old defender has decided to join the club, despite interest from Real Madrid.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Leny Yoro from Lille. United had an offer accepted last week and the 18-year-old has decided to join the club, despite interest from Real Madrid.",
      "The fee is expected to rise to around €70million (£58.7m) for the Frenchman, who was named in the Ligue 1 Team of the Year after impressing last season. Yoro is poised to become United's second signing of the summer after Joshua Zirkzee arrived from Bologna in a £36.5m move.",
      "It's expected to take their spending to £95.2m for the summer, with more incomings anticipated as they look to sell several squad members. Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire are among the players being linked with moves away as United look to raise some cash.",
      "But who else should United sign this summer? MEN writers have their say on who the Red Devils should target as their next and third arrival in the transfer window...",
      "A centre-back and a striker were the priority for United at the start of this window and if they secure both before heading off on tour it will have to be considered an excellent start. The reality is sales are now required to boost the budget and who goes might condition who is next to arrive.",
      "United will have to sell another central defender, probably Victor Lindelof, and there are midfielders who could depart, notably Casemiro, while there have been bids for Scott McTominay.",
      "Another, slightly more senior centre-back, would be a preference and Matthijs de Ligt could yet tick that box. The most interesting situation is Casemiro's, however. If United are to replace him it probably needs to happen sooner rather than later and that is why midfield should be the next area to look at.",
      "Before the transfer window opened, I said United's priority must be signing a quality defensive midfielder to replace Casemiro and my opinion hasn't changed. The Brazilian's regression was significant last season and persisting with him in the new campaign is inadvisable.",
      "Finding the right player to succeed Casemiro is the challenge. Joao Palhinha appealed, but he's joined Bayern Munich from Fulham and the market isn't bursting with options.",
      "Nonetheless, now a forward and a defender have been brought in - although Leny Yoro's move isn't official yet - United should focus their efforts on signing that player.",
      "Perhaps PSG's midfielder Ugrarte fits the billing and he'd add to the South American influence in the dressing room.",
      "It's clear as day that United need to strengthen their midfield this summer. They need someone to partner Kobbie Mainoo for the long-term as I am not convinced Casemiro can still cut it at the top level. The Brazilian looked way off his best last season, and at 32, should United look to the future? I think so.",
      "Crystal Palace starlet Adam Wharton is the man they should look at. He has impressed since moving to Palace from Blackburn in January and could immediately solve United's midfield problem. That is the area United should look at next, with Wharton the most ideal candidate available right now.",
      "Signing Yoro is a huge coup for United: it also means they don't need to get sucked into time-sensitive transfer sagas, overbidding for targets as they have done in previous summers. So, what do they need to do next? United could do with another centre-back along with Yoro: Matthijs De Ligt fits the bill at the right price. Jarrad Branthwaite would be a superb signing, but looks too expensive at this point - especially with Everton left baffled by the Yoro fee.",
      "A left-back would be welcome given Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia's injury records, while Ten Hag also desperately needs a defensive midfielder: PSG's Manuel Ugarte looks a good prospect for an affordable fee, but that deal likely rests on Casemiro being sold. In truth, the rest of United's transfer window hinges on who can be sold to raise more funds.",
      "If Ineos can get Casemiro, Mason Greenwood, Christian Eriksen and one of Victor Lindelof or Harry Maguire (or both of them) out the door, then De Ligt, Ugarte and a left-back would represent upgrades across the squad. Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho leaving now looks less likely, but if United could sell either then I would also pick up a winger and/or a striker: Ivan Toney and Federico Chiesa would offer goals, experience and depth at affordable prices.",
      "Capturing Matthijs de Ligt as well as Yoro is a mouth-watering prospect but one that could be scuppered by past transfer failings. United are thought to be operating on a net transfer budget of just £50m, having so far received an initial £10m for two sales and spent £36m on the arrival of Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The purchase of Yoro will take the net spend up to £85m with a midfielder still to buy. The probable exit of Mason Greenwood for around £27m will lower this back down to circa £58m but sales will still be needed.",
      "De Ligt would be a great addition but will cost £42m, money that ought to be first spent on a midfielder. United are expected to offload Casemiro and a replacement will be needed.",
      "£101m-rated Joao Neves is too expensive for a player with just 75 club appearances, while a return deal for Sofyan Amrabat seems risky, albeit much cheaper. If a deal under £40m can be secured for Manuel Ugarte, it might be worth the punt.",
      "It's been a promising transfer window for United so far this summer and it will be a welcome relief to fans that they haven't been dragged into the drawn-out transfer sagas of previous years.",
      "If and when Yoro joins then Ten Hag will have two of Europe's brightest young stars joining after the arrival of Zirkzee. It's a mouthwatering prospect to go alongside other young talent including Mainoo, Garnacho and Hojlund.",
      "But midfield remains a concern as United cannot afford to go a whole season with Casemiro trying to cover spaces which left United's defence exposed on countless occasions last term. The priority now has to be a defensive midfielder with PSG's Manuel Ugarte looking like a player who could fit into their new philosophy under Dan Ashworth and Ineos.",
      "Joao Neves would also be a great signing but the fee required to complete a deal is likely to be beyond United's financial means in this window.",
      "The signings of Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro add to both the front and back line options for Erik ten Hag in the upcoming season, so concentration should be now on completing the spine with a midfield addition.",
      "The uncertainty over the future of Casemiro means that United will be short in the area if he is sold. The team will need a long-term partner for Kobbie Mainoo at the base of midfield, Sofyan Amrabat played the role in the FA Cup final but has since turned to Fiorentina.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has been linked with a move to Old Trafford and could be the solution. At just 23-years old he is still young, meaning that the position could be sorted for years to come.",
      "He is said to be available for around £38 million which could prove to be a shrewd long-term investment in midfield.",

      "Leny Yoro caught the eye of those in the Old Trafford directors' box as a 16-year-old and he has the support network to succeed at Man United.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Leny Yoro's first and last appearances for Lille were against Nice. His debut, as a 16-year-old, came in the presence of Sir Dave Brailsford.",
      "Brailsford was at the Allianz Riviera Stadium in his role as the Ineos sporting director of Ineos-owned Nice. He was flanked by Josh Thompson, the group's sports project manager already dubbed Brailsford's \"bag man\" by some at Manchester United.",
      "Where Brailsford goes, Thompson usually follows. He wandered through the mixed zone with Brailsford and Sir Jim Ratcliffe after the FA Cup final and appeared to advise Ratcliffe on an exit strategy that avoided the press.",
      "Thompson closely assists Brailsford and fellow United football board member Jean-Claude Blanc to drive the performance levels. Yoro has gone up a few levels since Brailsford first clapped eyes on him.",
      "The teenager came on in the 78th minute with Lille 2-1 up in May 2022 and they clinched a 3-1 victory. Three of Yoro's 68 appearances for Lille came against Nice.",
      "United sporting director Dan Ashworth championed the development of a signing from Lille at Brighton six years ago. He joined two months before Ashworth's appointment but it was under the Ashworth-Graham Potter axis he emerged into one of the Premier League's most dominant midfielders. Yves Bissouma restored Tottenham's backbone last season.",
      "Ratcliffe said earlier this year United would opt for a grassroots approach in the transfer market and Yoro is very green. Ratcliffe last month lamented the disadvantages of multi-club ownership in the transfer market as the Nice centre back Jean-Clair Todibo had been eyed by United but is now headed for West Ham.",
      "Yoro, six years the 24-year-old Todibo's junior and without any international recognition, is a long-term addition at a club in need of significant short-term gains. Yoro's final fee could trump Lisandro Martinez's yet United lack longevity at centre half, where three of the defenders are in their 30s.",
      "Last season was, in all probability, Victor Lindelof's last with United and next season could be the curtain call for Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans. Yoro will be afforded a season of adaptation, as unforgiving as his position is.",
      "Eight league games in an untried Europa League format should help him find his feet. Maguire and Evans are sound professionals who have been around the block and will offer expert guidance. It is a pity for Yoro that Raphael Varane, another teenage centre half at a northern French club United coveted 13 years ago, came to the end of the road at the club.",
      "Following Zinedine Zidane's intervention in 2011, Sir Alex Ferguson turned to Phil Jones, also 19. Jones is proof a raw defender can make a fearless start at United, even eliciting a barely credulous comparison with Duncan Edwards from Sir Bobby Charlton.",
      "It helped that Jones was a homebird from Blackburn and accustomed to the Premier League. He was emboldened by United's gung-ho approach to the 2011-12 season as they plundered 21 goals in their first six games, which placed him mostly out of harm's way.",
      "Yoro's age will not protect him from scrutiny but he need only look to his left at Martinez, written off by Jamie Carragher (and others) after two appearances. Despite an injury-plagued year, Martinez has been the most successful signing of the Erik ten Hag era.",
      "Newly-signed centre backs at United used to endure baptisms of fire until Eric Bailly, usually the fire starter rather than firefighter, eased some of the heat. He was the man of the match in his first two appearances in 2016, Maguire had a steady start three years later and ditto Varane in 2021. Lindelof was unsteady in his first season and Martinez's mare lasted two games before he helped neutralise a daunting Liverpool attack at Old Trafford.",
      "Bailly was 22 when he was unveiled, Lindelof 23, Maguire 26 and Varane 28. Lindelof was culpable for both goals in newly-promoted Huddersfield's win over United in October 2017 and left the John Smith's Stadium with two hoodies pulled up, skulking out like a criminal leaving court.",
      "Yoro's compatriot, Patrice Evra, was 24 when his debut at Manchester City lasted 45 minutes with United 2-0 down, an experience he likened to being put in a washing machine. Sixteen and a half years later, Tyrell Malacia was hooked at the interval at the same venue with City 4-0 up.",
      "These tales should inspire rather than instil dread in Yoro. He has a good support network among the other centre halves and will be flanked by the bullish Diogo Dalot and backed by the popular Andre Onana.",
      "As well as those who spotted him on the French Riviera.",

      "Man Utd are set to sign an 18-year-old centre-back who was wanted by Real Madrid and the deal is a major milestone for Ineos.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe didn't shy away from the biggest issue that has held Manchester United back when he completed his £1.25bn deal to invest in the club in February.",
      "\"I think recruitment in the modern game is critical. Manchester United have clearly spent a lot of money but they haven't done as well as some other clubs,\" Ratcliffe said in his first sit-down interview as the club's minority owner.",
      "\"So when I was talking about being best-in-class in all aspects of football, recruitment is probably top of the list.\"",
      "The 71-year-old has never really hid his feelings about the transfer operation at Old Trafford. A few years ago he called United the \"dumb money\" in football and a look at the rewards for the £1.6bn spend since 2013 would make that a fair assessment.",
      "In recent months he has touched again on recruitment. He told the Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast that \"the solution isn’t spending a lot of money on a couple of great players\", and then said he wanted to sign the next Kylian Mbappe rather than the man himself.",
      "The extent to which Ratcliffe has placed recruitment at the top of the list in areas to improve can be seen in the overhaul of roles at Old Trafford. Since February, Ineos have appointed Dan Ashworth as sporting director, Jason Wilcox as technical director and Christopher Vivell as interim director of recruitment. Three executives with vast experience in transfers and a reputation as shrewd operators.",
      "They are making a good start as well. The deal for Joshua Zirkzee was wrapped up quickly after his involvement in Euro 2024 came to an end, with a deal agreed with Bologna that helped United navigate their own financial concerns. But it is the second transfer of the summer that looks set to cause a storm.",
      "When United had a bid accepted by Lille for 18-year-old Leny Yoro recently there still wasn't a feeling it was going to happen. The teenager is out of contract next summer so held the ace cards and it had long been expected that he wanted to move to Real Madrid.",
      "But United's aggressive approach in making an offer Lille clearly couldn't refuse tilted the balance and they have convinced him his future can be at Old Trafford. At an initial £52m it is a large fee, rising to £58.7m with add-ons, but that remains well below what Everton want for Jarrad Branthwaite. Yoro has far more high-level exposure at this stage of his career than Branthwaite had at 18, when he spent time on loan at Blackburn and played 10 games in the Championship.",
      "Yoro has already racked up 46 appearances in Ligue 1 and is probably the most highly-rated young centre-back in Europe. The fact he made the Ligue 1 team of the year speaks of his talent and he doesn't turn 19 until November. He could be a United centre-back for years to come.",
      "The deal would certainly be a feather in the cap for Ineos and particularly for Ashworth, Wilcox and Vivell. Convincing Yoro to put aside his ambitions to play for Real Madrid is a significant achievement and he has clearly been sold on the idea of progressing his career at Old Trafford.",
      "They have also acted decisively. Yoro's move to Real had looked like a formality, but while the European champions waited to play hardball over a fee, United stepped in. It is an example of the quick-thinking and nimbleness that Ratcliffe would want the club to show.",
      "There is more work to be in this window, but in a significant couple of months for Ineos they are laying down a marker already.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United fans will admit Pep Guardiola has been at the forefront of evolving tactics.",
      "Guardiola made playing false nines fashionable, he introduced playing out from the back to England and, more recently, began to play central defenders in full-back roles. Other managers have followed Guardiola's tactical innovations and his former assistant manager Mikel Arteta picked up the central defender idea and ran with it at the Emirates.",
      "Arteta has played Ben White out of position and Guardiola has changed the roles of Nathan Ake and Josko Gvardiol, with all three of those regularly playing as full-backs last season, providing extra defensive solidity on the wings and an advantage in build-up play.",
      "Centre backs tend to be significantly better one-on-one defenders than traditional full-backs and that's an obvious positive, but playing a natural centre half as a full-back also allows teams to have a back-three in build-up, which helps to press high and defend counter-attacks.",
      "Playing central defenders out of position became a popular trend last season and Liverpool and Aston Villa played Joe Gomez and Ezri Konsa as their full-backs respectively. The four teams who finished at the top Premier League all used the innovation, which suggests there's an advantage in doing so if implemented correctly.",
      "Now enter United and Erik ten Hag, who has often instructed his full-backs to play an inverted role, which is why Diogo Dalot comes into midfield from the right. Perhaps Ten Hag is happy with his current system and believes it doesn't need to be tweaked, but an elite manager adapts to the players at his disposal and the United squad is changing this summer, with Leny Yoro coming in and Aaron Wan-Bissaka expected to leave.",
      "Wan-Bissaka has entered the final year of his contract and selling him this summer is the last opportunity to recoup a decent fee for someone who was signed for £50m in the summer of 2019, with West Ham said to be interested.",
      "Although moving on Wan-Bissaka would leave Dalot as the only senior right-back in the squad, Yoro is flying to Manchester for a medical and is an option in that role. Yoro is a natural centre-back and made 44 appearances at the heart of Lille's defence last season, but starting in central defence at just 18 years old in the Premier League is bound to be a tough challenge and he could be eased into the team at right-back.",
      "Like every player at his age, Yoro needs time to physically develop and playing him at right-back would allow him to improve and gain experience without coming under the cosh in central defence. As the last line of defence, centre-backs are exposed and tested by the opposition more than any other outfield players and Yoro might not be ready for that challenge.",
      "He is a defender for the future - United hope he'll become one of the world's best - but immediately chucking him into the deep end is inadvisable. Yoro has the qualities to excel at right-back for United.",
      "It might not be a position Yoro has played before, but he's comfortable with the ball at his feet, he intelligently reads the game and his natural athleticism will help him adapt. His long-term future is in the middle but it wouldn't be a surprise to see him at right-back this season.",

Interest in the France international is high, though, and despite it looking like he was going to join Juventus, West Ham have agreed a deal with Nice to sign the 24-year-old.",
      "The Hammers have struck an initial loan deal with an option to sign Todibo for £27million next summer and it is now up to the player to decide whether he wants to move to East London. West Ham are looking to reshape their defence under new manager Julen Lopetegui and have already signed Max Kilman from Wolverhampton Wanderers for £40million.",

The 26-year-old is out of contract next summer and this transfer window represents the last chance United have to recoup a significant fee for a player they paid £40million to sign from Crystal Palace five years ago.",
      "Reports suggest West Ham want to strike a £15million deal for Wan-Bissaka, and while that would represent a significant loss on the fee they paid to sign him, any player sales will go towards United's own rebuild this summer. Erik ten Hag's side have already secured the £36million signing of Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna, while they are expected to seal a £58.7million deal for Lille defender Leny Yoro.",

      "The 18-year-old will join for an initial £42m, with the rest of the fee made up of add-ons as United look to overhaul their defensive options.",
      "They have also agreed personal terms with Bayern Munich's Matthijs De Ligt and have had two bids rejected for Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite. However, they may need to sell the likes of Mason Greenwood and Victor Lindelof to help fund those deals.",
      "“Now into a new financial year, Manchester United have the ability to be more flexible with additions, although the sales of the likes of Donny van de Beek, Willy Kambwala, and Alvaro Fernandez should be instructive as to United’s approach to the summer window, which will require money to be recouped before adding yet more transfer debt, something Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to reduce,\" Powell said.",
      "“The reported fee for Leny Yoro is €62m (£52m), with €50m (£42m) of that guaranteed and the rest made up of add-ons. For amortisation purposes, only the £42m guaranteed sum would be accounted for annually, which would be £8.4m per year on the assumption that he signs a five-year deal.",
      "\"The add-ons would appear on the balance sheet as extraordinary costs as and when they are activated, be it through performance or making a certain number of appearances.",
      "“With the sales of Kambwala and Fernandez both being sales of United graduates, they allow for the club to book pure profit to the tune of some £11.4m combined.",
      "\"As for Van de Beek, the Dutchman had one year left on his United deal, and a remaining book value of £7m, although loan fees recouped from his time elsewhere means that has largely been accounted for. United have reportedly received a fee of £423,000, but it is a deal that has add-ons that could rise to as high as £5m, plus it removes some wage pressures on the payroll.",
      "“United have the flexibility to move for Yoro, and cashflow isn’t an issue in terms of a payment plan, but in order for future additions, such as Jarrad Branthwaite, they will likely have to go to the well of selling off talent, with Mason Greenwood, Victor Lindelof, and Harry Maguire all potentially on the block, although a profit on Maguire may be challenging.”",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Man United were deservedly beaten by Rosenborg in a Norwegian friendly that Erik ten Hag will have learnt little from.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have played in Norway in five of their last six pre-season schedules and the organisers may want to reconsider that jaunt for next summer's schedule.",
      "Five members of the 25-man United squad were senior players and it showed in a sterile friendly that sounded about as atmospheric as a Sunday league game. United ambassador Ronny Johnsen went off-message during MUTV's coverage when he commented on how quiet the atmosphere was. Such is the enthusiasm of United's Nordic following, it was a 21,000 sell-out at the Lerkendal Stadium.",
      "The referee's refusal to put everyone out of their misery and add three minutes of stoppage time did at least yield a goal in the 93rd-minute winner from Rosenborg substitute Noah Emmanuel Jean Holm. That was the least the dominant hosts merited against a hotchpotch United. \"The performance was below standards,\" Erik ten Hag admitted.",
      "The Norwegian contingent of United's support did not expect European Championship or Copa America participants but would have anticipated the presence of Andre Onana, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Antony and Amad.",
      "That quintet was back at Carrington. Steve McClaren, not in Norway, is on crutches after a foot operation, so the training back at base will have been minimal. United could at least have fielded a five-a-side team in the local power league.",
      "Back in Norway, Ten Hag learnt little. He did not say that, of course. Jose Mourinho was not shy in dismissing friendly matches with shadow squads and this was a particularly pointless excursion.",
      "Not for everyone, though. Radek Vitek was exceptional in goal, Ethan Wheatley was one of the few bright starters and Toby Collyer captained United on his maiden senior appearance.",
      "Nine of the players who emerged for the second half had never played under Ten Hag. They will always be able to say they represented the United first team and cherish their match shirts.",
      "Couching this as a first team friendly was disingenuous. It was about as senior as the United academy's exhibition match with Wrexham in San Diego last year. That turned out to be their most eventful tour fixture, with Paul Mullin maimed by United's goalkeeping competition winner Nathan Bishop.",
      "Vitek replaced Bishop at the pause that evening and his performance in Norway would suggest he has a higher ceiling. The 20-year-old pulled off at least five saves and his glove onto the crossbar from Emil Frederikson was world-class. The United goal led a charmed life and Rosenborg hit the woodwork four times.",
      "United have stockpiled goalkeepers from Eastern Europe in recent years but they made a tidy profit on the impressive Matej Kovar when he joined Bayer Leverkusen for €9million next year. His compatriot Vitek, on loan at League Two Accrington Stanley earlier this year, will not be playing at that low a level next season.",
      "At the other end, Wheatley applied himself with a purpose that suggests he does not want to be remembered as United's 250th academy graduate. The 18-year-old's portrait now graces the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year plaque at Carrington and last year it was Kobbie Mainoo's face.",
      "“In my team talk, I said yesterday, Copa America final: involving Alejandro Garnacho,\" Ten Hag told MUTV before kick-off. \"Euros final: Kobbie Mainoo. Last season, same game (against Leeds United in Oslo): Kobbie Mainoo was part of that match.\"",
      "There was not a performance comparable with Mainoo's accomplished half against Leeds but Wheatley was responsible for United's only attempt on target in a humdrum first half.",
      "Mason Mount endeavoured to raise the tempo and played Wheatley in. Mount, starting in midfield with Casemiro, will struggle to stay there when Mainoo returns from his overdue holiday and Ten Hag may have to tinker with his role over the next few weeks against Rangers, Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool.",
      "Ten Hag opined to a confidant towards the end of last season the rookies he was forced to name on the bench were not ready. That was apparent against the 11th-placed Norwegian side (out of 16), though Rosenborg are 14 games into the Tippeligaen season.",
      "Collyer, Habeeb Ogunneye, Rhys Bennett, Harry Amass and Joe Hugill were all unused substitutes in first team games last season. Bennett's positioning was awry for the only goal yet he lacked support from those in front of him.",
      "A little like Vitek.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Listening to Erik ten Hag speak in Norway you were left with the impression that two things in particular will need to change for this season go better than the last one. Manchester United's fitness record must improve and Ineos' new football structure needs to deliver greater depth to the squad.",
      "Ten Hag didn't put a number on the quantity of signings required to be competitive again, instead pointing to the fact with most of his first-team stars available United ended last season by 'beating the best team in the world'. You can't argue with that.",
      "They didn't show that level consistently enough, however, which is why they finished eighth in the Premier League. Ten Hag constantly pointed to a disastrous injury record to mitigate that underperformance.",
      "He is expecting this summer to beef up his squad, although it remains possible that the numbers will shrink with several players likely to be sold. It will be about shoring up the quality just behind the starting XI, which is what the £35.7m deal for Joshua Zirkzee does, while spending £52m on an 18-year-old Leny Yoro is another example of adding real quality to the squad.",
      "After that, it will be about getting players fit and keeping them there. Ten Hag has made no secret of the running requirements to play his style of football and in Trondheim, there was a hint of unhappiness about the physical capacity of some of his players in the first week of pre-season.",
      "The demands are only going to rise this season. United will play eight Europa League group games rather than six, with the league structure now finishing in January. The players themselves might be relieved they haven't qualified for FIFA's dreadful Club World Cup next summer, a month-long tournament that finally turns the sport into a year-round jamboree where pockets are lined but players are exploited.",
      "For now, United's squad can at least comfort themselves with the idea of a break at the end of the season, but Ten Hag didn't exactly play down the most important aspect of the season ahead. \"You need squad depth,\" he said. \"Then it's about survival of the fittest.\"",
      "That sounds like a neat catchphrase for the start of the game's most demanding season yet. It will also set alarm bells ringing at Carrington given last season resembled more an episode of Casualty than Bear Grylls.",
      "End-of-season research by the Premier Injuries website revealed United suffered the most in 2023/24, with 45 separate cases affecting 21 players, with a total of 1,620 days lost to those on the sidelines. That doesn't include Tyrell Malacia, who was injured before the season started and never returned.",
      "Those injuries robbed Ten Hag of continuity, especially in defence, and the medical issues have to be rectified for this season. Many of those problems were muscle injuries picked up in training at Carrington.",
      "This season won't just be about a repeat of avoiding those setbacks, however. It's not solely about not getting injuries, but about being fit enough to outrun the opposition twice a week, week after week. That is partly what Ten Hag is getting at when he says this season will be the \"survival of the fittest.\"",
      "We know how important running stats are to Ten Hag. He made that perfectly clear when his team were trampled all over by Brentford in just his second game in charge. There were some grumbles in pre-season a year ago about the demanding nature of some of the double sessions.",
      "This summer United are cutting down on travelling and will spend a significant chunk of their US tour in Los Angeles. It will make for a better work environment and was a key demand for Ten Hag when planning the trip.",
      "On those training pitches, he will hope to lay the foundations for a season when the ability of teams to keep going will be tested more than ever before. It will be survival of the fittest and Ten Hag will be desperate to make sure his players are ready for the challenge.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United appear to be closing in on their second signing of the summer transfer window, with defender Leny Yoro agreeing to join.",
      "United had a bid accepted by Lille for the 18-year-old last week, but the teenager was said to have his heart set on a move to Real Madrid. It now seems that he has changed his mind and has decided to push on with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "A deal for Yoro could rise to as much as €70 million (£58.7m) with add-ons. If a deal goes through then he is expected to be available for the club’s pre-season tour in America next week.",
      "Yoro’s arrival could however have a big impact on another transfer the club has been working on. United have been in talks over a move for Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt for the last few weeks and have reached a verbal agreement with the Dutchman over personal terms.",
      "However, reports this week suggested that the transfer had been delayed due to the move for Yoro. De Ligt is valued at £42 million by Bayern, and it is said that United didn’t have an expectation of signing both the 24-year-old and Yoro this summer, suggesting that interest in the Ajax man could now be dropped.",
      "It leaves United with a decision to make. If they push ahead with a move for De Ligt it would take their spending up to £137.2 million on three transfers. United confirmed the £36.5 million capture of Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee over the weekend.",
      "Erik ten Hag has been keen to add to his defensive options this summer, with the departure of Raphael Varane. There has also been uncertainty over the future of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof who are both out of contract next year, the club will need replacements if one, or even both move on this summer.",
      "One thing that could point towards the club continuing their pursuit of De Ligt was their stance on Jarrad Branthwaite. It was reported that United were keen to do deals for both the Everton man and De Ligt this summer, when news of interest in the Ajax centre-back emerged.",
      "Branthwaite will have cost United more in terms of transfer fee than Yoro has. If the club have therefore moved on from the Everton defender, then the plan to sign De Ligt could potentially remain in place.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was charmed by Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund posing together on the Old Trafford advertising hoardings after a goal last season.",
      "Those players are the future of Manchester United and Leny Yoro can be added to that bracket when he completes his transfer from Lille in a deal that could rise to €70million.",
      "That fee equates to £58.7m which represents value for a player who is regarded as one of the brightest prospects in European football. Real Madrid were interested in Yoro but United have made a breakthrough and his signing will be a statement of intent.",
      "Yoro is just 18 years old and his potential is vast. United could build their defence around the Frenchman for the next decade and he will complete a young core of the team, with Mainoo in midfield, Hojlund leading the attack and Garnacho on the left or right wing.",
      "Yoro is the type of signing Sir Alex Ferguson would target and he possesses similar raw attributes to Rio Ferdinand when the United great was on the cusp of signing from Leeds.",
      "It made sense for Lille to sell Yoro considering he'd entered the final year of his contract, but United have done well to steal a march on their rivals to make a breakthrough to sign him.",
      "Yoro is on his way to Manchester for a medical and he will become the club's second signing of the summer window after the arrival of Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna for £36.5m. United have made a strong start to the transfer window and there is still plenty more work to do.",
      "However, the signing of Yoro should be regarded as a coup and supporters have already shared their delight at the club landing one of the hottest prospects in football.",
      "Yoro made his senior debut for Lille aged 16 and it didn't take long for him to become a key first-team player. He made 44 appearances in all competitions last season - not starting in just one of those games - and demonstrated his quality against Aston Villa in the Conference League.",
      "Aston Villa progressed to the semi-finals of the Conference League with a victory over Lille on penalties, but Yoro announced himself to a wider British audience over those two legs.",
      "Although Yoro still has scope to physically mature, which is par for the course at his age, he oozed quality and composure against Villa and that bodes well for this season.",
      "The Premier League poses different challenges to Ligue 1, but Yoro is equipped with the attributes to succeed in England and will become an even better player with the benefit of time.",
      "United fans want to challenge for the Premier League title as soon as possible but they aren't daft. The club hasn't come close to winning the league since 2013 - United were 19 points behind Manchester City in 2017/18 - and a title challenge is at least a few years away, realistically.",
      "Ratcliffe has shared that sentiment in his interviews since acquiring a minority stake and the early signs of his co-ownership show United are taking a longer-term view for success.",
      "United are hopeful Yoro will develop into one of the world's best defenders and he's the final piece of a talented, youthful core that could play together for many years.",
      "Mainoo confirmed himself as an exceptional prospect last season and was superb at Euro 2024 for England. Hojlund enjoyed a solid first season, scoring 16 goals, and Garnacho has been likened to a young Cristiano Ronaldo, who was full of confidence yet raw at United.",
      "When you add Yoro to that list of players, United have four talented youngsters who will eventually form the core of the team, which is a genuinely exciting prospect to savour.",
      "It might take five years to challenge for the Premier League, but Ratcliffe is building for long-term success and United undoubtedly have an exciting crop of youngsters.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already made his first signing at Manchester United, but Paul Ince believes the squad needs a new striker with Premier League experience if they're to improve",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been advised to target English stars Ivan Toney and Ollie Watkins this summer.",
      "Ratcliffe recently began his first summer as a United investor by signing Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee for £36.5million, while Lille's teenage centre-half Leny Yoro is on his way to Old Trafford too for around £50m. But the British billionaire has a significant amount of work on his hands if he hopes to improve the club's fortunes in the coming campaign.",
      "A surprising 1-0 pre-season defeat to Norwegian team Rosenborg highlighted the challenges that lie ahead, and it's clear United's transfer dealings are far from over. Former Old Trafford star Paul Ince has urged his old club to prioritise securing an experienced Premier League striker - specifically Toney and Watkins - to alleviate the scoring pressure on young Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Aston Villa ace Watkins and Brentford frontman Toney made waves with their performances for England at Euro 2024. Toney confidently converted his penalty in the shootout win against Switzerland, while Watkins scored a memorable goal against the Netherlands to propel England into the final.",
      "Both players have attracted considerable attention this summer, with Toney of particular interest to clubs as his contract expires in 2025. The Bees will be reluctant to let their top scorer leave for free next year, however, making a sale during this transfer window likely.",
      "Ince, 56, firmly believes United desperately need a major revamp, with a particular focus on recruiting a striker who can consistently find the back of the net at the highest level. In an interview with Ladbrokes 1-2-Free (via The Mirror), he said: \"They've got to strengthen a lot this summer.",
      "\"When you look at a team before pre-season starts, and you start identifying where you might want to strengthen, you don't want to make wholesale changes. You know, you want to keep the core of the team. But when you look at Manchester United, they need at least seven players, arguably in the starting XI.\"",
      "United have to be careful about spending outside their means despite winning the FA Cup to qualify for next season's Europa League. And Ince went on to identify other specific areas in which reinforcements are required, with striker top of the wish-list.",
      "He continued: \"Raphael Varane is gone now, Lisandro Martinez has been injured pretty much all season, so there's an issue there; can he compete for 40 or more games per season? We've got Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who we're trying to sell. Luke Shaw has spent a lot of time out.",
      "\"Casemiro is going to move on, and we still haven't found that holding number six. Antony hasn't been performing, so do you get someone in to replace him? Marcus Rashford hasn't been at his best, and Rasmus Hojlund is still a young striker. That's so many areas of the pitch you would say need improving.",
      "\"I think that's what we need to get; a top, top striker, like an Ollie Watkins, like an Ivan Toney. Someone like that, who knows the league, to play up front and let Hojlund take his time and settle in. Listen, I'm sure the new people behind the scenes know what they're doing.\"",
      "A proven striker in England's top-flight is sure to command a hefty fee. Brentford have reportedly put a £60m price tag on Toney despite his contract expiring next summer, and Villa would demand more for Watkins.",
      "The player's current market value is understood to be around £85m, but that could increase as Villa look to offload other assets to balance their books. Douglas Luiz's £42m sale to Juventus has already helped ease their woes in that sector, but other departures may be on the cards.",
      "Winger Moussa Diaby is believed to be attracting interest from Saudi Arabian clubs, while back-up forward Jhon Duran is on West Ham's radar.",
      "With several potential departures at United, the funds raised could pave the way for them to make a move for either of the England stars.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Imminent Manchester United signing Leny Yoro has received high praise from his Lille teammate Angel Gomes.",
      "United have agreed a £58.7million deal with the French club for the 18-year-old, who is set to fly to Manchester to finalise personal terms. Yoro had been on Real Madrid's radar, but the Spanish giants were unwilling to meet Lille's asking price.",
      "United academy graduate Gomes, who left Old Trafford in June 2020 after just 10 senior appearances, has been impressed by Yoro's maturity and ability to fit into the first-team environment at Lille despite his young age. Previously speaking to Eurosport, he said: \"As soon as he arrived in the group, I understood that he was going to reach the summits.",
      "\"When I discovered the pros at the age of 16 at Manchester United, I understood that it was different. He already had the right temperament. That's not normal for a 16- or 17-year-old player arriving. It's like he's already an experienced player and it showed in the way he trained, the way he behaved. His progress was obvious.\"",
      "While investing in young talent can be risky, United have reaped the rewards of trusting their youth players, with Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho making significant strides.",
      "United are keen to strengthen their defence following a challenging season. Erik ten Hag has identified Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Jarrad Branthwaite as potential targets, with the aim of securing at least two of these players. However, the acquisition of a second player may hinge on the future of Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire.",
      "Lille's president, Olivier Letang, has confirmed that Yoro will be available for transfer this summer. Initially, Yoro favoured a move to Real Madrid, but United's persuasive approach has swayed him towards an immediate transfer - a preference shared by his current club.",
      "United's management sees Yoro as a promising talent who could become a key figure in their defence over the next decade.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Man United now have to get into the habit of not letting the manager solely decide players' futures. That forward planning has already started.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",
      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",
      "Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.",

      "Man Utd need to make at least a couple of key signings during the summer transfer window but getting away from the 'United tax' is never easy.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",

Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",

      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",

Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone.

      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United face a busy few days in the transfer market, especially when it comes to centre-back.",
      "United have already completed the signing of Joshua Zirkzee on a permanent deal from Bologna. The striker will be part of Erik ten Hag's squad for the upcoming season and could be one of several new additions this summer.",
      "Centre-back is an area of the squad that United are known to be looking at strengthening this summer. Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt is a known target and is already understood to have verbally agreed personal terms with United.",
      "Two other players of interest to United are Lille's Leny Yoro and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite. The Reds are close to completing the signing of Yoro on a long-term contract, beating Liverpool and Real Madrid to his signature.",
      "United have agreed a deal worth €70million (£58.7million) to sign Yoro this summer. It's also expected that the 18-year-old defender will be part of United's squad that travels to the USA for pre-season.",
      "Branthwaite is also a player of interest to United. The Reds have had two bids rejected for the Everton defender but United still thought to want to sign the centre-back this summer.",
      "Yoro and Branthwaite enjoyed successful individual seasons last season. The Lille defender made 44 appearances in all competitions to guide the French club to fourth in the Ligue 1 standings.",
      "Branthwaite enjoyed his first full season at Everton after spending the previous campaign on loan at PSV Eindhoven. The 21-year-old made 41 appearances in all competitions and played a key role in helping the Toffees avoid relegation from the Premier League.",
      "The numbers behind both of Yoro's and Branthwaite's seasons show why United are interested in signing the duo. According to FBref, Yoro had a 54.8 percent tackle success rate for Lille which is not as high as the 72.6 percent of Branthwaite at Everton.",
      "Branthwaite also has the advantage when it comes to winning aerial duels. The Everton defender has a 68.6 success rate with heading in duels compared to the 63.8 percent of Yoro.",
      "While these two stats are far from being the defining factors for signing players, Branthwaite has certainly shown his capabilities of being a successful defender. That's not to say Yoro's numbers are not impressive - far from it - merely that United are expressing an interest in two talented centre-backs in the same transfer window.",

The France Under 23s international is set to sign a long-term contract and will follow forward Joshua Zirkzee, who signed from Bologna for £35.2m over the weekend, through the door.",

That is set to be their first competitive outing since beating City in the FA Cup final back in May - a win that helped save Erik ten Hag's job.",
      "United started with Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane as the centre-back pairing for that one. But with Martinez set for some time on holiday after Argentina won the Copa America on Sunday and Varane not at United after his contract expired, Ten Hag could name an entirely different duo.",
      "In order to help Yoro get acclimatised after his move to United, this could be the perfect game to give him his first start. With that mind, Yoro could be named in the XI alongside one of Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof or Martinez if the Argentine is back following his country's Copa America win.",
      "With the defender struggling with injury last season, though, United may decide to rest him up further ahead of the new season if they have any lingering concerns over his fitness. Matthijs de Ligt is another name linked with a move to the Red Devils and would go straight into the team if he does make the switch across from Bayern Munich.",
      "But should that not be the case, Yoro will be partnered alongside Martinez with Luke Shaw, who could return after helping England reach the Euro 2024 final, on the left side of the back line and Diogo Dalot on the right. The defensive four would be supported by Andre Onana, who is set to continue as first-choice.",

      "Any United fan who parted with their money for an MUTV login to watch Monday's match could have been forgiven for wondering what had changed. A depleted squad with half of the established players absent and the goal peppered with shots. Rosenborg racked up 22 attempts at goal and hit the woodwork four times.",
      "Managers receive a hospital pass when they return for pre-season in a summer of international tournaments and Ten Hag confirmed the obvious in Norway: the majority of the squad members will not be in the squad when the season starts. It was a meaningless excursion.",
      "Yet he has form for pillorying performances in pre-season. Ten Hag likened United's defence to a \"pack of cards\" collapsing for a goal against South Melbourne two years ago and described aspects of the defeat to Borussia Dortmund in Las Vegas last year as \"unforgivable\".",
      "There is a misconception that those who cover United are the most negative when usually it is the club or sections of the support. This was especially the case with the manager making a mountain out of a molehill in Scandinavia.",
      "Ten Hag will at least be able to add early European Championship departees Scott McTominay, Christian Eriksen and Rasmus Hojlund to the passenger manifest for next week's flight to Los Angeles. So there's a potential XI of Onana, Wan-Bissaka, Yoro, Maguire, Casemiro, McTominay, Mount, Amad, Antony, Rashford and Hojlund, albeit minus a specialist left back. Perhaps Antony, scorer of fewer goals than Maguire last season, can be recast there.",
      "United have a 27-man squad but nearly a third are deemed sellable or must-sell. Willy Kambwala was out of contract next year, the price was right and he was a rookie squad member with limited first-team experience, so he was sold.",
      "That logic will be applied to just about any other United player who has entered the last year of their deal, regardless of whether there is a one-year option. Amad is now bracketed among the youngsters Ten Hag has hot-housed and regarded as a more integral squad member but he changed representation recently. A new contract has to be in the offing.",
      "Of the potential team to face Arsenal in Los Angeles on Saturday week, only Onana, Evans, Mount and Hojlund are absolutely assured of retaining their status as United players when the transfer window closes on August 30. Ten Hag has reiterated better squad depth is essential and Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee are steps in the right direction. The reintegration of the unapologetic Jadon Sancho is a step backwards.",
      "\"We know in the depth we need more players,\" Ten Hag told colleagues at the Lerkendal Stadion. \"Especially this season.\" Twenty-seven players with first team experience is a reasonable number yet up to eight could be sold and all would have to be replaced.",
      "Wan-Bissaka and Lindelof have to go, Sevilla had an option to buy Hannibal Mejbri, Facundo Pellistri was scheduled to leave on loan last summer until Amad succumbed to injury, a bid was accepted for Maguire and a separate offer for McTominay rejected. United have turned down bids for McTominay this summer and Christian Eriksen is inessential.",
      "Leny Yoro is inbound but, for now, United have four centre backs and three are aged 30, 31 and 36. Next in line is Will Fish, on loan at Hibernian the past two years. Little wonder United are open to recruiting up to three centre backs.",
      "Reinforcing a porous defence has been prioritised yet as much of a problem as that depleted department last season was the lack of protection in front of it. Casemiro operates at nearly as glacial a pace as Joe Biden and there is no alternative defensive midfielder.",
      "Sofyan Amrabat is in limbo at Fiorentina, where he has not returned to training, and his loan with United expired 17 days ago. Of course, that is how long United took to decide to keep Ten Hag.",
      "Amrabat is still inexplicably listed among the first team players on the United website even though that privilege ended two weeks ago. Hopefully the accountants have not given him two weeks' pay.",
      "Had Amrabat's form amounted to four months rather than four games then the option to buy would have likely been triggered. It still might. If it is, it would be as unconvincing as their X account's post.",

      "Should Manchester United wish to complete all of their transfer targets, they may need to look for a bargain at some point.",
      "Once Leny Yoro’s arrival is confirmed the club will have already splashed around £95m on two players, with Joshua Zirkzee costing £36m. United set out to look for a new striker, midfielder and central defenders this summer.",
      "Yoro and Zirkzee tick off two objectives with more signings anticipated. A midfielder is needed and should be the club’s next summer mission given the fragility in the centre of the park last season, Kobbie Mainoo aside.",
      "Despite Zirkzee’s arrival, United have been softly tipped to make an approach for Ivan Toney. This is questionable for a number of reasons, including the fact that the Brentford attacker would cost a hefty sum.",
      "United are thought to be operating on a net spend of around £50m this summer and have already chalked up a net expenditure of £80m given the small sales of Donny van de Beek, Willy Kambwala and Alvaro Fernandez, although this figure could shrink due to add-ons.",
      "Toney’s arrival would not only disturb the balance of the finance sheets but also potentially cause frontline disruption. A back-up role for Rasmus Hojlund would have been ideal upon his arrival last summer but now he is first-choice, relegating him backwards would not bode well for squad contentment.",
      "That is why Zirkzee has been brought in, to support and challenge Hojlund to reach his full potential. Another striker signing is unlikely. But if United are insistent on another attacker, then Yoro’s Lille teammate, Jonathan David, would be a sensible option to consider.",
      "The Canada international, who finished as Ligue 1’s second-highest scorer last term with 19 goals, is widely reported to have a release clause of just £25m. He has been told by Lille that he can secure an exit this summer with just a year left on his deal.",
      "The issue is, though, he would likely wish guarantees over game time - something United cannot offer with Hojlund and now Zirkzee at the club. But triggering his £25m clause would at least mean a chat could be had amid a more realistic transfer prospect than that of Toney to United.",

      "Osimhen scored 31 goals in all competitions during the 2022/23 campaign, where he helped fire Napoli to the Serie A title. Despite a disappointing title defence which saw the Naples side finish tenth in Serie A last term, Osimhen still managed 17 goals in all competitions and the time could be right for a new challenge.",
      "A move to Paris would see him compete with French international forward Randal Kolo Muani and Portuguese international forward Goncalo Ramos for regular football and it would be a blow for Chelsea, who were keen to sign him this summer.",

      "There was a spiky defeat to Atletico Madrid two years ago and Kobbie Mainoo imposed himself during a 45-minute run-out against Leeds last year. There was little to write home about from playing against Valerenga, Kristiansund and Rosenborg. The latter two 1-0s were settled by goals in added time.",

      "Man Utd need a defensive midfielder to come through the ranks and they could have one in the making after a bright debut in Trondheim for Toby Collyer.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "When Casemiro took off the captain's armband in the away dressing room at Lerkendal and strapped it onto Toby Collyer's bicep, the symbolism would have hung heavy in the air. This wasn't a changing of the guard just yet, but Manchester United's two captains on the night hinted at careers going in different directions.",
      "For Casemiro, this was the kind of start to pre-season he didn't want. It's perhaps a little surprising the 32-year-old is still around, but interest from Saudi Arabia hasn't emerged and as it stands he looks likely to see through a third campaign in Manchester. He needs the snap to return to his game.",
      "His last competitive involvement was pulling out of the FA Cup final squad between the teamsheets being submitted and then confirmed. He was due to be a substitute at Wembley but felt tightness and withdrew. It summed up a season in which he looked and played like a veteran entering the twilight of his career.",
      "The Brazilian doesn't turn 33 until February but has had a demanding career in Europe and has a build that suggests fitness doesn't always come easily to him. He was a weak link in United's midfield for much of last season, although the open nature of that department didn't exactly offer him much protection.",
      "Maybe he will be better in a smarter system this term and against Rosenborg there were a couple of nice passes, but he fell over scuffing a clearance in his box and was pounced on and lost possession just outside the area. It was an inauspicious start for a player who will want to prove the career obituaries are being penned too early.",
      "It was certainly a contrast to Collyer, who strode onto the pitch with his socks rolled low, looking more of a throwback than the man he had replaced. But he played like a modern No.6.",
      "His former Brighton Under-18s coach Mark Beard once labelled him the best defensive midfielder in the country for his age. He is a month older than Adam Wharton, who has excelled for first-team exposure and was part of England's Euro 2024 squad, although he didn't kick a ball.",
      "Until Monday night, the closest Collyer had come to playing on a big stage was in the academy friendly against Wrexham in San Diego a year ago. This was a bigger night than that and he looked the part in a callow second-half side.",
      "He was combative and strong in the tackle, took up intelligent positions to block attacks and used the ball well, happy to receive it from the defence or goalkeeper Radek Vitek and try and keep it moving forward. One flick on the left touchline to the advancing Harry Amass was a stylish contribution.",
      "Collyer recently signed a new four-year contract at Old Trafford and although he hasn't yet played for the first team, Erik ten Hag insisted on being present for the signing of the paperwork. This is a player he rates highly, as seen by the decision to give him the captaincy for the second half on Monday night.",
      "He will get further chances this summer as well. Collyer is expected to go on the pre-season tour to the United States, with Scott McTominay and Christian Eriksen returning from their summer breaks to boost options in midfield. Ten Hag has urged the youngsters involved in pre-season to take their opportunity, just as Kobbie Mainoo did a year ago. Collyer could be the biggest beneficiary of more first-team exposure.",
      "He plays in a position that United have struggled to fill for a long time now. Casemiro looked to be the answer in his first season but the £70m signing now has questions to answer. There is still a chance United sell and look to sign a younger player in that position during this window.",
      "Sofyan Amrabat contributed last season and United still haven't decided whether to try and sign the 27-year-old on a permanent deal, though the player is keen to return to Old Trafford. Amrabat isn't good enough in possession and it would be a retrograde step, while Ten Hag has decided McTominay is best utilised further forward and there is interest again in the Scot this summer.",
      "It's expecting too much for Collyer to force his way into the starting XI for the opening day of the league campaign, but he could emerge as a rotation option this season. If Casemiro does go a replacement will be signed, but with a little more experience under his belt, Collyer could become a first-team option in a position where United really need a succession plan.",

      "Malacia last played a competitive fixture for the Netherlands in the UEFA Nations League on June 14 but went under the knife a month later shortly after pre-season began. The defender sustained a knee injury at the end of the 2022/23 campaign and surgery was eventually required, despite United initially looking to manage it with pain injections.",
      "After that initial operation, Malacia required another round of surgery and his prolonged absence has been a source of frustration for Erik ten Hag, but he's now closing in on a return to full fitness and is currently undergoing an individual programme to complete his rehabilitation.",
      "United released fresh footage of Malacia training individually under the guidance of a member of medical staff and he is wearing a device around his left knee. For the first time since his injury, Malacia was seen with the ball at his feet during the session, which suggests he could be available for selection in August.",
      "It's understood the club are carefully handling Malacia's return to prevent any further setbacks, as the player has already missed more than a year during his time on the sidelines. United went the majority of the season without their senior left-backs, Luke Shaw and Malacia, due to injury and Sergio Reguilon was signed on loan as a stopgap signing.",
      "Ten Hag went on record to express his frustration at injuries in that area and many fans believe United should sign a new left-back in the summer transfer window. Malacia was on crutches after his initial injury and spent some time in the Netherlands to recover, and a source indicated he was expected to return before 2024.",
      "However, Malacia's setback delayed his return and Shaw sustaining different muscle injuries throughout the season compounded the problem at left-back. Malacia has made a total of 39 appearances for United.",

      "Mainoo, who played alongside Kambwala in the UEFA Youth League before establishing himself in the senior squad, expressed his support on social media, commenting \"Big love bro, all the best,\" on Kambwala's Instagram post announcing his move.",
      "Kambwala shared his gratitude and reflections on his time at United: \"Dear @manchesterunited, I arrived at the club as a boy with a dream and today I'm leaving like a young man who has fulfilled his dream,\" he posted. \"From the academy to the first team, it's time for me to start a new adventure after 4 wonderful seasons at the club\".",

      "Ten Hag was keen to play his new additions as much as possible, with the Dutchman eventually deciding to move Lisandro Martinez into midfield to accommodate his signings. This worked a treat, with all three defenders playing regularly in their first season at the club.",
      "De Ligt and Branthwaite was the partnership that saw the most game time in the simulation, with the latter making 41 appearances, one more than De Ligt. As the least experienced, Yoro was eased into the squad, but in his 28 appearances the Frenchman averaged a rating of 7.03 per game along with five assists - the same rating as De Ligt, and higher than Branthwaite (6.98).",
      "At the end of the 2024/25 season, Football Manager 2024 put together an overall best United XI, based on performances, statistics, and other metrics. This is what it looked like:",
      "Full United best XI: (4-3-3):  Onana; Dalot, De Ligt, Branthwaite, Shaw; Martinez, Fernandes, Mainoo; Garnacho, Hojlund, Rashford.",
      "De Ligt and Branthwaite were the centre-back partnership in the best XI, with Yoro missing out. Martinez made the best XI as a holding midfielder, with Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo completing the midfield three.",
      "New signing Joshua Zirkzee failed to make the best XI with Rasmus Hojlund scoring more goals than the Dutchman. Both Maguire and Lindelof were sold in the simulation, leaving little competition for the new signings.",
      "With De Ligt, Branthwaite and Yoro all settling in nicely at Old Trafford, their impact was felt in the Premier League, with Ten Hag's side improving massively in the 2024/25 season. At the end of the campaign, United finished fifth, but it was their defensive record that impressed the most.",
      "20 wins, 13 draws, and five losses saw United end the season on 73 points, 13 more than the previous season, and only seven points off the top four. Ten Hag's side conceded just 31 goals in the league, giving them the joint-best defensive record in the league along with Tottenham.",
      "United earned a spot in the Champions League for the following season in the simulation, but it wasn't to do with finishing fifth. A fantastic European campaign saw Ten Hag's side win the Europa League, with Marcus Rashford scoring twice as United beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the final.",
      "Overall, FM24 predicts that if United can sign Branthwaite, De Ligt and Yoro, their defence could improve drastically, with Ten Hag's side winning a European trophy in the simulation. The triple signing also saw Martinez move into midfield, a switch that definitely worked.",

      "Jorge Mendes’ arrival on the scene as a football agent followed a career as a DJ and nightclub owner in his native Portugal. Seeing the booming market of player trading, aided by the Bosman Ruling of 1995 that allowed for the free movement of players at the end of their contracts, Mendes set up the Gestifute agency in 1996, with his first deal being to represent former Spurs and Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo for his switch from Vitoria de Guimaraes to Deportivo La Coruna.",

      "Having already had two bids for Branthwaite rejected, United are not out of the race to sign the Englishman despite an outlay of nearly £100million soon to be committed to deals already this summer.

      "Branthwaite looked set to be the priority target for Sir Jim Ratcliffe in his first summer window but a significant gap in valuations between Everton and United saw that one stall. Attention quickly turned to Matthijs de Ligt and Yoro, both of whom could be United players before long.",
      "It has left Everton in a position to start initial pre-season preparations with Branthwaite in their squad, and don't the social media team know it. Just hours after MEN Sport reported that Yoro had agreed to join United in a transfer worth £52million (that could rise to almost £59million with add-ons), they posted a series of images of the left-footed defender in training.",

      "Manchester United's newest signing Joshua Zirkzee has described himself as 'creative, good with the ball and unpredictable'.",
      "United completed the signing of Zirkzee from Bologna for €42.5million last Sunday and the forward signed a five-year contract, with includes the option of another year.",
      "Bologna defied the odds to finish in the Italian top four last term. They enjoyed their best season since 1967/1968 and Zirkzee started 32 out of a possible 38 league games.",
      "Zirkzee contributed 11 goals and five assists in those appearances and finished the campaign as Bologna's top goalscorer, which caught United's attention.",
      "The 23-year-old will compete with Rasmus Hojlund to start for United in the new season, but as a versatile talent, it's also thought he can play across the attacking front line.",
      "Zirkzee sat down with club media as part of his unveiling and his interview, which covered his transfer to the club and what he will bring, was released on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\"I have a lot of trust and a good feeling about this step,\" Zirkzee told MUTV. \"It wasn't a difficult decision. I mean, I love Bologna a lot, but Manchester United just gave me a very, very good feeling.",
      "\"I'm confident that what's planned will also happen. It's been a rollercoaster the past, the past few weeks. But, Yeah, some very good experiences. And I'm very happy to be here.",
      "\"Obviously, at a good point [in his career]. I mean, making a transfer to Manchester United is obviously something very positive. So, yeah, I just, can't wait to get started. And, and continue what I basically did last season. Just hoping to improve every day and, and do the best I can.\"",
      "Zirkzee was asked to describe his qualities and said: \"Creative player, good with the ball. Yeah, I’m just, a bit unpredictable at times. So, yeah, I think those are the perfect words for me, yeah.\"",
      "When asked whether he likes to entertain supporters on the pitch, he added: \"A little bit. It's best to entertain with the whole team. Not necessarily as an individual, but, yeah, I think, you have to make the fans who come to the stadium happy as well about the game.\"I mean, as a young boy growing up, playing mostly with tougher, bigger guys who are older than you, makes you adapt. So, I think, I think it's something that you learn at a young age in Holland. Especially where I'm from, this was the case.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag has signed multiple Dutch players since his appointment from Ajax and Zirkzee mentioned that connection. \"It's an extra privilege, of course because he's Dutch,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm Dutch as well. So, but I think, besides that, it's obviously not the only reason why I came here. I mean, Manchester United is a great, huge club. So it's is just an extra, privilege and benefit for me.\"",
      "Zirkzee will also work with the newly appointed Ruud van Nistelrooy. \"Having some, some Dutch people around obviously makes it a bit easier,\" he said. \"To be fair, I'm an easy-going person. I'm not too difficult with, adapting, so, but, yeah, it's always nice, to have them around.\"",
      "At the end of the interview, Zirkzee discussed his football heroes and recalled he would get in trouble with his mother as a child for spending too much time playing football.\"Ronaldinho was, for sure my hero. as I grew older, Ibrahimovic as well, was, someone I really looked up to, but I think Ronaldinho was, was my favourite,\" said Zirkzee.\"I hope she [his mum] forgives me now for all the times I came home late. Or, if I broke something in the in the backyard or even, even just at home. So eventually, it all worked out pretty well.",
      "\"But, yeah, that was just life back, back when I was younger. Play football, forget about the time and getting, getting back home late. Yeah. it turned out pretty well.\"",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Erik ten Hag strode purposefully through the double doors protecting the sanctity of the dressing room and tunnel area at the Lerkendal Stadion and into a bustling mixed zone dominated by Norwegian journalists and TV crews.",
      "He strode over to the three British journalists who had made the trip to the north of Norway to watch Manchester United's opening pre-season friendly of the summer, shook our hands and exchanged the briefest of small talk. He had had a good summer, he said. Everyone knows where he holidayed, that's for sure. He was still in Ibiza when he found out his job was safe.",
      "In truth, small talk has rarely been Ten Hag's thing. The mind goes back to his first sit-down with the written journalists covering United's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia in 2022. In an attempt to put him at ease, we planned to ask the golf enthusiast if he caught the end of The Open the previous evening. \"Not that much,\" came the reply.",
      "It feels like it's all business with Ten Hag, which is no bad thing, so we got straight into it again in Norway, but not before he asked the local journalists not to record the conversation. He made it clear this was for the three of us who had followed United out here, a gesture always appreciated in friendlies that come with no contractual obligations from a media perspective.",
      "In truth, getting to speak to Ten Hag was going to be more important for us than the game. It was a young, low-key squad and a forgettable fixture. When the manager came out to speak we breathed a sigh of relief. The presence of a backpack revealed this was his final act of the night.",
      "Over the next seven-and-a-half minutes a range of topics were discussed, although not necessarily in that much depth. As Ten Hag's first public media appearance since surviving as manager, this was a noteworthy moment, but also not the environment to go into detail, with the engine of the coach ticking over just outside and a private jet waiting on the tarmac at Vaernes Airport 20 miles away.",
      "Ten Hag's first act was to recouch the criticism he had delivered to MUTV post-match, including himself in those responsible, although there was again a hint that he might not be happy about the physical conditioning of some members of the squad.",
      "Primarily, this was Ten Hag again defensive of his record. When asked if this felt like a fresh start, his immediate response was to point to the two trophies in two seasons, a record only Manchester City can surpass, as he pointed out. To the final question, as to whether fans can be confident this campaign won't be like last season, Ten Hag's first words in reply were \"but we won a trophy\".",
      "There was an acceptance it was a \"complicated season\" and an understanding that ambitions must be higher, but in what feels like a new era Ten Hag is still happy to point to old records. He has the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup on his CV at Old Trafford and he isn't going to let anyone forget it.",
      "He was positive about the new structure at the club, although pointed out that his working relationship with sporting director Dan Ashworth is only just over a week old. Still, Ten Hag clearly feels Ineos have delivered new energy to the place and that could be beneficial moving forward. It did feel telling that he stressed the new structure couldn't fix all the club's problems in such a short space of time. Don't expect miracles, in other words.",
      "The tensest things got was when the subject of Jadon Sancho was brought up. A truce has been called, but nobody at United has confirmed whether Sancho actually apologised or not during his talks with Ten Hag. When the winger's name was raised the manager didn't exude warmth.",
      "Two questions about the £73m man elicited just 35 words in response and the phrase \"we draw the line\" was uttered three times. That stock phrase was repeated when it was put that it was now up to Sancho to take the opportunity of a fresh start. You didn't leave with the impression that the two were going to forge a long and happy relationship from this point on.",
      "Ten Hag's relationship with United endures, however. There was a final handshake, a thanks for taking the time to stop, and he was gone. The first signpost of a new start and the chance to remind people of old triumphs.",

      "Manchester United are set to sign Lille centre-back Leny Yoro - putting a move for Bayern Munich's Matthijs De Ligt in doubt.",
      "The French defender has agreed to join Erik ten Hag's team this summer in a deal rising to €70million (£58.7m). Yoro has been one of Europe's most sought-after centre-backs with Real Madrid and Liverpool also said to have been interested.",
      "It's a move which continues to signal United's new approach to transfers under Ineos and new sporting director Dan Ashworth. Over the past decade, the club have been involved in frustrating transfer sagas, chasing players who they end up overpaying for or fail to secure.",
      "And after signing Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna, MEN Sport understands that United are open to signing three new centre-backs after the departure of Raphael Varane and with the future of Victor Lindelof at Old Trafford in doubt.",
      "De Ligt is another centre-back who United are looking to sign with the Dutchman knowing Ten Hag well from their time at Ajax together. However, a potential transfer for the Bayern defender may now be more difficult with United set to spend heavily on Yoro.",
      "The Netherlands international is understood to have agreed a move to Manchester but United are yet to agree on a fee with his current club. It is claimed that they didn’t expect to sign both the 24-year-old and Yoro this summer, suggesting that a deal for De Ligt may not happen.",
      "And previous words from United's co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe have suggested why the club may have prioritised a deal for the Frenchman over a move for the former Ajax star. Ratcliffe told former Tour de France winner Geraint Jones on his Cycling Club podcast in March that the club will be looking to sign potential stars of the future, rather than current big-name players.",
      "\"I think in a way what I would rather do is try to sign the next Mbappé than spend a fortune trying to buy success,\" Ratcliffe told Geraint Jones on his Cycling Club podcast.",
      "\"It's not that clever buying Mbappé, anyone can figure that one out. What's much more challenging is to find the next Mbappé or [Jude] Bellingham or Roy Keane.\"",
      "Whilst De Ligt would no doubt improve United's defence, the signing of Yoro would be a bigger coup with the 18-year-old widely viewed as a generational talent. The similarities to Varane, when he was at Lens in France, are eerily similar, with United missing out on the then teenager in 2011.",
      "This time though it looks like United may be about to beat the Spanish giants to a transfer in what would be a huge boost ahead of a vital 2024/25 campaign - and he appears to have everything needed to fit Ratcliffe's 'next Mbappe' transfer model.",

      "Jonathan Tah has emerged as a potential transfer target for Man United this summer amid ongoing attempts to sign Jarrad Branthwaite, Matthijs de Ligt and Lille youngster Leny Yoro",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have made no secret about their plan to strengthen at centre-back this summer and the main question to answer is which signatures will they eventually secure? Jarrad Branthwaite, Matthijs de Ligt and highly-rated Lille youngster Leny Yoro are on the shopping list for Erik ten Hag and key figures behind the scenes.",
      "However, another man - Bundesliga-winning Bayer Leverkusen colossus Jonathan Tah - has emerged as a possible alternative with the wheels in motion for a defensive rebuild. Reports from Sky Germany underline the 28-year-old as a viable and attainable option on the proviso Branthwaite, De Ligt or Yoro slip away.",
      "Netherlands international De Ligt - well known to manager Ten Hag from their days together at Ajax - has verbally agreed personal terms as he aims to kick-start a promising career that has stalled for club and country. But while he might not break the bank as such, Everton are playing hard ball with Branthwaite's valuation.",
      "It's said the Merseyside outfit are holding out for between £70million and £80million and signing over that cheque, regardless of his talent, might not be the smartest move. Yoro, meanwhile, is claimed to have Real Madrid no other on red alert - as the Branthwaite conundrum flags up an all-too-familiar mistake.",
      "United have been among the worst spenders in world football for at least a decade and, with INEOS on board and controlling transfers, the intention is to pay smart money and make better footballing and business decisions. They were stung in that regard 12 months ago when snapping-up Mason Mount from Chelsea.",
      "That is not to say Mount was not worth signing, nor would Branthwaite be. However, amid lingering FFP caution - which could yet be eased with further sales - spending a huge chunk of the budget on one marquee signing might restrict what else United can do in the market.",
      "INEOS will not want to spread themselves too thinly either by bringing in too many cheap options, but Tah fits the bill for a happy middle ground. He is coming off the back of a hugely impressive and successful season as part of an all-conquering Leverkusen side that earned rave reviews under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Tah was also a regular for Germany at Euro 2024 on home soil - partnering Antonio Rudiger in a back four - while a loophole with his contract has emerged to thrust his name on to the radar. With 12 months to run on his deal -just like Mount had - there are clubs taking note including United and the mighty Bayern Munich.",
      "Even taking 'the English tax' into consideration, United overpaid for Mount at a similar juncture. INEOS, though, will not let that happen with Tah representing an opportunity that should not be missed.",

      "Jeremie Frimpong has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer and he could reunite with Netherlands teammate Joshua Zirkzee if he made the switch to Old Trafford",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Jeremie Frimpong has sent a message to Joshua Zirkzee after the forward completed his move to Manchester United over the weekend.",
      "The Red Devils unveiled the signing of Zirkzee from Bologna for a fee in the region of £35.8million, which will be paid over the course of three years. The 23-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford with the option of a further season. He scored 12 goals and provided seven assists in 37 matches last season.",
      "After his move was announced, Zirkzee posted a photo of himself on Instagram in the dressing room wearing a United jumper in front of a new shirt with the caption: \"An honor. Happy and proud to be part of this club. Can't wait to get started!\" followed with three red circle emojis.",
      "And Netherlands teammate Frimpong, who has himself been linked with a move to United this summer, decided to leave his well wishes in the comments section. He wrote: \"Joshyyyyyy,\" accompanied with two red love heart emojis. Zirkzee replied with a love heart emoji and a smiley face emoji.",
      "Frimpong enjoyed a fine season at Bayer Leverkusen, scoring 14 goals and assisting 12 times from right wing back. He helped Xabi Alonso's side win the Bundesliga title. Having impressed, Frimpong's future has come under question with a number of clubs across Europe tracking his progress ahead of a potential transfer.",
      "According to BILD, Frimpong has a release clause worth between £33.6m and £37.8m but that is set to expire this week, meaning interested parties, including United, may have to act fast before his value increases even further. It's been reported that United could move for the Dutchman if Aaron Wan-Bissaka leaves.",
      "Frimpong could follow another Netherlands international, including Zirkzee, to Old Trafford with Matthijs de Ligt heavily linked with a switch across to Manchester. It's emerged that the 24-year-old has made it clear that he would be open to a move to United, having struggled for regular game time at Bayern Munich.",
      "As for Zirkzee, he said after his move to United was completed: \"Having had discussions with the manager and the leaders of the club I know how exciting the future is going to be here and I cannot wait to play my part in achieving success for Manchester United.",
      "\"I am a player who has always dedicated everything to winning; I'm ready for this next challenge, to go to another level in my career and win more trophies. It is a privilege to join such an iconic club. I have to take a short break now after being with the national team, but I'll be coming back ready to make an impact straight away.\"",

      "Man United kicked off their pre-season with a loss against Rosenborg on Monday and here is what you might have missed.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season schedule by losing 1-0 against Rosenborg.",
      "United have a huge and loyal following in Scandinavia and the Reds played in front of a sold-out Lerkendal Stadium, although the fans in attendance weren't treated to a goal-fest.",
      "That was largely down to Radek Vitek, who delivered a man-of-the-match performance in between the sticks for United to deny Rosenborg a more dominant win on home soil.",
      "The travelling squad at Erik ten Hag's disposal in Trondheim was youthful and just five senior players, Jonny Evans, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro, Mason Mount and Marcus Rashford, made the trip.",
      "Those five first-team players were substituted at half-time as wholesale changes were made, which saw Vitek keep his place and 10 youngsters come on.",
      "Vitek made a string of excellent saves throughout the match and will be hopeful of playing against Rangers this weekend. Here are the moments you might have missed...",
      "You could argue Marcus Rashford is currently like Marmite among United supporters: he splits opinion. The forward enjoyed the best campaign of his career in 2022/23 but spectacularly regressed last term and his off-field behaviour damaged his relationship with fans.",
      "Rashford, at least, ended the season with a positive showing in the FA Cup final and many believed missing out on the England squad would allow him to refocus this summer.",
      "There is a lot for Rashford to prove in the new campaign. He must deliver consistently strong displays again and perform to the level he's capable of, otherwise, the 2024/25 season could be his last representing his hometown club and the team he supported as a boy.",
      "There were times when Old Trafford's frustration with Rashford was audible last term, but that didn't stop the crowd in Norway giving his name the biggest cheer when it was announced. Rashford was the biggest 'star' on the pitch in Trondheim and must deliver performances worthy of star status going forward, or his future at the club will be in bigger doubt.",
      "When Hull City played Manchester City at the Etihad in December 2008, they embarrassingly trailed 4-0 after just 36 minutes and their furious manager, Phil Brown, famously made the unusual decision of giving his team talk on the pitch - not in the dressing room - at half-time.",
      "It's a moment in Premier League history that won't be forgotten, mostly because a Hull player subsequently reenacted the team talk in a goal celebration a year later.",
      "Ten Hag did his best impression of Phil Brown at the Lerkendal Stadium on Monday night, as he also decided to conduct his half-time team talk on the pitch during the break.",
      "The Dutchman was seen in deep communication with his players, although with it being a pre-season friendly, he wasn't feeling the emotions Brown once felt at the Etihad.",
      "Nonetheless, Ten Hag was strong in his analysis after the game and said: \"The result is not secondary. We play pre-season, but it's the standard at Manchester United to win games - definitely don't lose them. The performance is more important but it was below our standards.\"",
      "Maybe we'll see Ten Hag's team talk reenacted as a celebration at some stage this season after all.",
      "There was a bizarre quirk before the game when goalkeeper coach Jelle ten Rouwelaar emerged to take the warm-up without his official appointment having been announced. Ten Rouwelaar put the goalkeepers through their paces before kick-off and at 4:17pm, United officially communicated his appointment across their social media channels.",
      "The Dutchman has joined United as first-team goalkeeper coach and succeeds Richard Hartis, who departed this summer. Ten Rouwelaar has been Vincent Kompany's goalkeeping coach for the previous four years, first at Anderlecht and then at Burnley.",
      "He left Turf Moor at the end of his contract and signed a deal with Ajax before United showed an interest, which meant it took €100,000 in compensation to appoint him.",
      "Ten Rouwelaar will work with Andre Onana, Tom Heaton and Altay Bayindir at first-team level this season, but he'll coach Vitek during pre-season and the youngster can be immensely proud of the performance he delivered against Rosenborg on Monday evening.",
      "Vitek is an imposing goalkeeper and will be hopeful of receiving more opportunities in United's friendlies this summer before another departure on loan again.",
      "Interestingly, another Czech goalkeeper, Matej Kovar, impressed for United in pre-season last summer but he was sold to Bayer Leverkusen on a permanent deal. United banked £7.7million for Kovar, who was 23 years old when he left, but Vitek might have a better chance of breaking into the first-team squad in the future.",

      "The sale of Mason Greenwood this summer looks set to beat a post-Sir Alex Ferguson record for Manchester United with the forward on the verge of leaving Old Trafford.",
      "After being sent on loan to Getafe last season, Greenwood’s performances caught the eye, after he scored eight times and provided six assists in 33 La Liga performances. The Spanish side were keen to sign him on a permanent deal but were unwilling to match United’s asking price.",
      "That prompted interest from several other clubs, including Lazio and Marseille. And it seems like the latter are now closing in on a move for Greenwood with the Athletic reporting that an agreement has been reached with both United and the player over a transfer.",
      "The move was put into doubt following criticism from supporters and the mayor of Marseille. Greenwood was suspended in January 2022 after being arrested for attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviours and assault, but the case was dropped and all charged were withdrawn.",
      "If the transfer to Marseille is completed, then it will see United earn an initial €27.6 million (£23.3m) with the fee potentially rising to €31.6 million (£26.7m) with add-ons. The profit made, seeing as Greenwood is an academy graduate, will be the most made since the retirement of Ferguson in 2013.",
      "The sale will come as a boost to United in terms of the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs). Due to him being an academy player, money made will go down as pure profit in the books for the 2024/25 season.",
      "It comes just days after United confirmed the signing of striker Joshua Zirkzee, who completed a move from Bologna for €42.5 million (£35.8m) over the weekend. The Dutchman has signed a five-year deal at Old Trafford with the option of a sixth.",

      "The latest transfer news from Old Trafford as Man United continue to pursue Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite after having two bids turned down for the England U21s international.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United and Everton are seemingly worlds apart when it comes to striking up a transfer for defender Jarrad Branthwaite with two offers already being rejected for the England international. United are still weighing-up moves for up to three centre-backs this summer as part of a defensive overhaul.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro are the club's two other main targets after rubber-stamping a swoop for Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee which has accounted for £36.5million in their budget. Getting all three defenders over the line will, meanwhile, be dependant on moving parts including the need for player sales.",
      "Branthwaite, 22, is viewed as an ideal fit for the United rebuild and also worked with returning assistant manager Ruud van Nistelrooy during his successful loan spell with PSV Eindhoven in the 2022/2023 season. Here, we take a closer look at the latest headlines surrounding Branthwaite's future;",
      "Leny Yoro has agreed to sign for Manchester United this summer in a deal that is set to rise to €70million (£58.7m) after Lille accepted a bid of €62million (£52m) earlier this week. The 18-year-old is set to be United's second signing of the summer after Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee's arrival, and will likely be available to travel with United to Los Angeles for their pre-season tour next week.",
      "Yoro is set to be part of a majorly-revamped defensive line which will see United attempt to patch up the evident holes from last season with three new signings, of which Yoro is one. Everton have already rejected two bids for their centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite while United are on the precipice of signing Bayern Munich star Matthijs De Ligt.",
      "United have had two offers rejected for Branthwaite already this summer. But will it be third time lucky?",
      "The second bid was worth £45million to Everton plus £5million in add-ons. It came after United saw a £43million attempt turned down last month, while Manchester Evening News reported in May that Branthwaite is valued at between £70million and £80million by the Toffeers - which United argue is unrealistic.",
      "Previous deals for Harry Maguire to United (£80million), Wesley Fofana to Chelsea (£75million) and Josko Gvardiol to Manchester City (£77.6million) are viewed as justification for the price tag in Everton's eyes.",
      "Everton have played hard ball from the outset when it comes to Branthwaite and business elsewhere means they do not necessarily have to cash-in on the England international this summer. Amadou Onana is seemingly ready to leave for Aston Villa in an agreement that will generate around £50million for the Toffees.",
      "As such, they can continue to wait for a third, improved bid from United or ultimately hold firm.",
      "Ongoing reports from The Liverpool ECHO and national publications indicate that Everton do not want or need to sell Branthwaite this summer. The 22-year-old remains under contract until 2027 having put pen-to-paper on a new deal at Goodison Park midway through last season.",
      "The party line from Everton hints at business as usual. Branthwaite, who was overlooked for the England squad at Euro 2024 by now-departed national team manager Gareth Southgate this summer, is sharpening up his fitness as Everton head to Ireland to continue their pre-season preparations.",
      "Branthwaite boarded the short flight from John Lennon Airport on Monday morning. As such, no immediate move appears to be on the cards for him - despite United's ongoing interest.",

However, as things stand, nothing concrete has been submitted to Bayern over his would-be signature - despite confidence in-house from United that a deal will eventually be done.",

In the market for up to three centre-backs this summer, Everton prospect Branthwaite and French youngster Yoro - from Lille - are the other primary targets.",

Exactly how much the German heavyweights want for his signature remains up in the air with contrasting indications across the board.",
      "Reports from Sport BILD outline £42million as the asking price and indicate United would be willing to pay up. De Ligt - who progressed through the Ajax system and captained the Amsterdam giants as a teenager under no other than Ten Hag - has already amassed a staggering total transfer fund throughout his career.",
      "Juventus paid €85.5million for him in 2019 and Bayern splashed out €67million coming up two years ago, but will it be third time lucky for United when it comes to a long-term target?",
      "Sky Germany flag up Bayer Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah as an alternative option for United if they fail to get De Ligt over the line. However, there is also a proposed scenario by which Tah heading to Bavaria instead would be the catalyst for De Ligt pitching up at Old Trafford as planned this summer.",
      "Whispers that United are keeping tabs on Tah feature in a social media post. A transfer triangle could emerge as to speed up the process, depending on which club makes the first move.",

      "Only the most highly regarded talents in the academy are given pre-pro contracts that activate when the player celebrates their 17th birthday and Mantato is included in that bracket.",
      "Chelsea, Liverpool, Newcastle and Brighton showed an interest in signing Mantato but he will continue in Manchester and is relishing the prospect of making progress at United.",
      "United were always hopeful Mantato would commit his future and eventually sign professional terms, and both parties are delighted he has signed as a first-year scholar.",
      "The youngster, who has bundles of pace, was in excellent form last season and it's thought his long-term future will be on the right wing due to the attacking quality he can provide.",
      "Mantato can play at left-back and on the wing, and his style has led to comparisons with Arsenal's Bukayo Saka, who started his career as a defender before moving forward. He joined United's academy aged nine and has represented England in the youth system - Mantato made his debut for the Three Lions' Under-16s team in February.",
      "Mantato's dribbling ability is a huge asset and he's already been backed to have a bright future at Old Trafford.",

      "Kingdon, whose natural position is centre-back, delivered a string of impressive displays and now his pro deal is officially signed, he will attempt to make a senior debut.",
      "Ethan Wheatley was the most recent academy youngster to be given his debut and the expectation inside United is that more debuts from last season's U18 team will follow.",
      "Kingdon's quality helped the U18s concede just 28 league goals last term, the second-fewest in the division behind Manchester City, who conceded 27 goals.",
      "The 18-year-old, who was born in Bolton, started his career with Greater Manchester grassroots club FC Strikerz Avengers before joining Morecambe at Under-12 level.",
      "Kingdon notably made an appearance for Morecambe's U18s when his age group was Under-14 level. United eventually signed the youngster for a six-figure sum in November 2020, following a successful two-week trial period at the club, and he's made excellent progress since joining.",
      "The defender played multiple positions at grassroots level, including as a striker and midfielder, but he's since excelled at centre-back and he's considered very strong, pacy and someone who can read the game well from the back.",
      "Kingdon stands at 6ft 1in and briefly played rugby as a child but wanted to prioritise football. He was also a gifted athlete, as he once took gold medals in the 75m, 150m and 600m sprints at the Bolton United Harriers championships.",
      "He has represented Scotland, whom he qualifies to represent through his father, at different youth levels and has worn the captain's armband for his country.",

      "Manchester United are said to have missed out on the chance to sign Arsenal target Pedro Neto for next to nothing.",
      "The Gunners have long admired the Wolverhampton Wanderers winger and could finalise a £60million deal for the 24-year-old this summer. The Portuguese star joined Wolves in 2019 from Braga, following a loan spell at Lazio. However, before his move to Italy, United were believed to be closely monitoring the promising attacker.",
      "According to The Athletic, United identified Neto in early 2017 and even invited the then-teenager to Carrington. Despite impressing coaches and scouts during an academy game, it took too long for a contract to be sanctioned, it is claimed, leading Neto to sign a new deal with Braga before joining Lazio on a long-term loan.",
      "He later moved to Wolves in 2019 and made his senior international debut a year later. The hesitation is consistent with claims from former club scouts, who say they discovered talents, only for the club to not act quickly enough to tie them down.",
      "The Red Devils were also said to have identified current Bayern Munich and Germany star Jamal Musial and Moises Caicedo, now of Chelsea, early in their development. Lyndon Tomlinson, who served as the assistant head of academy recruitment at United from 2017 to 2021, told The Athletic: \"I think it's just being decisive and getting things over the line, that was always the problem.",
      "\"In terms of the scouting, the structure and system we had - look at [Alejandro] Garnacho - was good. The reports were there, the process was there. We were just being let down at the end of it.",

      "It's been a turbulent week for Manchester United Women but the arrival of Dan Ashworth could be exactly what they need to get back on track",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Though Mary Earps' Manchester United goodbye message totaled 370 words, perhaps the biggest factor behind her decision to leave the club can be gleaned from just one: 'Transition'.",
      "Those 10 measly characters, deployed by Earps to describe the current state of play at Leigh Sports Village, rather concisely explain why one of the game's biggest stars feels the best thing for her career is to seek pastures new this summer. The 31-year-old's departure did not, admittedly, come as much of a surprise.",
      "Hers is an exit almost 12 months in the making, the portent of which can be traced back to Arsenal's failed world-record bid for her services last September. Still, though, in conjunction with a number of other happenings at United over the past few weeks, confirmation of Earps' leaving has been viewed in some quarters as an ominous indicator of the Reds' direction of travel.",
      "\"It's a decision l've gone backwards and forwards on for some time, and is not one I've made lightly,\" the England No. 1 wrote on social media on Saturday. \"The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don't feel it aligns with the timing of where I'm at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.\"",
      "That new challenge is set to take Earps to the French capital, where she will become the highest-paid women's goalkeeper in the world for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). It is understood, however, United's offer of a new deal matched Earps' expectations and therefore her decision to leave the club is rooted not in finances but in a desire to be successful on the pitch.",
      "Clearly, the shot-stopper remains unconvinced about the Reds' ability to yield such success in the near future. Despite winning the Women's FA Cup - the club's first major piece of women's silverware - last term, it's hard to argue with the fact that United's performances in 2023/24 left much to be desired.",
      "Marc Skinner's side finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL), winning just 10 of their 22 league games and registering a points tally 21 points lower than the one recorded in the previous campaign. A 6-0 defeat to champions Chelsea at Old Trafford on the final day was a crushing nadir for a team who had taken the title race to the final day only 12 months earlier, and the travelling support took great pleasure in making Earps the chief subject of their derision, regularly taunting her with chants of 'Mary, what's the score?'",
      "There is an argument, though, that United's malaise on the field is a symptom of the pervasive uncertainty off it. It has been a turbulent year for the Reds, who came under fire last summer for letting star duo Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo depart on free transfers, with the latter joining WSL rivals Arsenal.",
      "Then there was the Mason Greenwood debacle, which opened a number of female players up to online abuse on the eve of decisive Women's World Cup games. Couple this with the departure of numerous backroom staff, including highly-rated assistant manager Martin Ho and head of women's football Polly Bancroft, and it is easy to see why some players may feel United is, at present, a club in flux.",
      "Those feelings have only intensified since the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe in February. The INEOS chief caused a stir when he opted not to attend the Women's FA Cup final in May, instead making an appearance at Old Trafford for what was, for the hosts, something of a dead-rubber Premier League clash with Arsenal.",
      "Days later came confirmation of a new contract for manager Skinner - a decision that was not particularly well-received by the United fanbase, in spite of the FA Cup triumph. And then there was last week, when it seemed as if every day brought with it a new PR fire for the Reds to put out.",
      "First, there was Ratcliffe's tone-deaf interview with Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\". Next came the revelation that Skinner's side are set to be ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp - and that's before you consider the exodus of first-team stars, including Earps and club captain Katie Zelem.",
      "Cue the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United; a dangerous cocktail of bad news that does not inspire much hope of positive change at the club.",
      "Still, amidst all the negativity, there are green shoots of optimism. According to BBC Sport, United are closing in on deals to sign Brighton & Hove Albion forward Elisabeth Terland and former Arsenal defender Dominique Janssen.",
      "The duo are at opposite ends of the experience spectrum but could both have a hugely positive impact at Leigh Sports Village. Terland scored 13 goals in the WSL last term, with only Manchester City's Khadija Shaw finding the back of the net more frequently than the 23-year-old.",
      "Janssen, meanwhile, has won two league titles and starred in two Champions League finals for German side Wolfsburg, having previously won the WSL with the Gunners. United are also expected to trigger the option-to-buy clause in the loan agreement of highly-rated Lyon forward, Melvine Malard.",
      "With midfielder Grace Clinton set to return to Manchester following a hugely successful loan spell at Tottenham Hotspur and the likes of Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa expected to play a bigger role following their respective returns to full fitness, the Reds look to have have the makings of a strong squad.",
      "Perhaps one of the most heartening developments for the women's team, though, came on Monday morning, when it emerged sporting director Dan Ashworth is free to begin work at United after breakthrough talks with former club Newcastle. The two clubs have come to an agreement over compensation after an acrimonious four months of talks, avoiding the need for an arbitration hearing to settle the matter.",
      "While Ashworth's priority will almost certainly be changing the fortunes of Erik Ten Hag's side, the 53-year-old has long been an advocate for investing in women's football and could be the spark United require to reignite their commitment to Skinner and his players. Speaking to the Guardian in 2022, Ashworth outlined the club's vision for Newcastle Women, who were, at the time, plying their trade in the fourth tier.",
      "\"(The women's team) is absolutely a priority for the owners,” he said. “Already, they’ve gone from a team where the players had to pay to play last year to being professionalised. We will do everything we can to give them the support to get to the WSL as quickly as possible.”",
      "His comments were reminiscent of a similar statement he made during his time as technical director of Brighton & Hove Albion. “The aim now is to get a foothold in the top division, being a new club and new women’s programme compared to some of the teams in that division,\" Ashworth told club media back in 2019.",
      "“We aim to do that by maximising our resources, trying to recruit cleverly, coach well and get the results to keep us in the division. It comes back to the club’s long-term vision, which is to make us a top four women’s team. It will take time, effort and investment to do that, but we’re on the right lines to do it.”",
      "By joining United, Ashworth is joining a club with significantly more resources than Brighton and with a bigger global brand than Newcastle. If he is able to lend some of his expertise to Skinner's side, there is a chance the Reds could soon find themselves back on the right path and their period of transition might just lead them into a brighter new era.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly been blacklisted by agents in the summer transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos handed further headache",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "When Sir Jim Ratcliffe completed his minority purchase of Manchester United, he was keen to stress that he would not just be focused on the men's team.",
      "United were late to the women's football revolution but since earning their place in the Women's Super League they have become a threat. A fifth-placed finish last season was underwhelming considering they were runners-up the year before but the foundations appeared to be in place to regroup.",
      "However, in our latest look at the media headlines an admission by agents suggests this progress is no more which should be of great embarrassment to Ineos.",
      "According to journalist Katie Whyatt in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, the United women's team is no longer seen as a priority since Ratcliffe's arrival. She claimed that 'horror stories' have come out of Old Trafford regarding Ineos' running of the squad with agents reportedly telling their clients not to move to United.",
      "On Saturday it emerged that goalkeeper Mary Earps will be the latest United player to leave shortly after captain Katie Zelem was announced as departing at the expiry of her contract.",
      "What MEN Sport says: The revelations surrounding the United women's team and the lack of care that Ratcliffe has shown should bring shame on both himself and Ineos as a whole. The Reds' co-owner has often spoken about wanting to emulate the recent success of Manchester City and it is disappointing to discover that only expands to the men's team. In this day and age there is really no excuse to allow the women's team to go to rack and ruin. It also gives United a bad image which could taint hopes of securing major sponsorship deals at a time when the club needs the money. Ratcliffe needs to address this situation quickly before it does any more damage.",
      "Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake has told Dutch media outlet AD the prospect of moving to United is at the forefront of his mind but that he will not let it cloud his duty towards his current team. \"I owe it to them (Go Ahead Eagles to carry on as normal),\" he explained.",
      "\"It's not in the back of your head, but in your forehead. It can't get any crazier (than moving to United), can it?\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: Since being linked with a place on the coaching staff at United, Hake has caught the attention of the fanbase. Videos have circulated on social media of his no-nonsense management style which many feel this current squad of players are crying out for. These comments by the Dutchman should also be warmly received to. It is clear that he wants to be at Old Trafford and is not against stepping back into an assistant role. It seems as though he is exactly what the dressing room needs at this moment.",
