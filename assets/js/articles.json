      "Teddy Sheringham is expecting it to rain goals in Bilbao because he has no faith in the defences of Manchester United or Tottenham. The under-performing Premier League sides meet in the Europa League final on Wednesday night for a showdown with huge stakes.",
      "With United 16th in the Premier League and on an eight-game winless run domestically and Spurs 17th and without a win in six in the league, it is a final of two out-of-form teams. But while they have disappointed in the league, both have made it to the final of Europe’s second-tier competition and are eyeing silverware.",
      "The fact the winner will earn a place in next season’s Champions League has heightened the tension, while Tottenham have the added pressure of going for a first trophy since 2008. Picking a winner from two teams who have lacked consistency and confidence all season is difficult and Sheringham is only sure of one thing.",
      "“I could see there being a lot of goals in the game, because neither team can defend, and neither of them want to play defensively. I see a very high-scoring, open game. I’m going to predict a 4-3 win, but I don’t know which team will edge it,” the former United and Spurs striker told Prime Casino.",
      "“I think either way, it’s going to be goals galore and it will be end-to-end stuff. If I was looking at this from Man United's point of view, then I would be looking at the weaknesses in the Tottenham defence, but as I said, United’s back four is hardly a tight ship.",
      "“Whoever can be more solid at the back will have an advantage and it might come down to which team makes fewer mistakes, because both sides have got a rick in them.",
      "“If it goes to penalties. I think the pressure will be massively on Manchester United. A shootout could really affect them mentally, with all the implications of the result.”",
      "Pressure will be one of the key factors, with both managers feeling the heat at the end of largely miserable campaigns. Ruben Amorim has underwhelmed since taking the reins from Erik ten Hag in November, while Ange Postecoglou has become increasingly embattled in recent months.",
      "The Spurs boss made headlines in the build-up by taking issue with a reporter’s characterisation of him as a ‘clown’. “I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and never will be,” he said in his press conference.",
      "\"You really disappointed me that you used such terminology to describe a person that for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he is leading out a club in a European final. For you to suggest that somehow us not being successful means that I'm a clown, I'm not sure how to answer that question.\""

      "A former Manchester United youth star died after his sister had spotted a ‘sudden mood change’ but was told 'there is nothing more' she could have done to save him. Vinicius de Oliveira Cabral de Souza, just 19 and known affectionately as Vini, passed away in February.",
      "A statement from his former club Warrington Town at the time read: \"Scorer of the most spectacular goals, Vini was a well respected, much-loved member of the club, and his ability earned him a place training with the first team despite his young age.",
      "\"He played for the first team last season in the Cheshire Senior Cup against Cheadle Town, and trained regularly with the first team, appearing in numerous pre-season friendlies over the past couple of seasons.\"",
      "An enquiry has now looked into the circumstances of his death. Bolton Coroner's Court heard that he had quit football just months before his death, with his sister, Mayara De Souza, noticing a distinct change in her sibling.",
      "It was told that the 19-year-old had previously apologised to family and friends for letting them down. Vini was ‘disappointed’ when he was dropped by United at the age of 14 - albeit he continued playing football for five years.",
      "He is said to have never explained why he gave up and stopped training with Warrington Town. It was also said that he had seen his self-esteem drop after his steroid cream for acne run out.",
      "Speaking about her brother, Mayara De Souza said: \"He stopped doing the things that he liked to do such as football, going to the gym and seeing friends.",
      "“He started apologising about the way he treated us and we didn't understand what he meant. His best friend as well, he said the same to him and he said he doesn't know why.\" She continued: \"He said to my dad before he died, 'Am I going to be arrested for this?' And [my dad] said, 'for what?'",
      "\"He said, 'because of the way that I am, I'm going to be arrested'. And there was an occasion where he saw a police car but it was for a neighbour. He thought it was for him.\"",
      "Miss De Souza attempted to get her brother help as she booked a session for him with a psychotherapist which he attended in January, but he turned down any further sessions. When she told Vini he may have been depressed, he ‘laughed in her face’, she told the inquest.",
      "Vini had also stopped going out with friends after admitting to his mum that he had taken drugs at a nightclub on one occasion. A toxicologist's report found no trace of drugs or alcohol in Vini's system when he died.",
      "Vini was eventually found dead on February 20, with police concluding that he had died as a result of 'self-inflicted means by hanging'.",
      "Assistant coroner Stephen Teesdale was satisfied with that cause. Addressing his family, he said: \"There's nothing more you could have done. You did everything. You spotted the problem - depression. You made a plan, you sought professional assistance from a psychotherapist.",
      "\"You had a plan to take him to Brazil. There's nothing more you could have done. He had an entirely supportive family. It was to do with how he saw the world.\"",

      "They were filmed squaring up to each other before hurling missiles including glasses and wheelie bins in a spat that started just before 9.30pm in San Sebastian’s Old Town. Several fans are said to have been identified by the Ertzaintza, the Basque Country’s police force.",

One stuck his middle finger up at the pair as he walked by them, leading to a brief orgy of violence which took a turn for the worse when a second older man thought to be related to one of the youngsters who had been goading the Spurs supporters got involved.",
      "The same group of United fans were also blamed for another fight shortly afterwards in a nearby bar called Tribeca.",
      "A spokesman for the National Police in Cantabria, which covers Santander, confirmed today: “We responded to the incident at Siboney Cafe but when officers reached the scene there was nothing and none of those involved in the fight were present.",

      "Witnesses claim tempers flared after two rival sets of supporters started hurling insults at each other. Drama then ensued with fans then throwing punches and objects at each other, including a wheelie bin and drinks. One even turned over a table to try and use as a weapon before order was restored by the authorities.",
      "The report adds that no arrests were made, although officers remained in the area. An ambulance was also said to be present with 'several people' treated at the scene, though nobody was taken to hospital.",
      "Tens of thousands of Brits have travelled to Spain to support them teams in the face of astronomical flight fares and a dearth of available accommodation in the Basque region.",

      "The match winner that day, James Maddison, is among a lengthy injury list for Ange Postecoglou as he seeks to end the club's well documented trophy drought. Tottenham's last piece of silverware came back in 2008 with many big name managers trying and failing to end the pain.",

      "Asked if it would save jobs, he said: \"Again, I don't think that is the case. We are doing things that we need to do. Our club can have revenues without Champions League. It is a big brand. I am always playing for more than myself. I am coaching for my players, my staff and especially our fans.\"",
      "He added: \"A new future for me, I think, is not the case. People will look at our team in a different way, as winning a European title is really important. Nothing is going to change our season, but winning a European title can help us have that feeling to build a future.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed his surprise at Joshua Zirkzee being fit for tomorrow's final.",
      "He said: \"Me neither [Joshua Zirkzee not expected to be fit]! They recovered quite well. They pushed. Of course, we respect the feeling of the player but we pushed a little bit. They can help us win the game. De Ligt is out.\"",
      "Manchester United are set to be without Matthijs de Ligt for tomorrow's final but he's still set to offer his support.",
      "The Dutchman has flown over to Spain and has arrived at San Mames over the last hour or so,",
      "So we've already had Son Heung-min, Pedro Porro and Ange Postecoglou speak in Bilbao and it's now the turn of their opposite numbers.",
      "Ruben Amorim will give the Manchester United perspective on tomorrow evening's game, with Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire also set to speak.",
      "The Red Devils press conference will get underway at approximately 6:30pm.",
      "Spurs fans have taken over a number of bars in the centre of Bilbao and are singing merrily in the 25c sunshine.",
      "They have draped their flags between street signs and over the bar awnings as they down their beers.",
      "One of the most popular songs is about there being No f****** Gooners in Bilbao”.",
      "The number of fans has increased massively over the past couple of hours. Thousands of United and Tottenham supporters are expected to descend on the city over the next 24 hours ahead of the final.",
      "The upcoming Europa League final is obviously crucial for United's hopes of winning the Europa League and also returning to the Champions League. But it could also be key to their hopes of a successful summer transfer window.",
      "As per ESPN, a United victory would hugely bolster their chances of taking Delap to Old Trafford. But should they lose, that could see Chelsea move up the queue.",
      "Delap has scored 12 goals for Ipswich this season.",
      "We're still expecting to hear from Ruben Amorim but before that, he has had his Man United players hard at work.",
      "Among those is Ruben Amorim, who appears to have decided on a fresh hairdo for the final.",
      "Postecoglou has in the meantime revealed that he hasn't discussed his future with Spurs stars.",
      "He said: \"No, because I think that would be not really helpful in what is before us right now. I've said to the lads from day one, nothing is guaranteed in life or in sport. You have to try to take every opportunity that is ahead of you. I've been in this position before where the big game was the last game I'd manage and that's something I've navigated before.\"",
      "The Spurs boss added: \"I don't think my job is done here. I think a trophy would accelerate that and I think there's a lot still to be done. The challenges we've had are well chronicled but I think there's been some growth in there.\"",
      "Postecoglou has admitted that talk over his position at Spurs 'doesn't matter' ahead of tomorrow's final.",
      "He said: \"Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter really because the reality of it is the opportunity is the same for me and more importantly the club.",
      "\"Whatever happens beyond tomorrow is irrelevant when you think about the opportunity right now and that's to provide something special for this club and its fans and everyone who has worked so hard for this. Whatever happens after that I'm very comfortable that I'll be continuing to try to win trophies wherever I am.\"",
      "Son has suggested that former Spurs captain will be keeping a keen eye out tomorrow evening as the North Londoners attempt to lift their first trophy since 2008.",

      "\"I just concentrate myself with the boys. Obviously, Harry will be the biggest of Spurs fans tomorrow and supporting us on holiday.\"",

      "The Europa League final is set to be contested between Tottenham and Manchester United in an all-Premier League tie. Both sides have fallen well below expectations in the league, but have the opportunity to end the season with silverware and a place in the Champions League.",
      "Earlier this season, Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou stated he always delivers a trophy in his second season as a manager, and is one game away from fulfilling that promise at Tottenham. The club's last trophy came in the 2008 League Cup, and winning the Europa League would represent their first European triumph since 1984.",
      "As for United, manager Ruben Amorim has similarly struggled in the league since replacing Erik ten Hag, with his side a point above Spurs in 16th. However, victory over Spurs would secure United's place in next year's Champions League and ensure the club earns silverware for the third consecutive year. Here's everything you need to know about how to watch Tottenham Hotspur vs Manchester United in the Europa League final.",
      "The Europa League final between Spurs and United will take place on Wednesday, May 21. Kick-off is scheduled for 8pm. The game will be held at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao. It is a venue that United know well, having earned a 3-0 win at the same ground in the first leg of their semi-final tie with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "The Europa League’s specific squad rules mean that Spurs quartet Radu Dragusin, Timo Werner, Fraser Forster and Antonin Kinsky were never going to be involved in the final as they were left out of the club’s squad for the knockout rounds. However, Tottenham manager Postecoglou has other issues to contend with.",
      "James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski have both suffered injuries in recent weeks, with the latter already undergoing surgery. Young midfielder Lucas Bergvall is another notable absentee who is not expected to be involved in Bilbao, despite making progress in his recovery.",
      "Spurs were given a fresh injury worry in their defeat to Aston Villa last Friday, as Pape Matar Sarr suffered a knock that makes him a doubt for the final. Elsewhere, Dane Scarlett will not be part of Postecoglou’s plans as he is also recovering from surgery.",
      "For United, defender Lisandro Martinez and forward Joshua Zirkzee have been dealt season-ending ACL and hamstring injuries, respectively. The majority of the club’s other fitness doubts concern their backline.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt returned against Brentford earlier this month, but has not featured again since being substituted at half-time with a knee injury. Fellow centre-back Leny Yoro recently recovered from a broken foot, but seemed to aggravate the same area in United’s defeat to West Ham. Meanwhile, Diogo Dalot is making strides in his recovery, but Amorim is unlikely to risk playing the full-back.",
      "Both clubs may have endured similarly frustrating seasons outside of European competition, but they plan to celebrate a possible Europa League triumph in distinctly different ways. It has been reported that United will not have an open-top bus parade if they are victorious, but instead will host a barbecue for players and staff.",
      "This is due to United having little time to celebrate the possible silverware, as the club end their Premier League season at home to Aston Villa on Sunday, May 25, shortly before a post-season tour in Kuala Lumpur. United’s last open-top bus parade was for winning the 2013 Premier League title. There was no public celebration when the club won the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017.",
      "Meanwhile, Spurs are expected to have a parade if the club can end their 17-year wait for a trophy. The club have finished runners-up in four cup finals, including the 2019 Champions League, since last lifting a trophy.",
      "Spurs are viewed as slight favourites (2/1) to win the game in normal time over United (6/4), as per Oddschecker. The draw is priced at 12/5, which would lead to extra time and a possible penalty shootout. In terms of an outright winner, United hold a slight edge at 4/5 while Spurs are priced at evens."

      "It all comes down to this. Dire seasons in the Premier League will be forgotten on Wednesday as Tottenham and Manchester United do battle in Bilbao.",
      "The clubs are 17th and 16th in the table respectively back home - yes, the first two places above the relegation zone - but it's been a different story on the continent. Injury-hit Spurs have got themselves to a second European final in six years, a game that could decide Ange Postecoglou's future.",
      "Some would argue that the same goes for United. Ruben Amorim has gone through the opposite of a new manager bounce since being appointed in November and if the Red Devils can't bank the £100million that comes with winning the trophy - thanks to it including a ticket to the Champions League - his ambition of rebuilding United in his own image could become an impossible task.",
      "Will Postecoglou deliver on his vow of always winning a trophy in his second season? Or will Amorim and his players continue to work their magic in Europe?",
      "The clash of the flops. We have to go all the way to Bilbao to watch two bang average teams thrash it out in the Europa League final. But let's be clear - the rules were there in the first place and the carrot of the Champions League is a huge incentive.",
      "I've a feeling for Tottenham. What a crazy season for Ange Postecoglou. Spurs have suffered 21 defeats in the Premier League and yet I still think they look a better team with their better XI out than the rabble that is Manchester United at the moment.",
      "What is Ruben Amorim doing? If you do not have players to play a system - don't play it! That will hurt them. Spurs are clearly missing players, can't field that strong XI but I think they will have just enough.",
      "I would love to say it will be a thriller. But more like a comedy of errors. Neither are very good up front. But they are worse in defence. Tottenham to win an entertaining game.",
      "Tottenham 3-2 Man Utd",
      "The demeanour of this Ruben Amorim side in Europe this season - compared to the dismal domestic vibes it gives off - has been little short of remarkable. While this is a second-tier competition, Manchester United have disposed of some decent teams along the way and it could be argued their road to the final has been a little more challenging than the one negotiated by Ange Postecoglo's side.",
      "And while Spurs have beaten United three times this season, Amorim's men have approached this competition with a positivity that has been painfully absent in the Premier League. Spurs will certainly feel they can get at their opposition but, in the semi-final against Athletic Bilbao, United showed they can be well-organised.",
      "I don't see many goals in the contest but fancy Harry Maguire to seal an unlikely trophy for United from a set-piece.",
      "Tottenham 0-1 Man Utd",
      "Who'll win the Europa League final - Tottenham or Man Utd? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "Spurs have won all three meetings between the sides this season, so it stands to reason that they'll make it four in a row... right? Er, no. When you can't defend for toffee - and neither of these teams can defend a fish supper - logic doesn't come into it.",
      "What is most distasteful about a major European final between the two worst teams in the Premier League is the scent of money. The winners will get their snouts in the Champions League trough next season, and they won't really deserve it.",
      "With James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, their two most creative players, on parade I would have given Spurs the edge. But their absence gives United to burgle a trophy from a season of unrelenting misery on the home front and, in fairness, they have managed to stay unbeaten in 14 games in Europe this season.",
      "With absolutely no confidence, and with all the science of pinning the tail on a donkey blindfolded like that party game, I'm going for United to win the donkey derby.",
      "Tottenham 1-2 Man Utd",
      "A Europa League final between the sides in 16th and 17th place in the Premier League is unlikely to be one to savour - but it is all about the result for Manchester United and Tottenham. How you play in a final is irrelevant.",
      "All that matters for United and Spurs is getting their hands on the trophy - and with it a £100million ticket to the Champions League. United have players back from injury at the right time, in particular Amad and Mason Mount, both of whom have impressed since returning, giving Ruben Amorim more attacking options, as well as Luke Shaw, who brings experience to United's back three.",
      "In contrast, Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou is missing key men James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, which is a major blow given the inspiration and influence both can provide. Against that backdrop, I expect United to edge the final, but with so much at stake for both teams in the all-or-nothing showdown, it is likely to be a tense, edgy encounter.",
      "Tottenham 1-2 Man Utd",
      "The Carabao Cup quarter-final between these two poor sides in December was like their seasons - full of errors and goals and entertainment for the neutral. And this Europa League final could be the same, although I take Ruben Amorin's side to come out on the right side of a seven-goal thriller this time.",
      "There is no point either of these two teams trying to sit on any lead - they are just not good enough. It could be like a basketball match. Dejan Kulusevski was the Man of the Match at the Tottenham Stadium in that cup game and he will be badly missed by Spurs.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should be the best player on the pitch and make the difference. And so Ange Postecoglou won't always win a trophy in his second season.",
      "Tottenham 3-4 Man Utd",
      "The game labelled 'El Crapico' could come down to which team doesn't perform the worst. These two sides have so much at stake and it promises to be such a high-octane affair.",
      "But while Spurs have beaten United three times already this season, it's hard to believe they can make it a fourth. And it cannot be overlooked that, considering what United have overcome to reach this final, it feels like their name is written on the trophy.",
      "Spurs might have the better players, but United appear to have fate in their team.",
      "Tottenham 2-3 Man Utd",
      "The last time Spurs took on English opponents in a European final, it didn't go to plan. Injury issues dominated the lead-up to the game, they fell behind early on and struggled to assert themselves in an eventual 2-0 defeat against Liverpool.",
      "This year, injury issues have dominated the lead-up to the game, with Dejan Kulusevski in particular a big loss. If Manchester United take an early lead, we could have a painful example of history repeating itself.",
      "Optimists in north London will no-doubt point to Spurs getting the better of United on their previous meetings this season. However, what would be more tragicomic (I won't say 'Spursy') than winning three out of four but losing the one that matters.",
      "If Ange Postecoglou's team want to win this game, their best bet may be repeating the chaos of the Carabao Cup meeting back in December. However, their opponents appear to be peaking at the perfect time in Europe and may well squeak to victory.",

      "\"They need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",

      "Tony O’Neill, once known as ‘the general’ in the Red Army, spoke about an “onslaught” Manchester United fans suffered during a visit to White Hart Lane for a League Cup night game against Tottenham Hotspur in 1979.",
      "Spurs won the match 2-1 but the real pain for Tony and his mates came after the 90 minutes, when they were attacked in the street. He said they were “frantically panicking” at one frightening point but ended up laughing with relief to escape North London with their lives.",
      "Speaking for his ‘Fan Culture’ series on his Webby & O’Neill YouTube channel, he said: “Tottenham was always fun, it was always dangerous, it gave you everything.”",
      "But he said the clash in 1979 was particularly violent and he remembered getting “battered” by bloodthirsty Spurs fans.",
      "The author, whose books include Red Army General, said there was little trouble before the game, but said it was the “calm before the storm”, because Tottenham’s mob was “proper, proper organised”.",
      "Recalling how he walked out of White Hart Lane and turned right, Tony simply said: “We just got smashed.” He added: “They came from every angle, from every corner, and they came at us. And the police just couldn’t control it.",
      "“My pal, Harry Hamilton, he is getting dragged off by the coppers, because we are all fighting, and I mean proper fighting in the street, in a circle and it is hands, everything. They are coming from behind, coming at the side.",
      "“And Harry is getting dragged off but by the time he is getting dragged off, I’ve got us against the wall, and there must have been about maybe 40 of us against the wall because it was just coming from everywhere.",
      "“I just remember being in the middle of hands and legs going and I mean we are being whacked all over. I just remember seeing Harry going in the back of the car, and I looked at him and thought, ‘You f****** lucky b******.”",
      "Tony, who went on to work security at Gary Neville’s Hotel Football, added: “And that is what makes it funny because there are certain things, this is dangerous, you are getting hammered, the lads are getting battered, getting butchered, and I’ve got these kids from Wythenshawe, I won’t say their names they know who they are, screaming, screaming, ‘Tony, save me, save me’ and all that. And we are getting hammered.”",
      "He said the petrified younger lads in the mob started using him as a human shield. He continued: “I couldn’t go on the floor because they had hold of my body, using my legs and arms to fend these people off who were coming at me.",
      "“There were just a few coppers running in now and again and as they went to the right to hit these Tottenham fans, the Tottenham fans were coming from the left. I thought, ‘When is this going to stop?'",
      "“The one thing that stood out with me all the time, I’ve known him all my life, great kid, cockney kid, Robert from Pekcham, he is trying to gee us up, I am trying to gee us up, like, 'Stay together, we are going to die here, we are going to die.'”",
      "Tony, who has been jailed three times for football related offences, said the group managed to stay together and edge closer to Seven Sisters station. But he said the street was “full of Tottenham baying for blood”.",

      "“We were frantically trying to get in,” he explained, saying they dived under the police horse to safety. “We were shattered, and I mean physically shattered, but we were laughing because we were all looking at each other like ‘oh my god’. But we were still together - you can take a good hiding but still be together. But it was the part and parcel of Tottenham.”",
      "The lads eventually boarded a train to Euston and he said there was a relief at “getting out there alive, without being put in hospital”. However, 20 minutes later, he said he experienced something he had never experienced before.",
      "In his own words, he explained: “We got off at Euston and we were talking up the big street just before where the fire station is now, and right out of the side street, Tottenham, just come charging at us, big planks of wood and I actually mouthed the words, ‘Oh my god, not again.’",
      "“But we was in no mood to stand and fight, it was just like, there’s Euston, get there, there is loads of them, they’ve got sticks, planks of wood, there is no point, we have had enough here, let’s just get off, we didn’t even entertain it.",
      "“We might have been able to stand and have a scuffle but we took enough good hidings, enough is enough.”",
      "He said they were chased up the stairways at Euston but they managed to escape and make it back to Manchester.",

      "It's all or nothing for Manchester United's season as they bid for a shot at glory ahead of the Europa League final. Ruben Amorim's side will take on Premier League rivals Tottenham hoping to end their disastrous season with silverware after jetting out to Bilbao for Wednesday's showpiece.",
      "Their opponents Spurs aren't in much better form after sinking to 17th after one win in seven, with five defeats in six and it should be a competitive final.",
      "The result could have huge consequences for United's summer of spending knowing that victory will put them in next season's Champions League - allowing them to target a higher calibre of player - while defeat will leave them without Europe entirely.",
      "The first deal United look to have got over the line is Wolves star Matheus Cunha, who wants to join Old Trafford regardless of whether they're playing in the Champions League next season.",
      "Cunha has a £63million release clause in his contract at Molineux and its understood United are close to agreeing a deal to sign the forward.",
      "The Brazilian has scored 15 times in the Premier League and is now attracting interest from some big times - including Liverpool and Arsenal.",
      "But with United now closing in on a move for the player, Neville has talked up his ability up front and said the club were \"desperate\" for someone of his calibre.",
      "\"They need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's [Cunha] a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.\"",
      "Another forward United are being linked with is Jonathan David - and that would be a slightly more straight forward move as he's available on a free transfer.",
      "David is set to leave Lille for nothing this summer after yet another superb season in front of goal. He's netted 25 times in all competitions and has confirmed he will depart at the end of the season.",
      "United will hope to among the frontrunners to sign him as they look to further upgrade their forward line in the wake of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee's timid displays.",
      "But his Canada national team boss Jesse Marsch has urged the player to pick a club where he will play often and compete for trophies.",
      "\"Knowing Johnny, he is going to want to play,\" Marsch said. \"He’s going to want to go to the best club he can be at. And I think achieve the most in terms of what it would mean to compete for trophies in Europe. But he’s going to want to play as well.",
      "\"And I think that’s important. I think the most important thing for him is, it’s not good if he goes somewhere and then he has to play on the bench a lot and not get minutes to keep himself sharp and fit and ready to go, especially with the World Cup being a year away.",
      "“I don’t even think Johnny really knows quite yet what that is, but I’m sure he’ll make a good decision. We’re hopeful that he can be with us this summer. But more importantly, we want him to be in a good situation, so that the next year that he has under his belt really leads him into the 2026 World Cup in a good way.”",
      "Making up a trio of attacking targets, you could argue that Amorim's dream signing would be his former Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres, but this would probably be the most challenging deal to get over the line.",
      "The Sweden international is one of Europe's most sought-after forwards after his ridiculous goalscoring efforts this season, netting 53 goals in 51 games in all competitions and he looks likely to win the European Golden Shoe this season.",
      "Amorim is a big reason for Gyokeres' top performances over the last two seasons with Lisbon and he would certainly take United to the next level if he did join.",
      "But it's understood the player would be desperate to play in the Champions League next season, so his move to Old Trafford would hinge on whether the team can win the Europa League on Wednesday night.",
      "If they are defeated by Tottenham, then Arsenal would likely take the lead in the race for Gyokeres - having earmarked him as their main transfer target this summer."

The Red Devils have flown out to Bilbao hoping to finish their awful season with silverware, with Spurs standing in their way.",
      "United will be favourites against Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham due to their far superior record in finals and winning trophies, but both teams have struggled in the Premier League this season, with the teams sitting 16th and 17th in the table respectively.",
      "Spurs might have an upper hand going into the game after beating United three times in the league and cup this season, though everything will go up in the air during a massive European final.",
      "And Ferdinand worries that his old team lack the pace and physicality of their Premier League rivals, arguing that they have performed well in Europe this season because they are yet to come up against an English team.",
      "\"The worrying thing for me from a Man United perspective is that physically we can’t keep up with any team in the Premier League,' he said, speaking to talkSPORT.",
      "\"If they go man-to-man and go toe-to-toe with us we’re at a disadvantage because our profile of our players at Man United are not players that can run as hard and as fast, and as long, and they’re not as powerful as other teams. That’s a big thing in the Premier League. In the Europa, we’re overpowering every team.",
      "\"There’s only one team I’ve watched us play against in the Europa League that we struggled against and thought 'Ooh, that was a bit too close for comfort'. Rangers, who are more akin to a Premier League side, physically. So that’s the concern for me in the final playing against a Premier League team, who have beaten us three times, that physically can, minimum, match us.\"",
      "Ferdinand has a rich history of winning trophies for Manchester United, having lifted six Premier League titles, two League Cups and the Champions League in 2007-08. He played 455 times for the club and will go down as one of their greatest defenders ever.",
      "But with United a much different side in present day under Amorim, Ferdinand insisted he wouldn't be surprised if Spurs beat them in Bilbao, though he said he simply 'couldn't call\" the result.",
      "\"I have to be honest, I can’t call a Man United result,' he told Optus Sport. 'They’re so inconsistent or they have consistently been bad in the Premier League. But the fact that they are playing against Spurs, another consistently bad team in the Premier League. But they have players who can win a match. It makes it such a hard game to call.",
      "\"I don’t think the fans can be too surprised (if Spurs win). They beat us three times already this season, so it’s not going to be a surprise if they beat us a fourth time. I think it’s only going to be stupid people that are going, 'Oh my god, I can’t believe this'.",
      "\"We’re 16th because we’ve lost a lot of games. 18 Premier League games we’ve lost this season. Anyone who’s surprised if we don’t win this game against Spurs is a lunatic in my eyes.\""

      "The Portuguese playmaker has scored seven goals in the Europa League this season and provided a further five assists. Despite that form, Scholes believes the best course of action in the final against Spurs would be to give him a slightly more defensive role.",
      "\"The best way might be to drop Fernandes back in the central midfield role alongside Casemiro, which has worked well in the past, especially in European games. I think Amorim will start [Rasmus] Hojlund in the final because he hasn’t been too bad in the Europa League.",
      "\"He’s looked like a real threat and scored some important goals, but in the Premier League, he’s been really poor. If Amorim wanted to change things up, he could play Bruno Fernandes as a false nine just like Erik ten Hag did in last season’s FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "\"I know he’s tried Kobbie Mainoo in that position too, but I don’t think he’s suited to it and Fernandes is a bit more mobile. With Fernandes playing as a false centre-forward, you could also start with Casemiro and [Manuel] Ugarte in central midfield.",
      "\"There are plenty of selection dilemmas for Amorim, but I just hope he gets it right. The problem is the manager doesn’t know what he’s going to get from most of his players on the day.\"",

If Amorim was feeling the pressure ahead of tonight's £100million all-or-nothing clash in Bilbao, the United boss did not show it and nor did his inspirational captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "When asked why he felt he is not under the same pressure as Postecoglou, despite their sides being just a point and a place apart in the Premier League, the United boss was interrupted by his skipper. “He is!” said a smiling Fernandes, answering on behalf of his boss, who dissolved into laughter at the cheeky response.",
      "“He wants my job!” was Amorim's retort. “He’ll be a very very good coach. But he has to work on his mindset. He doesn’t know how to deal with people!” The light-hearted exchange between Fernandes and Amorim gave an insight into the calm mentality within the United camp ahead of what will be a season-defining game for both clubs.",
      "While Postecoglou is almost certainly on his way this summer, Amorim's job is not under threat, a position the 40-year-old Portuguese coach admitted is hard to explain, given they have had such similarly calamitous domestic seasons.",
      "“I don’t know,” said Amorim. “I know that in this kind of club, also Tottenham, but especially Manchester United, it’s strange because you have some coaches here that lose some games and are sacked. So it’s hard to explain.",
      "“But I think people see what we're trying to do and see I’m about thinking more about the club than myself. People, especially the board, understand that we have a lot of issues that in their context are really hard.",
      "\"I don’t know how to explain how the fans like me in this moment. But the good thing is I never worry about that. That's a part of being a coach and the most important thing is I know what I'm doing and I explained everything before when we started.",
      "“I explained about a storm coming, I explained all the problems we have to the board, so I was so clear and I explained that I will not change my ideas. So they cannot say one thing about what I said to get the job and then I change my mind.",
      "\"It’s the opposite. I think the board can understand that, I think the fans can understand that but we will reach a moment where we have to win - no matter what.”",
      "Despite their abysmal Premier League form this season, which has seen them lose 18 times, United remain unbeaten in the Europa League, with nine wins and five draws. They looked to be heading out when trailing Lyon 4-2 in extra-time in the quarter-finals, but staged an epic late comeback to win 5-4, with Harry Maguire plundering a 121st-minute winner.",
      "That fightback, coupled with a 7-1 aggregate semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao, denying the hosts the chance to reach the final at home, fuelled the narrative that United's name is on the trophy. Fernandes hinted as much when he said: \"Everyone knows about Fergie time here, so we just have to believe that the magic is still present at the club.",
      "\"But a final is a final - it doesn't matter who we're playing. Finals are usually cagey affairs, as both teams are scared to make mistakes. It's two teams who have had a rough season, but who can end it with a European trophy.\""

      "United saw their rating fall from four stars all the way down to two. The past few months have been spent attempting to fix the issues identified in that review but it doesn’t appear to have worked.",
      "According to Mail Online, the fresh report has offered a number of concerns. It is suggested that mouse droppings were found across seven areas of Old Trafford including the Ambassador Lounge, the Manchester Suite and under the buffet bar in the Number 7 suite - the latter of which is dubbed as one of the most stylish spaces in the stadium, with prices starting at around £550.",
      "Supporters are also charged around £600 for tickets in the Manchester Suite where a ‘large number of droppings’ were found as per the report. As quoted by The Mail, a United spokesperson said: “Manchester United implements a robust pest-control system throughout Old Trafford.",
      "“Multiple weekly checks are made in all catering areas and stringent measures are taken to ensure levels of hygiene and cleanliness are high wherever food is stored, prepared and served. If incidences of this nature do occur at the stadium, immediate and appropriate action is taken.”",
      "Away from the suites, the report revealed a number dirty areas, with the labelling of certain foods a particular concern. In United’s defence, both of those issues were immediately addressed.",
      "And inspectors noted that ‘it is evident that significant work has taken place to control the mice activity on site’, while they said that the club ‘needs to persevere with the measures being implemented to eradicate activity within food areas.’",
      "The latest Old Trafford report comes just months after plans for a mega-money rebuild of the club was announced. Speaking after the £2bn plans were unveiled, Jim Ratcliffe said: “The north of England has won 10 Champions League medals, London has two. But London has Wembley, Twickenham, Wimbledon and the Olympic Village.",
      "\"The north of England deserves a stadium where England can play football, where we can hold the Champions League final, and one befitting of Manchester United's stature. Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport.\""

      "Amorim's feeling is not uncommon in Manchester with Harry Maguire, who scored the winner to see off Lyon in the quarter-finals, admitting that a trophy would not make up for the dire season they've had, which has seen them lose 18 times in the league.",
      "He said: \"It wouldn't save the season because I think it's been disappointing. There's been too many games that we've lost, far too inconsistent. It's been a difficult season. It's been a disappointing season but of course football is about memories, it's about creating memories, it's about winning trophies and we have a great opportunity to win a trophy.\"",

      "He said: \"We are not ready to play in the Premier League, be competitive, and to be in the Champions League. We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition [Europa League], to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League. Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions. So, it is a dilemma, but we want to win, of course.\""

      "It's approaching 4pm in Bilbao on Tuesday. The sun is shining, and the noise is growing. But the noise has a distinctively cockney twang. In pockets on different streets approaching San Mames, Tottenham fans are cranking up the volume.",
      "As Spurs fans spill out onto the streets from one small bar near the ground, they start to wonder out loud where the United fans are. \"Where the f**k are Man United?\" is their Bilbao reworking of a song they often sing.",
      "A day before the Europa League final, it did feel like there were more Tottenham fans in the streets and bars of Bilbao, with a suggestion last week that they were expected to outnumber United fans on the money.",
      "But then it's also the case that the two sets of fans do things differently. While Spurs fans were gathering in numbers, smaller groups of Mancunians were seated around tables in different bars across this wonderful city.",
      "There were dads and lads in the main fanzone, trying to kick footballs into boats on the Nervion River and queuing to have their photo taken with the Europa League trophy. There were groups of five or six, bucket hats on, still singing 'For United are going to Bilbao' while knocking back pints in temperatures that will feel familiar after the spring that Manchester has enjoyed.",
      "There was no mass gathering, though - at least not yet. There might have been more substantial sing-alongs on Tuesday night, and the atmosphere will be cranked up a notch on the day of the final.",
      "There is room for 20,000 fans at United's fanzone in Etxebarria Parkea, with a musical line-up that could sell out Heaton Park, but for many of United's regular European away-dayers, such substantial shows of force and numbers are to be avoided. It's also true that Etxebarria Parkea is at the top of a hill in Bilbao, and as beautiful as the views are, the walk to get there isn't all that much fun.",
      "A group of United fans were scouting it out on Tuesday, climbing the steps to see the ring of steel around it. The big screen is up, and the bars and toilets are ready to go. \"It's f**king miles away,\" didn't suggest they would be going back on game day.",
      "The journey to Bilbao - and the wider Basque Country - has also been challenging. John and John, father and son United fans, were reunited in the city on Tuesday. Dad flew in from Manchester via Amsterdam, but his son was here via Hong Kong.",
      "\"I moved to Hong Kong for work, I don't get back for games often, but I had to be at this one,\" said the younger John.",
      "\"It took 20 hours to get from Hong Kong to Bilbao, but it's nice to be in the sun now. It's a really nice city, it's very friendly and seems like a nice place.",
      "\"I'm not that confident, I think it's going to be dull, 1-0 to United with a Fernandes penalty.\"",
      "They weren't the only father and son. Jonathan Law, from Worsley, stopped for a chat with his son Leo, and they will be hoping Leo's teachers aren't MEN readers after he admitted his son was skipping school to get a different kind of education this week.",
      "\"We just had to be here. We paid too much for the tickets, too much for the hotel, too much for the flights, but we're glad we're here. It's better than being at school,\" said Jonathan, with Leo nodding at that last comment.",
      "\"I'm confident, the closer it gets, the more confident I'm getting. It's United, isn't it? We can turn it on in certain games.\"",
      "Another Mancunian, Paul, was walking around the city with his son Jake. Although tempted, he decided against a chat as his son was also swapping school for watching United in a European final.",
      "One supporter who didn't pay too much for this journey was Nate, who was in Bilbao from Torbay in Devon. A stroke of good fortune had brought him to the city.",
      "\"I've been in Spain in my motor home for a month, I'm sailing back from Santander to Plymouth on Thursday. I booked the crossing six months ago, not realising United were going to get to the final,\" he said.",
      "\"When we booked it, I never booked it with this in mind, but as they progressed through the rounds, I realised there was a possibility they were going to get to the final. Bilbao in the semi-final was the big one to get over.\"",
      "He is also one of the many United fans who have made the journey without a ticket, but he did the same in Stockholm for the Europa League final against Ajax in 2017 and plans to try the same approach to getting inside San Mames.",
      "\"I don't have a ticket, but everyone says leave it as long as possible, that's what I did in Stockholm,\" he said. \"I left it until five minutes before kick-off and got two tickets for face value, so the longer you hold the nerve, the better you have of getting good value.\"",
      "Although United fans seemed outnumbered on Tuesday, that might not be the case on matchday. Thousands are staying around the Basque Country after refusing to pay the price of accommodation in Bilbao.",
      "The MEN are holed up in San Sebastian, and a few groups of United fans were in the city on Monday night. More arrived on Tuesday, and others are on the other side of Bilbao in Santander.",
      "Andrew Houten and his dad flew from Manchester to Nantes in the west of France on Monday. They then took the train further south to Bordeaux before getting a coach to Bilbao. They are staying in Zaramillo, a small village about 20 minutes outside of Bilbao.",
      "Richard, a United fan from Blackpool, found another way to beat the exorbitant flight prices. Just come earlier.",
      "\"I went via Berlin,\" he said. “The flights were difficult, and I'm going back via Mallorca. I saw quite a few United fans on the route out, and it's a Sunday night to Friday trip. I had to square it with the wife, although I made sure I booked it first!",
      "\"The atmosphere has been fairly tame so far, but we found a couple of bars on Monday that were quite lively. There was a good mix of United and Spurs. It's been very friendly so far.",
      "\"I can't say I'm feeling confident, I think it's going to finish about 1 in the morning.\"",
      "For those fans staying outside of Bilbao, the challenge of getting back to their accommodation will begin then. For now, they have the excitement of a matchday to come. And today, the Spurs fans might see a little more red in Bilbao."

      "If it was strategic of Manchester United to allow Tottenham Hotspur to hold their pre-match duties first, it had the desired effect.",
      "Ange Postecoglou rounded on a reporter who suggested he could be remembered as a \"clown\". He dismissed concerns over his future, urging another reporter not to lose any sleep over it. He also reminded his audience he had lifted a trophy and exited stage left at his previous clubs.",
      "Sub-editors could design their back-page splashes hours before deadline. United's timekeeping for press conferences on the continent can be tardy but even if they were late Ruben Amorim was never going to be as quotable as his opposite number.",

      "Then there is Amorim, seemingly safe whatever the outcome in San Mames. Amorim is partial to a zinger but he was so relaxed that he joked Bruno Fernandes, sitting to his right, was after his job.",
      "That job is not in jeopardy. Amorim will be judged sooner than the two years he suggested it was fair to assess him at United. He has to oversee demonstrable improvement ahead of the trio of international breaks in September, October and November next season.",
      "He sounded borderline bewildered he was not as certain to be summoned to the guillotine as Postecoglou is. \"It's strange because you have some coaches that are here that lose some games and they are sacked. It's hard to explain,\" he shrugged.",
      "Not really. Ineos sought out every Tom, Dick and Harry to replace Erik ten Hag, watched United punch above their weight in the FA Cup final, had a leadership vacuum, lost their nerve and pandered to fickle fans.",
      "Once decision-makers were in the building and this season was becoming an extension of last season, they left emotion at the door. Ten Hag was never their man but Amorim is.",
      "In The Thick of It, Malcolm Tucker spells it out for the gaffe-prone minister Nicola Murray: \"The PM is not going to sack you after a week. Sacked after 12 months - looks live you've f****d up. Sacked after a week - looks like he's f****d up.\" The timeframes are different for the United brains trust and Amorim but the same logic applies.",
      "To dismiss Amorim after six months would be their f**k-up. Amorim has inherited an inadequate squad teeming with expensive errors and United have to purge it in the summer.",
      "He has reiterated that winning the Europa League this season cannot mask United's problems. Quite so. United have to be measured by their Premier League form: 16th, 18 defeats, -12 goal difference, no back-to-back wins. That would be relegation form in other seasons. Under Amorim, it is six wins out of 26 and 18 defeats. That is sackable form.",
      "But context is key. United assembled a Dutch-centric squad over three summers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's cabal inexplicably backed Ten Hag to the hilt despite all the evidence pointing to the contrary.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident but we already know the problems,\" Amorim explained. \"There's a lot of things that we need to change in our club. The way we do everything during the week in Carrington, the recruitment, the academy, I think we need to improve.",
      "\"So it's hard to point one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.\"",
      "This was a prosaic pre-match gathering, even with the majority of questions asked by the dedicated correspondents accustomed to Amorim's stock answers. He has been on repeat for several months as United's domestic form has remained consistently dire and, without any jeopardy surrounding Amorim's role, apathy has developed.",
      "He could afford to be chipper with Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt the only senior players absent from the travelling squad. De Ligt strolled around the San Mames pitch with teammates at 7pm but Amorim confirmed he is out.",
      "Leny Yoro, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee will only be able to get \"limited\" playing time. Zirkzee last played 38 days ago, Dalot has been sidelined for a month but Yoro's foot injury was only ten days ago.",
      "Zirkzee's presence was a major surprise. Rasmus Hojlund has been hapless this calendar year, scoring three goals in 33 games. Amorim convinced Zirkzee, ruled out for the season with a hamstring injury five weeks ago, to make himself available as the only alternative striker, with Chido Obi ineligible and also not ready.",
      "\"They recovered quite well,\" Amorim remarked. \"They pushed. Of course, we respect the feeling of the player, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to be part of the team and that is a very, very good sign.",
      "\"And it's very good for us. Of course they are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "The notion that Zirkzee could start ahead of Hojlund is unrealistic. United salvaged last season in the FA Cup final by dropping Hojlund in favour of a strikerless starting XI but that was in a 4-2-3-1, not the 3-4-2-1 Amorim swears by.",
      "\"Our system is the normal system that can change the characteristics,\" Amorim added. \"It's not about playing as a striker or without a striker. It's a system like any other that you can change the characteristics.",
      "\"But it doesn't matter what happened in the last final because it was a different team, different competition, different context, so everything was different. I just focused on the way we play, the way Tottenham play, what we can do to be better than the last two games.",
      "\"So that was my focus and not the last time that we won a cup.\"",
      "There was more levity when Maguire's dribble-and-cross against Athletic Bilbao was raised. Amorim and Fernandes were both giggling. \"The manager has me dribbling down the wing every day in training,\" Maguire quipped. He stressed that he hoped he would not have to go up front on Wednesday evening.",
      "A European final is no occasion to be clowning around."

      "The dedicated Red had been to every cup final, including Europeans, until recently when a friend who was responsible for sorting their tickets made an error, but Thomas will be present at the Estadio de San Mames on Wednesday night and he can't wait to take his seat in the stadium.",
      "\"My other grandson is going with his mates and they're flying via Tenerife,\" Thomas laughed. \"He's been to the quarter-finals and semi-finals away in Lyon and Bilbao, and he booked his flights for the final early.",
      "\"The Lyon match at Old Trafford was crazy. We had to make a dash to the toilet and the equaliser was scored, so we darted back in at the bottom and we were right where Maguire scored.",
      "\"It was amazing, something like '99 [Champions League final at Camp Nou] because they scored three goals in just a few minutes. It has to go down as one of my favourite games anyway.\"",
      "Thomas continued: \"They're the only unbeaten team in Europe, so I fancy them with how we've been. It's been a ride when you compare it to the Premier League, which has been terrible.",
      "\"Because they can't get relegated, I don't think they've been bothered, so that's not a good thing. But I'll be phoning you up if they win the trophy! We've beaten Tottenham lots down the years.\"",

      "Thomas' first season at Old Trafford was in 1957 and he's seen dozens of United legends in the flesh, but he believes Bruno Fernandes should be remembered as one of the greats.",
      "Fernandes scored a brace in the Europa League semi-final first leg and has continued to be a driving force in a struggling team. \"He's everything, he pushes, he assists and scores goals,\" said Thomas.",
      "\"He's my hero in this team and I hope he doesn't leave in the summer. We need to keep him for next season, see who we buy in the summer, because you can't replace a player like him.",
      "\"He's the one who sticks out. We've always had good midfield players who are leaders. He just falls short of Bryan Robson for me, who was Captain Fantastic, but he probably comes close.\"",

      "Manchester United will be targeting Europa League glory when they face Tottenham Hotspur in the final at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao tonight.",
      "United have made it all the way to their third Europa League final in nine seasons boasting an impressive unbeaten run in the competition, winning nine and drawing five of their first 14 games, meaning they will be determined to jump the final hurdle and return to Manchester with silverware.",
      "Just like Spurs, United have endured a wretched Premier League campaign, meaning the opportunity to win the Europa League and secure Champions League qualification for next term would salvage something from their campaign.",
      "Regarding the team news, United head coach Ruben Amorim has taken a 26-man squad to Bilbao with him, which includes Diogo Dalot, Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee, all of whom have recovered from injury issues to be involved.",
      "Below, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see United line up in the final:",
      "United have some genuine dilemmas. Yoro's availability is significant and Noussair Mazraoui merits a start. It should be a point of principle not to start Luke Shaw when he has lined up four times within three weeks on the eve of a final.",
      "Ideally, United would not play Rasmus Hojlund. We know he will start but he shouldn't. United won a trophy last season because Hojlund was taken out of the team for the FA Cup final and Bruno Fernandes would be an upgrade.",
      "You can play Fernandes anywhere and he will have an impact. United need to balance pragmatism with proactivism and not have the starting XI overloaded with defensive players.",
      "The big unknown here is the fitness of the three players who have returned to training this week. Well, two of them really, Zirkzee surely won't be fit to start.",
      "Yoro seems the most likely to get the nod from the beginning. As a centre-back his workload is smaller and he has only really missed a week of training. That means Lindelof can drop to the bench and Yoro can line up alongside Shaw and Maguire.",
      "Dalot is a valuable option off the bench but after a month out with a hamstring injury, I wouldn't risk starting him. He can influence the game as a sub, so Mazraoui plays on the right and Dorgu on the left. Playing Mazraoui is balanced by Fernandes dropping into a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, with Ugarte the unfortunate fall guy.",
      "Moving Fernandes back will allow Amad and Mount to fill those No. 10 roles, with Garnacho primed for a role off the bench. Hojlund has to start as the striker.",
      "The biggest game of United's season is finally here - the talking has ended and it is time for the players to deliver on the pitch. Amorim named a 26-man travelling squad for the game, but three players are guaranteed to miss out, and perhaps that's evidence of him playing mind games with Ange Postecoglou.",
      "I'd start with Mazraoui, Maguire and Yoro in the back three, who should be able to limit Tottenham's threat. It also makes sense to start Dalot and Dorgu at wing-back.",
      "Amad must start and I prefer him in the No.10 position for now, which means Dalot gets the nod at right wing-back in my team and Fernandes is dropped back into midfield alongside Casemiro.",
      "Tottenham will have prepared to face an out-of-form Hojlund in the Europa League final, so starting Zirkzee would provide some unpredictability and give United a slight advantage.",
      "Amorim has some tough calls to make in just about every position. Yoro's availability means he must start somewhere in the back-three, but there will be some debate about exactly where.",
      "I would start him on the left, as that was where he was flourishing prior to his recent injury. Maguire should start in the middle and Mazraoui is a logical candidate to start on the right amid Dalot's return.",
      "Dalot, if his fitness allows, should start at right wing-back and Dorgu is an obvious pick on the opposite flank. Casemiro and Ugarte have developed a good midfield bond in the Europa League and ought to start together in the engine room.",
      "Amad has to start after the season he has had, meaning he should operate in the right-sided No.10 role. Hojlund has struggled for goals all season and United, despite not testing the water recently, would be better off allowing Fernandes to lead the attack as a false-nine.",
      "As Samuel has already said, Fernandes has the ability to make something happen from just about anywhere on the pitch."

Despite their domestic struggles, they stand on the cusp of claiming silverware and a spot in next season's Champions League.",
      "The job security of both managers has been under scrutiny due to their teams' lacklustre league performances. Ruben Amorim appears to be on firmer ground than his Tottenham counterpart, yet he recognises the immense value of the upcoming trophy.",
      "Amorim commented on the impact of the potential win, saying: \"A new future for me I think is not the case, but it is going to help us to finish the season. People will look at our team in a different way because winning a European title is really important.\"",
      "Ange Postecoglou also chatted about the significance of tonight's match, adding: \"That opportunity is to provide something special for the football club and for the supporters and for everyone who has worked so hard.\"",

      "A forgettable Premier League campaign means they are under immense pressure to come out on top in Bilbao, win a third trophy in as many seasons and secure a place in next season's Champions League.",
      "Regarding the team news, United have taken a 26-man squad to Bilbao, featuring Diogo Dalot, Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee, who have all recovered from injury issues in time for the final.",
      "As has been the case throughout United's knockout campaign, Andre Onana is expected to start in goal and make his 13th Europa League appearance of the season. He will be keen to add to the clean sheet he earned when United faced Athletic at the San Mames Stadium earlier this month.",
      "Yoro's availability must be tempting head coach Ruben Amorim to throw him straight into the starting XI. He was in excellent form prior to being forced off against West Ham United just over a week ago, meaning if he is deemed fit enough to start, Amorim might take the gamble for a game of such importance.",
      "Harry Maguire has played a key role in United's run to the final and is poised to be one of the first names on the teamsheet, meaning he is likely to start in the centre of the back-three.",
      "Should Yoro and Maguire occupy two of the three centre-back berths, Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof will compete for the final spot, and Shaw could get the nod to provide a left-footed presence.",
      "Despite being included in the squad, Dalot might have to settle for a place on the bench, leaving Noussair Mazraoui to start at right wing-back. He has been one of United's most consistent performers this term and he started both legs of United's semi-final triumph over Bilbao at right wing-back.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is a shoo-in on the opposite flank, meaning he is expected to maintain his record of starting every Europa League game since joining United from Lecce earlier this year.",
      "Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro have occupied the two midfield berths for each of United's last four Europa League games, meaning they are highly likely to maintain their partnership in the centre of midfield. Casemiro started Friday night's 1-0 defeat to Chelsea while Ugarte was introduced from the bench in the second half.",
      "With Amorim having refused to experiment with a striker-less formation in recent weeks, the expectation is that Rasmus Hojlund will spearhead United's attack and be supported by Bruno Fernandes and Amad in the two No.10 positions.",
      "The prospect of the latter starting in attack means Alejandro Garnacho could be forced to start on the bench.",

      "The biggest surprise was they were joined by Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman has been out of action since the defeat to Newcastle on April 13 and even though he recently claimed it would not be \"impossible\" for him to recover in time for the final, it seemed very unlikely after Amorim had previously ruled him out for the season.",

      "There wasn't such good news on Matthijs de Ligt. The defeneder has travelled to Bilbao with his teammates but will play no part in tonight's game, meaning the Dutchman and Lisandro Martinez are the only two United players to miss out through injury.",

      "United aren't alone in the race for Gyokeres with Arsenal reportedly in pole position. It's been claimed that new sporting director Andrea Berta had made the former Coventry City star his number one target ahead of the summer to bolster Mikel Arteta's attack.",

      "It's claimed that Arsenal are taking their time in sending their first formal offer and Paris Saint-Germain have removed themselves from the race. The French outlet state that United are \"the first major European club to have made a concrete move\"."

Considering United's track record of playing in Europe, the pressure is on them to win and book their place in the top tier competition.",

What's more, their manager Ange Postecoglou has insisted he always wins a trophy by his second season at a club and the Europa League marks his last opportunity to do just that.",

      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Ollie Watkins and Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Your guess is as good as ours.",
      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Liam Delap (Ipswich Town)\nEvery Premier League club – except Arsenal – is chasing Liam Delap, hopefully resulting in an exciting transfer saga that ends at the right time instead of dragging on and on and on.",
      "Despite attracting interest from several competent football clubs, it’s reportedly Manchester United (or Chelsea… or United again) leading the race. Delap is open to the move, which should be enough of a red flag for everyone else to back off and let United crack on.",
      "Twelve goals in 36 matches in a debut Premier League season is a very solid return for the 22-year-old. Not long ago it was 12 in 30, which looked even better and explains the hype.",
      "Ipswich’s relegation and his loss of form won’t stop the vultures circling, and £30million still feels like a bargain. Especially for a striker who is, by all accounts, a slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "8) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that. As could Florian Wirtz, Alejandro Grimaldo, Jonathan Tah, Piero Hincapie and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. Chelsea seem very keen – him and Delap fit their ‘project signing’ blueprint. This is why Arsenal prefer Gyokeres, who is more of a ready-made title winner.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Liverpool, though Man United and Arsenal are obviously in the picture.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",

      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea now seem to prefer Sesko and Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but that would open him up to ridicule after calling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s agent a “dumb f**k” for saying he was moving there.",
      "Clubs seem to be oblivious to Osimhen’s availability but it’s guaranteed that the Nigerian will leave Napoli this summer after spending the season on loan at Galatasaray. His bridges in Naples have been burned to the ground.",

      "Of the many areas Manchester United need to strengthen this summer, goalkeeper is the position they will most resent having to address.",
      "Andre Onana should have been United’s No. 1 for a decade; that was the plan when the Red Devils spent £43.7million on the Cameroonian in 2023 to replace David De Gea and, to be fair to the recruitment ‘brains trust’ at Old Trafford at the time, there was very little dissent over their pick.",
      "Onana was viewed as a safe set of hands with two feet that would help United play the Ten Hag way, a concept that remains a mystery. The ex-Ajax keeper had just helped Inter Milan get to the Champions League final and the decision to give him De Gea’s gloves was overwhelmingly well-received by everyone bar De Gea.",
      "The recent revisionism around De Gea highlights how far short Onana has come to matching those early expectations. Despite the Spaniard’s success at Fiorentina – after a season’s sabbatical – the decision to replace De Gea was absolutely correct. Their choice of replacement – in glorious hindsight – was not.",
      "We’ll give him a pass on the fact he hasn’t improved United in possession. Sometimes, a goalkeeper building out from the back is only as good as the players he’s passing to. As we know, many of his team-mates just aren’t up to receiving the ball under pressure, from either high-pressing opponents or the millions scrutinising them across the globe.",
      "That doesn’t excuse some of Onana’s clumsiness, especially when playing longer. But his real failings are rooted in the more traditional expectation of an elite goalkeeper: be hard to beat. Save the shots you’re expected to save, and some that you’re not.",
      "His two seasons in the United goal have been riddled with mistakes. Not just basic handling errors, but some inexplicable decision-making and highly-questionable techniques. One example: his approach to one-on-ones – stay deep, sit down – can’t be one that any of the Carrington goalkeeping coaches and analysts endorse. And, assuming they have identified it, they haven’t corrected his habit of parrying into poor areas.",
      "The fact that United are in Bilbao right now, hoping to rescue a generationally-bad season with a trophy and a route into the Champions League via the back door, is in spite of Onana’s performances.",
      "As is the case with many of their failing players that need upgrading, getting Onana out of Old Trafford won’t be easy for United without almost giving him away. Really, they need to hope a sheikh in Saudi is blinded by his profile enough to ignore his flaws.",
      "With that comes another attempt at finding a goalkeeper capable, composed and confident enough to keep United’s goal.",
      "Recent days have seen the Red Devils linked with Emiliano Martinez. At first sight, it appears to be a solid match.",
      "Martinez, not long ago viewed by some as the best on the planet largely because of his role in making Argentina kings of the world, appears to possess the requisite confidence. Outwardly at least, he presents as a character big enough to handle the pressure of defending even United’s goal.",
      "But perhaps we shouldn’t be fooled by his bravado. It is entirely likely that Martinez is more sensitive and self-aware than Onana. The Argentina No.1 has spoken about how he has worked on portraying an image of infallibility; much of the arrogance is an act. Which is absolutely fine – goalkeepers do need to fake it if they aren’t feeling it. But we ought not to believe that Martinez is the outstanding candidate based purely on the character he plays.",
      "But you could argue that type of personality is not what United need at this stage of whatever trauma it is they are currently going through. An attention-seeking egomaniac impatient with others’ imperfections would not lead a happy existence behind Ruben’s reds right now.",

      "The game doesn’t produce many goalkeepers with those traits anymore. Modern keepers tend to carry a calmer authority, more in the mould of Alisson than Schmeichel or Kahn.",
      "Plenty still skirt close to the edge, but the likes of Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale have worked hard to train their chimp rather than allow it to fling faeces while swinging from the goalposts.",
      "Martinez too has tweaked his mindset and persona on the way to becoming one of the Premier League’s best, channelling the frustration of being overlooked at Arsenal towards oozing the confidence that helped Argentina to a third star. It worked for him then. But that doesn’t mean it will work at Old Trafford.",
      "He doesn’t have to act the d*ck now. The chip on his shoulder from being binned by Arsenal ought to have been smoothed by a World Cup winner’s medal and various individual honours thrusted from his groin that vindicate him from whatever doubts plagued him. It’s a matter of opinion whether Martinez is the best in the Premier League/Europe/world, but he’s rightly in all those conversations. That should be enough to facilitate the evolution from manufactured arrogance to supreme and justified confidence.",
      "United need much more of the latter than the former. Of course, Villa will have plenty to say about Martinez’s next steps. Shipping to Saudi is a very different prospect to selling to a domestic rival, if United can still be labelled that. Without making it worth their while, there is certainly more in a move for United than Villa.",
      "Which leads us to believe it perhaps won’t happen, especially if United are turned over by Tottenham in the Battle of the Banter Clubs. Regardless of the outcome in Bilbao, persisting with Onana is not an option for a serious club if United are hoping to be viewed as one again in the near future. The Cameroonian must be replaced, by an experienced, proven stopper. And Martinez ticks most of their boxes.",
      "Man Utd’s Andre Onana features twice, but one Brighton player has a hat-trick of shame in this ranking of the worst performances in this season’s Premier League.",

      "Both can point to a vast discrepancy between their Premier League and Europa League form. Both have, correctly and inevitably, prioritised this competition at further cost to already ruined domestic campaigns.",
      "Both have made it abundantly clear where their priorities have been for months now.",
      "But with Spurs this feels like an opportunistic chance for catharsis, to cast off a banter albatross at long, long last and move on with their lives. On its own, the Europa League final perhaps means more for them, but as part of a wider plan it is United who face the bigger sliding doors moment in Bilbao.",
      "Win or lose, Spurs will reset and relaunch yet again under a new manager, who will be given some of the signings he needs yet by no means all. They will spend a year or two in transition, lose their nerve, and start the whole process again. It is the history of the Tottenham.",
      "United’s case is slightly different. They are in the early stages of one of their own frequent post-Fergie resets, one that involved bringing in a manager whose style of play is almost entirely at odds with the squad that’s been left at his disposal.",
      "While Ange Postecoglou will surely leave Spurs win or lose, Amorim surely stays. What alters with victory here is the potential speed and scope of the rebuild he badly needs this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s move to Old Trafford is welcome, and shows that even in their current reduced and sorry state United remain a draw for players with what are, on paper, better choices.",
      "But there is no doubt that the financial and footballing benefits of being able to offer Champions League football will make United’s other wooing missions this summer that bit easier.",
      "Bluntly, even as wretched as they are now, United in the gutter are still looking at the stars. Given the right tools and opportunity, Amorim remains a manager capable of restoring them to something like their rightful place in English football even after his unnecessarily chaotic and poorly-timed arrival.",
      "For Spurs, Wednesday night in Bilbao is a destination in itself. A release of emotion and frustration akin to that we’ve already seen this season for Newcastle and Crystal Palace.",
      "For United, though, it represents more of a stepping stone. They’ll enjoy the night if it goes their way, of course, but it won’t even be the first time they’ve won this trophy in the post-Fergie wilderness years.",
      "The flipside, of course, is that defeat comes with dread consequences and further erosion of an already significantly depleted aura.",
      "While victory represents a potentially transformative springboard for Amorim and the club, defeat will leave them as not only the Manchester United team that finished 16th – or maybe even worse – in the Premier League but also the one that handed a trophy to Tottenham.",
      "This one game comes to early in Amorim’s reign to definitively make or break him right now, but it still feels like when his United career comes to be judged, the result of this one game will be a pivotal moment in setting its overall course."

      "Nine Man Utd players who should leave this summer\nFollowing the season United have had, where it’s honestly been such a drag watching some games, it makes you think how United have somehow gone from 8th place last year in the league with Ten Hag at the helm (which was deemed as disastrous), to 16th in the league this year. It proves some players are just rubbish and there for the paycheck. There isn’t really an excuse for it to be finishing not only in the lower half of the table, but to be finishing below 15th place, is brutally shite.",
      "I have no idea how the team are somehow the only unbeaten side in Europe this season, but it looks like Amorim does have a few tricks up his sleeve in European competition, but has to improve drastically in the Premier League next season otherwise he will probably get sacked. Truth be told, I wish the whole board would just get sacked, with former United players and those who understand the standards of the club to take their place, but Ratcliffe and the Glazers are the ones in charge and it doesn’t look like that will change any time soon…",
      "If the owners actually had some sense of responsibility and courage, and the manager must communicate this as well, they need to have a serious conversation with some of the players at the club and insist on putting them on the transfer list. And if United can’t sell them due to the ridiculous salaries they are on, at least loan them and agree a deal with another club to pay for 40-50% of their wage. The players who need to leave are the following.",
      "Luke Shaw: This player is honestly so lucky to have been at United for the last 11 years. Yes its unfortunate how his leg injury ruined his potential and his fitness, but United should have gotten rid of Shaw years ago. Not reliable or good enough and did have a few good years, but it’s time to go.",
      "Jonny Evans: Did we seriously just sign him to keep Tom Heaton some company? Pointless signing.",
      "Victor Lindelof: Actually rate him quite a lot as a defender and player, and built a somewhat solid partnership with Maguire over the years, but should try and head back to somewhere like Benfica or a mid-table club in Italy/Spain.",
      "Diogo Dalot: I think he had a great year last season, but very big downfall this year. If United can get 35-40 million for him, sell him as he isn’t good enough defensively, has headless chicken vibes.",
      "Christian Eriksen: I thought he was excellent in his first year at United and was just as good as Casemiro in that first year under Ten Hag, but time for him to leave on a free and enjoy last few years at another club.",
      "Jadon Sancho: No explanation needed, came for money and incredibly overrated. Loan him again if necessary.",
      "Marcus Rashford: Looks like he needs a new start, and if United can sell him for a reasonable amount of money, they should sell him and it’s a big salary amount off the books too.",
      "Antony: Has proven that United really were the problem, need to convince Real Betis to sign him for around 30 million and looks to suit La Liga much more than the Premier League.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund: I do think the criticism of him has been somewhat unfair, but is he good enough to score 15-20 goals a season? He just looks so uncomfortable up front and should head back to Italy where the game seemed to suit him more. Would make a big loss on him given the price paid for, but should cash in and sign another striker.",
      "I would arguably include Mason Mount as part of this list due to his injury issues, but only came in two seasons ago. Knowing United, they won’t even sell half of the players listed here, and it will be the same vicious circle of an ‘Average’ summer of transfers. 8-9 players must be sold/loaned out this summer, a large chunk of players need to leave the club before bringing in new blood. If the owners don’t realise that, then Amorim will eventually pay the price and the same thing will happen to United where they bring in a manager for 2 years max and change it up when the owners feel like it/are bored.",

      "",
      "There are some positives though…\nSo here we stand on the precipice of glory or failure. Win and the season will be marginally acceptable, lose and it will be confirmed a disastrous campaign. This goes for both teams, and the fact Spurs have got the better of us thrice this season makes me incredibly nervous (albeit the two under RA were close affairs). Which United will turn up – Ruby’s Euro diamonds or Ruben’s relegation-hunting rejects?",
      "The league season was a write-off a good couple of months ago, so I can understand some sluggish league performances. We haven’t won since March but, Newcastle aside, most matches have been fairly evenly contested. But this doesn’t make it acceptable, and Ruben has said as much.",
      "Of course the manager has to take some flak, that comes with the territory, but we have known for some time that the squad isn’t good enough regardless of what system is being played – this doesn’t necessarily mean they are all “bad” players individually, just as a collective it hasn’t worked, and changes were and are needed.",
      "I like Hojlund, but he isn’t ready to lead the line for us every week and is still learning the game and how to deal with the pressure of being at one of the world’s biggest clubs – he needs to be a 1 in 2 striker, and it remains to be seen if he can hit those numbers.",
      "Garnacho will be a fine player, but he isn’t a wingback or a #10, so doesn’t suit the system; he has improved but, again, is not ready to play there week in week out. I don’t want us to sell him but might be necessary.",
      "Our wingbacks, key positions in this system, have not delivered consistently – injuries explain some of this but, regardless, we need players there who can defend, attack and stay fit! Dorgu looks a good buy but is still raw, not sure Amass will make it with us but we’ll see. Malacia who? Dalot gives 100% but isn’t consistent in attack, he should stick to the edge of the box cutbacks as they are his most effective deliveries, and Mazraoui looks more at home as the right CB. Most of our quality in MF is aging and our GK loves a mistake. So other than that, it’s all good.",
      "It’s not all doom and gloom, Maguire continues to look good in a 3, Yoro looks a player, Diallo has come back as sharp, Zirkzee has shown some flashes and Bruno is Bruno. Mount has even stayed fit for longer than 3 matches. We will add to the squad in the summer (Cunha would be perfect, would love Mbeumo but can’t see it), there are some promising youth players to come through and the players we keep will have more of an idea of what is expected of them.",
      "The point being, talk of getting rid of Amorim at this stage is madness. He will know that next season brings less patience, and his methods have to be seen to be working in the league as that is our bread and butter. A trophy and CL place would, however, be a start and buy him some further support.\nGarey (come on United!!) Vance, MUFC",

      "",
      "Is Frimpong that odd of a potential signing?\nYouth development is never linear; as good as Bradley has been, he isn’t consistent. Defensively he was excellent against Mbappe and bloody terrible against Martinelli. He’s been Cafu incarnate going forward, whilst also showing the inadequacies of Abel Xavier in some moments.",
      "For every youth prospect that excels, like a Gravenberch, there’s a youth prospect that excels and then stalls, like Bajcetic. Both may well thrive, but relying on one was foolhardy and didn’t work and relying on the other did work – though entirely out of luck rather than judgement.",
      "There is a difference between giving youth a chance with an opportunity that’s still safe to fail, and relying on youth and then their struggles hamper the whole team, the compounding pressure of that then destroys their career.",
      "Gravenberch saved the day this season but it was a forced gamble, rather than a plan that should be scaled. Beyond that, perpetually play a kid in every game, and you’ll break them as LFC did with Owen and Arteta may well do with Saka.",
      "The interesting thing about Frimpong is, if he is signed, it’d obviously provide competition for Connor Bradley, but given his attacking output, it’d not be out of the question for both to play on the right hand side. Frimpong strikes me as another potential Riise, who can play on the wing or as full back.",
      "And to that end, Salah has rightly earned a new contract, but this season has indicated a degree of burnout by April. If a season is 50+ games long, with minutes available at right wing and right back, then 40+ starts for Frimpong across both roles, and 20 + sub appearances for Connor at full back is still good squad management, and that’s discounting injuries. I’m likely mis-remembering but I recall Arsenal playing Eboue as a winger, and didn’t Saka start out as a full back before moving forward? I’m sure it’s been done before, it’s just my memory is failing me.",
      "Not everyone’s career ends up like Gareth Bale’s but the prospect of playing an attacking full back further forward isn’t entirely new, and not entirely unsuccessful. Riise was instrumental in Istanbul after all.",
      "Final thing would be that at circa thirty million, in today’s world of utterly ludicrous prices, that’s not too extravagant, and albeit losing Trent for buttons is a huge dropped-bollock, having two people replace him for an all-in cost of 30 million does repair that damage somewhat.",
      "I can empathise with the argument F365 are making about saving your transfer kitty till you know if a target is available. The inverse to that logic though is your main target’s price tag could/would swell to fill your entire budget if you wait forever, as your negotiating position is reduced: folks will know how much money you have.",
      "If LFC kept their powder dry, then Newcastle could argue they want the whole fee for Isaak up front. If LFC bring in two fullbacks relatively quickly, they could make the case to Newcastle that they’d be ‘happy’ adding extra onto the fee, but need to defer the installments across 18 months or longer etc – basically negotiating. (notwithstanding that i don’t think Isaak will move this window, just using him as an example as you did).",
      "I’d hope that with the sales of Darwin, Chiesa, Tsimikas, Kellegher, and Jota, and the departure of Trent, and the rumours of an exit for Endo and Elliot, that the club would have budget and wage bill capacity to do what they need to. If the signing of an ‘extra’ full back negates that, then as much as I really can’t be arsed with the manic fringe of the FSG-out brigade, some questions would realistically need to be asked as to where the money is. And Frimpong looks a decent buy if the club can get it sorted.\nTom",

      "On Joel Ward. Or why Palace are 12th\nYes, I’m still overwhelmed by the FA Cup Final. Details keep coming back to me, like seeing Paddy McCarthy from the 2010 survival side squaring up to one of Manchester City’s medical team, or the fact that victory was secured with two important players (Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton) requiring substitution due to head injuries.",
      "However, the dominant memory at the moment is what happened immediately before the cup presentation. Last week it was announced that Joel Ward, the longest-serving member of the current Crystal Palace squad, would be leaving the club when he contract expires in the summer.",
      "Clearly we all missed a memo because we didn’t plaster Selhurst with posters calling him a Judas, forcing him to pick “loyalty or lolly”, sending death threats to him and his family on social media and demanding the Joel Ward mural be painted over – that’s what you’re supposed to do when a long-serving right-back announces they’re leaving at the end of their contract, isn’t it?",
      "Ward joined the club from Portsmouth in 2012, leaving a side that had been relegated from the Championship for one that had finished 17th, for a fee of £400,000. The following season he made 25 appearances as Palace were promoted to the Premier League, and prior to this campaign made that many or more appearances in nine out of eleven seasons. Arguably the dictionary definition of a reliable if unspectacular full back, there is no denying that he has been one of the best value for money signings of the past 15 years – particularly as his arrival, with Palace just a year or so out of administration, meant they had to sell players in order to fund his acquisition.",
      "In a way, he’s a good example of why Palace finish roughly 12th every year. A more ruthless club would have cut Ward loose a long time ago, replaced him with someone younger, cheaper and with personal ambition in abundance that can be translated into ambition for the team. And yet, he’s still here, because as Steve Parish has said in interviews about other players, he wants to do right by the person behind the player; he knows that Ward, like Paddy McCarthy or Damien Delaney before him, still has leadership and experience to contribute to the group and its younger members even if he isn’t playing every week.",
      "Some clubs, or at least the very online people among their supporters, will see this as excessive sentimentality that holds Palace back, but it isn’t, it’s just humans being considerate to each other.",
      "And then we get to Saturday, when Ward and Guehi get to lift the FA Cup together, the first people to ever do that in Crystal Palace colours. It was a fantastic moment and something so richly deserved for someone who has done so much for the club for so long. Not being someone to actively seek the spotlight made it all the better that he got to be front and centre at the greatest moment in the club’s history – the greatest moment in the club’s history so far. Go well, Wardy.\nEd Quoththeraven",
      "",
      "Giving the promoted clubs a chance\nSimple solution, currently Premier League teams can only loan two Premier League players, what if say newly promoted sides were allowed up to 6 (then 4 in their second season and back to the default 2 in their third)? On the face of it wouldn’t it be a win-win? Newly promoted clubs get access to more Premier League level talent without the cost of transfer fees or locking in long-term expensive contracts, bigger clubs have more scope to give league minutes to players who need them (so currently all the promoted teams can only lend 6 between them, under this system you’d open up 24 more slots).",
      "You’d be less likely to end up with scenarios where players who desperately need the minutes, like Evan Ferguson end up going on loan to clubs who are taking them on as a spare rather than as a core part of their starting line up. I also would have an option for special appeal, wherein a club could make a case for exception circumstance on going over the set limit, this would leave the door open to late window options that turn up (like say a scenario where a player gets dramatically left out of the squad after a huge falling out and has nowhere to go).",
      "I’m aware that the sight of a team taking the field with majority players they don’t ‘own’ might be weird at first (and of course they don’t have to fill all their slots either), but surely it’d be preferable to the predictable churn of promoted sides in giving them a better fighting chance, and with more league teams in Europe than ever before and so needing deeper squads i can see how something like this could serve as a halfway house for players on the verge of the first team of higher tier sides to bridge the gap.",
      "Thanks.\nSeanán",
      "Ps. Have a lovely Summer and please be a bit nicer to Arteta."

      "Man Utd will be rivalled by fellow Premier League outfit Chelsea in the race to sign Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils are have been having an awful time in the Premier League this season with Ruben Amorim’s side currently 16th heading into their final match of the campaign.",
      "Man Utd, who lost 1-0 against Chelsea on Friday night, have only won ten matches in the Premier League this season with only four sides scoring fewer goals than them.",
      "There has been growing pressure on Amorim to get results but the latest reports indicate they will stick with him, even if they lose the Europa League final against Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "Man Utd need to improve all over the pitch ahead of next season but one player who has come in for lots of criticism this season is goalkeeper Andre Onana.",
      "There have been rumours in previous weeks that Amorim now ‘wants him out’ of Old Trafford and is looking for a new goalkeeper before next season.",
      "READ: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",
      "And now Argentina international Martinez – who has been brilliant for Aston Villa over the past five years – has been linked with a summer move to Old Trafford.",
      "Both Martinez and Leon Bailey were in tears at the end of Aston Villa’s 2-0 win over Tottenham on Friday night, leading to speculation that both players could be leaving in the summer.",
      "Responding to those rumours, Aston Villa boss Unai Emery did little to persuade journalists otherwise, he said: “Of course, it is the last match (of the season) here, and I don’t know.",
      "“We will see about the team, the players, but of course, they are responding on the field, at the moment they are responding and they are so, so focused in how we are preparing and playing each match.",
      "“Of course, Leon Bailey is playing now less because other players are responding very well. They are performing well.",
      "“And we are going to play Manchester (United) for the last three points. And for us it will be very important again, to prepare, to be focused everybody.",
      "“And of course, then we will see about everything, how we are going to try to get better for the next season.”",
      "And now Diario AS journalist Eduardo Burgos has claimed that Chelsea, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid are also interested in signing Martinez this summer.",
      "Burgos wrote on X: ‘Dibu’ Martínez has a chance of leaving Aston Villa this summer. It will depend on the Champions League, but the player wants to fight for titles. Several clubs have approached him: Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona and Atlético de Madrid. Note: There are no official offers yet.’",
      "Another player Man Utd have been linked with is Napoli striker Victor Osimhen – who has been on loan at Galatasaray this season – but now Football Transfers (who cite GiveMeSport) claim that the Red Devils have ‘pulled out’ with the Nigeria international ‘asking for €475,000 per week from his new club’.",
      "And now Galatasaray vice president Abdullah Kavukcu has confirmed that the Turkish side are willing to make a record offer to bring Osimhen to Istanbul permanently.",
      "They are reportedly willing to pay his €75m fee and match “the salaries he will receive from Europe”.",
      "“We talked to my president about Osimhen in January,” Kavukcu said.",
      "“We told Osimhen in January, ‘We want you very much, don’t go anywhere. We are working to get your transfer.’",
      "“We are developing projects for this. We developed them to sit at that table and we are at that table right now. We are ready to get his transfer and pay the salaries he will receive from Europe.”",

Man United are set to approach also Wolves to proceed with £62.5m release clause payment in installments. The deal is almost done on player side as revealed yesterday, with final details being clarified. Cunha said YES.’",

      "Chelsea have also been linked with Cherki and ex-Blues winger Florent Malouda gave his view on how the Frenchman could adapt to the Premier League.",
      "Malouda said earlier this month: “Simple answer: yes, he’s ready, but I want him to stay in Lyon and give us more years and to keep developing himself in Lyon. I think right now with this kind of talent, you could have PSG going for him in France.",
      "“He could have teams like Barcelona and in the Premier League he is a player I could see in a club like, like, Arsenal, like Man City. So in terms of talent, in terms of potential, he belongs to the Premier League. But I would delay. I want him to stay in Lyon.”",

      "Man Utd have received a major boost ahead of the Europa League final after Joshua Zirkzee was among three returning stars pictured in training on Tuesday.",
      "The striker was initially ruled out for the remainder of the season with a hamstring injury suffered during last month’s 4-1 defeat to Newcastle. Ruben Amorim had confirmed at the time that Zirkzee would not feature again this term, telling reporters: “He will not play again this season. Let’s prepare him for the next one.”",
      "However, Zirkzee was involved in full team training at Carrington on Tuesday morning, on the day the squad flies to Spain for Wednesday’s final against Tottenham in Bilbao.",
      "It marks a surprise turnaround for the Dutch forward, who had looked visibly upset when he left the pitch at St James’ Park and was widely expected to focus on recovering ahead of pre-season.",
      "His return provides a timely lift for Man Utd, who have been forced to protect Rasmus Hojlund, the only striker available for the final, in recent weeks.",
      "Zirkzee’s availability offers a new option in the final third and could influence the manager’s tactical approach against a Spurs side Utd have failed to beat in three meetings this season.",
      "Zirkzee has scored six goals and provided four assists in all competitions since arriving last summer, and his blend of physicality and link-up play has been missed in recent weeks.",
      "Amorim’s side has managed just five goals in their last eight domestic matches, with Bruno Fernandes still tasked with carrying the bulk of the attacking threat.",
      "There was further good news for Utd in their final training session before the flight to Bilbao. Both Diogo Dalot and Leny Yoro took part after recent fitness concerns, while Jonny Evans was also involved in the main portion of training.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt was absent, casting doubt over his chances of making the matchday squad. With Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw starting in the recent 1-0 defeat to Chelsea, Yoro’s return may see him replace Shaw if deemed fit enough to start.",
      "Dalot’s return also gives Amorim the option to push Noussair Mazraoui into the back three, with the Portuguese defender and Patrick Dorgu providing the width in more advanced wing-back roles.",
      "Despite sitting 16th in the Premier League and enduring a dismal domestic season, United are one win away from lifting silverware and qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Victory in Bilbao would also complete an unbeaten Europa League campaign, a feat achieved by only three other clubs in the competition’s modern era.",
      "Zirkzee’s return will now be assessed by the coaching staff, with a decision to be made on whether he features from the start or is held in reserve. Either way, his presence provides a significant boost on the eve of Utd’s biggest match of the season.",

      "Matheus Cunha “loves Man Utd”. That’s the quote fed to the media, presumably by his agent. So we fully expect Matheus Cunha to join Manchester United this summer, which would be something of a coup. And would inevitably befuddle the minds of the easily confused.",
      "Others will say he has ‘only joined Manchester United for the money’ and post images of falling wads of cash on social media, ignoring any and all evidence that United are offering no greater wage than any other Big Six club.",
      "But check Cunha’s age – he’s 25 – and clock that he turned 10 the summer after United had won their third consecutive Premier League title, reached the Champions League final and had a fella called Cristiano Ronaldo on their team. Of course he “loves Man Utd”.",
      "When Manchester United wheeled out Sir Alex Ferguson and Bryan Robson (who had last played for United a decade before he was born) in 2020, the “this is Manchester United Football Club we are talking about” charm offensive fell flat on Jude Bellingham, who turned 10 just as David Moyes was replacing Ferguson and the Banter Era was kicking off.",
      "But Cunha? He will absolutely believe United are one of the biggest clubs in the world – not measured by market share or ‘reach’, but because he has grown up watching one of the actual best football teams in the world. As a child in north-eastern Brazil, he would have dreamed of one day playing at Old Trafford and wearing red; as a 25-year-old in the Midlands, he will still hold the glowing remnants of that dream. It’s human nature.",
      "Manchester United do still have that lure. But perhaps only to players like Cunha, who are old enough to have grown up thinking that they are the pinnacle of success. How long does that sheen last? The red wasn’t shiny enough for Bellingham, who wisely chose Borussia Dortmund as the likeliest route to Real Madrid. Surely Cunha belongs to the very last generation of players who look at Old Trafford and see the Theatre of Dreams and not a crumbling circus.",
      "Modern Premier League clubs/businesses tend to focus almost exclusively on young talent with both potential and sell-on value but United’s short-term quest to re-join the elite based on something other than heritage might well lie with those players who still see them as something extraordinary.",
      "For now, Cunha is as close to a no-brainer – he fits the system, he has creativity and personality in abundance – as a signing for Manchester United this summer, but United are far from a no-brainer for a footballer who can have his pick of top-half clubs.",

      "Jamie Carragher has warned Liam Delap to think twice before choosing Man Utd as his next club, despite growing reports that a move to Old Trafford is edging closer.",
      "The 22-year-old has emerged as one of the most promising young strikers in the Premier League, and with Ipswich relegated, his £30 million release clause has put several top clubs on alert. Utd have already held face-to-face talks with the striker, while Chelsea remain interested. But Carragher believes a switch to Utd would be premature.",

      "The big stuff has already been settled this season. We’ve known for months now – long before mathematical confirmation belatedly rolled in as it so often does – who was winning the league and who was being sent packing back to the Championship.",
      "But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing left to sort out in these closing days of the 2025/26 season. Here are literally 10 things of varying levels of importance that are still to be decided.",
      "",
      "Some of next year’s Champions League qualifiers\nSure, Liverpool have got the league wrapped up. And yes, Arsenal are going to be in the Champions League having successfully now (barring mathematical absurdities) avoided the ‘third in a two-horse race’ whimsy.",
      "But the rest? Up in the air.",
      "We do know the top five will all qualify for the Champions League this year, but which three of Newcastle, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Man City and Nottingham Forest make it alongside Liverpool and Arsenal remains very much TBC.",
      "And if Man City don’t beat Bournemouth tonight then we have the very delicious prospect of the five teams scrapping over third to seventh going into the final day separated by a single point.",
      "It’s a better climax to the season than we thought we were getting a few weeks ago, anyway.",
      "",
      "Some of next year’s Europa League qualifiers\nAnd if we don’t know who all the Champions League qualifiers are, then we obviously can’t know the Europa League qualifiers either, can we? One of those who misses out on the Big Cup are joining FA Cup winners Crystal Palace in the Europa League, which is so easy to win even Spurs or Man United can do it.",
      "Crystal Palace London-bussing their way to a second trophy so soon after their first is a fun prospect, and there’s a very plausible chance that they too could do so in a London-Manchester final to match this year’s, against the team they’ve just beaten at Wembley. Wouldn’t that be fun?",
      "",
      "Next year’s Conference League qualifier\nOr even if there’s going to be one at all. It’s possible England won’t even have a team in next year’s Conference. We don’t pretend to understand the science of it but if Chelsea finish sixth and Newcastle don’t finish seventh and then Chelsea win the Conference League then we end up with six English teams in the Champions League and three in the Europa League! And none at all in the Conference! Because reasons!",
      "",
      "Golden Glove: Raya v Sels\nAlexander Isak’s untimely injury has denied us the chance to pretend the Golden Boot is still up for grabs this season, with a malfunctioning Erling Haaland needing seven goals in two games to pull level with long-time clear leader Mo Salah atop the charts. It’s not happening, is it?",
      "But Isak’s absence against Arsenal may well have helped gives us a neck-and-neck Golden Glove fight, because David Raya’s hard-won clean sheet against Newcastle – one that required him to make five saves in the first 20 minutes as Newcastle started much the brighter – allowed him to pull level on 13 clean sheets with Matz Sels.",
      "Sels looked like moving to 14 for most of Sunday afternoon’s game at the London Stadium, but while Jarrod Bowen’s late goal proved to be nothing more than consolation nerve-jangler for the result, it has left this fight going down to the wire neck and neck.",
      "And if you were a betting man you’d have to now favour Raya, with Arsenal up against Southampton on the final day and Sels facing the altogether trickier task of keeping out Chelsea.",
      "",
      "The match that will determine once and for all which club is the greatest on earth: Tottenham or Manchester United\nWe know England will have six teams in next season’s Champions League. We know who two of them are. We know the other three will be some flavour of competent. And then there’s the piss-boiling sixth, which is going to be one of the two stupidest teams in the league at this time because one of them is going to win the Europa League.",
      "A lot of people are unhappy about this. Arsene Wenger is so cross about it all that he’s briefly stopped trying to destroy football entirely with his batsh*t non-solution to toenail offsides. People who have absolutely no problem with the team that finishes fifth in the Premier League being in the Champions League are foaming at the mouth at the very idea of Spurs being there, people presumably in for the shock of their lives when they find out how Spurs qualified for the Europa League in the first place.",
      "We have a strong inkling about how Wednesday night will pan out based on years of evidence that tells us two things: one, Manchester United can always pinch a trophy no matter how abject they appear to be, but more importantly two, the joke is and always must be on Spurs.",
      "‘Only Spurs’ is an overused expression in these pages but there really is no other club quite like them and it really does feel like Only Spurs could carve out a situation where this season is either a) their best season in 41 years or b) their worst season in 48 years, with there being absolutely no middle ground and the whole thing settled by one game in Bilbao.",
      "And again, recent history tells you one of those options instinctively feels far more likely. But at the same time United are simply so bad that even the apparent formality of beating Spurs in a final cannot be taken for granted.",
      "What we do know for absolute certain is that by 11pm on Wednesday night X-formerly-Twitter will be awash with cry-laughing emojis and people saying ‘Can’t believe these are in the Champions League’. The loser is going to get absolutely cooked and the winner is going to boil more p*ss than has ever been boiled before.",
      "Honestly, we can’t wait.",
      "",
      "Can Antony win two European titles in one season?\nThe Europa League final is the most obvious example of how no matter what happens everyone wins yet also somehow everyone loses, but let’s not forget the humble Europa Conference League final because that is not without its charms.",
      "If Chelsea have been kind enough to finish seventh in the Premier League, then them winning it as everyone has just assumed all season long is what will happen means that England will have 10 teams in Europe next season and that’s just plain nutty.",
      "But if Real Betis win it on the back of a Man United win in the Europa League then Antony will have won more European trophies in one season than Arsenal have in their entire existence, and you have to say that’s magnificent.",
      "",
      "The race for eighth\nThis is the kind of thing we should all be able to get behind: a final-day barney for one place that probably won’t matter. And even if Chelsea do the necessary on the final day to make eighth potentially matter, it won’t be until three days later and the Conference final that we actually know for sure.",
      "This is Barclays heritage. Brighton are in pole position now after beating unapologetically beach-based flip-flop-sporting cigar-puffing Liverpool on Monday night, knowing that a final-day victory at Tottenham – who are either going to be too happy or too sad to care, surely – will be enough even if Bournemouth win both their remaining games.",
      "Brentford are still in the mix as well, but that Brighton win over Liverpool has taken Fulham out of the equation.",
      "",
      "The race for 17th\nWest Ham, bless them, have managed to stay involved in this dignity-shedding contest despite not having the excuse of a Europa League final to possibly get them out of jail, but they face Ipswich on the final day and thus this surely will come down to a fight between the stoppable force of Manchester United and the movable object of Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Sure, it’s perhaps not the most significant contest between the two that remains to be played out this season but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t all just stop and take a moment to marvel at what we’re actually saying here. Spurs. Man United. Seventeenth place.",
      "One way or another we can’t imagine either of them getting anything out of Sunday’s final game after what will for both teams whatever happens be the season-defining emotional extreme of Wednesday night.",
      "And in any case both find themselves up against demonstrably superior teams who actually have something to play for in the league, a quaint concept Spurs and United abandoned months ago. United play Villa, still in the Champions League hunt, while Spurs host a Brighton side in pole position for the uncomfortably Chelsea-dependent but nevertheless potentially significant eighth place.",
      "If we’re being very greedy indeed, we do want whoever wins the Europa League to finish 17th because it is slightly funnier than a Champions League qualifier finishing 16th even though that is already very funny indeed.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace’s maiden half-century\nSome might argue that Crystal Palace have already achieved the biggest thing they’ll do this season having won the FA Cup and thus the first major title of their entire history. To that we say tish and fipsy because that will pale into rank insignificance if they can secure a 50th point for the first time ever in any Premier League season.",
      "They are currently on 49 points with two games to go, the second of which is now set to be a rare old occasion at Anfield in which everyone is just having a big old party as Liverpool collect their Premier League trophy and Palace revel in their new-found status as trophy winners.",
      "It’s one of the games we’re most looking forward to on the final day purely because such a vibe is so rare in your toxic, tribal, online modern football warfare. A game where everyone in the stadium will just be having a lovely old time celebrating a successful season. ‘Snice.",
      "We’re thinking double guards of honour. We’re thinking both teams cavorting about with their trophies. We’re thinking everyone celebrating a late Eberechi Eze equaliser that takes Palace to the promised land of 50 points. We want to go to there.",
      "",
      "The sacrificial play-off winner\nWe did genuinely almost forget this one, which is slightly embarrassing but also revealing of how the land now lies for teams promoted from the Championship.",
      "But in terms of formalising things we don’t yet know about this season, we do need to stop and consider that we don’t yet in fact know the full line-up for next season’s Premier League until it is confirmed which poor sods are setting themselves up for a season of Derby-bothering ritual humiliation.",
      "It’s going to be Sheffield United or Sunderland, so it’s going to be a big club that in days gone by you would absolutely think had every chance of giving survival a red-hot crack. Now you assume they’re doomed unless they decide to just break all the rules and accept a points penalty in their second season is probably worth the risk if they’ve already managed to stay up at the expense of, oh, let’s say, West Ham.",
      "More likely, though: the winner of Football’s Richest Game instead condemns themselves to a season of being patronised very nearly as much as we’ve just done here while desperately scrambling to cobble 20 points together before dropping back down to the second tier to try and do it all again."

      "A bullish Ange Postecoglou said he will \"never be a clown\" and insisted his work at Spurs is not done - even if they beat Manchester United in Wednesday's Europa League final.",
      "In an explosive press conference ahead of the game in Bilbao, the 59-year-old hit out at a newspaper headline which described him as \"teetering between hero and clown\" amid speculation over his future as the club's head coach.",
      "Spurs' poor Premier League campaign, which has seen them slump to 17th place on 38 points, having lost a club-record 21 games, has led to suggestions that he could leave even if he guides them to their first trophy in 17 years in the Europa League.",
      "But Postecoglou insisted his future is not a distraction and urged his team to seize their chance to make history by winning a trophy which would also earn Spurs a Champions League spot.",
      "\"I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and I never will be, mate,\" he told a reporter in reference to the article relating to his Spurs legacy.",
      "\"I'm really disappointed you'd use such terminology about a person who, for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he's leading out a club in a European major competition.",
      "\"For you to suggest that, somehow, us not being successful means that I'm a clown... I'm not really sure how to answer that question.\"",
      "Postecoglou has faced repeated questions relating to his future in recent months but insisted his sole focus is on ensuring his players are ready to take their opportunity to win silverware.",
      "\"Does it matter, really?\" he said when asked about his future. \"It doesn't matter because the reality of it is the opportunity is the same for me and, more importantly, for the club.",
      "Postecoglou said the injured Lucas Bergvall is not available to play against Manchester United despite having travelled with the squad to Bilbao. Pape Sarr is fit, however, despite having been taken off with back pain during Friday's 2-0 loss to Aston Villa.\n\n\nJames Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also missing due to injury but like Bergvall, have travelled with the squad to Bilbao to support their team-mates.",
      "\"I've said before, whatever happens beyond tomorrow is kind of irrelevant when you think about the opportunity that exists right now and that is to provide something special for this football club, for the supporters, for everyone who's worked so hard, not just this year, but for the last 15, 16 years since we last won a trophy and 41 years since a European trophy.",
      "\"If I were worried about my tenure at this football club, it's fair to say we wouldn't be in this position as I would've been distracted long ago. I'm pretty good at making sure all my focus is on giving this football club the best opportunity to do something special.",
      "\"Whatever happens after that, I'm very comfortable that I'll continue on trying to win trophies wherever I am.\"",
      "The Spurs boss insisted he has not spoken to his players about his future ahead of the final, adding: \"Again, that would not really be helpful in what is before us right now.",
      "\"I've said to the lads from day one, nothing is guaranteed in life, nothing is guaranteed in sport, so you've got to make sure you take every opportunity before you.",
      "\"That's what I've done my whole career. I've been in this position before where the big game was the last game I managed, so it's not unusual territory for me and I've always navigated that pretty well.",
      "\"For me, nothing is more important than my responsibility at this football club and to its fans tomorrow. Me and the players' minds are on one thing and that's trying to create something special.\"",
      "Pressed again on his future, Postecoglou insisted: \"I wouldn't be the first person who changes jobs. We all change jobs.",
      "\"My future's assured. I've got a beautiful family, I've got a great life, I'll keep on winning trophies until I finish, wherever that is, so don't worry about my future.",
      "\"My future is not entwined with anything. Provided, God willing, my health remains and my beautiful family and friends are beside me... there's nothing wrong with my future.",
      "\"Don't stress. Sleep easy at night. I'll be OK.",
      "\"I don't think my job is done here. I really feel like we're building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.",
      "\"I still think there's a lot of work to be done, that's quite obvious with the challenges we've had this year, which are well chronicled. There's some reasoning in the context of that, but also there's been some growth that I'd like to see through.",
      "\"Whether that happens or not is not that important right now. I don't think this job's finished and I certainly feel like there's some growth there that we can take this club to where it needs to be.\"",
      "Spurs captain Heung-Min Son insisted he is ready to make history by winning his first trophy at the club after admitting he was affected by nerves in the 2019 Champions League final loss to Liverpool.",
      "\"It would be very special,\" he said. \"It would be a historic moment, I stayed here 10 years. I just want to win the trophy, which nobody has done in 10 years.",
      "\"Tomorrow is going to be a massive day for the club and for the boys, and for me as well. It has been such a tough season but we have always been together and that's why we are here.\"",
      "Son, who also revealed he had chatted to Bundesliga winner Harry Kane ahead of Wednesday's game, continued: \"Six years ago I played my first final. It was a very nervous moment.",
      "\"It was exciting but I was very nervous. I couldn't believe I was in the Champions League final.",
      "\"Six years later I'm a grown man, I'm experienced and just want to prepare in my way, calm.",
      "\"So many players have changed, also my role has changed. I'm captain of this club and leader of the boys and I want to help lift the trophy together.",
      "\"That is my dream. Tomorrow, I hope we can make a historic day that I can never forget.\"",
      "Son only recently returned from injury but insisted he feels physically prepared for the challenge ahead as Spurs aim to change their history of falling short.",
      "\"If we win the trophy, we can change the mentality and the history of the club. Then hopefully we can compete for other trophies.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim reiterated his stance that winning the Europa League would not solve the club's issues but admitted it would help him build their future.",
      "Amorim's side sit only a point ahead of Postecoglou's in 16th place in the Premier League after a similarly difficult campaign but while the Spurs boss has preached optimism, Amorim has favoured brutal realism.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident, but we already know the problems,\" he said.",
      "Manchester United have been given a boost with Diogo Dalot, Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro all available to feature having recovered from injury.\n\n\n\"They recovered quite well,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we respect the feelings of the players, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to part of the team and that is a very good sign.\n\n\n\"They are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club; the way we do everything in the week at Carrington, the recruitment, the academy. I think we need to improve.",
      "\"It's hard to point at one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow will be important for us, for our fans. That feeling of winning can help us have strength to do every job we have to do.",
      "\"But nothing is going to change our season. We have a lot to do at our club, not just winning tomorrow. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build the future.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire insisted Manchester United have shown their quality in the Europa League, despite their domestic struggles.",
      "\"When you play for this club, you want to win every football match and this season we've been far too inconsistent, we haven't won enough in the Premier League. It's not been good enough, we know that.",
      "\"The Europa League has been different. We've performed at a high level and we have proven again this season we can beat anybody.",
      "\"I'm sure, next season, we will improve an awful amount, with a full pre-season and, as players, we're all looking forward to that, but we've got a big game tomorrow night, first and foremost.",
      "\"It's a special night, a special occasion. We've prepared well and it's one we're looking forward to.\"",
      "Maguire has earned plaudits for some of his attacking contributions during United's run to the final, including scoring the winner in their comeback win over Lyon in the quarters, but hopes he won't be needed up front on Wednesday night.",
      "\"The manager has me dribbling every day in training, running up and down the wing,\" he joked.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao, managed to put a good cross in and Casemiro scored the goal.",
      "\"I've gone up front in the later minutes of games; hopefully tomorrow night I'm not going up front.",
      "\"I don't want to go up front chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "\"I'm always there to help, always there to do my best, but I'm more than happy playing in my favoured position.\""

      "\"Every game has its history…\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said these words when asked about the prospect of playing Tottenham in the Europa League final - a team that has beaten the Red Devils three times already this season.",
      "But the question is, will their recent history matter when it comes to who wins the trophy - and that crucial Champions League place?",
      "Perhaps the performance Spurs will take the most encouragement from is their first of the season against United, an utterly dominant 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September to put even more pressure on United's former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The game is evidence of why Ange Postecoglou is wrapping Micky van de Ven in cotton wool ahead of the final.",
      "Van de Ven was not just defensively impressive in this game, as he typically is, he also carried the ball over half the length of the Old Trafford pitch to set up Brennan Johnson for their opening goal in the third minute.",
      "The game then was seemingly over at the end of the first half when Bruno Fernandes was sent off - a red card that was later overturned through appeal.",
      "But this is a different United side. Although you cannot suggest their position in the Premier League of 16th is evidence they have moved forward under Ruben Amorim, they do look better defensively, they concede fewer chances, and have shown in these big European nights that they can be a threat going forward, more so anyway, then under Ten Hag.",
      "The second time these two sides met was in the Carabao Cup quarter finals in December - a fun encounter that Postecoglou's Spurs won once again, this time 4-3, with Amorim having taken over from Ten Hag.",
      "But when you look at lessons both sides could take to the final, it is challenging when you consider the context around it.",
      "First of all you look at the make-up of both sides. Spurs had Archie Gray and Radu Dragusin making up their centre-back partnership, with Fraser Forster in goal. Spurs' main three at the back of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario and defenders Van de Ven and Cristian Romero were all injured.",
      "For United, again, a side that will be much changed for the final with Altay Bayindir starting in goal, Lisandro Martinez, who is out for the remainder of the season, as well as Antony, who is now starring for Real Betis in Spain, also featured.",
      "On this occasion, although Spurs were injury-hit and did well to progress, Amorim also took a calculated risk to heavily rotate many of his first-team players. It did not work out as they lost their next three games in the Premier League as well.",
      "February was the last time these two sides met and Spurs won 1-0 but I don't think Amorim will look back at this game too closely.",
      "That's partly because the goal United conceded was a poor one. Andre Onana should have done much better to palm away a Lucas Bergvall shot, which ended up leaving James Maddison with a comfortable finish right in front of goal.",
      "Amorim had very limited opportunities to change the game when you look at the squad he had to pick from at that moment. It was an injury-ravaged United side. Victor Lindelof was the only substitute who had any sort of Premier League experience.",
      "Spurs had injuries too, with Kevin Danso and Ben Davies their centre-back pairing, two players who again are not likely to start in the final, while Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski also started but will play no part on Wednesday due to injury.",
      "Not much, really!",
      "Spurs will take confidence despite the circumstances. When they have taken on Untied this season, they have been able to pull out performances and perhaps more importantly, results.",
      "Dominic Solanke has three goals in three meetings against United too, which may give him that extra edge against their opponents in the final.",
      "Asked about facing a side who have beaten United three times, Amorim said: \"If you look at the odds, we are closer to winning than losing. Both teams will play like all or nothing.\"",
      "Those last three words perfectly describe Manchester United in Europe this season: all or nothing.",
      "United looked like they'd be out of the competition when they were 4-2 down at Old Trafford against Lyon in the quarter-finals but they miraculously came back.",
      "In the semi-finals, as I travelled to Bilbao for their tie against Athletic Club, most pundits and fans alike would have thought a draw away to a team who had lost just once in LaLiga since August at home would have been sufficient",
      "Man Utd won 3-0 in San Mames and 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "We also have to consider the tactical tweaks Amorim has made since the two sides last met in February.",
      "In the most important games, he has now settled on a midfield duo of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Brazilian especially has become revitalised under Amorim in recent months.",
      "Amorim told me this has been mainly down to Casemiro working on his own fitness as well as the United boss tweaking the way they press, more so with their wing-backs going high, enabling Casemiro to stay in front of the defence and not be caught out on transition.",
      "Amorim and the players have spoken about how the physicality levels of European opponents are more suited to the players, which does pose the question of how they will deal with a physical Spurs side who will look to impose themselves as they have done in this season's previous meetings.",
      "But United have been illogical and unpredictable when it comes to the Europa League this season. When you consider all of the circumstances of their previous meetings with Spurs, it is clear that they won't have much relevance.",
      "Wednesday's game is a different proposition for both sides."

      "Matheus Cunha is set to join Manchester United after the season ends this weekend.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Wednesday 21 May 2025 09:09, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows previews the Europa League final and outlines where the value lies as Spurs and Manchester United look to save their seasons.",
      "This is a beautifully grotesque final. Both teams are balancing on the highwire with no safety net below them.",
      "We can get carried away with overdramatising the outcomes of football matches but this one truly is huge, especially for Tottenham, who have one game to decide whether it's been their best or worst season for many years. It's a ridiculous situation, really.",
      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11. The 90-minute odds have United at 7/4 and Spurs at 29/20.",
      "It's a 50-50 spin of the Roulette wheel. White or red. Heads or tails.",
      "I'm very confused about this game from a betting perspective.",
      "These two teams have been completely different in the Europa League compared to their Premier League form. And usually you'd put more weight in the domestic form to gauge a true ability of a team, especially in this spot as this is an all-Premier League final. But I'm very torn.",
      "United can't score in the Premier League, averaging just 1.14 goals per 90 minutes and have scored just five goals in their last eight games. But look at their Europa League form.",
      "They have averaged 2.5 goals per game this season, scoring a whopping 19 goals in their six games with Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Club in the knockouts.",
      "And then we have Spurs, who are equally as confusing to analyse. As they are a completely different team to their overall form of this Premier League season when their first-choice back five plays under Ange Postecoglou. The difference is simply huge.",
      "When Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie all play under Postecoglou, they have won 18 of those 30 games, losing just six times.",
      "If you were converting that to points per game - that's two per game. If you translate that over the course of a Premier League season of 38 games, you get 76 points, which would be enough to finish a clear second in the Premier League this season. There is a really good side lurking there.",
      "It's a game where backing teams both not to win is actually quite attractive, so the draw in 90 minutes at 23/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play the outright market.",
      "Three of the last four Europa League finals have ended in a stalemate. It's a result which is always a runner in finals of this nature where two big clubs meet with lots on the line.",
      "Much better opportunities are found in the props market for Wednesday's clash in Bilbao, notably in the fouls markets.",
      "The Europa League final has a rich tradition of being a foul-heavy occasion - it makes sense with such riches on the line.",
      "The last 15 Europa League finals have averaged 31.2 fouls per 90 minutes.",
      "That's a huge number.",
      "For context, Premier League matches have averaged 22.5 fouls per 90 this season, so the added jeopardy of a final using those numbers, there could be almost 10 more fouls in this type of game that a run-of-the-mill Premier League game. And when you throw in so much being on the line for these clubs and how evenly matched they are in the betting, I think this game could be very foul-heavy and potentially go way above the number the market is expecting.",
      "Sky Bet has the line set at 24+ match fouls at 5/6 which looks a great starting point for those looking to exploit these total fouls angles. I'd advise laddering the prices on offer with Sky Bet right up to the 10/1 on offer for 32+ match fouls, which has a chance of landing based on the historic averages.",
      "And it's worth noting that Spurs are a foul-heavy team under Postecoglou - he likes to play expansive and man-for-man which creates lots of one-on-one situations in space that therefore lend itself to fouls being made. Since he was appointed, no team in the Premier League has seen more fouls in their matches than Tottenham - that average is 24.5 fouls per 90 over a 75-game sample size in the Premier League.",
      "On the biggest stage, with so much on the line, I'd expect this Spurs game to hit those foul averages so those odds look very generous to me."

      "Crueller observers might speculate that 'tough to watch' is a fitting preview of the forthcoming final between two of Berbatov's former clubs, Manchester United and Tottenham. Both have endured particularly miserable Premier League seasons.",
      "Incredibly, since the two teams met in London in mid-February, neither has managed to beat an opponent that will be competing in next season's Premier League - their only victories coming against the relegated trio. In Bilbao, it will be 16th against 17th.",
      "\"Some will say maybe it is not fair when one of them wins and goes to the Champions because they did not earn it or qualify in the proper way. But it is what it is and it is going to be an interesting game now because their backs are against the wall,\" says Berbatov.",
      "\"Finals are about concentration, about not making silly mistakes, because you could be punished and there is no rematch. Maybe we will be surprised and it will be an open game but I expect caution, nobody wanting to take risks. Their seasons are on the line.",
      "\"The only thing that can justify either season now is lifting that trophy. Who needs it more? That is the question. United have been going backwards while others gone forwards. Spurs have not won a trophy in 17 years. So in a way, both managers need it.",
      "\"Ange Postecoglou, he can say, 'I told you, I always win something in my second season. Now shut up.' Or Ruben Amorim can say, 'Trust me, this is the system that we are going to play and now we can build for United's next season with that trophy'.\"",
      "It was Berbatov himself who scored the goal when Tottenham won the 2008 League Cup final - their last piece of silverware. They came from behind that day at Wembley to beat a strong Chelsea side. \"We were the underdogs, we had nothing to lose,\" he remembers.",
      "\"That was the Chelsea of Didier Drogba, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Petr Cech, some great players. But we knew that we would have our chances to score because we scored a lot of goals, that team, especially up front with me and Keano (Robbie Keane).",
      "\"Everybody expected Chelsea to win. Drogba scored a great free-kick but we kept going.\" Berbatov equalised from the penalty spot and Jonathan Woodgate won the cup in extra-time. \"Sometimes that is all you need, a penalty or a corner kick or whatever.\"",
      "Berbatov has had his own frustrations in finals, of course. In the 2002 Champions League final, his Bayer Leverkusen team were edged out by Real Madrid's superstars in an even game at Hampden Park. A moment of magic from Zinedine Zidane decided it.",
      "\"It was probably the greatest ever goal in a Champions League final. There was nothing you could do. The ball just landed at the feet of the one player you do not want the ball to land to. In football, sometimes even your best is not good enough. It is a cruel game.\"",
      "It was cruel in 2011 too. Despite being the joint-top scorer in the Premier League that season, sharing the Golden Boot with Carlos Tevez, Berbatov was surprisingly omitted not just from the United team for the Champions League final but the entire squad.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has since apologised for the move - he started Javier Hernandez, with Michael Owen preferred on the bench. Does Berbatov understand the call yet? \"Not personally but Sir Alex obviously admitted that he probably made a mistake,\" he says.",
      "\"My confidence was sky high. You are king of the world or that is how I felt. In every game, you think you are going to score. But even if I did play, I do not know if it would have made any difference because at that time Barcelona had prime Lionel Messi!\"",
      "Berbatov left United for Fulham at the end of the following season, with Ferguson calling time on his long reign at Old Trafford just one year after that. The Scottish legend bowed out with yet another Premier League title but United have been in decline ever since.",
      "\"United remain massive around the world, but it is a long time since that last Premier League and that way of thinking, that mentality of going to win every game, it has faded away,\" says Berbatov, speaking in his role as a LiveScore European brand ambassador.",
      "\"United have been struggling for years and that is painful, of course. Everybody knows that - the fans, the management, the coaches and the players as well. That is why this game is so important, so they can say, 'Look, we are struggling but we still won a trophy'.",
      "\"In the past few years, it has always been about how next season is going to be ours - and the next season. Again, we are in that position where next season, let us hope that the new manager can do it. As cliched as it sounds, you always have to keep the faith.",
      "\"Keep that faith and hope Ruben, with a pre-season behind him, will not start over, but maybe bring in the players he wants because he is not going to change, he loves that system. So you need players specifically to fit that system and hope the results come.\"",
      "Is there a suspicion that United just seem to find a way? Berbatov talks of them having \"a DNA that they need to win trophies\" while Spurs' wait goes on. But he is conflicted. \"I do not think it is that Spurs do not have belief. It is a tough question to answer,\" he says.",
      "\"On the one hand, there is the DNA of the club, the history, everything you have won before, and you know that the expectation from everybody is that you will win in the end. On the other hand, maybe if you are not expected to win then there is nothing to lose.",
      "\"Sometimes football can be a cruel game and there is just no explanation for it. You just go out there with your best intentions, you are fully concentrated, you are all ready to go, all your first-team players are ready and they play and then it just does not happen.\"",
      "Either way, Berbatov will be watching. Just do not ask him who he wants to win. \"I will sympathise with the loser because I have been there, winning finals and losing finals. Football will remind me again that there is so much joy but so much pain as well.\"",

      "Monday 19 May 2025 22:42, UK",
      "Luis Castro’s long career began in Portugal’s fourth division and has seen him rise to become one of the most accomplished coaches in world football. Football has taken the Portuguese to four different countries, winning trophies in all four of them.",
      "He was the first man to win Portugal's second tier with a B team, finished sixth with little Chaves and took Vitoria Guimaraes into Europe. Castro then won the title in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk before embarking on a new adventure in South America.",
      "When he left Botafogo in 2023, the Brazilian club were seven points clear at the top of the table and he finished that calendar year as the coach with the most wins in world football over the past 12 months - there were 51 of them, four clear of Pep Guardiola.",
      "All of which is a rather long-winded way of saying that, for all this, Castro knows by now the first question that is coming his way. That is because his most recent appointment was in Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr. So, what exactly is it like coaching Cristiano Ronaldo?",
      "Al Nassr won the Arab Club Champions Cup under Castro, the victory coming after extra-time courtesy of two goals by you know who. In total, Ronaldo scored 55 goals in 55 games under his management. \"We shared some great moments together.\"",
      "Does Castro have any special insight into how it is that Ronaldo continues to pummel goals for club and country even after turning 40? \"What set his apart is what happens before and after training - the so called 'invisible training' that he does,\" he explains.",
      "\"His behavior is all tailored towards sports performance - his diet, his sleep, and his recovery. He is a person deeply concerned with eating well, sleeping well and preparing his body properly. In my opinion, this is clearly where Cristiano's longevity comes from.\"",
      "Did it inspire others? \"Of course,\" he replies. \"Every positive example helps us grow. Our parents, our friends.\" Did he learn from Ronaldo as well? \"Coaches learn from players. Anyone who thinks they know everything becomes stuck. It is a very limiting mindset.\"",
      "Given that Erik ten Hag saw no role for Ronaldo at Manchester United, in part because of the player's inability or unwillingness to press from the front, one wonders what exactly he makes of that decision. \"We look at each player and we adjust things,\" he explains.",
      "\"We adjust according to their identity. That is exactly what I do - with Cristiano and with everyone else. That is my duty as a leader, as a coach. Our job means we have to look at the group of players and get the most out of them as a team. I have no doubt about that.",
      "\"That is why we need to find a system that enhances the players that we have. I cannot stick rigidly to a tactical system and refuse to change. I cannot just go to the end with my idea, no matter what, because that would lead to failure and disaster.\"",
      "It is interesting to hear a coach of such experience talk about the need to adapt his ideas. At the age of 63, Castro is still making those adjustments - because the game demands it. \"Football has evolved and not only the tactical systems,\" he acknowledges.",
      "\"Science has become intertwined with the game. The media are much more active. Player representation has changed. Coaching staffs have increased significantly in number and their areas of expertise. We all have to adapt to match this evolution.",
      "\"The intensity has increased, which has forced us to change our training methodologies and focus more on player recovery. We had to evolve in the tools we use and become much more comprehensive and knowledgeable about everything that surrounds us.",
      "\"A coach must be much more strategic now. In the past, coaches could be known for their tactical system. Today, I have to give my team the versatility to understand multiple systems, to make faster decisions because there is less and less room for hesitation.",
      "\"Today, it is about reading the game, solving situations. We create exercises to address these tactical changes and respond to the tactical shifts during a game, to overcome those challenges posed by the opponent and to put the opposition in difficulty too.\"",
      "In Castro's view, this represents a major change in how coaches need to approach football. \"Training sessions are much richer now. There has been a radical shift in how we look at training and how we prepare players for the various phases of a game.\"",
      "Some developments he is not so fond of. He has spoken of how youngsters are more focused on the individual than the team, but he stops short of suggesting it is a problem. \"It does require constant reminders about what teamwork should be,\" he says.",
      "\"But through good communication, the players always end up understanding and following the team path. We, as coaches, also need to recognise that the individualistic players remain assets. It is the job of the coach to connect them to the team.\"",
      "The appetite remains - Castro describes doing that as \"fantastic\" - and Portuguese coaches are proving better at it than most. There are three of them working in the Premier League at present - Ruben Amorim, Nuno Espirito Santo, and Marco Silva.",
      "\"The Premier League is the biggest showcase in world football. It is the best league in the world and has the best professionals working in it so I have no doubt that if they are there, it is because they are of excellent quality, taking a successful path to get there.",
      "\"I do not really like distinguishing coaches by nationality as quality has no nationality. But I can speak about our coaching school because it has managed to combine scientific knowledge, academic background, and the other experiences of football perfectly.",
      "\"Many of us Portuguese coaches worked in academies, which helped us to understand younger players - development programs, methodologies, and all the factors that shape a player's identity. It is about how we put individual talent into the service of the team.\"",
      "A lesson that Luis Castro learned with Cristiano Ronaldo."

      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",

      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""
