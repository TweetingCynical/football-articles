      "Manchester United felt they were closing in on the signing of Bryan Mbeumo - that was before Brentford's appointment of Keith Andrews threw a spanner in the works with progress stalled.",
      "The Red Devils have seen several bids for the Cameroon forward rejected, the last being £60million, with the Bees sticking robustly to their valuation. The two parties remain millions apart in their respective figures and the change in the dugout has not helped.",
      "Andrews is another internal hire at Brentford, replacing Thomas Frank. The new Tottenham boss was thought to be keen on Mbeumo, but the north Londoners now look to have gone in a different direction.",
      "It leaves United with a free shot at the Brentford star, who himself wants the move, but they have struggled to agree on a fee. The MEN also understands that Andrews' arrival as the new head coach has further complicated matters with the Irishman wanting to keep his top players.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 times last term and has emerged as the club's prime attacking weapon, stepping up impressively after the departure of Ivan Toney.",
      "United had wanted to get Mbeumo through the door for the start of their pre-season having originally started negotiations weeks ago for the 25-year-old. That hasn't proved to be the case but if they can striker a deal he could yet join them on their tour of the United States.",
      "Brentford's director of football Phil Giles has maintained that the club will not do business unless it makes sense for them and has opened the door to the possibility of Mbeumo staying in west London for the foreseeable. Leaving it up to the Manchester outfit to table the necessary figure.",
      "He said: “We’ve made our point clear. If Bryan earned a massive move now and it was right for us financially, we’d be open to it. But if he ended up here with us next season, I wouldn’t be massively surprised. We’d be delighted. And it would save me a massive headache, frankly.”",
      "Mbeumo himself stands to massively increase his pay packet if he does secure a move to Manchester, which could still be on the cards. The Bees have targeted another forward in Ipswich's Omari Hutchinson, who could serve as the man to replace Mbeumo if he leaves."

      "Juventus are looking to sign Marcus Rashford and end his Manchester United exile. Rashford, 27, has been told to stay away from United's first-team squad during pre-season along with four other outcasts at Old Trafford.",
      "The England international, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have all been ordered to train after 5pm once rest of Red Devils' squad have already left Carrington. Ruben Amorim doesn't see a future for any of the players, who United are actively trying to sell.",
      "Barcelona have long been the favourites to sign Rashford after Aston Villa decided not to take up their £40million option to buy at the end of his loan spell. But the La Liga champions are yet to make a move, despite Rashford's brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, being spotted meeting Barca sporting director Deco in Catalunya last month.",
      "That's left the door open for Juventus, who Sky Sport Italia report are exploring the conditions of a deal. Like United, Juve want to reshape their attack this summer and have made strikers Dusan Vlahovic and Arkadiusz Milik available for transfer as well as winger Timothy Weah.",
      "Rashford isn't the only United player who the Serie A giants have been linked with either. Juventus have been in talks over a move for Sancho, who also spent last season out on loan, winning the Conference League with Chelsea.",
      "It's been reported that Sancho has agreed personal terms with Juve and is prepared to wait in order to seal a move to Turin. The 25-year-old could try and convince Rashford to join him at Juventus, although his ideal destination is Barcelona.",
      "Rashford has even spoken publicly of his desire to play for Hansi Flick's side, who are yet to formally approach United. Barca's priority is Luis Diaz, who Liverpool want to keep and showed their resolve by rejecting a £58.6m bid from Bayern Munich earlier this week.",
      "While on holiday in Marbella last month, Rashford issued a thinly-veiled come-get-me plea to Barca. The forward was asked by Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer whether he wants to play with Barcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal in the future.",
      "\"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best,\" Rashford replied. \"So hopefully, we'll see.\"",
      "He added: \"Spain is nice, it's not too far from home. If I'm training over a long period, my family can come for a few days, it's a nice location and good weather.\""

      "Ashley Young has no plans to retire despite turning 40 and is attracting interest from Watford, where he first began a career that has seen him play for 22 seasons. The ex-Manchester United star made more than 30 appearances for Everton last term, proving that he can still play regularly in the Premier League, but was let go by the Toffees and is on the lookout for a new club.",
      "A romantic option emerging could see him head back to Vicarage Road with the Hornets, who are looking to land promotion from the Championship this season. Young is yet to drop out of the top flight since helping Watford win promotion back in 2006.",
      "TalkSport reports that the club have no concerns over his age or fitness, but will leave the final decision to new boss Paulo Pezzolano as he plots his recruitment. Young previously made 100 appearances for Watford, scoring 22 times before leaving midway through their relegation year in 2007.",
      "The veteran has now plans to call it a day and recently said: “It's been one of those things where I've played so much this season. I feel so fit. I've not felt as fit as I have done for years. I just want to continue playing, however that may look, however that may seem, I'm not ready to retire.",
      "“I'm definitely going to carry on next season. Whichever way that is. I'm not getting any younger. I'm going to be 40 in July. I feel as fit as when I was in my 20s. I'm definitely going to continue. The stats are there - I've played 31 times this season and I feel I can keep going.”",
      "After leaving Watford, Young's career continued to go from strength to strength. Whilst he was at Villa, he continued to impress and played in a side that threatened to crack the top four. He spent more than four years at Villa Park before catching the attention of Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "United signed Young for £17million in 2011 and he was an instant hit, winning his one and only title in his second season with the club. He would later enjoy a renaissance at a converted wing-back and that saw him continue playing for England, where he won 39 caps.",
      "He would leave Manchester in 2019 to join Inter Milan, where he spent two years before returning to England to have a second spell with Villa. Everton were the next club on his CV and Watford could now look to utilise that experience to aid their ambitions this term."

      "The Spanish giants are considering a swoop for the United man having missed out on some of their other targets this summer. Nico Williams chose to remain at Athletic Bilbao whilst Liverpool are determined not to sell Luis Diaz, so they are running out of options, but Sheringham has not been impressed with his conduct",
      "He told Sky Bet: “If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you’re there, you appreciate it. You don’t throw it away and say you want to leave.",

      "Sancho is not part of United's plans under Amorim and is in search of pastures new despite joining the club four years ago for more than £70m with many tipping him to be a huge success.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund winger is in the final year of his contract and spent last season on loan at Chelsea, before they chose to pay a penalty fee to prevent his move to Stamford Bridge becoming permanent. Juventus are now looking to seize on the unfortunate situation by adding Sancho on the cheap.",
      "The Red Devils have held talks with the camp of Brighton star Pervis Estupinan with the club interested in signing the full-back, who is also drawing interest from AC Milan this summer. Amorim only added Patrick Dorgu from Lecce in January and the summer has seen the arrival of teenage star Diego Leon, but they still want players in that area.",
      "Brighton have already signed Maxim De Cuyper from Club Brugge this summer and as a result could be open to offers for Ecuador international, who has two years remaining on his contract at the Amex.",

      "Arsenal are said to have Ollie Watkins as an alternative target if they cannot get a deal for Gyokeres over the line, while United's pursuit of Mbeumo would likely kill any chance of a move for Wissa with Brentford unwilling to sanction exits for both of their leading attackers in the same transfer window.",
      "United have been locked in talks with Brentford for weeks over a deal for Mbeumo, who has made it clear he wants to move to Old Trafford. But an agreement is still seemingly no closer to being reached with both clubs standing firm on their valuation of the player."

      "The winger, who celebrated his 18th birthday in controversial fashion last week, is among the favourites to win his first Ballon d’Or this year – which Ronaldo has won five times.",
      "Given Yamal’s recent heroics in La Liga, the Champions League and 2024 European Championships, it is understandable that many younger fans consider him a better player than the veteran Ronaldo, who is now considered past his peak.",
      "That view was clear to see in a recent Twitch stream with American creator 2xRaKai, who was travelling in a car with 15-year-old Ronaldo Jr. During the stream, the teenager was asked to name his favourite footballer of all time, to which he instantly replied: “My dad.”",

      "Teddy Sheringham hopes that Marcus Rashford \"doesn't get the move\" from Manchester United to Barcelona, claiming the forward isn't worthy of such a switch.",
      "The United academy graduate is tipped to leave Old Trafford this summer after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim. He was loaned out to Aston Villa for the second half of the season, but Unai Emery's side opted against making his move a permanent one.",
      "Rashford is now weighing up his options and those close to him understand that the dream scenario would see him head to the Nou Camp. The Spanish club are considering a swoop having missed out on some of their other targets this summer.",
      "Nico Williams chose to remain at Athletic Bilbao whilst Liverpool are determined not to sell Luis Diaz - which could see them turn their attention to the United outcast. Sheringham though doesn't believe Rashford's behaviour has warranted a move to one of Spain's giants.",
      "The player's attitude and off-field antics were called out by previous manager Erik ten Hag, who previously dropped him on several occasions. Amorim was also quick to highlight issues with Rashford, airing concerns with his application at training.",
      "Sheringham told Sky Bet: “If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you’re there, you appreciate it. You don’t throw it away and say you want to leave. I find the whole episode very soul-destroying, compared to the way I was back in the day and how I strove to get the privilege to play for such a huge football club.",
      "\"To hear someone talking the way he is talking, saying he wants out – I didn’t like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doing that at Arsenal, I thought it was soul-destroying, and I hope Rashford doesn’t get the move that he’s hankering for. From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that’s a step up that he hasn’t deserved.”",
      "United and Rashford are keen to part ways in a move that would suit all parties. He is one of a number of major names, earning big wages, who the club want to get off their books. The player has returned for pre-season but is training on his own at Carrington.",
      "Rashford has proved to be a devastating player in the final third when on form, previously hitting 30 goals in a season, but he's remained hugely inconsistent. Barcelona though may feel he can further their attacking quality if they can get him back to his best."

      "Alan Shearer insists you'd have to be \"very, very brave\" to back against Chelsea being involved in the Premier League title race this season - as he hailed Enzo Maresca for the \"magnificent\" job he has done at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The Italian coach, who arrived in west London last summer after leading Leicester City to the Championship title, came under widespread scrutiny last season - with his past relationship with Pep Guardiola, having worked as a coach at Manchester City previously seeing him cruelly being dubbed 'Diet Pep' in some quarters.",
      "But Chelsea finished the 2024-25 campaign strongly, finishing in the Champions League places, winning the UEFA Conference League and then brushing aside European champions Paris Saint-Germain with a magnificent final display to win the FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "Impressively, Maresca has done that while club chiefs continue to spend big in the transfer market on adding more young talent to the Premier League's youngest squad. Jamie Gittens, Liam Delap, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and £60m striker Joao Pedro have all already arrived, while a number of players - including Noni Madueke and Christopher Nkunku - are set to depart.",
      "Maresca, vocally backed by Cole Palmer after the win over PSG in New York, has been working on ironing out his side's inconsistencies and getting his side, tactically and mentally, to a point where they can challenge the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City in a title battle again - and not just cup competitions. And former England captain Shearer believes the Blues boss may well have done just that.",
      "\"I think it would take a very, very brave person to say that Chelsea would not be involved in the title hunt next year because of what they’ve achieved this season, what they’ve just achieved [winning the Club World Cup], who they’ve signed, who they will sign,’ Shearer said on the latest episode of The Rest Is Football.",
      "\"I think you have to say that they will be involved in the title race.\"",
      "Speaking about Maresca and the Club World Cup final, Shearer added: \"It was a masterclass from Maresca because PSG went in, their football has worked all season and why not? Why should they change anything?",
      "\"But I think the little tweaks from Maresca, they’re pressing high and all those things, and I just think it worked perfectly for them and he deserves huge credit, not only for the job he’s done in this competition, but for the whole season.",

      "One player who could also depart in the coming weeks, potentially, is Nicolas Jackson. The Senegal striker was Maresca's main man last season, but has been sent off twice in recent months and has seen both Joao Pedro - who made an outstanding start to life as a Blue in the USA - and Liam Delap arrive at the club.",
      "Now the former Villarreal forward is being linked with a move away, with Manchester United monitoring his situation as they continue to look for a new No.9 and suggestions Chelsea could deal for around £50million.",

He played under several managers during his seven-and-a-half year spell with the Red Devils, including Dutchman Louis Van Gaal and club legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",

      "Mata ultimately chose to ignore the advice and stay to fight for his place in the team. He went on to make 285 appearances for the club and has told former United goalkeeper Ben Foster that he feels pride over deciding to stick to his guns after Mourinho joined.",
      "Speaking on the Fozcast podcast, he said: \"The first call that I received was from my family and from my granddad saying, 'You have to leave. What's going to happen?' And I said, 'No, I'm going to see how it goes. I don't have any problem with him, and he doesn't have any problems with me.'",
      "\"It is one of the things that I'm most proud of in my career is to have remained, to be calm and say, 'No, I'm going to try to show that I can play in his style.' And I did so. Our relationship was very natural. Actually, we have a good relationship.",

      "The race to sign Gyokeres, who has scored a staggering 97 goals in only 102 games for his Portuguese employers, has been the talk of the summer transfer window, with both the Gunners and Premier League rivals Manchester United keen to bolster their forward lines.",
      "Gyokeres supposedly turned his nose up at the idea of reuniting with Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford, and now, after he failed to return for Sporting's pre-season preparations this week and remains missing from their Algarve training camp, reports suggest his representatives are in London to seal a £69million move.",

      "Portuguese outlet A Bola reports that Gyokeres' potential exit has not been discussed openly within Sporting's cohort. However, many of the club's players anticipated the striker missing their pre-season in light of his potential Premier League switch.",

      "In recent seasons, United have been blighted by numerous missteps in the transfer market, with a string of expensive signings failing to live up to their price tags. The club is trying to move on some of those misfits to fund fresh arrivals and maintain headroom when it comes to PSR restrictions.",
      "Only Matheus Cunha has arrived from Wolves this summer, while exhaustive talks with Brentford over another striker, Bryan Mbeumo, continue after at least two rejected bids. To add insult to injury, United have seen two players they let go relatively cheaply flourish and go on to secure big-money transfers elsewhere.",
      "Anthony Elanga, 23, who United sold to Nottingham Forest for £15million two years ago, has just joined Newcastle United in a £55m deal. Elanga made 55 appearances for United but was deemed surplus to requirements by then-head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "United did retain an interest in the Swedish winger in the form of a sell-on fee related to profit, which means they will reportedly net £6million. While that is a useful sum, United may have been the club reaping the benefits of his potential instead of a direct rival.",
      "Another ex-United player is on the move, Alvaro Carreras, who has left Benfica for Real Madrid in a deal worth £43m. The left-back, 22, was previously part of Real's youth set-up before joining United in 2020.",
      "However, again under Ten Hag's watch, he was allowed to leave for Benfica, initially on loan, before sealing a permanent move for just £5m. United's interest was retained in two ways: a sell-on fee related to profit and a buy-back option, reports Fabrizio Romano.",
      "United opted not to trigger the buy-back clause, although they are said to have received around £7.6m as part of Real’s purchase. Again, United’s decision not to keep or trigger their buy-back option now looks questionable, given that he now resides with the 15-time European champions.",
      "Meanwhile, with just a month to go before the start of the Premier League season, Mbeumo remains a Brentford player, with the two clubs seemingly no closer to striking a deal. United are believed to have offered in excess of £60m - £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons.",
      "However, the Bees are said to be demanding a fixed fee that surpasses the £62.5m that United paid Wolves for Cunha. The inpass adds to the frustration of Amorim, who is eager to get as much business done as soon as possible so he can integrate new players into his squad during an intense pre-season campaign. The Red Devils begin their Premier League campaign against last season's runner-up, Arsenal, on Sunday, August 17.",

      "Tottenham have hired a number of former Manchester United executives who were axed earlier this year as part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's major cost-cutting efforts. Ratcliffe has gone to extreme lengths to save money since taking full control of football operations after buying a share in the club.",
      "That includes scrapping staff lunchboxes, cancelling a staff Christmas party and axing Sir Alex Ferguson's ambassadorial deal. United have also had several rounds of redundancies and some of the staff who were cut have now joined Tottenham.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Spurs have agreed a deal with agency Altius8, which was set up by former United commercial executives Ali Edge, Thomas Liston-Jones and Victoria Timpson in February.",
      "Edge spent 29 years at United and was largely tasked with retaining commercial deals, while Liston-Jones was the club's head of data and strategy. Timpson spent 16 years at Old Trafford and was chief executive of global alliances and partnerships before her departure earlier this year.",
      "The report states that Florence Lafaye, who briefly succeeded Timpson after she left the club, is also involved with Altius8. And Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is said to be hopeful that they can 'have the same transformative effect on the club's revenues as the team did at United.'",
      "The report also claims that those within the industry believe Altius8's involvement at Tottenham could cause embarrassment for Ratcliffe after 'dismantling what was one of the few unqualified successes of the Glazer era'.",
      "However, Ratcliffe has repeatedly defended the cost-cutting and claimed that United would have gone bust by the end of the year if they had not made cuts. \"I don't enjoy reading the newspaper very much these days I have to say,\" Ratcliffe told BBC Sport in March.",
      "\"I know it's unpopular, and this period of change is uncomfortable for people, and some of the decisions we have to make are unpleasant. But they are necessary to put Manchester United back on to a stable footing.",
      "\"If people want to see Manchester United winning trophies again then we have do all this stuff. Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year - by the end of 2025 - after having me put $300m (£232.72m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer.",
      "\"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans. The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\"",

      "One area of the Manchester United squad that almost certainly will not be addressed this summer is central defence.",
      "United have signed at least one centre back in seven of the past nine summer transfer windows. Three came in last season alone.",
      "After Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt joined in the summer, Ayden Heaven followed in the winter. In between, the one-year extension in Harry Maguire's contract was triggered.",
      "Once Lisandro Martinez has recovered from his anterior cruciate ligament injury, United will have five specialist centre halves with an average age of 24. Two are homegrown and three from overseas.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "It is a promising blend of youth (two teenagers), experience and athleticism. Maguire is the only 30-something and all five are ball-playing centre backs.",
      "\"I think if you really analyse our games, it's not that static,\" De Ligt said. \"It's in a way that we are always defending in a three, always in a four. I think in the build-up, all the European teams, the big European teams play with a three in the back. They switch the midfielder in the back or a full-back who comes back. So it's always in a three.\"",
      "Maguire, De Ligt, Martinez and Yoro also tallied a creditable nine goals between them. Heaven got on the scoresheet with a well-placed header in the post-season friendly win in Hong Kong.",
      "Yoro, at 19, was billed as a coup when United beat Real Madrid to him last year and he started to show his class during last season's run-in. After an unconvincing first six months, De Ligt found form before his ill-timed injury.",
      "\"We must remind ourselves he is really young,\" Maguire cautioned on Yoro last year. \"There are going to be mistakes but he has every attribute of a centre back in the modern game, he has it. So I’m sure he’s going to have a bright future.",
      "\"It’s our job as senior centre backs, my job, to help him along, communicate well, let him know what to expect. There are going to be times where I’m sure he’ll feel the world is on top of him, there are also going to be times where he’s going to feel like the best player in the world. And that’s what this club brings.\"",
      "Heaven has been a revelation and got better with every performance until he too hurt himself at Leicester City in March. At the turn of the year, Martinez turned a corner and was influential in January prior to his season-shattering injury against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford.",
      "Now into his sixth year at United, Maguire can fairly be regarded as one of the more respectable recruits of the post-Ferguson era at United. His first season was good, second decent, third a disaster and fourth worse, yet he has recovered commendably with impressive back-to-back campaigns. He has become a United captain without the armband.",
      "Maguire is a more authentic talker now he does not have that elastic wrapped around his bicep. The captaincy was so overwhelming at times that it doubled for a blood pressure cuff strapped to him.",
      "Like his fellow Yorkshireman Joe Root, Maguire has found a new lease of life taking a step back as the team's official leader. Root is the number two Test batsman in the world three years after stepping down as captain. Maguire will be aiming to earn a new United contract next year.",
      "The defensive quintet available to Ruben Amorim is a far cry from Jose Mourinho's final months at United in 2018 after Ed Woodward denied him a central defensive signing. Mourinho was responsible for the arrivals of Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof but inherited Chris Smalling and Phil Jones.",
      "When Mourinho telephoned Bailly, the defender thought it was someone playing a joke. Bailly's appearance average at United - fewer than 20 games a season - was a joke.",
      "It was no surprise to hear that Lindelof was one of three United players that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remains in contact with (Maguire and Bruno Fernandes were the other two). Lindelof benefited from Solskjaer's Scandinavian solidarity and had long outstayed his welcome before he was released last month.",
      "The caveat with United's current five defenders is they all had significant injury lay-offs last season. Yoro was on crutches after his second appearance in pre-season and had to wait more than four months to make his competitive debut.",
      "De Ligt's final two months of the season were practically wiped out, Heaven missed two months, Maguire was sidelined for around three months of the campaign and Martinez has suffered agonising injuries in each of his three seasons in Manchester.",
      "It was only 15 months ago that Casemiro was parachuted in at centre back for the FA Cup semi-final after Willy Kambwala (remember him?) broke down again. With Kambwala, Martinez, Lindelof, Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans all on the treatment table, the only centre back United had on the bench against Coventry City at Wembley was Louis Jackson.",
      "Given United operate in a back three, five centre backs with recent injury issues is a potential risk. The risk is offset by Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw, both experienced at playing at centre half and unlikely to be used on the wing.",
      "If need be, Casemiro has played in defence. Tyler Fredricson has received a squad number upgrade as well. That is nine options across nine months with a reduced workload due to the absence of European football.",
      "Expect a summer more like 2018 or 2020."

      "Frustrating is probably the word most Manchester United supporters would use to describe the club's summer transfer window so far.",
      "United came flying out of the traps at the start of last month, announcing they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha on the opening day of the transfer window. United triggered his £62.5million release clause and the deal was formally completed 11 days later.",
      "In between confirming they had reached an agreement to sign Cunha and formally unveiling him as their first summer signing, United tabled an opening offer for Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Alongside Cunha, the Brentford attacker was one of the best players in the Premier League last season, scoring 20 goals. United set an objective of signing him ahead of the start of pre-season training at the beginning of last week.",
      "After seeing an opening bid worth £55m knocked back and a second offer in excess of £60m not proving enough for Brentford to give Mbeumo the green light to move to Old Trafford, United could have been forgiven for walking away. Instead, discussions are still ongoing.",
      "United are determined to bring Mbeumo to Old Trafford and beef up their attack. They have rightfully prioritised attacking signings this summer and the prospect of heading on the upcoming tour of the United States with Cunha and Mbeumo in the bank would resemble a strong start to the window.",
      "In addition to chasing Mbeumo's tail, United are still eager to sign a striker this summer. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen who they will turn to in their pursuit of an out-and-out No.9.",
      "Furthermore, United also want to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer. It remains to be seen if Andre Onana's hamstring injury will force them to move for a shot-stopper earlier than expected.",
      "United's retained list confirmed the exits of three first-team players: Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen. Tom Heaton was the only out-of-contract player to be offered a new deal.",
      "The exit of the aforementioned trio immediately shrunk United's squad size. It has now been reduced by a further five players amid Tyrell Malacia's, Marcus Rashford's, Jadon Sancho's, Alejandro Garnacho's and Antony's absences from first-team training.",
      "The quintet have all informed United they want to leave the club and they do not feature in head coach Ruben Amorim's plans. With the exception of Garnacho, they all spent time away from Old Trafford on loan last season, with Malacia, Sancho and Rashford departing in the winter window.",
      "United are right to try and sell all five of them amid Malacia's struggles and Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation having no room for natural wingers. Cunha has been drafted in to play as the left-sided No.10 and Mbeumo could be an option for the right-sided berth.",
      "Having released three players and five more not currently training with the first-team, United's squad size is currently smaller than it was last season. However, they will play fewer games in 2025/26 after failing to qualify for Europe.",
      "United could play as few as 40 matches in the coming season, meaning the demands will not be as straining as they have been in recent years. United played 60 competitive matches in 2024/25.",
      "To ensure United strike the right balance between having a healthy number of options and enough quality in reserve, Amorim cannot afford to be left light in any area of the squad. With four attackers currently out of the picture and no guarantees about Rasmus Hojlund's or Joshua Zirkzee's future at the club, United face the prospect of being light up front.",
      "The obvious caveat to highlight is that Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are natural wingers and do not fit into Amorim's system, but they are still bodies Amorim could turn to in an emergency. They will, when analysing the landscape of the squad in terms of personnel, need replacing in some form.",
      "If United can add Mbeumo to the ranks, he and Cunha will be first-choice No.10 options. Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Amad can also operate in those roles.",
      "In terms of natural strikers, though, United still look light. Hojlund regressed in his second season at the club and Chido Obi is still raw and unproven, despite his exciting potential.",
      "The club's striker search is yet to offer the answer they are looking for and that will only change once funds become available via player sales. Departures hold the key to completing what many consider as United's top transfer objective.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "Jackson was widely pilloried after he was sent off in the Club World Cup. In his first season in London, he was mentioned in the same breath as another Premier League newbie, Rasmus Hojlund. He should be a non-starter for that reason alone.",
      "United cannot remotely entertain taking a busted flush off Chelsea's hands. They are nowhere near as keen on Nkunku as Chelsea have tried to suggest and Jackson is less attractive.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "Every Tom, Dick and Harry who plays up front is cropping up in the United gossip columns. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is a free agent that Everton are better off without yet United's striker strife is so acute there is speculation about a possible move for him.",
      "Apart from sorry Southampton, every Premier League side last season had a better striker than United. Go through the table and 18 clubs had a more rounded frontman than Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Such reports are not of United's own making but they have given the impression that Delap was the only duck they had lined up as their new starting striker. It suited them to be linked with Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike but there was nothing concrete. Both are bound for Premier League clubs that qualified for the Champions League.",
      "United might have edged Chelsea for Delap had they left Bilbao with the Europa League trophy among their hand luggage. United, reeling from their worst season in 51 years and with no European football on offer, are a tough sell to strikers.",
      "Thirty goals in two seasons is not the pedigree of striker United require. Jackson is neither prolific nor proven. He was red-carded twice within six weeks at the tail-end of Chelsea's campaign and they have recruited two forwards in between those expulsions. Of course they want rid.",
      "United have signed one-season wonder strikers (Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani, Cristiano Ronaldo) with a short shelf life while Hojlund was too young. Romelu Lukaku ticked most of the boxes yet he continued to be a peripatetic striker. Radamel Falcao and Anthony Martial were two gambles from Monte Carlo that bust.",
      "And United also have form for settling any Tom, Dick, Harry or Wout. For all the mitigation surrounding the loan arrival of Weghorst in January 2023, opting for another Dutchman who grew up in the same district as the manager was beneath them. Weghorst was playing on loan in Turkey, having riled teammates and supporters at recently relegated Burnley. He scored as many goals for United as Burnley - two tap-ins.",
      "The Weghorst deal was reminiscent of Odion Ighalo's deadline day move in January 2020. Ighalo was playing in China, back when the country's Super League was teeming with Premier League cast-offs, and he was represented by a Norwegian agent who was the same nationality as the United manager.",
      "Ighalo and Weghorst were brought in as the support striker to Martial. Banking on Martial three years apart and under two managers is one of innumerable reasons why United are in the state that they are.",
      "As recently as January, United gave consideration to signing Mathys Tel, a peripheral forward who barely scored for Bayern Munich. Yet United have a penchant for taking surplus squad players from Bayern.",
      "On the basis of the Ighalo and Weghorst deals, any striker with a Portuguese connection should instruct their agent to dial 0161. Ominously, Portugal international Joao Felix is still technically a Chelsea player."

Consequently, Garnacho has been absent from United's pre-season preparations.",

      "Two former Manchester United youth-teamers have transferred in the past week for a combined £98million.",
      "Thanks to sell-on clauses, United have raked in £13m from Anthony Elanga's £55m move to Newcastle United and Alvaro Carreras's return to Real Madrid.",
      "Elanga will be playing in the Champions League next season and Carreras figured in that competition last term with Benfica. The latter never made his debut for United while Elanga failed to score in his final 18 months at the club.",
      "It has become easy to deride United whenever a former player thrives. Elanga scored the winner against his former club for Nottingham Forest in April. Typically, it was his last goal of the season and Forest lost their nerve with a Champions League place up for grabs and ended up in the Europa Conference League.",
      "In 2023, United decided to strengthen their approach to selling academy graduates at the opportune moment. A year before, the only fees they banked from departures were for academy graduates Andreas Pereira and James Garner.",
      "Every case with a United academy sale is nuanced. Contrary to popular belief, the club have got more right than wrong.",
      "Pereira is a Premier League regular and plays for Brazil but nobody seriously suggests United miss him. He had plenty of chances under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, perhaps too many, and became an irrelevance in his last two-and-a-half years at the club after Bruno Fernandes arrived in January 2020.",
      "Following loan stints with Lazio and Flamengo, Fulham took the plunge with a £10m offer in 2022, a year before Pereira's United deal expired. They did United a favour.",
      "Verdict: right to sell and for a good price",
      "United belatedly decided to sell Garner in the 2022 summer transfer window, informing intermediaries before the player himself. Garner was injured for the majority of Erik ten Hag's first pre-season and then failed his audition in the final friendly at home to Rayo Vallecano.",
      "It was still a jolt that United planned to offload one of their most polished players to emerge from the academy in recent years. Given Garner's cachet as a United youth-teamer, England Under 21 representative and role in Nottingham Forest's 2022 promotion, he went on the cheap at £15m.",
      "Garner has been a quality addition for Everton and operated at such a low level he has not been bracketed among the ones to get away from United.",
      "Verdict: too low a price and wrong to sell but understandable as the manager was not going to use him",
      "Newcastle's hit rate in the transfer market has been so good in recent years that the £55m they have coughed up for Elanga has barely been scrutinised when they have overpaid for an overrated winger.",
      "United received £15m rising to £20m from Nottingham Forest for Elanga in July 2023. The only other club that was interested were Everton. Forest and Everton finished in the two places above the relegation zone in 2022-23.",
      "Elanga did not score in his only full season in the United first team and, at the time he left United, they had Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho ahead of him in the pecking order on the left wing. It has gone awry for all three, all available for transfer this summer, but United had to cash in on Elanga, Premier League-quality but not United quality.",
      "Verdict: right to sell but could have negotiated a better price",
      "Ten Hag was briefly reunited with a familiar face at Bayer Leverkusen. Kovar never debuted for United but his impressive skill set was obvious and he seemed poised to become the new No.1 at the 2024 Bundesliga champions. Yet he has just joined PSV Eindhoven on loan.",
      "Kovar left United in the same summer that Andre Onana arrived. If United had not stockpiled goalies, he would have been a worthy competitor for Onana but Bayer paid £7.7m for a goalie that United had developed for six years.",
      "Verdict: right to sell for a good price",
      "Chelsea were prepared to part with £40million for Henderson in 2021. He ended up leaving United for an up-front fee of £15m, rising to £20m, two years later.",
      "After Solskjaer reneged on his pledge to install Henderson as No.1 for the 2021-22 season, the England international made only three more appearances for the club and spent his final year on loan at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Come the summer of 2023, United released David de Gea and brought in Onana. Henderson, demonstrably a No.1 Premier League goalkeeper, had to go but the fee United banked was derisory, chiefly due to the mismanagement by Solskjaer of a 'keeper they had developed for a decade.",
      "Verdict: right to sell but poor price",
      "Leverkusen fans should keep an eye out at left back as that is where Ten Hag has a blind spot. While Fernandez was at United, the club bought Tyrell Malacia, handed Luke Shaw a four-year contract, loaned in Sergio Reguilon and played three right-footers at left back.",
      "Malacia wants to leave, Shaw has played 27 times in two seasons and Reguilon's loan was terminated early. As long as Ten Hag was at United, Fernandez would not get a kick and he was sold to Benfica last summer.",
      "This week, he re-joined Real Madrid for £43m.",
      "Verdict: wrong not to ever play him",
      "After being dogged by injuries in his first few years at United, Kambwala overachieved to play ten times for the club and receive an FA Cup winner's medal. He would have started in the FA Cup semi-final epic with Coventry City but for another ill-timed injury.",
      "A €4m recruit from Sochaux in 2020, Kambwala was sold to Villarreal for £4.63m rising to £9.68m, an impressive outlay for a raw defender who did not have a realistic pathway to the first team at United.",
      "Verdict: right to sell",
      "The United chief executive, football director and manager were all gone within a little over a year after the club abandoned plans to reintegrate Greenwood into the first team squad. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped criminal proceedings over attempted rape against Greenwood in February 2023 and the United hierarchy had planned for him to come back into the team until a fan backlash prompted them to back down.",
      "After a year on loan with Getafe in Spain, Greenwood was sold to Marseille for £26.6m last year.",
      "Verdict: right to sell",
      "Mejbri and Kambwala arrived in the United academy from French sides in successive years and left for similar fees. Burnley agreed an overall £9.4m to sign Mejbri.",
      "Mejbri had a brief stint as a starter under Ten Hag but his productivity off the ball was not matched by his effectiveness on it. After five years with United, he moved down the road to Burnley and helped them to promotion back to the top flight.",
      "Verdict: right to sell",
      "United refused to sell McTominay for £30m in 2023. A year later - and after his career-best season - he was sold for around £30m.",
      "McTominay's goal-getting was crucial in 2023-24 and he was the glue in the team that punched above their weight in the FA Cup final triumph against Manchester City. Yet United needed a younger defensive midfielder and the sellable asset to make way was the attack-minded McTominay.",
      "Fulham were the only interested Premier League club before Napoli came in. McTominay topped his final season with United by winning the Scudetto in Italy, where he was named Serie A's MVP.",
      "McTominay's profound impact in Naples, and the struggles of Manuel Ugarte (hardly a like-for-like replacement) undermine United's decision to cash in on the Scot but their logic was understandable. McTominay might have been sold a year earlier had Kobbie Mainoo not sustained an ankle injury during pre-season.",
      "Verdict: right to sell but replaced with the wrong man"

      "Erik ten Hag overlooked Amad for Omari Forson at the beginning of 2024. Amad was forced to consider his future away from Old Trafford and his departure would have been a huge loss to Manchester United.",
      "Forson made a single start and eight substitute appearances as Monza were relegated from Serie A after finishing rock bottom last season, which proves Ten Hag got his pecking order wrong.",
      "Ten Hag made a handful of inexplicable decisions during his two-and-a-half years in Manchester, but perhaps his decision to overlook Alvaro Fernandez was worse than his preference for Forson over Amad.",
      "Although Ten Hag had various qualities as United boss, his assessment of talent could be iffy and there must be regrets about the circumstances of Fernandez's departure from the club.",
      "Fernandez joined Benfica on loan in January 2024 with a view to a permanent transfer in the summer window and the Portuguese subsequently club triggered their option to buy him.",
      "Benfica paid €6million (£5.2m) plus €3m (£2.6m) in potential add-ons to sign Fernandez and United inserted a 15 per cent sell-on clause, along with a buy-back option, into the sale.",
      "Just a year later, Fernandez has signed for Real Madrid in a €50m (£43m) deal and supporters have pulled their hair out, wondering why the defender was allowed to slip through United's net.",
      "The truth is the blame lies with Ten Hag, who did not deem Fernandez worthy of a senior debut, despite his first-team potential being obvious after his arrival at the club as a teenager in 2020.",
      "Fernandez won the Denzil Haroun Reserve-Team Player of the Year award in 2021/22 for his brilliant academy performances. However, Ralf Rangnick also denied him a debut.",
      "The Spaniard made the first-team squad for the last four Premier League games of Rangnick's tenure, but Alex Telles was strangely picked ahead of him on the final day of the season.",
      "Fernandez was loaned to Preston for 2022/2023 and looked determined to prove his quality. His spell at the Deepdale Stadium was considered a resounding success and he subsequently travelled on the pre-season tour of the USA after an injury to Tyrell Malacia, but opportunities were limited.",
      "Fernandez's only appearance in the States in the summer of 2023 was against Wrexham in San Diego when an academy side was fielded. Even Brandon Williams was handed more minutes.",
      "There was also a sliding door moment in August 2023 when Luke Shaw picked up an injury against Tottenham. Malacia remained on the sidelines, recovering from knee surgery, but Diogo Dalot started at left back in the following game and Fernandez was named on the bench.",
      "To make matters worse, Sergio Reguilon was signed on loan from Tottenham on deadline day.",
      "Fernandez's loan to Granada was confirmed on the same day and he later criticised Ten Hag.",
      "“What message did United give me? That I should go out on loan, that Ten Hag didn’t count on me, that I should continue to gain experience, rhythm, and we’ll see what happens in the future,\" he told The Athletic in December 2023.",
      "\"But it’s clear that football doesn’t end at any club and that you have to keep working. My main objective is to return to United and make a place for myself there.”",
      "Eyebrows were raised when Fernandez signed for Benfica on loan in January last year because it was a move with a view to a permanent transfer. United fans understood he was about to leave the club for good.",
      "Fernandez was never given a fair crack of the whip by Ten Hag, despite the evidence in front of him and injuries to Shaw and Malacia, meaning there were no senior left-backs available.",
      "It always felt possible Fernandez would use Benfica as a springboard to further success and his departure from United looks much worse after his multi-million pound move to the world's biggest club.",
      "Ten Hag made an assessment of Fernandez and was ultimately responsible for his exit. It really does not reflect well on Ten Hag that Real Madrid have swooped to sign the youngster.",
      "It could be suggested that Fernandez wouldn't have been in that position to sign for Madrid unless he'd left United, but he spent just a year and a half with Benfica, which clearly weakens the argument.",
      "There is no denying Fernandez took strides forward with Benfica and benefited from regular game time, but it's not as if he spent four years in Portugal and became a completely new player.",
      "Anyone who watched Fernandez in the academy and observed his loan at Preston could tell he was destined for bigger things. That's not to say anyone predicted he would sign for Madrid at 20 years old, but it was a mistake from Ten Hag not to give him a chance, especially when senior left-backs were injured."

      "2) Liverpool actually worry me a little.",
      "Liverpool buying attackers, attacking midfielders and attacking full backs looks lovely on paper..",
      "Selling Quansah (the new Van Dijk for me – but seems Arne disagrees) Nat (head breeze blocks all day, love that lad) Philips and Konate looking to be off (what’s happened behind the scenes that Trent, Ibou and Diaz have all decided this is not the club for them? That worries me a little too) leave us with Virgil and Joe (Made from the bits of Darren Anderton that still work) Gomez and Rhys Williams, who hasn’t really managed to step up in the few chances he’s had",
      "Titles are generally won based on a good defence and while we might score plenty this year, the defensive side really does concern me (unless the plan is to play Alli and Marmalade together and only 9 outfielders……)",
      "I also totally agree that Darwin will score 30-40 goals this year, for someone, He just can’t be as unlucky (yes yes he was! stop laughing at the back) as he was last year. Part of me wants him to stay and become the cult legend that he should be.",
      "I can’t see us signing Isak, this seems quite indecisive for us at the moment. Lots of actual strikers on the market unusually this year and people seems not to want them for some reason, Sesko, Gyokeres, Ekitike, Osimhen etc etc",
      "If you really need a striker, they are there to be purchased, Why are we trying to buy one that isn’t (allegedly) for sale in Isak and risk getting no one?\nAl – LFC Should be fun season for sure. Chelsea look good (though will be knackered?) and Arse may have a striker.. City are City all the boxes ticked for a title race.. but can we DEFEND it.. literally and metaphorically",

      "Liverpool title is enough, actually\nTwo things can be true at once. Liverpool can be spending at an unprecedented level, for their history. And winning ‘just’ a Premier League will be more than good enough in the coming season.",
      "The first point doesn’t need a lot of explaining. Anyone who’s ever spent much time in the mailbox knows there’ve been endless Liverpool net spend, salary spend, discussion since the mid 2000s at least. That’s because, for all of them being one of the biggest clubs in the world since Shankly did his thing, they’ve rarely spent like it. Hells, they’ve rarely had the ability to spend like it.",
      "When we were linked to Wirtz, I didn’t believe it. And continued to not really believe until it was firmly established as happening. And this is after bidding a billion on Caicedo a couple of years ago. The idea we’d get one of the best and brightest in the world is just foreign to me. I’m used to them either being much younger (and bigger gambles) previously failed (and so not trusted) or just being a relative unknown.",
      "Doing it once was crazy. Barely credible. We’d signed that level player two or three times since 2000. To do it twice in a window is madness. I’m giddy that it seems real. Wild.",
      "And yet, winning the league is hard. Winning it twice in a row is even harder. As much as I’ll never let a City fan forget how much (alleged) cheating was involved putting that group together, it’s still an accomplishment to do what they did on the field.",
      "Here’s the list of people who done it since WW2: Pep, Fergie (a lot), Jose (once), Paisley, Busby, Bob Jackson and Stan Cullis.",

      "That means as a Man United fan all of my formative years and a lot of my adult life we just won all the time. Maybe not all the trophies we actually should have but we went in to every game against anybody either reasonably expecting to win or to have a better than even chance.",
      "I can tell you honestly that never made me personally entitled. I have always found the specific moments and the experiences bigger than the actual trophy presentations. Hard to explain but Macheda scoring against Villa is a much bigger memory for me at OT than any of the title presentations. Raw emotion. Same recently with Maguire against Lyon watching it on TV. Not winning Europa in the end was disappointing obviously, but that moment was very special.",
      "For me as well, Henry and Bergkamp were two of the most special players to ever play the game. I can see a bit beyond blind loyalty. So with all this said just wanted to say that hand on heart, I cannot believe in a sports, business, hobby or even a fantasy gaming environment that anyone could do a worse job of running a football club than Sir Jim Radcliffe. We are extremely lucky that football really is not “life or death”.",
      "It would take me in my professional life between 1 to 2 hours to agree an internal budget for any asset on Earth and then a workshop lasting maybe 2 to 3 hours to negotiate that sale.",
      "Some of you need to think how long a drunk conversation takes in a pub to come up with a list of players you could realistically sign for your club and how much they would cost and then translate that in to ultra high value individuals backed by legal council doing it. It is a disgrace that an institution like Manchester United can ever have been brought to this. Please feel free to laugh at us but at some point, it would be good to worry about if it can happen to us who is next? Because we were rich as a business without oil and successful as a team with players no one else rated and they still ruined us because they could.",

      "Truth be told, Manchester City are not an academy product team like Barcelona. All our best players since the Abu Dhabi era like Kompany, Aguero, Kevin, Rodri, Haaland etc were all bought, not developed. Barcelona seem to actively push their academy players in the playing 11, our academy seems to be a sort of profit machine i.e. A mini Benfica or Dortmund.",
      "It’s a bit sad to see these players like James McAtee come to the realisation, that after so many years at the academy, it’s next to impossible to get in the playing 11. I feel that Foden could burn the PL if he played for United or Tottenham, where he would probably be the biggest star. Here it will be difficult for a mercurial no 10, simply because it will be his responsibility to feed the best striker in the world. If he doesn’t do that properly enough, Cherki and Reijnders are just waiting for that spot.",
      "Ultimately, No point whining about these problems, the team does its main job quite professionally i.e actually winning things (never mind last season).

      "United completed a £62.5m deal for Matheus Cunha early in the window, while Diego Leon has also joined for £3.3m, but they’ve gone weeks without getting another transfer over the line as the club chiefs put all their efforts into landing Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "They’ve so far had two bids rejected, the latest thought to be worth £62.5m, but transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insisted last week that the “deal is absolutely alive”.",
      "He said: “The contacts are still ongoing between United, Brentford, people involved in the deal. Mbeumo still wants to go to Manchester United, and the club maintains their confidence, their optimism, to get the green light and sign Bryan Mbeumo in the next days.",
      "“So still no breakthrough in this story as of tonight but Manchester United keep advancing to find the right structure for the deal. They are working on easy and difficult add-ons, trying to make Brentford happy with their final proposal. So Man United are still on it. The Bryan Mbeumo deal is absolutely alive at this moment.”",
      "But The Guardian claimed on Wednesday that the Red Devils’ ‘push to buy Bryan Mbeumo has stalled after Brentford raised their valuation to closer to £70m, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe intent on not being pushed into paying more than his club’s £65m valuation of the forward’.",
      "After it was known that Mbeumo wanted to join Man Utd, Brentford ‘privately indicated a medical was expected imminently’ but now both Ratcliffe and technical director Jason Wilcox ‘do not wish to be held to ransom and are determined to be patient’.",
      "And now The i Paper claim ‘United have turned their attentions to Jackson as they desperately look to add firepower to their underperforming strike force’.",
      "While no bids have been made yet, ‘interest is there, especially if he can be acquired at a knockdown price’ on the back of Chelsea signing both Joao Pedro and Liam Delap this summer to compete for his No.9 spot in Enzo Maresca’s starting XI.",
      "And the report claims Jackson could ‘trade places’ with Alejandro Garnacho, who ‘retain an admiration for how Garnacho carries the ball and his willingness to take on defenders’, despite Chelsea making Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers their ‘top target’.",
      "Reports in Spain also claim Chelsea have ‘offered’ Real Madrid Jackson in a ‘direct exchange’ for Arsenal and Liverpool target Rodrygo.",

      "The report adds:",
      "‘Both United and Chelsea would prefer straight player sales, especially United, given Garnacho is an academy graduate and any revenue generated goes down as pure profit in the eyes of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.",

While speculating over the Reds’ alternatives to Isak, the Daily Mail writes: “Rashford was also floated but that initial conversation has not progressed so far.” Of course it hasn’t. Though Rashford winning 21 at Anfield next season would be very modern-day Manchester United.",
      "",
      "",
      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao which, presumably, will supress the Old Lady’s appetite for Sancho. So what now for the ex-England international?",
      "",
      "17) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern have made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool won’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, but £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, but it feels very unlikely the two clubs will compromise while they stand £30million apart in their current valuations.

The one signing they made in January was a left wing-back, though Patrick Dorgu showed almost nothing in his half-season so far.",
      "",
      "15) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",

      "14) 🆕 Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Bayern Munich\nWith Arsenal looking to sign players in the positions Trossard plays, it makes sense that they cash in on the attacker. Who just so happened to change his representatives this summer to a fella well connected with the German big-hitters. Trossard has two years remaining on his contract and would be around half the price of Diaz.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s gotta go somewhere…",

The Guardian says ‘preparations for a move are being conducted’ which have to start with a simple question: how much?",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nIt seemed as though United were at fault for this dragging as long as it has but now we hear of Brentford increasing their demand to £70million. Perhaps as a consequence of their own frustration at United’s lack of decisiveness. The Red Devils appear determined not to go over £65million, but Brentford’s show of strength could prompt them to get to their maximum a little faster.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool were rebuffed in their initial enquiry but we doubt they took ‘no’ as a final answer. We can still imagine a deal happening if the Reds say they will step back from Ekitike – and if Isak agitates for the move.",
      "",
      "7) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Newcastle\nSome reports at the start of the week suggested Ekitike’s agents were in Newcastle, others say a Toon delegation was in Germany. Whatever. Talks were certainly taking place, which apparently involved Eintracht saying ‘nein’ to Newcastle’s opening bid of £70million. It has always been reported that the Germans want more for the forward, perhaps as much as £85million. And they will feel emboldened by the bidding battle that could ensue since Liverpool are determined to ‘go to war’, according to The Telegraph.",
      "",
      "6) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nLiverpool heard the rejection of their advances on Alexander Isak and reacted with violence by targeting the stiker Newcastle crave. We make Liverpool favourites here on the basis they have greater spending power. We assume so since they were willing to make a record bid for Isak. And also because Liverpool are the more attractive option right now. That’s not to denigrate Newcastle – it’s an exciting time up there too – but Liverpool have strengthened significantly as champions. Of course everyone else is playing catch up.",
      "",
      "5) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there. And Mosquera’s farewell message suggests it is heading in the right direction.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion amid reports a deal has finally been agreed between the two clubs. Indeed, Gyokeres’ representatives are in London now though a five-year contract was agreed weeks ago.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger will be unveiled by Arsenal any time now after a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",

      "24) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",

      "23) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "22) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",

      "20) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",

      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",

      "18) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",

      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",

      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "A new report has revealed the ‘most realistic solution’ for Manchester City and England star Jack Grealish amid interest from Premier League rivals.",
      "Jack Grealish looks destined to leave Man City this summer but a £300k-a-week wage has made it hard for clubs to take the risk.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Every Cruyff turn is a footprint. Some players leave lasting impressions; others barely register. Was peak Eden Hazard the very best?"

But I presume they are not included in the Big Six as there are two of them.",

Historically and financially they warrant their place undoubtedly but in terms of league position they obviously finished 15th and are not playing in Europe next year. But if they are included should we not include Spurs? They finished 17th and have a massive stadium and were in the top 4 not that long ago.",

      "We’re all just the Washington Generals. Or Ernie Wise.\nInteresting reading Paco’s nonsense countered by common sense from James, Chris and especially Ken in today’s mailbox. Ken’s point about entertainment usurping sporting values struck a particular chord with me.",
      "Back in the 60s and 70s when I were just a lad, and we all lived in a box in a hole in t’middle of t’motorway fast lane (“luxury!” I hear you cry), there wasn’t much on the telly, but we’d get a few treats at Christmas. Big film TV premieres, Disney Time, Morecambe and Wise, Top of the Pops with the Christmas number one. For a few years, we also got to see The Harlem Globetrotters travelling basketball / entertainment team. They always played brilliant, entertaining basketball with wonderful trick shots, dribbling, ball juggling and comedy routines thrown in. Their opponents were routinely made to look foolish, and, in my naivety, I often wondered what was in it for them, why did they keep turning up and suffering the humiliation Meadowlark Lemon, Curly et al would inflict on them.",
      "Of course that’s what they were there for, paid stooges to make the Globetrotters look good, like Ernie Wise was mainly there to highlight Eric Morecambe’s comedy genius. It turns out they were another touring team called the Washington Generals set up purely for that purpose. It wasn’t intended to be genuine sport, it was pretend eye-candy for TV viewers around the world.",
      "So what’s this got to do with football? Well, as a Villa fan, my team has progressed far enough to become one of those knocking against the glass ceiling of the ever more entrenched “wealthy elite”. Those in the elite were fortunate enough to have either been successful when the PL rose to prominence and gained a global audience via Sky TV rights and the internet, or they were able to buy their way unrestricted into the club via incredibly wealthy owners.",
      "By the time Villa, Newcastle, Forest and a few other clubs acquired owners who were willing to invest heavily in their clubs, the football authorities made sure the ceiling was not only firmly in place but was made of PSR/FFP/115 reinforced bullet-proof glass. And the football authorities’ clear intent is to disarm outsiders of any tools capable of breaking it and killing or wounding their golden goose.",
      "Thus it has effectively created a mini-super league within the PL (notwithstanding the astounding capacity of United and to a lesser extent Spurs to monumentally screw things up despite every advantage) and, to my mind, this is intentional, driven by fear that the wealthier clubs will be tempted to join an actual super league by the likes of Real and Juventus if their positions aren’t protected within the PL and CL.",
      "As a consequence it increasingly feels like Villa, and other ambitious teams in similar and lesser positions, are simply there to make up the numbers. Two thirds of the PL just a bunch of Washington Generals and Ernie Wises, stooges only there to provide pseudo competition for the wealthy elite, to make them look good.",
      "Surely it is only a matter of time before Chelsea, Citeh and their European counterparts start working comedy routines, trick shots and ritual humiliations into their performances for the delight of plastics, glory hunters (yes I mean you Paco – why Chelsea Paco, and not Fulham or Brentford?) and casual TV viewers across the globe, safe in the knowledge that they will still win because the other guys are only there to lose to them.",
      "The Club World Cup is just the latest inevitable symptom and manifestation of this travelling circus approach. There’s money in it for FIFA, and there’s money in it for those who already have more than anyone else, and there is gratification for some of the global glory hunters who will be queuing up for more.",
      "The issue I have is that PL clubs have the power to change things but they don’t seem to want to. I can only imagine that some smaller PL clubs without mega wealthy owners don’t vote to amend or abolish FFP rules because they fear that the elite group would only get bigger and they still wouldn’t be in it . Or they fear it will “damage the product” if certain teams aren’t successful all the time. If that’s the case they deserve nothing more than regular humiliation at the hands of the big boys.",

If Eintracht is compliant about payment structure, this could be a real coup, and I hope it goes through.",
      "Isak and Ekitike playing together could be madness in its own right, but the option of reverting to a front three when one is injured or misfiring is gold, as far as Eddie is concerned. Low blocks have flummoxed the Mags since he arrived, and he hasn’t previously had a Plan B. Elanga and Gordon will pin fullbacks wide if we play a 442, I could see Tonali and Bruno scoring a lot more goals in that system.",

I suspect, however, that either Barnes or Gordon would leave by January. Joe Willock to Manchester United has never been mooted, but it would be a decent move for them, West Ham, or any of the promoted sides.

      "On the CWC, the biggest issue beyond overplaying players and the dreadful spectacle around the games is that the amount of money involved is going to massively skew domestic leagues across the world. Auckland FC made USD3.5m for being in the tournament – that’s 4 years of turnover. How can other clubs in their league compete? It’s like when the Champions League expanded and clubs from smaller nations that happened to be in the first iteration got enough money to dominate their leagues for a decade. More money to fewer clubs means less competition – all Infantino seems to want is to have the best teams play each other all the time to make as much money as possible, which reduces the excitement and ultimately overall quality of the sport.\nTom, Andover",

      "Bedding down new players is not easy, from Real Madrid downwards.",
      "The guys that secured 100 points and promotion basically have to be trusted, even if it is clear that they’re not good enough – some of our best results (not many, I know) had a core of 6-7 players who played for Ipswich in Div 1. The rest were strangers until it was far too late…",
      "That, of course, is the Sword of Damocles attached to promotion – damned if you do, damned if you don’t.",
      "Hopefully see you next year – enjoy Liam Delap…\nMatthew (ITFC – a shedload of cash and who knows)",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer exposes Sir Gareth\nAfter another MoM (or Superior Player according to the Yanks) performance from Palmer, we can see Sir Gareth only played him for 144 minutes out of a possible 690 (plus injury time I can’t be arsed to count) in Euro 2024. Compare that to",
      "Bellingham (why always me indeed) 671 mins\nFoden 622 mins",

      "…Cole Palmer has played in 4 senior finals (European Championship, European super cup, Europa conference and Club World Cup) with 4 goals and 3 assists. 1.75 goal involvements per game and scoring or assisting 78% of his teams’ goals in those 4 finals.",
      "Leaving him out of the Conference League squad in the first half of the season was superb decision making as was recalibrating the team to be less reliant on him during the season.",
      "Chelsea need to go cojones out next season in terms of trusting their whole squad (including George and Acheampong). The top players should only be playing 2 games in 3 and squad players should be starting 1 in 3.",

      "A final word on the Club World Cup\nI think the main thing that folks like me have against eminently political things like the revamped Club World Cup, is the encouraging of political discourse in football, and mails like the intellectual drivel contained in Paco’s note from Accra.",
      "In it s simplest form, you have the claim from football fans the world over, when something they want is acquired by an arse, or a nation state, or gets a sponsor from a pollutant or war criminal, that ‘what are they supposed to do; I was a fan first, my story with this is longer than theirs’. And it’s hard to argue against. I know how I’d hope to react if it was my team, but I don’t know what I’d do for sure.",
      "I do know I didn’t watch a second of the Qatar World Cup, and ideally would have liked every match report to have started with the sentence “As the families of the deceased workers are still trying to get the wages due, and the bodies remain shamefully missing, we watched a great game of football today as…”. But, it’s the World Cup. Football has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. It brings people together and is a cauldron for joy, for the most part. So if folks wanted to watch Qatar, they should.",
      "But those arguments don’t apply for the revamped version of the CWC; This is a ‘new’ tournament, so an opportunity to hold to your principles, or declare you have none. The CAPSLOCK brigade can rightly and perpetually laugh at Jordan Henderson for demonstrably being dim, but if they watched the CWC then I can’t see how they can have a go at him for his ethical stances or lack there-of.",
      "It was funded by the Saudi regime, proposed by Infantino and for the personal glory of Infantino, hosted by Trump under the spectre of ICE, and played upon condemnation from player-unions and managers like Ancelloti amongst many, many others. You had the very easy option of just electing not to watch, but if you did it was transparent what you were supporting, who was paying for it, and who benefited from it.",
      "As for Paco’s arguments about its reception globally, his raving review doesn’t tally with there being literally zero bidders to broadcast it, so it had to be propped up by the ghouls behind DAZN, and ticket sales were considerably lower than when the same teams visit the same venues for pre-season friendlies.",
      "We have to be mindful of our own echo chambers and just because mine thinks one thing it doesn’t mean everyone’s does, but it shouldn’t also tally that just because Paco had a whale of time watching this it doesn’t mean broadcasting and attendance numbers haven’t been abysmal for this thing that they literally had to give away free-to-air because no one would pay for it.",
      "And it expressly being a vehicle to increase the wealth of European football clubs does somewhat chime against your ludicrous point that this tournament offering three games to Boca so Real Madrid, Chelsea or PSG can win a billion is for the benefit of the ‘global game’.",
      "Finally, my not watching this has sod all to do with bigotry or the colonial past of Britain, which you mis-spelled as England. I’m well aware of what was done, and the reason I’m aware of it is because there is considerable effort to try and educate on it, via school, subsidised documentaries and case histories from the BBC, and eminently successful historians, of every race and nation, whom are either British themselves or found a home and commercial success in Britain in trying to educate us on the abominations of the past and present, and those voices are amplified in the mainstream print media rather than quashed.",
      "There is no comparison as to what nation is ‘worst’ without a tedious race to the bottom and attempts to trivialise what should never be trivialised. But politely, what is now Ghana does not have a history of rainbows and unicorns. I say this not to say ‘you’re just as bad’ but to say that every nation, hidden it’s dark recesses, has been an arsehole. The more pertinent question is what is your country doing to try and move things forward, and of that, I am at least grateful that Britain does more than post colonial France, and Belgium, and Spain, and Portugal. This is not a source of pride in any way shape or form.",
      "In fact for the most part, I see the country led by morons trying desperately to undo the very small positive steps taken. But the things you know happened account for 13% of our 3000 year history. It’s enough to damn our reputation but doesn’t damn who we are trying to be. We are, after all, the land that has a red cross as a flag because we stole from it from a bigger-boy in the Mediterranean, entirely because we were so repeatedly raided and enslaved that we had to steal the valour of someone who could fight back, until we were able to ourselves.",
      "We are the fans that march behind a song written by left wing comedians and scousers, about the improbability of hope and tacit acceptance that we could be successful but likely won’t be. The nation that has three lions on our badge rather than one, like Scotland, as it’s a crest of compromise. Just because we have taken against something, and are (in my case) white, doesn’t mean the opinion is invalid or due to bigotry.",
      "And frankly, when a site for chatting about the nonsense of football becomes an exercise of thought pieces on colonialism you have to acknowledge that the beautiful game is being stolen by arseholes with political ends. That the fact we are talking about this should emphasise this is not what football should be about.\nTom G",
      "",
      "Loving the Lionesses\nLike Matt (Gooner exiled in Essex) I watched the England Wales women’s Euro game rather than the Chelsea PSG men’s Club World Cup final. Largely because I had absolutely no interest in the two teams playing in the Club World Cup final.",
      "I don’t support any of the teams that played in the Club World Cup but I support England at that means supporting any England team be it the men’s senior England team, the U21 men’s England team and the senior women’s England team. I too found it refreshing and in general I find watching the women’s England team refreshing and more enjoyable than watching the men’s England team. This is because with the women’s team there isn’t the toxicity that surrounds the men’s team.",
      "No abuse directed at the players if they underperform, no racism aimed at the black players from knuckle dragging “fans” and no vitriol from the English media. Also the female England players private lives aren’t subjected to anything like the same level of scrutiny as their male counterparts so we don’t get who their dating as a media distraction. And in general there isn’t the same media circus that you get with the men’s team come every major tournament where everything including what the players had for breakfast is poured over and debated. It’s all so refreshing, more enjoyable and is about the football rather than anything else.\nDan, London"

      "Losing Thomas Frank is an enormous blow. We simply don’t know just how vital he was to Brentford’s success at establishing themselves in the top flight because he’s just always been there quietly doing an excellent job in surroundings where he felt enormously comfortable.",
      "We’re about to find out both whether he can flourish at an objectively sillier club, but also whether the estimable Brentford project can work without him.",
      "We’d suggest that would be an easier task had they not also lost Christian Norgaard to Arsenal, with Bryan Mbeumo soon and then very possibly Yoane Wissa and very possibly more besides also following Frank out of the exit door.",

      "Handing the reins to a set-piece coach who has never managed at first-team level just feels like a gamble of startling proportions in the circumstances. It’s the sort of person you hand the interim role when you are left with no choice midway through the season, which begs the question who exactly Brentford will hand the interim role when they are left with no choice midway through the season.",

      "16) Arsenal (17)\nThe wait for a striker nears its end, but the mood around Arsenal remains febrile. As ever, the challenge with Arsenal is not to be swayed too far in either direction by the gobshitery of their loudest and most ridiculous supporters, but there’s a clear sense of unease.",
      "The #NoToMadueke behaviour was not that of a well football club at peace with itself. For all the absence of self-awareness that so frequently defines the most terminally and noisily online of the club’s fans, Arsenal know, don’t they? They very clearly know that they can’t have another year of moral victories or winning on xG or watching other clubs gleefully celebrate winning assorted pots and pans while they sit gloomily in the corner explaining why that trophy they themselves never won is beneath their attention, actually.",
      "This has to be the season where all the undoubted progress and growth and development of the last three years arrives at something tangible. And that’s obviously going to be very difficult.",
      "One of our very earliest predictions for next season was that Arsenal would win the league if they got the striker situation sorted, and we are going to stubbornly stick to that. We don’t know whether Arsenal actually do have it in them to deliver that title after all this time, but we are very confident that somewhere along the way they will be top of the mood rankings and somewhere along the way they will be bottom. And that’s the real quiz, isn’t it? Well, no.",
      "The problem for Arsenal’s threepeat runners-up is that a glance around suggests a league that is only getting harder to win, not easier. From having only City to worry about – and that was enough, frankly – Arsenal now very obviously have Liverpool to think about and on current evidence very possibly Chelsea as well. And these are all clubs for whom winning trophies remains a far more straightforward habit to maintain than it is for the Gunners.",

      "Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez were exceptional members of a high-class back four for Bournemouth last year, and while the hundred million-odd quid the Cherries have banked for the pair is welcome it’s still a desperately hard task to fill two gaps of that size in one summer. Even for a club that’s pretty good at rolling with these punches. And there’s still lingering talk of Illia Zabarnyi heading to Paris as well, talk that their humbling at the hands of Chelsea is unlikely to silence.",
      "But they’ve kept their manager which didn’t feel certain at the start of the summer, and Antoine Semenyo’s new contract amid interest from plenty of big fish is another significant boon. Feels like a big finish to the transfer window might well be needed, though.",
      "",
      "14) Burnley (15)\nDespite finishing miles ahead of eventual play-off winners Sunderland and right alongside Leeds at the top of last season’s Championship, it does feel slightly like Burnley are the forgotten member of the promoted trio right now.",
      "Leeds are Leeds and Sunderland are doing all sorts of wildly eye-catching transfer business, while Burnley appear to just be going about things more quietly. That might well be entirely prudent, of course, and by September their less flashy antics might well look by far the most sensible of the promoted clubs.",
      "But fundamentally we do not trust Scott Parker to be manager of a Premier League team. We are going to need to see some pretty clear evidence he’s going to be better at it this time around, and until such time as we see that evidence we will have to keep Burnley’s mood down.",
      "That said, they do have the boost that all three promoted teams have this summer: so many seemingly settled established teams being picked to the bone.",
      "",
      "13) Sunderland (14)\nThe loss of Jobe Bellingham is a shame and robs the Premier League of an interesting and unexpected storyline, while offering instead the ‘Will a Bellingham ever actually play in the Premier League?’ quandary, but Sunderland’s summer activity certainly hints at a club that if they are going to go back down are going to do kicking and screaming. No quietly accepting their fate for a club who’ve brought in six players from around Europe.",
      "At the very, very least they should avoid Southampton’s season-long struggle to avoid Derby-based ignominy and that’s a start, isn’t it?",
      "Doesn’t hurt to see a division that suddenly contains a lot more plausible relegation rivals than appeared the case at the time of Sunderland’s shock play-off success.",

      "12) Wolves (8)\nIt is the time of year when we instinctively and reflexively start to worry about Wolves because they start every season like absolute muck.",
      "And that’s true even in summers where they haven’t sold a couple of their best players as well.",
      "We might have felt a bit different had they carried that winning run they had last spring all the way to the finish line, but once they no longer actually needed any further points they simply stopped getting them in the final four games and while that didn’t matter for 24/25, Wolves are the one team we would particularly worry about carrying that drearier form all the way through the summer with them before depositing it with big trumpy dump in a one-win-in-nine games start to the season.",
      "It is the history of the Wolves.",
      "",
      "11) Nottingham Forest (9)\nInteresting club, are Forest. By the end of last season there was a distinct whiff of entitlement around the place. Sure, you’ve got a couple of European Cups in the trophy cabinet and that’s undeniably something that can inflate the ol’ ego a bit but while the rest of us were going “Cor look at Forest having a brilliant season” there was definitely a sense of some (by no means all) their fans not quite enjoying it as much as they really should have done because to them this was nothing more than the restoring of the club to its rightful status.",
      "That’s fine, but it does also mean that as well as not fully enjoying the good times you can end up getting more miffed than is healthy about the less good, and while the harrumphing at the sale of Anthony Elanga and still-likely departure of Morgan Gibbs-White is understandable, the general air of “How can this thing that happens to all clubs outside the cosseted elite be happening to us, Nottingham Forest?” doesn’t seem like it’s the sort of thing that can end with anyone feeling good about anything really.",
      "There’s something similar about the extent of apparent behind-the-scenes lobbying Forest have done to get themselves Crystal Palace’s place in the Europa League. Sure, it makes sense to want to be in the Europa League, but the Conference felt like a tournament Forest would have a genuine shot at winning in a way that even the current even-Spurs-can-win-it watered-down Europa League doesn’t.",
      "We do also very much enjoy the idea of contracts having secret release clauses the very activation of which constitutes a breach of said secrecy, but not really sure how well that’s going to actually stand up in practice.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester City (19)\nWe’re as excited as you to find out whether City’s embarrassing early exit from the Club World Cup constitutes the latest stage in the decline of the Guardiola Empire or will, come May, have been fully reimagined as the blessing in disguise that allows them to reclaim their Premier League title as Chelsea wilt on the run-in.",
      "The important thing, of course, is that in and of itself not doing much at the Club World Cup doesn’t really matter. Had that happened on the back of a more customary City season in which the Premier League and probably a cheeky domestic cup had been safely trousered nobody would bat an eyelid.",
      "But another failed shot at silverware on the back of the first genuinely worrying season since Guardiola really got going at City means it does catch the eye slightly more.",
      "Feels like City are a side who could do with making a statement start to the season, and the worry for them is that fast starts are not their great strength. Very good starts and then unimprovably relentlessly opposition-spirit-crushing finishes have been the modus operandi for Pep’s teams.",
      "But last year was one to puncture the idea that City will always come decisively good down the home straight, and once that kind of aura is lost its powerfully hard to restore.",
      "What City have done is continue with the rebuild that began in January and it’s certainly going to be exciting to watch a new-look post-De Bruyne City in action. But we’ve not been this uncertain about them before a ball’s been kicked for several years.",
      "Which is all the evidence we need to know they will be 12 points clear by November and win the league by 20 points in the end while spinning effortlessly upon the very tips of their cocks.",
      "",
      "9) Everton (11)\nGenuine question: has anyone seen or heard anything at all to do with or about Everton over the last couple of months? We’re genuinely struggling. They just seem to be there in the background, like the whole club is just on the backburner in this empty space between leaving Goodison and arriving at their new stadium, at which point everyone once again notices them.",
      "That’s fine, but it does leave us with not a huge amount to say here really. They’ll probably be fine, won’t they? Yeah, they’ll probably be fine. New stadium looks nice and that. Always exciting until you realise you’ve accidentally set yourselves back 10 years on the pitch to pay for it, but still always exciting.",
      "",
      "8) Aston Villa (7)\nThe entirely unrelated and coincidentally timed sale of their women’s team to themselves appears to have kept PSR wolves from doors for now and allows Villa to continue for now looking to a positive future without having to do anything as unpleasant as sell some players like Newcastle did last year, the damn fools.",
      "That said, they’ve not really actually done anything particularly proactive in the transfer market either. Not even a mutually beneficial signing of a toddler from Everton or anything. Very disappointing, and on a vaguely serious note potentially slightly problematic for a team still right on the limit when it comes to the financial rules and who have waved goodbye to a few loan players who really did become quite important during the second half of last season.",
      "These feel like nervous times for Villa, a club that teeters on the divide between two possible futures. Missing out on the Champions League as agonisingly as they did really might turn out to have been far more significant for Villa than it would have been for anyone else in that situation.",
      "",
      "7) Fulham (13)\nFeels like it’s been a very, very quiet summer at Fulham thus far. And a quick look around at the teams sharing Premier League mid-table real estate with the Cottagers last season suggests that quiet and boring might be just the ticket this summer.",
      "Sure, we all like seeing lots of new signings come through the door and at some point it would seem like a very good idea for Fulham to join in with that particular endeavour but for the upwardly-mobile middle-class this appears to be a summer where standing still might not actually be the worst net result.",
      "",
      "6) Brighton (10)\nWe’ve all been here before and we’ve all said it before but is Joao Pedro finally the point at which Chelsea sign a player from Brighton and Brighton don’t instantly by some alchemic magic still manage to get better as a result?",
      "Feels like he’s the first player to tread that well-worn path over recent years who feels both a massive gain for Chelsea and a huge hard-to-replace loss for Brighton.",
      "And that’s a bit of a buzzkill, we fear, for a club who already have a little bit of rueing to do about the way last season ended up with them just outside Europe and paying a heavy price for an on-brand mid-season slump.",
      "There’s nothing hugely bollard-grabbing about the business Brighton have done on the incoming side this summer, but that’s fine because that’s always the way with Brighton. They do transfers that only turn out to have always looked brilliant in hindsight, which is very much the right way to go about these things.",
      "",
      "5) Crystal Palace (2)\nMight eventually be able to channel the current sense of anger and injustice at being booted from the Europa League into another fine season, but for now it is just anger and injustice.",
      "Hard right now to escape the sense that Palace are paying an enormously heavy price for an administrative cock-up while actual multi-club empires are able to circumvent the rules with ease and disdain.",
      "And really how much of a cock-up even was it? Forest were able to take steps to dodge the multi-club bullet before the March deadline because by then it was pretty clear that Europe was a near certainty. Palace had no such certainty.",
      "Nothing can take away from Palace’s joy at finally landing that first piece of major silverware with a famous FA Cup win over Manchester City, but there is a bitter taste now. They’ll just have to go and win the Conference, we guess, while sticking pins in their Evangelos Marinakis dolls.",
      "To which end (the winning the Conference part, not the doll part) they could also really do with not selling all their best players this summer if they can possibly avoid it.",
      "",
      "4) Leeds (5)\nIt’s not so much what Leeds themselves are doing this summer as what’s happening to an awful lot of the teams that they might consider among their potential rivals that creates such cause for optimism.",
      "There is clearly further work needed on the squad before it can be truly said to be one that has a genuine crack at survival, but the potential bottom half of the Premier League in 25/26 looks decidedly weaker now than it did in May.",
      "Leeds also have lovely, lovely kits for their return to the top flight and while some may consider it irrelevant because at the end of the day it is, it can still provide a welcome midsummer boost in those long barren football-less wastelands.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle United (3)\nWe thought all was broadly well on Tyneside, but then the early Sack Race odds that have Eddie Howe nowhere near as safe as we expected have slightly thrown us for a loop.",
      "What are we missing here? Champions League football. No apparent need to or significant risk of selling any of their many very excellent players – most notably of course Alexander Isak.",
      "Is it just the continued inability to just buy their way to absolutely anything and everything? Feels like that shouldn’t be so surprising now.",
      "We can only really see two reasons for any real lack of cheer at Newcastle right now. One, the fact that the four teams who finished above them last season all look like being stronger next year. And two, adidas have made a complete bollocks of their kit for next season.",
      "But overall, we’d still be feeling pretty chipper if we were Newcastle. All things considered.",
      "READ: Ekitike among record signings which will be made this summer after beautiful five-word Ornstein message",
      "",
      "2) Tottenham (1)\nTo those outside Spurs the sheer sense of cathartic relief that still flows around this club after ending that trophy drought may be hard to fathom.",
      "It’s exhausting being the butt of every joke, and that was Spurs’ lot for years and years and years. They are now free of it, at least for a little bit and there is a clear sense of revelling in it.",
      "The club’s official shop is now selling hoodies and t-shirts with ‘Spursy’ and ‘Lads it’s Tottenham’ on. They are one unconvincing 2-1 Champions League win over Juventus away from adding a range of ‘It is the history of the Tottenham’ merch to the burgeoning collection. Their social media content in the aftermath of victory over Manchester United in Bilbao was the 2025 version of Father Ted’s acceptance speech.",
      "It matters. It matters because it strikes to the very heart of being a fan and how you experience it. Spurs’ renewed status as trophy winners has meant that even the initial noise and anger over the brutal sacking of Ange Postecoglou on charges of delivering a succulent 17th-placed finish while ending that trophy drought has now died down.",
      "Sure, that noise will return soon enough if Thomas Frank finds life harder outside of Brentford’s very specific and very different environment, but there are also plenty of encouraging signs around Spurs’ transfer business this summer as they seek to avoid a repeat of last season’s league fiasco in a season where, for the first time in so, so long, they enter into it without the banter monkey upon their back.",
      "And to make things even better for Spurs, the banter monkey has travelled only a few miles down the road to find his latest host.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea (6)\nThey do keep getting cross with us for pointing out that the Club World Cup wasn’t real, but they are absolutely right to revel in it. Revel they must and revel they will in being able to call themselves the first halfway legitimately crowned world champions club football has ever had.",
      "The myriad and often nauseating flaws of the tournament itself, on-field and off, that culminated in Donald Trump apparently believing he’d won the title because he’s just so brilliant at everything can vex and agitate the rest of us, but Chelsea can just enjoy it while the rest of us chew it raw.",
      "And, crucially, the thinly veiled criticisms about how they Southgated their way to the final from the markedly easier side of the draw all melt away in the face of the manner in which they swept away PSG, pretty much everyone’s current idea of the actual best team in the world, in the final.",
      "That was a performance and result that would make any fan giddy. It doesn’t matter whether you think that particular tournament matters or not. The possibilities that have suddenly appeared for a Chelsea side that has underperformed for several years now are intoxicating.",
      "They have had an excellent summer in which their transfer business has, dare we say it, even looked like it might have a plan beyond just stockpiling wingers on eight-year contracts. They’ve bought well and are even looking like they might be selling well.",
      "For the first time in a while, they look like a proper team to be taken entirely seriously. One that can and should compete for all the undoubtedly meaningful trophies available to them next season.",
      "It’s worth remembering that Enzo Maresca had them in a title fight for far longer than anyone really expected last season, and there is now the very real prospect that this could be the latest team given the all-important task that is now so vital to English football’s banter drive: beating Arsenal into second place."

      "The England forward remains determined to leave this summer, and Barcelona is the move he wants. Rashford is said to be “very keen” to joining the La Liga side, with Fabrizio Romano suggesting he’s effectively waiting for them to make it happen.",
      "But the Spanish giants are only in a position to offer a loan deal, and that’s not something Utd are prepared to entertain. Barcelona’s financial situation has already prevented them from registering top target Nico Williams, and although Rashford remains of interest, he is no longer viewed as a priority.",
      "Reports in Spain claim the only deal under consideration is a loan, preferably with no obligation to buy. Man Utd, for their part, are holding out for a sale and have no interest in temporary solutions.",

      "We’re still waiting on some stragglers and official releases, so do check back for further updates, but here are our objectively correct rankings of the Premier League’s 25/26 home kits for you to enjoy and not get unnecessarily cross about.",
      "Remember, these are the correct opinions.",
      "Big themes for this season include: round collars, local ‘inspiration’ and more immediately obvious divergence between ‘replica’ and ‘authentic’ versions of shirts. We’re not really happy about any of those themes, if we’re honest.",
      "Away and third kits to follow in due course but there are still just far too many unknowns and uncertainties there for any kind of solid ranking, and as you know we wouldn’t want to just put our name to any ranking that was half-baked. Ahem. On we go.",
      "",
      "TBC. Sunderland\nWe’ve seen a few leaks and they’re mainly terrible, but no confirmation yet for what is actually the kit. It’s hummel, so it should be good. Which is the main reason we’re remaining too sceptical to rank based on those current upsetting leaks.",
      "",
      "19) Burnley\nUtter woke nonsense, we’re afraid to report. Burnley and Castore were so busy coming up with a shirt that meets the apparent current requirements to ‘taking inspiration from the local area’ that they completely forgot to take inspiration from an actual Burnley shirt.",
      "Update your phone wallpaper to celebrate our 2025/26 Home kit 🥳 pic.twitter.com/g6w7rcNGOE",
      "— Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) July 4, 2025",
      "The marketing bullsh*t manifests in a vaguely topographical pattern designed to represent the fact that East Lancashire, famously and uniquely, has some hills in it.",
      "But they’ve completely failed to put anywhere close to enough blue on here. Yes, Burnley have in the past dispensed with their traditional blue sleeves, but we don’t care for it and it will never look right.",
      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

      "And now we don’t know at all. We’re not saying this is bad, we’re saying we’re not sure whether it’s bad or brilliant, and it’s that total lack of conviction that has rattled us into the shadow realm. If we can no longer be sure about sashes on football kits, than what certainties do we have left to cling to?",
      "We don’t think we’re being dramatic when we say this feels like it might be a harbinger of absolute doom for all mankind. Especially in a year that has already featured Spurs winning a trophy and the MCC allowing members not to wear jackets in the Lord’s pavilion just because it was a bit warm.",
      "We expect confirmation that the ravens are leaving the Tower any moment.",
      "And it’s not even like City have plucked a sash from nowhere either. Sure, it’s never been on the home kit before, but they have a proud away-kit sash history that dates well back into the before times of the 1970s and whatnot.",

      "16) Brentford\nA new home shirt is an event in itself after they took the now wildly unusual step of keeping the old one for two years. It’s certainly an interesting one to mark the switch from Umbro to Joma, and while we really want to like it, it’s not quite right.",
      "Let’s start with the good. The red and white cuffs and collar are good, as are the pinstripes at the edge of the main stripes. Well done there.",

      "— Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC) July 4, 2025",
      "We’re not sold on the white sleeves, though. In our view it tilts the balance of red and white too far in favour of white, and not even the primarily red back for the name-sets can quite save that.",
      "Our big problem, though, is the ‘lace-up’ collar detail. Officially, it’s ‘inspired by our original 1925 kit lace design’ but… it’s a bit wanky isn’t it? There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",
      "Just sort of drawing a fake one on sadly reduces a shirt that could have been really good to something approaching a novelty. It’s just a little bit too close to ‘humorous T-shirt with a bow-tie drawn on it’ which is a shame.",
      "",
      "15) Tottenham\nA significant departure this for Tottenham with plenty of non-white areas here. That’s not unusual in itself; what’s unusual is that just as Spurs managers generally alternate in style and tone, so too their home kits operate on a rota switching between all-white (or nearly all-white) and more colourful.",
      "Our new Head Coach 🙌 pic.twitter.com/lS0xDZJMLn",
      "— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) June 18, 2025",
      "Yet after last year’s Kappa-coded full navy blue sleeves comes this effort. Now there’s less navy on this sleeve for sure, but it still constitutes a navy-heavy season, and with plenty of that silvery-blue-gray thrown in for good measure. That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",
      "What we can’t get away from – and no, we can’t fully explain this – is that the specific placement of the navy areas means this shirt is giving Bolton to a distracting degree.",
      "",
      "14) Liverpool\nA return to adidas for Liverpool after many years with Nike and based on the plentiful leaks out there it’s a safety-first start to the rekindled relationship, with a low-risk entirely inoffensive shirt that leans heavily on the 2006/07 classic minus the big ol’ flappy collar.",
      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards, something we expect the away and third kits to do rather more based on the leaked pics we’ve seen so far.",

      "It’s absolutely adequate based on the leaks we’ve seen. While we’re always slightly reluctant to rank on leaks, we’re confident nothing new we could learn about this kit will propel it up or down this list in any significant way.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nWe will always prefer even stripes which puts this latest Bournemouth effort on the back foot from the start. The sand-effect red stripes are already thicker than the black ones here even before further red bordering is added in. A shame, because it’s actually rather good apart from that.",

      "— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) July 15, 2025",
      "We’re not even going to bother looking up the PR spiel as it will only annoy us and instead we’ll just go right ahead and assume the sand motif is once again drawing inspiration from the local area and okay, fine, whatever. The gold trim is nicely understated and swerves all accusations of gaudiness. If the thickness of the stripes were sorted out we’d be very happy with this. Not that they asked or care. Honestly, some people.",
      "",
      "11) Brighton\nNot too sure about the asymmetric collar – something Nike are keen on and seen last year on Spurs’ light blue away kit – but generally speaking it’s a bold and bright Brighton kit that we can all enjoy.",
      "One interesting quirk is that it’s almost entirely inverted from last year’s. That had white sleeves and blue cuffs, while this year it’s blue sleeves and white cuffs. Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",
      "The most exciting thing about Brighton’s kit, though, is that it takes the prestigious award for this season’s most overexcited and unnecessary made-up colour name. Football kit manufacturers rank second only to paint companies in this field, and we are beyond excited to tell you that the little turquoise flashes on the sides of this kit are not in fact just your common or garden turquoise but are in fact Hyper Turq.",

      "",
      "10) Everton\nVery hard to rank until we actually get to see it for real. Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",

      "— Everton (@Everton) June 27, 2025",
      "",
      "9) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "8) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here if the widespread leaks are anything to go by, with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",
      "A source has leaked the 2025/26 Aston Villa Home Kit, It should officially release inside the next month if this is the actual design. pic.twitter.com/wtRVNHSwQe",
      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "6) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

      "We reserve the right to alter this ranking if the actual shirt disappoints, but at this stage we’re very excited about this one.",
      "",
      "4) West Ham\nUmbro have done some fine retro work with West Ham in recent years, and it all comes together here in this shiny and powerfully early 80s effort. Even the BoyleSports logo looks like it’s from 1983.",

      "The striped collars and cuffs are first-rate, and the flashes of blue under the arms are just enough to avoid this falling into the Burnley trap.",
      "Also, while we generally restrict our rankings here to the tops, given the amount of switching and alternate use that goes on with shorts and socks anyway, it is worth noting that West Ham have this year’s best socks, with the stripes of the collar and cuffs deployed simply but expertly.",
      "",
      "3) Wolves\nYes, we like this. That’s a pleasingly modern take on a proper old-fashioned collar, and the whole retro vibe is enhanced by a material that almost looks knitted.",
      "Again, we could be wrong because we’re only at this stage going off pictures rather than real-world information, but it does look like the lads at Sudu have got the colour right this time. Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

      "2) Manchester United\nYour mileage may vary, but personally we’re fans of predominantly black trim on a Manchester United shirt, and that feels even more important this year with Liverpool also back in the adidas fold. You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",

      "— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 1, 2025",
      "This shirt certainly has that, and perhaps our favourite collar of the entire season’s efforts. In a world of plain round collars, United have a double-element v-neck that – and we have no idea whether this is intentional or not but to our mind it’s a bonus – brings to mind the devil’s trident from their badge.",
      "Having praised the black, though, we’re not quite sure at first glance about what seem some very shiny black adidas stripes on the shoulders and sleeves. They’re slightly off-putting – notably on the long-sleeve version.",
      "There’s also a print woven into the sleeves rather than body of the shirt, which is an unusual choice but one that works here. The last United home shirt we can recall with sleeves that differed from the main body of the shirt was 1998/99, and that seemed to work out well for everybody.",
      "The design on the sleeves is, of course, a nod to their stadium because that seems to be what everyone is doing this season. Presumably that means after one wash it will have all holes in it.",

      "A deal is ‘still not imminent’ for Bryan Mbeumo as Man Utd and Brentford continue to negotiate a fee for the forward, according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein.",
      "The Red Devils have made two signings over the summer transfer window with Matheus Cunha arriving from Wolves and Diego Leon joining from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno.",
      "Man Utd are hoping to do lots more transfer business but outgoings are crucial to how many they can bring in with the Red Devils looking to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and more.",
      "The Premier League giants have been bidding for Brentford forward Mbeumo with two offers rejected so far and talks are continuing to get a deal over the line.",
      "However, a report on Monday on Football Transfers claimed that Man Utd have finally ‘reached an agreement with Brentford’ for the signing of Mbeumo.",
      "The website claimed that ‘a major breakthrough was made on Monday morning, sources with knowledge of the situation have informed us’.",
      "READ: Isak next? Ten best signings by Premier League champions obviously dominated by Manchester United",
      "It isn’t made clear how much the agreement is for but it’s claimed that the Bees have been ‘firm in their conviction that Mbeumo is worth around €80 million’.",
      "Football Transfers added: ‘Sources have told us that the last remaining issues between Man Utd and Brentford have been resolved and that the transfer is now in the process of being finalised.’.",
      "However, The Athletic’s Ornstein had a very different view on where the potential transfer is at and he insists ‘the two sides are several million pounds apart’.",
      "Ornstein revealed in The Athletic on Tuesday: ‘The gap between Manchester United and Brentford on their valuation of Bryan Mbeumo remains considerable. The two sides are several million pounds apart.",
      "‘There have been no significant developments over the past couple of weeks, and a deal is still not imminent, but talks continue as United work to complete a move for the Cameroon forward.’",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker insists it will “be very embarrassing” for the Red Devils if they don’t get a deal over the line for Tottenham target Mbeumo.",
      "Parker said: “It’ll be very embarrassing for Manchester United if they can’t get the deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line. That said, I do think they will get the deal done, I think it’s clear that Old Trafford is his preference.",
      "“If they don’t get him, it’ll be down to the club failing to get the deal down, rather than Mbeumo not wanting to go to Old Trafford. Everyone is saying that the pull of Thomas Frank at Tottenham will make him sign there, but he was happy to leave the manager. He wanted to leave Brentford whilst Frank was still in charge.",
      "“We don’t know if Daniel Levy is a fan of his either, he has a big say over the incomings at the football – that said, they do need something in that front line at Spurs. Heung-min Son has lost that sharpness and they’re lacking in that frontline.”",
      "Man Utd are not budging on their valuation of Bryan Mbeumo this summer even if it means moving on to different targets, according to reports.",

    "date": "2025-07-15 08:13:36",
    "source": "football365",
    "body": [
      "Arsenal are on the verge of finally signing a Proper Striker in Viktor Gyokeres and sorting a priority position. Liverpool and Manchester United are next.",
      "",
      "10) Crystal Palace and a centre-half\nWhile most executives at Selhurst Park are busy scouring their emails for old messages from UEFA and preparing for trips to Lausanne in the coming days, Crystal Palace must soon put down their Evangelos Marinakis voodoo dolls and instead focus on squad-building.",
      "There is admittedly less work than might have been expected by mid-July, whichever European competition the Eagles land in.",
      "For all the frenzied speculation surrounding their most prized assets, Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi, Adam Wharton, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Will Hughes remain.",
      "But there is a need for reinforcements and to push on from a position of strength. The central-defensive cupboards are particularly bare and Guehi’s departure feels inevitably whether this summer or next. Sporting must be too busy counting the Viktor Gyokeres pennies to start negotiating over Ousmane Diomande just yet.",
      "",
      "9) Manchester City and a right-back\nPep Guardiola perhaps didn’t realise he had identified his right-back solution for the best part of the next decade when Manchester City spent £50m to sign Kyle Walker in 2017.",
      "The only other players the Spaniard has signed specifically for that position at the Etihad have largely been lapped by that recovery pace: Danilo was only ever a back-up; Yan Couto never played for the club and Issa Kabore might well follow suit; Joao Cancelo was exceptional for a brief time before being ostracised.",
      "Walker described his exit chat with Guardiola as “not very comfortable” but in outlining a desire for new challenges in January, he spared the manager an even less pleasant conversation this summer.",
      "His decline has been pronounced and with the deposed champions embarking on their most ambitious squad revamp since Guardiola’s first, a shiny new right-back feels like The Final Piece of the Puzzle.",
      "",
      "8) Brentford and a forward\nAmong the many ludicrous numbers supporting Spurs’ choice of Thomas Frank as their new manager is this: in summer 2024 Brentford made Ivan Toney their record sale, spent most of the proceeds on Igor Thiago, saw him play 169 minutes last season due to injury and still enjoyed their best goal return in a single top-flight campaign post-Second World War.",
      "Keith Andrews was responsible for many of those as set-piece coach and it could be that his acumen transfers seamlessly to the role of Frank’s replacement as his first senior managerial post.",
      "But the likelihood remains that Brentford will lose either the fourth or sixth highest scorer in the entire 2024/25 Premier League; it would be a surprise if both Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa remained.",
      "Even in the event that attack is kept intact, Brentford need far more up front. Kevin Schade is the only other vaguely proven option in a department which needs Thiago to hit the ground running without knacking his knee.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds and a keeper\nWhen Leeds chairman Paraag Marathe took the unprecedented step of issuing a vote of confidence in a manager who had just earned Premier League promotion, adding that “we are going to build the best squad that we can with every penny that we’re allowed to spend,” supporters might reasonably have expected more than a freebie and £30m worth of defenders.",
      "Unless the plan was for Sean Longstaff to play in net, as a No. 10 and up front, Leeds need considerably more to compete instead of going into the season with a worse squad than that which Sam Allardyce took down two years ago, which is still really weird.",
      "That new keeper is especially pressing after the mistakes of Illan Meslier mounted to the point Karl Darlow had to drag Leeds over the line in the sodding Championship. Just sign Aaron Ramsdale and perpetuate the curse.",
      "",
      "6) Liverpool and a striker\nWith the ludicrous greed of Newcastle extending beyond selfishly keeping Alexander Isak to signing an option on the next rung down of desirable centre-forwards, Liverpool are a handful of steps away from declaring this the season Darwin Nunez finally comes good.",
      "A record of 40 goals and 26 assists in 143 appearances is far from shameful but a team pursuing trophies on four fronts requires far more consistency and reliability than the Uruguayan can offer.",
      "Liverpool could also do with a centre-half or two but ultimately the modern Premier League title race demands for one contender to Need A Proper Striker, and Arsenal are soon to pass on a baton they picked up from Manchester City years ago.",
      "",
      "5) Bournemouth and a centre-half\nAt least Andoni Iraola is aware that Bournemouth “will not find the same player” as Dean Huijsen, although it would be no disaster to identify another defender they are able to sell on for ludicrous profit within a single season.",
      "The sale of the Spain international and Milos Kerkez – and Paris Saint-Germain’s reluctance to meet the asking price – should preclude the exit of Illia Zabarnyi and subsequent extensive rebuild of Bournemouth’s entire central defence.",
      "But Huijsen alone leaves a substantial enough gap for the Cherries to plug, with more capable cover needed too.",
      "",
      "4) Aston Villa and a right-winger\nThe January transfer window gamble did not pay off. It made Champions League qualification a minimum requirement which proved beyond the competence levels of Emi Martinez and Matty Cash to deliver, and only increased the financial strain.",
      "That has been underlined in a deeply uninspiring start to the summer transfer window. Villa probably need to sell before they sign and the £3.5m generated for Kaine Kesler-Hayden doesn’t even cover Yasin Ozcan’s arrival.",
      "They need a right-back. They need at least one centre-half. They need a significant injection of attacking depth, including more options on either side and competition for Ollie Watkins. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were shiny distractions but only ever for so long.",
      "",
      "3) West Ham and a striker\nThe Prophecy dictates that West Ham always need a new striker. From Mido and Benni McCarthy in the first Sullivan and Gold transfer window to Evan Ferguson in the most recent, the East London graveyard of centre-forward hope has been littered with names over the last decade and a half.",
      "It is uncomfortably revealing that their best striker signing in that time was a left-winger plucked from the Championship and eventually repurposed into an unshiftable channel-running nuisance.",
      "Talks are ongoing with Michail Antonio over a contract renewal but Graham Potter needs far more backing, even if Niclas Fullkrug takes a break from his stint as irascible pundit to nod in a few goals.",
      "",
      "2) Everton and a right-winger\nThe signing of Thierno Barry has addressed one problem position but with a first-team squad currently comprising of about 18 players, Dave can afford to dither no more.",
      "Everton are especially light on numbers in defence, midfield and attack, while Jordan Pickford could probably do with some company too.",
      "But the most shocking aspect of Everton’s squad composition is that Jack Harrison was on loan from Leeds all this sodding time. Can Seamus Coleman play a bit further forward?",
      "",
      "1) Manchester United and a striker\nRuben Amorim has already been failed yet again by Manchester United, who by mid-July have only been able to generate money in the summer transfer window through sell-on clauses on players they offloaded long ago.",
      "Some might prefer to ask questions of how Anthony Elanga and Alvaro Fernandez have found themselves at Champions League sides after being deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford, but Manchester United having the foresight to ensure they were covered in that event is a necessary sign of growth and sensibility.",
      "Yet it will barely touch the sides of where that budget needs to go, especially if Brentford continue to inconsiderately want their money’s worth for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Even beyond another addition of a high-performing forward operating in the bottom half, Amorim needs someone capable of leading the line. It feels like a role painfully beyond the current capabilities of Rasmus Hojlund and while Joshua Zirkzee has handled the weight of the shirt far better, the Dutchman’s goal return isn’t close to what the position demands.",
      "The dream scenario is still on: Gyokeres struggles for Arsenal while Benjamin Sesko excels at Manchester United."

      "Barcelona make Marcus Rashford their top left-wing target, according to Sky in Germany;  Barca are \"prepared to go all-in\" for the Manchester United forward; interest comes after Liverpool rejected Barca's advances for Luis Diaz, and Nico Williams' new deal at Athletic Club",

      "Friday 11 July 2025 19:41, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is now Barcelona's clear left-wing target, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Barca are expected to try and agree a deal and are \"prepared to go all-in\".",
      "This is because Liverpool have rejected their advances for Luis Diaz, and Nico Williams has signed a new deal at Athletic Club.",
      "The forward has returned to Carrington despite being offered extra time off and is training away from the first team, using the medical and rehab facilities.",
      "The 27-year-old is among five Man Utd players who can explore a potential move away after expressing a desire to leave.",
      "Matheus Cunha has taken the No 10 shirt from Rashford, who said he wanted a \"new challenge\" before joining Aston Villa for the second half of last season.",
      "There have been no official offers for Rashford after he returned from his loan at Villa.",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did two weeks ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",

      "Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.",

      "Both clubs have been made aware by United what fee it would take to sign Sancho - believed to be £25m, with the sides both discussing terms with the England international's representatives.",
