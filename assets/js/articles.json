      "Former Liverpool and Man United star Michael Owen doesn't think that Marcus Rashford will leave Old Trafford insisting he doesn't believe any talk of the forward moving on",
      "Michael Owen says he doesn't believe the 'b*****ks' surrounding the future of Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rashford underwent a difficult season with United and has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford after failing to make the squad for Euro 2024, with fans and pundits speculating that he could seek to reignite his career at a new club. However, former Red Devil Owen isn't entertaining any of the hearsay and firmly believes Rashford will be lining up at United next season.",
      "‌Owen, speaking to BoyleSports, who will offer early payout on EURO 2024 matches this summer, said: \"Rashford won't go, I'm sure of it, he's Manchester through and through. The whole club is a struggle, but he has it in his locker.\" The ex-Real Madrid goal-scorer conceded that there was a chance Rashford could end up playing his football elsewhere but is not convinced all the elements come together for any club to take a punt on the 26-year-old.\"He might leave but his value is so high, who would pay it?\" Owen said, \"They might be thinking, is his attitude right? Is he in great form? I don't see how it can all come together at the moment.\" Owen even hinted that PSG could take advantage of Rashford's uncertain situation at United and swoop for the striker but admitted he just can't see it happening and preferred to put it down to the rumour mill.",
      "\"There was talk of PSG but I can't see that. Who can afford him? And would Man Utd want him to go, particularly with a new manager?\" Owen said, \"I just don't believe all this b*****ks that goes round all the time at this part of the year, it never happens.\"",
      "Rashford was in and out of the United squad as the club endured its worst English top-flight season in 30 years and as a result of his form, Gareth Southgate handed out the crushing blow of excluding him from his 33-man preliminary squad ahead of the Three Lions' European Championships campaign in Germany. Rashford's future could perhaps be in further doubt after the announcement that United are to keep faith with under-fire manager Erik ten Hag for next season.",
      "However, any doubt of where Rashford, allegiances lie was put to bed after he uploaded a picture of himself in floods of tears after Manchester United won the FA Cup. in May The photo posted on Instagram also included the caption: 'That's what the club means to me'.",
      "Owen addressed the sensational headlines that can plague this time of the football calendar and how constant talk can often come to nothing. Making parallels with Rashford's situation, Owen referenced how the build-up to big tournaments is often soured with negative press that rarely comes true.",
      "Owen said: \"This time of year is hilarious. Two or three months before every World Cup there is this big crisis everyone talks about. When the World Cup was in South America there were these killer mosquitos that were going to kill everyone, then one of the next ones was the stadiums not getting built and so on. Then lo and behold they are brilliant World Cups.\"",
      "\"Football is the same, with about five or six games to go, all the teams doing poorly get numerous articles of big clearouts. They say it every single year and the reality is two players go and you have barely heard of them.\"",

      "YouTuber IShowSpeed, known for his love of Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United, has faced plenty of controversial moments since becoming an online star and rapper",
      "Internet sensation IShowSpeed has been swarmed by SWAT teams and set off fireworks in his bedroom during his controversial rise to success.",
      "IShowSpeed, real name Darren Jason Watkins Jr, came to wider prominence among football fans due to his obsession with Cristiano Ronaldo. The 19-year-old infamously featured on Sky Sports in November 2022 as he attempted to meet his idol.",
      "Sky Sports deleted traces of IShowSpeed’s segment after historical misogynistic comments emerged but this did not slow his success. Watkins subsequently revealed getting a tattoo of the forward, as well as dedicating a song to the former Manchester United hero.",
      "The United fan boasts a combined 52 million subscribers across YouTube and TikTok, having initially gone viral for his live streams on Twitch. Here is a closer look at the YouTuber’s rise to fame and most controversial moments.",
      "Who is IShowSpeed?",
      "IShowSpeed created his first YouTube channel in 2016 but it was not until 2020 that he began to earn a number of subscribers. Clips of his streams began circulating on TikTok and Speed reached one million subscribers in June 2021, with his audience growing at an astonishing rate.",
      "He moved to Los Angeles with fellow streamer Adin Ross and released his first rap single in 2021. In the last year, Watkins has fought KSI in a charity boxing sparring match. The internet personality also featured at Wrestlemania 40 in April, appearing in a Prime bottle costume during Logan Paul’s match with Kevin Owens and WWE legend Randy Orton.",
      "Fireworks, SWAT team and other controversies",
      "He once marked US Independence Day by setting off a Pikachu firework in his bedroom. Believing it to be a firecracker, Speed was surprised when the Pokemon began firing multiple fireworks and shouted to his mother for help during a live stream. The fire service was called, though Watkins repeated the stunt the following year.",
      "Watkins’ live streams have also seen the YouTuber interrupted by SWAT teams because of hoax calls to law enforcement by trolls. After receiving false information, armed police have twice shown up to Watkins’ address in an attempt to apprehend IShowSpeed.",
      "In August 2023, Speed accidentally flashed his penis to 25k viewers as a result of a jumpscare. The clip went viral on social media but the accidental nature meant that YouTube opted against taking further action.",
      "The Three Lions are among the favourites to win this summer's Euro 2024 tournament and you can get your hands on the brand new Nike home and away kits before the first whistle.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo obsession",
      "Watkins was already a star before his adoration of Ronaldo became a notable part of his online persona. Having travelled to Old Trafford, Craven Cottage and the Qatar World Cup, it was not until June 2023 that IShowSpeed finally met Ronaldo after a 3-0 win for Portugal over Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
      "A year earlier, Speed had released a song titled, ‘Ronaldo (Sewey)’, as well as a single in honour of the last World Cup, both of which commanded millions of views on YouTube. In January 2023, the influencer revealed a tattoo portrait of Ronaldo on his arm.",
      "Despite his idol leaving United, Watkins has remained a fan of the Red Devils and live-streamed himself at Wembley during their recent FA Cup triumph. He has also made a name for himself in charity football matches, notably whipping referee Mark Clattenburg with his shirt after seeing a goal disallowed for offside and putting in a controversial slide tackle on former AC Milan and Real Madrid star Kaka.",
      "E-dating scandal and misogynistic comments",
      "In December 2021, IShowSpeed participated in a livestream e-dating show. Watkins was the first player to be eliminated after making threatening comments to a female participant, later rejoining the stream to fire further slurs at the contestant. The incident led IShowSpeed to be banned from Twitch for \"sexual coercion or intimidation\". His ban was reportedly revoked last year.",
      "A few months later, a Twitch clip of Watkins resurfaced, telling a female gamer to “Get off the f****** game and do your husband's dishes.\" This led him to be banned from playing Valorant and all other Riot Games titles. IShowSpeed apologised for his comments and claimed that he had received racist comments from other players that day, suggesting that this had contributed towards his behaviour.",

      "All it takes is one bad season for a player's transfer value to significantly decrease, as evidenced by the top 10 biggest price tag decreases over the last year",
      "Manchester United winger Antony is joint-top of a list of players with the greatest transfer value decreases last season.",
      "The 24-year-old endured a difficult 2023/24 campaign, registering only five goal contributions across his 38 appearances in all competitions. He's also got the weight of the £86million fee United paid for him hanging over his head.",
      "They look unlikely to recoup anywhere near that sum if they decide to sell him this summer, with Transfermarkt now estimating him to be worth €25million (£21m). That's a drop of €35m (£29.5m) from July 2023.",
      "And it's only matched by France forward Randal Kolo Muani, who joined PSG from Eintracht Frankfurt in a €90m (£76m) transfer last summer. His proposed market value has fallen from €80m (£67m) to €45m (£38m).",
      "In third place is Neymar, who made a €90m (£76m) move of his own to the Saudi Pro League's Al-Hilal. That was an overpayment compared to the €60m (£50.5m) he was estimated to be worth - which has now halved.",
      "An ACL injury which has ruled the 32-year-old out of action since October will have contributed to that. Wesley Fofana of Chelsea has been sidelined for a whole year with the same problem.",
      "As a result, his valuation has also dropped by €30m (£25m) to €25m (£21m). Tottenham's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg follows in fifth, seeing his price tag drop by €27m (£23m) from €45m (£38m) to €18m (£15m).",
      "That will be mainly because his contract in north London is approaching its final year. There's a four-way tie in sixth place between Joshua Kimmich, Reece James, Mason Mount and Joao Cancelo, all with €25m (£21m) decreases.",
      "Kimmich has gone from €75m (£63m) to €50m (£42m), as like Hojbjerg his deal with Bayern Munich expires in 2025. James' repeated injury woes, which kept him in the treatment room for much of the season again, mean he's fallen from €65m (£55m) to €40m (£34m).",
      "Mount, who United surprisingly paid £60m to Chelsea for last summer, has dropped from the €60m (£50.5m) mark to €35m (£29.5m) after his own injury-hit season. And Cancelo, who was on loan at Barcelona from Manchester City, saw his halve from €50m (£42m).",
      "Rounding out the top 10 of the greatest decreases is Marco Verratti, who after joining Qatari side Al-Arabi from PSG in September in a €45m (£38m) move has seen his €40m (£34m) estimation also cut in half.",

      "But in addition to his time playing for the likes of his boyhood club Manchester United, Real Madrid and L.A Galaxy, David quickly created Brand Beckham with the help of his popstar wife Victoria Beckham.",
      "His high-profile relationship off the pitch and his exceptional performance on it made him one of the most marketable sports stars globally.

His bond with his former Red Devils teammates is demonstrated through his co-ownership of Salford City alongside them. However, he isn't the only member of the legendary Class of '92 - the six footballers who rose from Manchester United's academy to become global stars - to have accumulated a fortune. Below, we examine the net worth of 'Fergie's Fledglings', three decades after they first made their mark...",

      "Beckham's former right-wing partner is one of Manchester's most prominent advocates, consistently investing in the city over the years. He has held property in the North West city since he was 21 and launched his 'Relentless' business empire in 2015.",
      "Now, he's estimated to be worth a cool £20 million, with his business success spanning ventures like Salford City and GG Hospitality, which constructed Hotel Football in Manchester. He also kick-started the UA92 University alongside his Class of '92 mates and even appeared in the latest series of BBC business show Dragon's Den.",

From a business point of view, he has also invested in the Scholes Gym in Oldham, which has saw him sink £500,000 into its coffers. The former England star is said to be worth an estimated £20 million.",

He would then be handed the opportunity to manage his country in 2018, a role he would fulfil for the next four years. As a result of his business ventures, which include GG Hospitality, alongside Gary Neville, and Salford City, as well as his lucrative playing and coaching career, he is estimated to be worth £50 million.",

      "Manchester United have lodged their first bid to buy top target Jarrad Branthwaite, although their offer of just £35million up front has been scoffed at by Everton. After agreeing personal terms with the 21-year-old defender, United hope to capitalise on Everton's well-documented financial woes, but a move from rivals Arsenal could dramatically change the landscape and put the Toffees in a much stronger bargaining position.",
      "That's because Arsenal have made contact to sign Branthwaite's team-mate, Amadou Onana, with the Gunners told to pay at least £50m. Should that deal be completed by June 30, that'd likely be enough for Everton to avoid any further sanctions from the Premier League and hold out even longer to try and keep hold of Branthwaite.",

      "The 26-year-old has been linked with a summer exit as he aims to secure first team football. Nothing is set in stone, though, and he said reports of a Newcastle switch were news to him.",
      "\"No footballer wants to not play,\" Ramsdale told talkSPORT in the lead-up to England's Euros opener. \"I’ve had a tough year personally not playing and I never want to do that again.\"",
      "Aston Villa will tear up Philippe Coutinho's contract to allow him to rejoin Vasco da Gama, it has been claimed.",
      "Coutinho joined Villa from Barcelona in 2022 but found opportunities hard to come by after Steven Gerrard - the manager who brought him to Villa Park - was dismissed. He spent last season on loan at Qatari club Al-Duhail but now looks set for a permanent exit.",
      "The Brazil international was once one of the most expensive players in world football when he left Liverpool for Barcelona in 2018. That £142million move was far from a success, though, with Barca taking a significant hit when selling him on four years later.",
      "Now, things appear to be going full circle. Coutinho began his career with Vasco before moving to Europe as a teenager and now looks set to return to the Rio de Janeiro club."

      "Now aged 60, McClair looks completely different to the player who scored an impressive 31 goals in his first season with the Red Devils. The Lanarkshire-born star was spotted in 2023 enjoying a pint in a Manchester pub named The Gold Cup.",

      "He finally had the opportunity to represent his country on the big stage at the 1992 European Championships, where he scored in a 3-0 win over the CIS (formerly USSR), following losses to Germany and the Netherlands. He hung up his boots at Motherwell in 1998.",

A week's stay in the Maxx Royal Belek's deluxe accommodation costs up to £6,400 per night, though cheaper suites can become available for less than £1,000.",

      "Manchester United decided to stick with Erik ten Hag after much deliberation but have stripped down the Dutchman's influence on recruitment for the summer transfer window",
      "Manchester United have started the summer transfer window with a limited budget of £50million, meaning that Erik ten Hag and co. will need to do some wheeling and dealing.",
      "Ten Hag has been given the go-ahead to continue as United manager after club chiefs including co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe spent two-and-a-half weeks deliberating over his future. Ratcliffe and other senior executives even met with multiple candidates to replace the Dutchman, although settled on giving Ten Hag the start of next season to prove himself.",
      "Now the Red Devils can focus on recruitment, with plenty of ins and outs expected before transfer deadline day on August 30. Sales will be key in funding new signings, with only young trio Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund deemed untouchable from United's current squad.",
      "For Casemiro, Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood, however, it's a different story. Casemiro is being courted by Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr, who if last summer is anything to go by would be willing to give United a healthy sum of cash.",
      "Meanwhile, Greenwood is almost certain to leave Old Trafford either permanently or via another loan after spending the 2023-24 season with Getafe. Italian giants Juventus have shown interest and reportedly submitted a £40million bid this week.",
      "Sancho would likely command a similar fee, as Borussia Dortmund - who he spent the second half of last term on loan with - are keen to sign him on a permanent basis. Dortmund don't have cash to burn but know that Sancho and Ten Hag's broken relationship puts them in a strong bargaining position.",
      "Peripheral members of Ten Hag's squad such as Victor Lindelof, Christian Eriksen and Donny van de Beek, are also on the chopping block, each with 12 months left on their respective contracts.",
      "The transfer window officially opened on Friday morning, hours after it emerged that United had agreed personal terms with the representatives of top target Jarrad Branthwaite. A fee still needs to be agreed with Everton, who'll only consider selling Branthwaite if they receive a 'mega offer'.",
      "Should United sign the 21-year-old, he'd likely slot in at centre-back next to Lisandro Martinez. Branthwaite is predominately left-footed but has shown to be comfortable on his right, meaning that the Everton star would work as a replacement for now-free agent Raphael Varane.",
      "Your turn! Who should Manchester United sign this summer? Let us know your picks in the comments section",
      "What'll be crucial to the defence's success is how United line up in midfield. Fulham linchpin Palhinha and Benfica wonderkid Joao Neves have both been linked, although would cost £60m and £84m respectively, according to reports.",
      "A cheaper option is Monaco's Youssouf Fofana, who the Red Devils have been tipped to sign alongside Arsenal and West Ham. Fofana, 25, has entered the final year of his contract in the French Riviera, where Ratcliffe notably lives.",
      "The midfielder dynamo has been included in France's squad for Euro 2024, which could give him an extra opportunity to impress potentially suitors like United. It's even been claimed that Monaco would be willing to sell him for just £20m - and the player himself is ready to depart.",
      "\"I have spoken about it with the hierarchy, it isn't a secret,\" Fofana recently confirmed. \"We had exchanges and they agreed to accompany me in this new stage.",
      "\"If [a move] doesn't happen, I still have a year left and I will be happy to stay. We were in agreement that we would accompany each other in this process in which everyone should be a winner, be it me or the club.\"",
      "Staying with the French, Michael Olise is on United's wish-list amid hot competition from Chelsea, who  Mirror Football  understands have already made contact over a move from Crystal Palace. The 22-year-old winger, who'll represent France at this summer's Paris Olympic Games, has a £60m release clause in his contract but it's far from simple for both Chelsea and United.",
      "That clause only applies to clubs in the Champions League, which the Blues and Red Devils both missed out on last season. A bidding war could be sparked between the two clubs, putting even more pressure on United to drum up funds by selling high-profile players.",
      "Names don't come much bigger than Bruno Fernandes, who Barcelona and Bayern Munich are said to be interested in signing. Keen to know if he's part of United's future plans, Fernandes, who turns 30 in September, wants a lucrative new contract which would put him in the same wage bracket as high earners Casemiro, Sancho and Marcus Rashford - who's also been tipped for a surprise exit but is more than likely to stay.",
      "It's expected that Old Trafford chiefs will offer the Portuguese a new deal, having been handed the captaincy by Ten Hag a year ago. Finally, despite Hojlund being untouchable when it comes to the market, United are keen to provide the 21-year-old with competition for the starting striker role.",
      "Mirror Football  exclusively revealed earlier this month that the Red Devils are looking at signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves, who have financial concerns of their own to address and could be forced into selling. Cunha, 25, is currently valued at £60m and United would be willing to double the Brazilian's £60,000-a-week pay.",
      "A second striker or attacking midfielder throughout most of his career, Cunha is able to function in various attacking roles, so he'd give Ten Hag greater tactical versatility. The Red Devils want strength in depth after an injury-ravaged campaign and those four signings would go a long way in providing just that.",
      "What's important to note is that Ratcliffe wants to usher in a new transfer policy at Old Trafford, one focussed on signing more rough diamonds with high potential and huge resale value - like the aforementioned quartet - as opposed to readymade, declining stars like the £70m addition of Casemiro in 2022.",
      "Newly-appointed technical director Jason Wilcox is set to have a significant influence on transfers, with Ten Hag's role in recruitment reduced. Wilcox will be supported by INEOS bigwig Sir Dave Brailsford as well as deputy football director Andy O'Boyle and transfer chief Matt Hargreaves.",
      "Man Utd's dream XI next season:  Onana; Dalot, Branthwaite, Martinez, Shaw; Fofana, Mainoo; Olise, Fernandes, Garnacho; Cunha",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s corporation, which purchased a quarter of the club last December and now oversees all footballing matters, has been clear that they intend to invest heavily in improving the club’s infrastructure after several rivals have stolen a march in recent years.",
      "The work is expected to last across the entire 2024/25 season and United said: “Temporary adaptations will be made… to ensure players and staff from all our teams can continue to operate successfully next season.”",
      "United plan to revamp the gym, medical, nutrition and recovery areas and there is “a design emphasis on creating more space for collaboration and innovation among players and staff.”",
      "After confirming the plans for Carrington, Ratcliffe said: “We want to create a world-class environment for our teams to win. When we conducted a thorough review of the Carrington training facilities and met with our men’s first-team players, it was clear the standards had fallen below some of our peers. This project will ensure Manchester United's training ground is once more renovated to the highest standards.”",
      "Last summer United opened a separate building at Carrington for its academy and women’s teams after a £10m investment. Lord Foster, whose firm oversaw the transformation of Wembley among other sporting projects, said: “We are delighted to lead the renewal of Manchester United's training facility in Carrington.",
      "“Our aim is to modernise and revitalise the building as a catalyst for future footballing success, creating spaces that inspire a culture of collaboration, unity and belonging.",
      "“As a proud Mancunian, it is a particular honour for me to see Foster + Partners given this responsibility and we will ensure that our design captures the spirit of industry, grit and ambition that exemplifies both Manchester and Manchester United.”",
      "United are also eager to move ahead with plans for Old Trafford with Ratcliffe keen to make it the “Wembley of the North” but no decision has been made over how to renovate the existing structure with previous reports suggesting that building a new stadium on adjacent land was being considered.",
      "The club was widely criticised last season because of the ageing stadium’s leaking roof - in particular after a storm during the Premier League defeat to Arsenal.",

There have been several public disputes during his time at Old Trafford so far, most notably Cristiano Ronaldo's critical interview with Piers Morgan and Jadon Sancho accusing Ten Hag of lying.",
      "According to a report from the Daily Mail, some United stars even mocked the manager behind his back by making buzzing noises.

      "The Red Devils are expected to be busy in the transfer window with Ineos, led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, now calling the shots. And with United confirming that manager Erik ten Hag will remain in his post earlier this week, it's expected that transfer activity at Old Trafford will now begin to ramp up.",
      "Branthwaite, 21, has been linked with United for months after impressing for Everton in the Premier League last season. The Times now report that United have agreed personal terms with the centre-half, who narrowly missed out on a place in England's Euro 2024 squad earlier this month.",
      "The next step is for United to agree a fee with Everton for the players services. And while the Toffees will demand a premium price for Branthwaite, United's top brass have already indicated they will not be held to ransom for the former Carlisle United man.",
      "It was outlined last month in a report by The Mail that Ratcliffe and co value Branthwaite at around the £55million mark. More recent reports, however, have detailed that Everton will demand a sum in the region of £70m for the impressive young defender, who has made a big impact at Goodison Park after returning from a breakout loan at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "Given Everton's financial situation, it's likely Manchester United will attempt to drive down the price of any deal for Branthwaite - particularly given that the deadline for clubs to get their finances in order to meet profit and sustainability rules for the season is June 30.",
      "Everton were docked eight points last season for breaching the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules and Everton director of football Kevin Thelwell admitted in a letter to fans last month that players would be sold this summer.

Real Madrid are considered the favourites to land the sought-after defender, though, with the 18-year-old likely to be sold this summer after entering the final 12 months of his contract.",

      "\"I found something quite interesting,\" Denzel began. \"Because when I was searching the internet, it says your height is 5'7\", Kobbie, but I know you've been telling people you're six foot.\"",
      "The statement prompted Palmer to ask his team-mate directly, with Mainoo doubling down on the six-foot claim. Then, after a chuckle, he asked, \"Why are you laughing?\".",
      "There was only one thing for it. Denzel brought out the tape measure, asking Palmer to hold it up alongside his team-mate. Sure enough, Mainoo was 184 centimetres - a fraction above six foot - albeit with shoes on.",
      "Earlier in the same broadcast, Palmer and Mainoo had been speaking about their inclusion in Gareth Southgate's squad. Both players were uncapped this time last season, but they forced their way into the reckoning after impressive seasons. Not that either of them saw it coming, though. \"When I went to Chelsea this was the last thing I thought about,\" Palmer said",
      "\"I was just taking it game by game,\" Mainoo added. \"Obviously, we [Manchester United] didn't have the best season, so I was just looking for the next game, the next game, to just try and get performances in. Then it got to the end of the season and I was in the provisional squad, and I was buzzing. It was a nice surprise.\"",
      "England had mixed fortunes in their two warm-up games. They beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 3-0 at St James' Park, only to then fall to a 1-0 defeat against Iceland at Wembley.",
      "The first of those games saw Palmer score his first senior international goal from the penalty spot. \"I nearly slipped, to be fair,\" the Chelsea star said. \"When it went in I thought I might have double-kicked it.\"",
      "Gareth Southgate's team will begin their Euros campaign against Serbia on Sunday, with Denmark and Slovenia also in their group. Palmer and Mainoo both featured in the warm-up games, and the pair will be pushing for a start in the first of those matches.",

      "Having resolved the drawn-out saga of Erik ten Hag's future and deciding to stick with him, Man Utd's new regime face another major test with their first transfer window",
      "Now the drawn-out saga of Erik ten Hag's future has been resolved, Manchester United can begin the process of rebuilding their under-performing squad.",
      "The window has now opened, with United's squad in need of a shake-up after the shambles of last season, which almost cost Ten Hag his job, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team having decided to stick with the Dutchman, after failing to identify a suitable replacement.",
      "Having ended last season in eighth place, their worst-ever Premier League finish, this summer is one of huge significance for United in terms of making their squad competitive once again.",
      "Ratcliffe's newly-installed football operations team are handling recruitment, leaving Ten Hag with the sole remit of coaching the team, a change he is known to be resistant to, arguing his must be the dominant voice when it comes to transfers.",
      "Jason Wilcox, appointed United technical director in April, is leading this summer's recruitment drive, in the absence of Dan Ashworth, who is set to take up the role of sporting director, but still on gardening leave at Newcastle.",
      "Wilcox is being supported by Sir Dave Brailsford, who is providing ownership representation, as well as Andy O'Boyle and Matt Hargreaves, United's deputy football director and director of football negotiations respectively.",
      "While there have been several confirmed departures, including defender Raphael Varane, striker Anthony Martial and full-backs Brandon Williams and Alvaro Fernandez, another handful could be on their way out of the club as Ratcliffe and his Ineos team tackle their first window.",
      "Ostensibly, Ineos will listen to offers for most of the United squad, the exceptions being Andre Onana, Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot, Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Even captain Bruno Fernandes, United's best and most reliable player, is available if the price is right, particularly if a Saudi Pro League club is willing to pay up to £80million for a player approaching 30, such are the financial constraints imposed by the Premier League's spending rules.",
      "In reality, though, Fernandes is likely to be offered an improved new deal and stay, such is his importance to United, who cannot afford to undergo a complete overhaul of their entire squad in one window, with the emphasis on evolution, rather than revolution.",
      "But United's limited budget – currently around £40m to £50m - can only be supplemented by player sales, which is why the club are willing to listen to offers for so many members of their squad.",
      "Moreover, money made from academy players such as Marcus Rashford or Scott McTominay counts as pure profit in terms of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules, an important consideration in the overall summer spending plan and one that could make those two more likely to be sold.",
      "Casemiro is expected to leave for a lucrative pay day in the Saudi Pro League, while £85m flop Antony will be sold if United can recoup a decent chunk of that exorbitant outlay.",
      "Victor Lindelof, Christian Eriksen and Donny van de Beek are expected to go, while United have already put a £40m price tag on exiled winger Jadon Sancho, while another forward who has returned after a loan spell, Mason Greenwood, is also likely to leave on a permanent basis.",
      "In terms of incomings, United have been linked with moves for Crystal Palace duo Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise, as well as Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite and Lille centre-back Leny Yoro. Bayer Leverkusen wing-back Jeremie Frimpomg is another target, as are Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes.",
      "Despite so many players being on the radar and scouted, United are set to focus on strengthening in three key positions this summer – centre-back, midfield and up front, with other non-priority areas considered a bonus if players can be brought in to fill those other areas.",

      "Chelsea made the first move in the battle for £60million Michael Olise in a potential blow for United's pursuit of the highly-desired 22-year-old.",
      "As Mirror Football revealed, the Blues are desperate to beat both Manchester clubs, Arsenal and Liverpool for Olise's signing and have made contact with Crystal Palace this week.",
      "Palace - who accept he wants to play in the Champions League - will only listen to offers between £60m-£70m to land the man who scored 10 times from just 14 league starts, assisting six times over the past season.",
      "United are in the market this summer for a central defender, a midfielder and a striker to help Rasmus Hojlund with the goal-scoring load now that Anthony Martial has departed the club this summer after nine years.",
      "With his veto power in tow, Ten Hag is also set to make three demands, according to The Sun.",
      "The Dutchman will continue to not allow Jadon Sancho back into the first team unless the 24-year-old apologises. The pair fell out at the beginning of last season and Sancho ultimately moved on loan to Borussia Dortmund to reinvigorate his career.",
      "It appears the club planned to sell their £73million signing regardless of who is in charge, but with Ten Hag remaining on board, Sancho's future looks destined to be outside Old Trafford's walls.",
      "Meanwhile, Ten Hag's other demands include not allowing the club's hierarchy to interfere or dictate his style of play, along with the renewal of coach Benni McCarthy's contract.",
      "Ahead of the 2024/25 season, Ten Hag is keen to bring in a new central defender, given the departure of Raphael Varane and the injury crisis endured between Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, and Victor Lindelof this past season.",
      "United used 15 different centre-back pairings this season, closing the campaign with Casemiro at the heart of defence for the final six league games. He had three separate centre-back partners in that time.",
      "Links to numerous targets have emerged in recent weeks with Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite appearing to be the priority, but Everton's asking price may be a stumbling block.",
      "And according to Sky Germany, United are interested in signing Matthijs de Ligt from Bayern Munch. The Dutch centre-back is expected to leave Bayern this summer and previously worked with Ten Hag at Ajax.",

      "Manchester United have reached an agreement over personal terms with the representatives of top transfer target Jarrad Branthwaite - but still need to negotiate a fee with Everton.",
      "Branthwaite, 21, is understood be top of United's list of centre-back targets for Sir Jim Ratcliffe's first transfer window as the club's co-owner. The Everton star, who narrowly missed out on being part of England's travelling squad for Euro 2024, enjoyed a breakout season at Goodison Park, becoming a stalwart in Sean Dyche's defence following a productive loan spell with PSV Eindhoven.",
      "United greatly admire Branthwaite's qualities on the ball, in the air and the fact he's two-footed - as well as being homegrown. That's why Old Trafford chiefs would be willing to pay him a salary worth between £150,000 and £160,000 per week, the Times report, but a major hurdle remains.",
      "Everton, it's claimed, are demanding a £70million fee for the 21-year-old, who signed from Carlisle United as a teenage prospect in January 2020. Mirror Football has been told that the Toffees want to keep Branthwaite this summer and would only be willing to change their stance if they receive a mega offer.",
      "Branthwaite's club are, however, under pressure to get their finances in order before June 30, the deadline to stay in line with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules for the 2023-24 season. Everton have already been docked points for failing to meet the league's financial requirements on two occasions.",
      "The Toffees would also have to pay Carlisle 15 per cent of whatever fee they receive for Branthwaite, who's emerged as one of Europe's most promising central defenders over the past 18 months. But the Cumbrian isn't the only centre-back who United want to sign this summer, as the Red Devils are eyeing a swoop for Lille wonderkid Leny Yoro.",
      "Yoro, 19, has been courted by Real Madrid in recent months and even attended their Champions League final victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley, although the European champions are yet to strike a deal with Lille. United and arch enemies Liverpool are waiting to pounce should the Frenchman's move to Madrid collapse, with Paris Saint-Germain also interested.",
      "Your turn! Should Manchester United pay £70million for Jarrad Branthwaite? Give us your stance in the comments section",
      "United are now focussed on their summer recruitment after determining the future of embattled manager Erik ten Hag. After leading the 20-time English champions to their lowest top-flight finish since 1990 and slumping to rock bottom of their Champions League group, Ten Hag was set to be axed by Ratcliffe and his fellow executives.",
      "But after the Dutch boss produced a tactical masterclass to stun Manchester City in the FA Cup final, two-and-a-half weeks of deliberation followed. Senior United figures met with multiple managerial candidates during their protracted end-of-season review but they eventually decided to keep Ten Hag.",

      "David Beckham expressed concerns about his daughter watching his Netflix documentary \"Beckham,\" which explores his career and personal controversies but was happy at its public reception",
      "David Beckham expressed concern about his daughter Harper watching his Netflix documentary, \"Beckham,\" as he feared it might influence her opinion of her dad's difficult moments from the past. But the Manchester United and Real Madrid icon was shocked by the positive response to the documentary, which lifted his spirits and aided in his reconciliation with some of the more challenging periods of his successful career.",
      "Unveiled in October 2023, \"Beckham\" was a four-episode series that dove deep into the celebrated footballer's life. What sets this documentary apart is the inclusion of previously unseen footage and the comprehensive exploration of Beckham's relationships with his family, friends, teammates, and coaches, offering a unique and intimate perspective.",
      "The series includes appearances from notable figures such as his wife, Victoria Beckham, and former teammates Rio Ferdinand, Roy Keane, and Luis Figo, providing a comprehensive view of the soccer icon's storied career and personal experiences. But before the product was available to the public, Beckham had reservations about how the content could affect his children.",
      "“I was a little bit worried about my daughter seeing some of the things that were being said about me over the years and how she would react,” Beckham said to Variety. “I’ve been telling my daughter for a long time that Mommy used to wear very, very short skirts. And then she was like, ‘Daddy, Mommy did really wear really, really short skirts!’ But she loved it.”",
      "The release of the documentary was not without its share of controversy. Victoria's discussion of her husband's alleged affair with yoga instructor Rebecca Loos stirred a heated debate. Loos, in a scathing critique, accused Beckham of presenting a sanitized version of their relationship, claiming that the documentary did not provide a truthful account.",
      "The documentary reignited public interest in and debate about the affair. Critics also pointed out that it glossed over or omitted other contentious aspects of Beckham's life and career, sparking discussions about the portrayal's accuracy and completeness.",
      "Despite facing criticism, Beckham acknowledged that the documentary underscored the importance of mental health, a theme he emphasized was personally and publicly crucial. He hoped the series would cast light on how the media treats women associated with famous athletes, suggesting that his story could contribute to a broader societal change towards more respectful and equitable treatment.",
      "\"I think that my takeaway from my documentary was how important mental health is. Because, 20 years ago, nobody was talking about it. And nobody was taking it seriously,” he said. “Now, it’s so great that people can actually talk about their feelings… There were many things said about us over the 27 years. It can be hurtful.”"

      "Erik ten Hag will remain in charge of Man Utd next season and now needs to make his signings work and deliver a successful campaign.",
      "As Ineos weighed up the future of Erik ten Hag during their end-of-season review at Manchester United they considered several factors. There were positives for Ten Hag and there was mitigation, reasons for a desperate Premier League campaign that can be rectified next season.",
      "Those focused primarily on injury issues, but also a sense that the business done in the 2023 summer transfer window was with an eye on long-term results. There was an acceptance that Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund took time to settle and that Mason Mount's season was wrecked through injury.",
      "Ineos expect that there is more to come from the £163m trio and that the full benefit of that investment is yet to be felt. Onana certainly improved as the campaign went on and Hojlund had a couple of spells where it looked like he was ready to lead the line.",
      "The greatest disappointment will be reserved for Mount, who started the season slowly after his £55m move from Chelsea, lost his place in the team and then struggled with his fitness. If there are reasons for Onana and Hojlund to take time to settle into a new league and a new country, it was expected that the England international would hit the ground running in midfield.",
      "Instead, he managed just 20 appearances and eight starts for the club, contributing a solitary goal and assist. His only start after November 1 came in the 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace towards the end of the season and he only came on in the 89th minute in the FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "The midfield didn't exactly thrive without him, but that was down to structural issues as much as personnel. The role he was signed for has now been filled by Kobbie Mainoo, a definite positive for Ten Hag, and Mount has a challenge to get back into the team.",
      "Mainoo has become an updrobbale presence in the centre of the pitch and Bruno Fernandes is a guaranteed starter. A new holding midfielder is likely to arrive this summer. That means Mount's role for now is likely to be off the bench.",
      "There is no way Ineos will give up on a £55m signing however and if he does flop again for a second successive season then it will reflect poorly on Ten Hag's judgement. The manager pushed hard to sign him having followed him since a loan spell in the Eredivisie seven years ago.",
      "In a way, Mount has become a key figure during the end-of-season review. When Sir Jim Ratcliffe met Thomas Tuchel the former Chelsea boss pointed to the success he had in getting the best out of Mount at Stamford Bridge and said he could repeat that trick at Old Trafford. Mount played the best football of his career under Tuchel and created the winning goal in the 2021 Champions League final.",
      "The promise of extracting more from a key signing wasn't enough to land Tuchel the job, but the mention of Mount as a factor in the mitigation for last season's performance levels still feels telling. It is now on Ten Hag to get the most out of the 25-year-old.",
      "As a player still yet to reach his theoretical prime and an England international signed for big money, there is pressure on Mount to deliver value. Ten Hag signed him to knit his midfield together and although his first season ended up as a write-off, it's clear there is now a demand to make this deal a success in season two.",

      "Man Utd are used to dealing with some bizarre stories on a transfer rumour and the latest reports in Spain fit neatly into that category.",
      "There would have been a few chuckles around Old Trafford at stories in the Catalan press suggesting Barcelona are eyeing up Kobbie Mainoo. This is the Barcelona who can't register all the players they currently have to play in La Liga next season, never mind sign any more.",
      "The financial demise of Barca is a story all of European football is following. Everyone knows that they don't have the spending power of old. Everyone, that is, apart from most of Catalonia.",
      "So the idea, floated in Catalan-based publication El Nacional, that Hansi Flick wants the club to sign Mainoo is about as likely as United winning the Champions League next season. They don't have enough cash to sign his left foot, never mind the rest of the 19-year-old, who is absolutely not for sale anyway.",
      "He is one of the few untouchables this summer, chiefly alongside fellow young guns Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund. They could be the future of United and Mainoo certainly is. His first season in the first team was evidence of that.",
      "It's why he is now being linked to clubs like Barcelona and more will follow. Mainoo is that rare breed - although increasingly less rare these days it must be said - of an English midfielder who has the ability to grace the Nou Camp and just about any other stadium in the world.",
      "After 35 senior appearances, he is already one of the best players in the United team and a key man in the midfield. He is wonderfully press-resistant, an intelligent player with an eye for a goal and an ability to find excellent finishes. He might not begin Euro 2024 in England's starting XI, but don't be surprised if he makes an impact in the tournament.",
      "He will certainly feature in Germany and if he does shine for his country in the manner he has done so for his club this season then we can expect more stories in the foreign press linking him with moves away. Maybe it will be Real Madrid next, or Bayern Munich. It's only Europe's very elite who would be realistic suitors.",
      "United certainly need to rejoin that category as quickly as they can. In Mainoo and Garnacho they have a pair of 19-year-olds who are among the most talented players of their generation and they need the platform at Old Trafford to achieve the success their games deserve.",
      "But at the moment they also have the ideal platform to keep developing. They are almost undroppable given the form they showed last season. Garnacho earned himself a five-year contract 14 months ago after his performances and at some point Mainoo will follow suit.",
      "The Stockport-born academy graduate is still on the contract he signed in February 2023, well before his significant senior breakout. That deal has improved since then as a result of performance factors and there is no rush to get a deal signed.",
      "United have been relaxed about the situation for months given he still has three years left, plus the option of another year, on his current contract. Having waited for the season to finish first, Mainoo's remarkable rise now means he is spending the summer at a major tournament.",
      "It is just a matter of time, however. United won't sell Mainoo and he doesn't want to leave his boyhood club. At some point in the not-so-distant future he will pose for the obligatory photo with pen in hand, smile fixed on the camera, ink about to be applied to contract.",
      "Until then, United can probably expect another fanciful story or two linking the shining star of their academy with another club. But right now there's only one club for Kobbie Mainoo.",

      "Those focused primarily on injury issues, but also a sense that the business done in the 2023 summer transfer window was with an eye on long-term results. There was an acceptance that Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund took time to settle and that Mason Mount's season was wrecked through injury.",
      "Ineos expect that there is more to come from the £163m trio and that the full benefit of that investment is yet to be felt. Onana certainly improved as the campaign went on and Hojlund had a couple of spells where it looked like he was ready to lead the line.",

      "\"He’s a player that’s capable of accelerating the game, whether that’s by him passing the ball or dribbling, and he possesses a lot of quality. I would not be surprised and I have no doubts that with some stronger players around him, he can be a terrific player.\"",
      "According to The Athletic, Casemiro was 'disappointed' by United's recruitment last summer. The report claims the veteran midfielder was frustrated to see Harry Kane join Bayern Munich and not the Red Devils.",

      "Earlier this season, Jarrad Branthwaite was quizzed on his future at Everton. The Everton defender shrugged off speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United and reaffirmed his focus on the Premier League relegation battle.",

      "Speaking to Poker Sites, he said: \"I think Rasmus Hojlund has done alright. It’s tough playing centre-forward these days because wingers don’t really get down to the by-line and feed players in the box, and he’s not getting an awful lot of supply in midfield.",
      "\"I think he’s feeding off scraps at Manchester United at the moment, but he’s fought well and looks quite strong. It’s a difficult position to play at the club as such a young lad and I think he’s done okay.",

      "Man United's transfer record has been poor over the years and here are some of the club's biggest flops in the market.",
      "Manchester United's recruitment has been awful in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Now that the transfer window has reopened and there is a new regime in town, the mistakes of the past must be avoided.",
      "\"What’s happened is, we have burned through cash,\" former United CEO Richard Arnold said (along with an expletive) in 2022 when meeting fans for an impromptu chat in a beer garden.",
      "Arnold wasn't wrong - United have spent over £1billion on transfers over the last decade and they haven't come close to winning the Premier League title.",
      "The scattergun transfer strategy is one of the main reasons for United's decline and there have been various transfer flops. It's a strategy that the new regime at Old Trafford, headed up by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos, are keen to avoid. Ratcliffe, speaking a few years ago, called United's recruitment 'shockingly poor'.",
      "\"[Ineos] never wants to be the dumb money in town, never,\" Ratcliffe said. So here are 10 of some of the biggest transfer flops United have signed that probably fit that bill.",
      "Antony was signed in a deal worth £86m from Ajax in Erik ten Hag's first summer in charge. The Dutchman pushed hard to sign the winger, who he worked with at the Amsterdam Arena, and United agreed to a deal despite Ajax's valuation increasing throughout the window.",
      "The Brazilian still has time to turn around his career at the club, but considering the fee invested to sign him, he's been an awful transfer and must improve next season.",
      "Antony contributed just one goal and one assist in the whole of the 2023/24 Premier League campaign.",
      "Alexis Sanchez was signed from Arsenal in a straight swap deal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, so he didn't cost a transfer fee, but he earned astronomical wages during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "The Chilean scored five goals and recorded nine assists in 45 appearances and failed to produce the form he did at Arsenal, which saw him excel in the Premier League.",
      "Sanchez was the highest-paid player in the Premier League and it's thought he earned £560,000 per week. He joined Inter Milan on loan in 2019 and later signed permanently.",
      "Mkhitaryan was used in the swap deal for Sanchez and was a transfer flop himself at United. His performances for Borussia Dortmund were excellent and United paid £30m to lure him to Manchester, but he struggled in the Premier League and was soon axed from the starting XI.",
      "The Armenia international's relationship with Jose Mourinho broke down and he was used as a makeweight in the deal to sign Sanchez.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson hadn't seen Bebe play before finalising a £7million deal to sign him, and when the winger did get a game for United, he was a major disappointment.",
      "He made just seven appearances for United before leaving in 2014 to join Benfica. Bebe is now 33 and stunned United fans in January when representing Cape Verde at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Donny van de Beek was a Ballon d'Or nominee in 2019 after his influential role in Ajax's domestic double triumph and progression to the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "Just a year later, his arrival at United for £35m was considered a coup, but his time at the club has been a disaster and his recent loan with Eintracht Frankfurt didn't work out.",
      "Van de Beek's nightmare continued at Eintracht - he was left out of their European squad shortly after signing - and he's under contract at United until 2025.",
      "There was excitement when United signed Memphis Depay from PSV Eindhoven in a deal worth £31m in 2015, but he never fulfilled his potential in two years at the club.",
      "After the departure of Angel Di Maria, Depay took the famous No.7 shirt - previously worn by George Best, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. He struggled with the weight of that shirt at Old Trafford and eventually signed for Lyon in January 2017.",
      "Morgan Schneiderlin signed from Southampton in 2015, arriving for a fee in the region of £25m, but he became 'lost' as a player under the demands of Louis van Gaal.",
      "\"I was too affected by what Louis van Gaal was asking from me,\" he said last year. \"I lost me as a player. It was not me on the field. It was not just the manager's fault, it was my fault, too.",
      "\"My role was not the one I had at Southampton. I felt restricted. I felt they wanted to change things in me. I was not thinking as me, I was thinking about what pleased the coach.\"",
      "The midfielder joined Everton in 2017 and had stints with Nice, Western Sydney Wanderers, Konyaspor and A.E. Kifisia after his time at Goodison Park.",
      "Pogba seemed to have the world at his feet when he re-signed for United in 2016 for a then-world-record transfer fee of £89million. He'd established himself as one of Europe's finest midfielders during his Juventus stint and his return to Manchester dominated global headlines.",
      "But Pogba left United on a free transfer in 2022, 10 years after he last left the club as a free agent, having won just the Europa League and the League Cup in six years.",
      "The Frenchman was supremely talented and should have achieved more with United.",
      "Although Radamel Falcao is the only loan player included on this list, he had to be included because United paid Monaco £6.8m to sign him on a season-long deal.",
      "\"When a player of this calibre becomes available, it is an opportunity not to be missed,\" said then-United manager Van Gaal of Falcao in September 2014.",
      "However, Falcao only managed to score four goals in 29 appearances and Chelsea decided to give him a chance the following season, despite flopping at United.",
      "He was a disappointing signing for United and scored just once at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Di Maria appeared to shout 'eff off' to a section of home fans at Old Trafford after Paris Saint-Germain's opener in the first knockout round of the Champions League in February 2019.",
      "Di Maria was booed with every touch of the ball that night, as he returned for the first time since he departed the club in 2015. He received a hostile reception and was targeted by a bottle in the second half as he went to take a corner.",
      "United signed him for a British record transfer fee of £59.7million in the summer of 2014 but he flopped, just like the other players on the list.",

      "Man Utd wanted Ralf Rangnick to remain as a consultant once his days as interim manager were over but he burnt his bridges at Old Trafford.",
      "There was an interesting scene at the FC Bayern Campus back in September as Manchester United under-19s took on their Bayern counterparts in the UEFA Youth League. Standing at the back of one of the compact stands in the stylish mini-stadium was Ralf Rangnick, a former manager of one of the clubs and - little did we know then - a future target for the other.",
      "Rangnick was accompanied by his partner and his former United assistant coach and analyst Ewan Sharp. He chatted to Sharp for most of the game and spoke to friends and acquaintances. Sitting on the front row of the same stand, no more than 30 yards away, was United's football director John Murtough.",
      "At no point did Rangnick and Murtough exchange pleasantries. Just under two years previously Murtough had championed Rangnick's appointment as the club's interim manager, replacing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for the final six months of 2021/22. The German had a reputation as a shrewd executive as well as a modern coach and the plan was for him to stay on as a consultant for two years once his spell in the dugout had ended.",
      "By the end of the season, there was no chance of that happening. Rangnick had long run out of allies at the club and although his plain-talking press conference approach was appreciated by supporters, virtually nobody else was enjoying it when he got behind a microphone.",
      "He slammed the transfer policy, criticised the players and said the squad needed \"open heart surgery\". That comment was made in an embargoed section of a press conference ahead of a Saturday lunchtime kick-off at Arsenal and only went public at 10.30pm on Friday. A little over 12 hours later his players were aware of what had been said by the time they got to the Emirates and they didn't take it well.",
      "Erik ten Hag had been confirmed as the club's manager for the following season by that point. When Rangnick oversaw his final game on Sunday, May 21, Ten Hag was in the stands at Selhurst Park. The following day he was unveiled at Old Trafford and was evasive over whether he had even spoken to Rangnick when quizzed on the subject during his press conference. When the subject of his planned consultancy role was raised, the Dutchman was dismissive.",
      "As an idea, it was now dead. A couple of days later came official confirmation that Rangnick was the new manager of Austria and that he would no longer act as a consultant for United.",
      "The 65-year-old hasn't been seen back at Old Trafford since, but after watching the Youth League fixture in September he made the short journey to the Allianz Arena to watch the Champions League clash. He had said earlier that afternoon that he still followed the club's progress and had watched them lose to Brighton 3-1 earlier that week.",
      "Many of the problems he had identified were rearing their head again under Ten Hag but chatting to a couple of reporters who had travelled from Manchester, Rangnick resisted the chance to gloat or issue any 'I told you' reminders.",
      "He had recently spoken to Victor Lindelof after a Euro 2024 qualifying fixture between Sweden and Austria in Stockholm and Marcel Sabitzer, a key cog in Rangnick's Austria team, spent the second half of last season on loan at Old Trafford.",
      "It had all started promisingly for Rangnick. A 1-0 win against Crystal Palace on December 5 was noticeable for a first half of aggressive pressing until the team tired. The first five games saw the former RB Leipzig boss avoid defeat but then the wheels fell off.",
      "His record of 11 wins from 29 games ranks him as the worst United manager by win percentage for 50 years. A 4-1 defeat at Manchester City and 4-0 losses to Liverpool and Brighton were low points. Rangnick slammed the Anfield defeat as \"embarrassing, maybe even humiliating\". He also said as many as 10 new players might need to be signed in the summer rebuild, which was a key moment in those behind the scenes joining the players in losing faith and patience.",
      "But fast forward two years and Rangnick is in a very different position. His spell at Old Trafford could have shredded his reputation, but it increasingly feels like a managerial spell at Manchester United can be glossed over on a CV. This has become a club that eats its bosses alive.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has touched on that previously and when the failure of big-name managers is discussed it's often Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho that people think of. Rangnick could be up there though. He has a reputation as a tactically smart coach and a clever football director, but at United he looked out of his depth.",
      "That isn't a view he would subscribe to and speaking to SPORT1 he reflected on the challenges he faced at Old Trafford.",
      "“Of course, it wasn’t an easy time,\" Rangnick said. \"The time to get there back then, there could have been cheaper ones. Obviously, the club has recognised the signs of the times.",
      "\"Many of the things that we discussed internally back then have now been implemented. They brought in a lot of new players. Other players who, for various reasons, were not able to perform at their best back then are now in top form again when they are fit.\"",
      "One of Rangnick's complaints was a lack of support in the January window while he was at United. While he pushed to sign a forward and later namechecked options such as Julian Alvarez, Dusan Vlahovic and Luis Diaz, he later offered up a longer list of names of players he wanted to sign.",
      "\"It was clear to everyone that there was a need in many areas,\" Rangnick told Bild. \"That's why we were already discussing players like Josko Gvardiol and Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig. Those were names that were realistic.",
      "\"We also talked about Alvaro Morata, Luis Diaz, Dusan Vlahovic and, as I said, Erling Haaland when they were still on the market. But the club decided at that time to rebuild the team under the new coach.\"",
      "His spell in Austria has been redemptive, however. So well has he done that Bayern Munich came calling as they sought to replace Thomas Tuchel, only for Rangnick to turn the approach down. He heads into Euro 2024 with Austria having been handed a difficult group, but with the side considered dark horses by many for a deep run into the tournament.",
      "Austria's 4-2-2-2 shape is Rangnick's calling card and a system he struggled to implement at Old Trafford. He has won 14 of his 23 games in charge, with just five defeats, and Austria came second in a tricky qualifying group, finishing a point behind Belgium and easily getting the better of Sweden, beating them home and away.",
      "They face France, Holland and Poland in Group D in Germany and Rangnick has been dealt some injury blows. He is without goalkeeper Alexander Schlager and, maybe more importantly, his best player in David Alaba and key midfielder Xaver Schlager.",
      "But they are one of the few international sides with a truly distinctive style and the presence of so many players who have been associated with the Red Bull network clubs and a tactical style that Rangnick developed is a help.",
      "The coach is certainly convinced they can challenge at this tournament and that they aren't simply in Germany to make up the numbers.",
      "\"If we're complete, then we're a team that is very hard to beat. We're able to compete with anyone at a high level,\" said Rangnick.",
      "\"We saw that during last year's friendlies against Germany and Italy, but also during the Euro qualifiers against Sweden. Even against Belgium we were about to turn the result in our favour in the second game.",
      "\"We're not going to the European Championship just to participate. We want to show what we can do. We are aware that our group is not easy at all. On the other hand, we have faith in ourselves and believe we can qualify for the next round.\"",
      "If they achieve that it will be another step on the road to redemption for Rangnick.",

We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it's a quick turnaround now. Maybe it's a reminder of how tough this tournament is.",
      "\"Their big players showed up and were excellent all over the park and had an answer for pretty much everything we had. I don't think we've played to our maximum. We have to dust ourselves down and go again.\"",
      "ITV pundit and former United captain, Keane, was far from impressed with Robertson's comments. \"Andy Robertson spoke at the end of the game and said they had a 'game plan' he stated.",
      "\"It's all well and good having a plan, he said then 'we weren't aggressive enough'. You have to be aggressive in a game of football. Being up against opposition who are much stronger than you, being aggressive is part of a footballer.",
      "\"I love watching skilful players, absolutely love it and the talent we saw from the German players tonight was great to watch. But my goodness, when you are playing football at this level, you've got to hit people. Hit them properly, hit them aggressively and do it in the right way.",
      "\"If you step off against them like Scotland did tonight and it's no good talking after the game saying 'we had a game plan'... it's rubbish! Andy Robertson, it's all just rubbish coming out. You knew before the game what was at stake and after the game it's no good going, 'we'll regroup and we'll be angry tomorrow.'",
      "\"No, you should be angry for a long time. We spoke before the game about creating history. They are creating history all right by playing as bad as that and letting their manager and supporters down. The tackle for the penalty and sending off wasn't aggressive that was madness, of course. Being aggressive is part of the game but they didn't lay a glove on them.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag has started the summer transfer window strong as he hunts down his priority targets ahead of their 2024/25 campaign",
      "Manchester United are set up for a busy couple of months this summer as the transfer window officially opened yesterday.",
      "Erik ten Hag will have a lot to do in order to get his squad sorted following a disappointing eighth-place finish in the Premier League which was the complete antithesis of their FA Cup run which saw them lift their second domestic trophy in as many seasons under the Dutchman.",
      "Having had his future secured in a decision made by minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe earlier this week, Ten Hag will no doubt be out to prove his doubters wrong after their tough 2023/24 campaign by wheeling and dealing his way through the summer months with concerns around their standing with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSRs) hanging over their shoulder.",
      "Man United opened the transfer window this summer by immediately sending a formal bid worth up to £43 million for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite but it was summarily rejected by the Toffees later that day. It's long been believed Sean Dyche's side will command a fee of at least £70m for the star whose performances at Goodison Park led him to Gareth Southgate's 33-man provisional England squad for the Euros.",
      "When asked about the rumours of a potential move to Man United back in April, Branthwaite simply shrugged off the comments and reiterated his focus to keeping Everton in the Premier League for next season. He said: \"You have just got to block it all out. I think if you focus on the outside stuff, you get distracted from what you need to do on the pitch.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Red Devils are reportedly 'very serious' about signing Lille centre-back Leny Yoro and have already submitted the 'biggest offer so far' in order to get ahead of their competition for the 18-year-old according to Spanish outlet AS.",
      "United are fighting against Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Liverpool and Real Madrid for the youngster, and it's been claimed they are 'very close' to the asking price of €60m (£50m) that's required to pull him away from France.",
      "It's said that while Madrid are heavily interested in the star, they don't want to go 'all out' for him given his contract situation which runs out next summer, with Los Blancos believing they can get him at a cut-price if he doesn't leave Lille this summer.",
      "It'd be a huge addition to what has been a weak defensive unit this season, with Raphael Varane having already left the club along with a possible Jonny Evans exit as his contract expires, while Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Lisandro Martinez and Willy Kambwala would be the only centre-backs left.",

      "The money Sir Jim Ratcliffe put aside to be invested in Man Utd is already being put to good use and will make a difference in the transfer market too.",
      "Training grounds matter to players. At Manchester United there might be a significant focus on the future of Old Trafford, but for the current squad and potential signings, the £50m investment in Carrington will be of greater value.",
      "Even with Old Trafford requiring modernisation, there remains an attraction to play there. When the players walk out at 3pm on a Saturday they don't see the outdated facilities and the fading paintwork, but a stadium with a story to tell, one of the most famous venues in the game.",
      "When they turn up at training, however, they do notice that things aren't quite right. It didn't take Cristiano Ronaldo long to point that out when he returned to the club for his second spell.",
      "This is where they spend the vast majority of their working week. It is where they train, where they eat and where they prepare. Players will notice if it's not being kept up to a high standard and new signings will notice if it isn't as impressive as other training grounds.",
      "When you're trying to convince a player to sign for your club this stuff matters. A comfortable, spacious, state-of-the-art workplace is an attractive asset to show off and it really can make a difference. When a player is spending so much time there they want it to be amongst the very best, especially at a club that aspires to be the very best.",
      "That hasn't been the case for a long time at Carrington. Much like Old Trafford, a lack of care and attention has allowed it to be overtaken by clubs who have either spruced up their existing training grounds or moved to new locations. Players no longer consider it amongst the best in the Premier League.",
      "For evidence of that you only need to read Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments on announcing the £50m investment into the facility, with work starting on Monday and set to last the entire season.",
      "“We want to create a world-class environment for our teams to win,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"When we conducted a thorough review of the Carrington training facilities and met with our men’s first-team players, it was clear the standards had fallen below some of our peers. This project will ensure Manchester United’s training ground is once more renovated to the highest standards.\"",
      "The fact players at the club are raising the state of Carrington as an issue with Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford shows how much this matters to them. They won't have been saying the same things about Old Trafford, which isn't to say that the stadium doesn't need significant work, as Ineos have already stated.",
      "But for the players, this is a priority, while it is also cheaper and easier to deliver on than either improving Old Trafford or building a new stadium, with the money the first tranche of the $300m Ratcliffe invested for infrastructure improvements on sealing his minority investment into the club.",
      "The £50m will also pay United back. Not only does it improve the working environment for players but it makes the club a more attractive proposition to potential signings. Playing for United is a good selling point, but it's not the deal sealer it was a decade ago.",
      "Instead, players will want to know that the conditions are in place to deliver success and make up ground on Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal. Ineos are getting a lot of things right and this statement is another example of that.",
      "This summer they will only have plans to show prospective new signings, but it shows that they are taking action. That alone is encouraging for players to hear.",

The 2024/25 Premier League season is set to get underway in mid-August, but United players are in action with the European Championships already underway and the Copa America coming next month.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest United news and gossip that has been doing the rounds in the last 24 hours...",
      "United icon Rio Ferdinand has suggested he would not be surprised to see his former club replace Luke Shaw after his poor injury record last season. Shaw missed a large chunk of the season and featured just 12 times in the Premier League.",
      "As a result, Erik ten Hag was forced to change his defensive line and Ferdinand believes that his fitness issues could be an issue moving forward, suggesting that a decision should be made over the summer.",
      "\"They’ve got to get a fit Shaw and Lisandro Martinez next season and games out of them both,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel. \"I don’t think Shaw could be disgruntled if United said because of his lack of game time over the last course of your time here, we’re going to find another left-back.",
      "\"I don’t think he could grumble at that. But I think he’s that good when he plays that they will go again [with him].\"",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Shaw will have the chance to prove to United that he can remain the club's first-choice left-back as he is set to represent England in the Euros. The 28-year-old has been a crucial player for United across the last seasons and his experience also speaks volumes. It could cost United if they were to replace him, given that some players can take time to adapt to new surroundings.\"",
      "According to GiveMeSport, Barcelona have set sights on starlet Kobbie Mainoo. However, United have been made aware of the Spanish giants' interest and are said to have initiated talks with the midfielder over a new deal.",
      "The 19-year-old has had a season to remember after breaking through the first-team at Old Trafford. He was one of the standout performers for the club, scoring in United's 2-1 FA Cup Final win over Man City as well as making his full England debut, earning a call-up to Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad.",
      "He was also nominated for the Premier League Young Player of the season award, and is seen as a generational talent for both club and country.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Nobody could have anticipated the impact Mainoo would have had at United this season. From his winner in the FA Cup final and his performances in the Premier League, the 19-year-old has exceeded all expectations and therefore, selling him now would be a huge mistake. He still has a lot more to offer and develop as a player and staying at Old Trafford can only help him achieve that.\"",

      "Hojlund, 21, scored 16 goals during an individually successful debut season at United, but the striker went through stretches where runs behind defences were not being found by teammates. The £72 million signing scored half of those goals during a fine run of form from Boxing Day to mid-February. Either side of that goal glut were barren stretches, particularly in the Premier League, as United teammates left Hojlund starved of service.",

      "Ex England international Danny Rose has suggested that Southgate should make changes to his defensive line in order to combat a specific threat from Serbia on Sunday",
      "Gareth Southgate has been told he doesn't need to play three or five at the back when his side face Serbia on Sunday.",
      "Speaking on Reach's new Euro Thrash podcast, which you can find in YouTube, Apple and Spotify, former Spurs full back Danny Rose has instructed the national team boss to avoid making a tactical shift in his defence for England's Euro 2024 curtain raiser. Rose believes the way the Serbians set up means Southgate doesn't have to deploy a back three or five to deal with their attacking threat. \"With respect to Mitrovic and Tadic, England have to realise that they are not going to run in behind, so I don't think there is any need to play with the three or five at the back,\" Rose said. The ex Sunderland man also thinks that Southgate's centre halves, or even whoever he selects as his deep lying midfielder, will do a good job of dealing with former Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic themselves and there's no need for cover, adding: \"The two centre-backs or holding midfielder can take care of Mitrovic.\"",
      "However, Rose has sent a warning to England over Fenerbahce star Dusan Tadic, who is expected to face England at the weekend. The former England international believes that England's Kieran Trippier will have a job on his hands to stifle the tricky forward and he has to ensure the ex Southampton man isn't allowed to cut in from the left.",
      "\"For Trippier, just don't let Tadic come in on his left and then that is half of the problems solved for England, \" Rose said. \"I wasn't keen on playing against defenders that could cut in, because once they get half a yard and when you have a left-foot like him, the ball goes into the box and as soon as it goes in, it's my fault. Tadic has a great left-foot and he is very strong.\"",
      "Speaking on the pod, alongside fellow ex-pro Wes Brown, Rose also commended Southgate's managerial qualities and revealed the national team boss is a very personable figure and that his friendly nature has hugely contributed to England's success in recent years.",
      "He said: \"I don't want to say he is one of the lads, but he is very approachable. He'll come and ask every one of you how are you? How are you doing? How's your family? He has a very good relationship with the players in his camp.",
      "\"It is not a coincidence that since he's taken over, everyone has started to believe that England are close to doing something and that is because of the atmosphere you create.\"",
      "Former Manchester United defender Brown concurred with Rose when it comes to Southgate's managerial style. \"You have to have a relationship with the players and it doesn't necessarily mean you are mates, but as a manager, you have to be able to talk to the players,\" he said. \"These players are running round for you and putting the effort in for every game, and it is only respect for the manager as well. The manager earns that respect and Southgate has with these players, you can see that since the day he came in.\"",

      "Ticket touts are exploiting Manchester United fans",
      "Manchester United are empathetic toward concerns at changes to how fans enter Old Trafford on matchdays, which have been made to 'clamp down' on ticket touting.",
      "The Manchester Evening News reported on Monday that some season ticket holders had been angered by changes to their season tickets. The new system for next season will see supporters use a live QR code in the club's app instead of downloading the ticket to an Apple/Google wallet.",
      "The new QR code system - the digital code is not available until three hours before kick-off - was implemented as a trial for some fans for Sheffield United's visit to Old Trafford.",
      "It will be used permanently from the start of the 2024/25 campaign. The live QR code regularly changes in the app and season tickets will be restricted to just one device.",
      "The changes prevent season ticket holders from passing on their ticket to a family member or friend without cost if they cannot attend the game themselves. A United membership is required to accept a transferred season ticket and that costs a minimum of £20 per season.",
      "The MEN contacted United to voice concerns and a club source said digital ticketing and unique QR codes 'help to clamp down on touting and fans being exploited by fellow fans'.",
      "They pointed to last season's home match against Chelsea and said more than 5,000 tickets were purchased by bots and sold at inflated prices, meaning tickets 'didn't go into the hands of genuine fans' – something they believe the new digitised system will stop from happening again.",
      "United have said digital ticketing 'makes it easier' for fans to use their tickets either by attending games or transferring to fellow fans, donating to the foundation or re-selling back to the club if they can't attend, which helps them reach the required games attended for the 15/19 rule.",
      "The club source reiterated they understand some fans may not use smartphones - or the app - and in those cases, United can help them directly with a solution.",
      "United made the decision to digitise their ticketing system in 2021/22, which meant fans were asked to download their season tickets to their mobile phones. Other Premier League teams have digitised their ticketing systems since then and United estimate it will be the norm in five years.",
      "However, some local fans feel United are making it increasingly difficult for them to attend games and have accused the club of 'touting' themselves, as a forwarding membership (£20) is needed for someone to receive a season ticket from a holder who can't attend a fixture.",
      "One fan described the changes as \"unacceptable\" and another said: \"The harder they make it to pass a ticket in, the more fans that will pack their season tickets in.\"",

      "It's said that Sir Jim Ratcliffe is willing to double Cunha's £60,000-a-week wage at Molineux in his efforts to sign the 25-year-old. Fortunately for United, Wolves are one of many teams who may be forced to sell players to avoid PSR breaches, and Cunha could be one of their assets allowed to leave.",
      "Cunha, who surprisingly missed out on a place in Brazil's Copa America squad, is currently enjoying his summer ahead of pre-season. And a video has since emerged online of him being questioned about whether he will be joining United with friends.",

      "In addition to United, Real Madrid have also been linked, but speaking back in April, Branthwaite revealed he was refusing to get distracted by the rumours.",

      "\"If they aren't granted, I won't do it. I am ultimately responsible and accounted for the results. I don't want to be the sole ruler, I stand for cooperation, but control in transfers is a condition for me.\"",
      "The final eight words of those quotes regarding influencing transfers are fascinating now Ten Hag is working under a football structure created by Sir Jim Ratcliffe. To repeat them: Control in transfers is a condition for me.",
      "Ten Hag has spent over £400million in two summer transfer windows and his fingerprints are all over the United squad, but recruitment will be different going forward.",
      "Ten Hag signed Tyrell Malacia, Christian Eriksen, Lisandro Martinez, Antony and Casemiro on permanent deals in his first summer in charge at Old Trafford. Mason Mount, Andre Onana, Rasmus Hojlund, Altay Bayindir and Jonny Evans were signed permanently last summer.",
      "Six of the ten players permanently signed on Ten Hag's watch have Eredivisie pedigree. It quickly became clear he had a preference for players he'd previously seen up close and it must be remembered that Frenkie de Jong was his priority midfield target, not Casemiro.",
      "Casemiro's decline has been remarkable over the last 12 months, but the Brazilian's first season was a resounding success and United needed his defensive discipline in midfield. De Jong wouldn't have worked at United because the midfield would have continued to be too lightweight.",
      "Although he missed out on De Jong, Ten Hag has been given a large degree of influence over transfers and recruitment is still hit and miss, which emphasises why it's time for a change. United remain in talks to appoint Dan Ashworth as sporting director and he will oversee transfers.",
      "Ashworth is still on gardening leave amid negotiations with Newcastle and won't be in the building to help with this summer's recruitment, but Omar Berrada will begin work as CEO imminently and Jason Wilcox, who is having a greater say in transfers for now, was appointed technical director in April.",
      "United have previously signed players for their manager and not the club. INEOS' new structure is changing that approach and recruitment will be aligned with the club's philosophy.",
      "A manager at an elite club should be guided by the sporting director, not given everything he wants in the sweet shop, although that's not to suggest Ten Hag, who currently has a veto on transfers written into his contract, should have completely no say on transfers.",
      "It's only healthy for a manager to be consulted on signings, but whether Ten Hag still has a veto included in his new United contract once it's signed remains to be seen.",
      "United have opened contract talks with Ten Hag after deciding he would remain in charge and it's understood the Dutchman is reluctant to cede too much power over transfers.",
      "Ratcliffe has decided United's incoming sporting director will lead on recruitment and the head coach will then report to him. Ratcliffe has also appointed Wilcox to draw up a 'game model' for a playing style to be implemented across the club, from the first-team to the academy.",
      "Sources have indicated there is a genuine desire on both sides to find some middle ground in contract negotiations but how much power Ten Hag will give up is interesting.",
      "United have spent over £1billion on transfers in the last 10 years and the scattergun recruitment strategy clearly hasn't worked. Ten Hag will argue his signings have been a success and will be reluctant to give up transfer influence but that is the best outcome for United.",
      "When he was appointed, Ten Hag didn't mince his words when discussing how important having control over transfers was, but he is in a weaker position in 2024 than in 2022, considering how poor last season was and that a new regime has implemented structural changes.",

      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",

      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",

With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",

      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "Jadon Sancho's time at Man United is coming to an end after his public disagreement with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

The club have also confirmed temporary adaptations will be made to the rest of the Carrington site to ensure players and staff from all teams can continue to operate successfully next season, which will be Erik ten Hag's third year in charge.",
      "United invested £10m to create a state-of-the-art women’s and academy building last summer and once the refurbishment of the men's building is complete, the spending will total £60m.",
      "Club sources have indicated the £50m will be drawn from the $300m fund that Sir Jim Ratcliffe committed for infrastructure as part of his acquisition of a minority stake.",
      "Ratcliffe said: “We want to create a world-class environment for our teams to win. When we conducted a thorough review of the Carrington training facilities and met with our men’s first-team players, it was clear the standards had fallen below some of our peers.",
      "\"This project will ensure Manchester United’s training ground is once more renovated to the highest standards. Lord Foster, a fellow Mancunian, has brought some great inspiration to the design, in conjunction with the Manchester United team and we look forward to seeing the improvement to the facilities but most importantly on the pitch.”",
      "Architect Lord Foster said: “We are delighted to lead the renewal of Manchester United’s training facility in Carrington. Our aim is to modernise and revitalise the building as a catalyst for future footballing success, creating spaces that inspire a culture of collaboration, unity and belonging.",
      "“As a proud Mancunian, it is a particular honour for me to see Foster & Partners given this responsibility and we will ensure that our design captures the spirit of industry, grit and ambition that exemplifies both Manchester and Manchester United.”",
      "United moved from The Cliff to Carrington in 2000 and the training ground was a world-class facility two decades ago, but it's fallen behind other facilities in recent years.",
      "The club have explored the possibility of buying nearby farming land to expand Carrington but could encounter issues with building football pitches on soil used for food production.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo publicly criticised Carrington in his interview with Piers Morgan in 2022. “Nothing changes. Not only the jacuzzi, the pool, even the gym. Even some points of technology, the kitchen, the chefs - who I appreciate, lovely people,\" he said.\"They stop in time, which surprised me a lot. I thought I would see different things: technology, infrastructure. Unfortunately, we see many things I’m used to seeing when I’m 21, 22, 23. It surprised me a lot.”",

      "Man Utd suffered an unrelenting injury crisis last season but some of their most important players have returned for international duty this summer.",
      "The key to Manchester United finding improvement under Erik ten Hag next season doesn't primarily lie with the manager's tactics, or how the summer transfer window unfolds, but what happens in the treatment room at Carrington.",
      "There were several factors involved as last season turned into an unmitigated disaster - until the final act - but chief among them was an injury crisis that left Ten Hag searching for solutions, particularly in defence.",
      "The Dutchman had to turn to numerous different combinations at the back, using 14 different partnerships at the centre of defence and going almost the entire campaign without a natural left-back. Had there been more stability in defence then there is no doubt performances would have been better.",
      "That makes it essential that the underlying reasons for such a desperate injury record are discovered and the necessary changes made. But before the squad return to pre-season training from July 8 onwards, Ten Hag and his coaches will cross their fingers that the players on international duty return without picking up any further injuries.",
      "Particular attention will be paid to Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw, the two players United missed more than any others last season. Martinez managed just 14 appearances last season and Shaw 15, with neither playing more than 1,175 minutes.",
      "Crucially for Argentina and England, they have recovered from club seasons disrupted by injury to represent their nations at the Copa America and European Championship respectively. That they enter those tournaments relatively fresh will be encouraging for their countries and if they get through them unscathed United might benefit, but they will desperately hope they do get through them.",
      "There will be plenty of eyes on Shaw, who hasn't played for United since February 18 and has a history of picking up injuries. If he is fit enough to play in England's second group game it will be four months since he last kicked a ball competitively and while he is the only natural left-back in England's squad they need to treat him with caution.",
      "Martinez returned to fitness in time to play for United towards the end of the season and his presence in the FA Cup final team made a major difference to the performance level. He is the most aggressive centre-back in the squad, excellent in defending one-on-one and also the best ball player at the back. The balance he brings is vital to the way United build up play.",
      "Martinez probably edges Shaw as the player most missed by United last season and having suffered muscle injuries as well as a recurrence of his foot problem, there will be a focus on how he gets through a busy tournament with Argentina, who kick off their Copa America campaign next Friday.",
      "They play Canada, Peru and Chile in the group stages in the United States and could play a further three knockout matches before the final on July 14. Argentina will be guaranteed the six games if they reach the semi-finals, with a third and fourth-place play-off on the final weekend.",
      "A run that deep would delay Martinez's return to pre-season training but it is more important for United he comes through it fit and in form. After such a quiet 2023/24, they will be content to grant him a couple of weeks off in July and will be desperately hoping he is fit and firing to start the next domestic season.",
      "Ten Hag won't want to do without his former Ajax centre-back again.",

      "But the Manchester Evening News understands the Toffees are set to turn down the offer of £35m plus £8m in add-ons - with United believing all add-ons are achievable if Branthwaite reaches his full potential - which falls well short of their valuation for the highly-rated defender.",
      "United made the offer on Friday as they stepped up their pursuit of Branthwaite, who is a leading target this summer as the club aim to sign at least one central defender. If the two clubs can agree a deal then personal terms will be a formality.",
      "They remain some way apart in their valuations at the moment, however, and Everton deemed United's opening offer unacceptable. Branthwaite is one of several central defenders under consideration at Old Trafford this summer as Erik ten Hag seeks to beef up that area of the team.",
      "Raphael Varane will leave the club when his contract expires this month and Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire could be sold if offers come in. United have monitored Juventus defender Gleison Bremer, Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba and have an interest in highly-rated Lille teenager Leny Yoro.",
      "Branthwaite is the principal target for now, however, and United could return with a new offer for the player who made his England debut this month but was cut from Gareth Southgate's 26-man squad for the European Championship.",
      "He was one of the stars of Everton's Premier League survival last term, scoring three times in 35 games as he impressed in his first full domestic campaign in the top flight. Branthwaite spent the 2022/23 season on loan at PSV Eindhoven.",

      "But an initial bid of £35m has been rejected by the Toffees who deemed the offer to be 'unacceptable', The Athletic reports.",
      "United are set to add another centre-back following the departure of Raphael Varane at the end of his contract this month. If the club do not extend Jonny Evans' deal, it would leave four senior central defenders in the squad, with Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire and Willy Kambwala the quartet.",
      "Although some may say that four or five is enough, last season United were forced to use Casemiro at centre-back due to an injury crisis and the Red Devils are no doubt keen to ensure that doesn't happen very often again. It's why Branthwaite has emerged as a serious option to bolster their back-line.",
      "Everton look set to sell one of their main assets before the end of June to stay in line with Premier League profit and sustainability rules, though they do not want to part ways with him below the £70million valuation.",
      "United are not the only team tracking his situation, with Tottenham and Manchester City both among his potential suitors. It's no surprise that more than just United are interested in Branthwaite, however, after the England international enjoyed an excellent season at Everton under Sean Dyche.",
      "Having spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan with PSV, Branthwaite returned to the Toffees and almost immediately knocked Michael Keane out of the side to partner James Tarkowski. That duo, alongside Jordan Pickford, gave the Toffees a solid base which helped them be the fourth-meanest defence in the Premier League.",
      "In fact, Everton conceded 51 goals in 38 top-flight fixtures, with only Arsenal (29), Manchester City (34) and Liverpool (41) shipping fewer. However, the Toffees did keep the second-most clean sheets in the division with 13, only behind Arsenal (18). Branthwaite started 35 league matches last season.",
      "There is no doubt Branthwaite was one of the standout defenders in the Premier League. He averaged 1.9 tackles, 1.4 interceptions, one block and 4.5 clearances per match in the 2023/24 campaign - with Branthwaite featuring near the top for centre-backs in each of those categories.",
      "Defensively, Branthwaite has proved himself. Standing at 6\"4, he is a commanding and strong central defender with a great leap and is excellent at winning his duels. He has also got a fast burst of acceleration which allows him to reach optimal speed when in a foot race with quick attackers.",
      "On the ball, Branthwaite is composed and would fit straight into the XI at Old Trafford. He averaged 39 passes per match with a success rate of 80 per cent in the Premier League last season. Although Everton are not predominately a possession-based side, Branthwaite showed his capabilities on the ball.",
      "His goal threat came in handy, too, as Branthwaite scored three goals last season. His first came in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham in February, bundling home a loose ball from close-range. That was followed up with a terrific strike against Brighton and a neat finish in the win over Liverpool. He was unfortunate not to score more, with Branthwaite often providing a handful in the air from set pieces.",
      "There is a lot to like about Branthwaite, who has age on his side compared to other alternatives and also has the capacity to improve and become even better.",

      "Erik ten Hag is to stay on as Man United manager after discussions with Ineos chiefs but recruitment could remain a big issue this summer.",
      "Over the last couple of years it has looked like Erik ten Hag has had free reign when it comes to dictating Manchester United's transfer strategy. Rarely did the approach deviate from players he has worked with or players attached to the Sports Entertainment Group of his agent, Kees Vos.",
      "Ten Hag might not have held the pursestrings but he held the power, with Vos heavily involved in supplying players to the United first-team. Lisandro Martinez, Tyrell Malacia, Antony, Wout Weghorst Andre Onana, Sofyan Amrabat, Rasmus Hojlund. The connections to Ten Hag, Vos or the Eredivisie were everywhere.",
      "Those close to the process have always insisted there is a perfectly fair explanation for this. United were revamping their recruitment department when Ten Hag arrived and the Dutchman felt he could better trust his judgement as he built a squad to challenge.",
      "When he did want a player, the recruitment department would create a shortlist of five options to be presented to Ten Hag and football director John Murtough. The manager was essentially free to pick his preference from that list and it regularly included the players he had associations with.",
      "In the case of some, that was hardly surprising, and there are successes there. Ten Hag pushed for the signing of Martinez from Ajax when the recruitment department preferred to go for Villarreal's left-footed centre-back Pau Torres. But there are failures too, most notably the £86million spent on Antony, who has rarely looked like coming close to fulfilling that price tag.",
      "Now, as Ten Hag enters his third summer window and looks to build on the £400m he has spent across the previous two, the dynamic is changing. It will almost certainly shift again before January.",
      "His current contract allows a veto on transfers and whether that remains will be a key part of contract discussions going forward. Either way, Ten Hag will want a substantial say in recruitment.",
      "Before starting work at United he said in an interview in Holland that \"control in transfers is a condition for me.\" Ineos want to get away from that model and eventually control in recruitment will be the responsibility of sporting director Dan Ashworth.",
      "In his absence this summer it is technical director Jason Wilcox who will lead the window, supported by director of football negotiations Matt Hargreaves and deputy football director Andy O'Boyle, who has impressed Sir Dave Brailsford.",
      "Ineos want to give Ten Hag their backing having settled on keeping faith with him now, but there is also a sense that faith only stretches so far. They won't want to let the 54-year-old dominate the window if he doesn't elicit improvements next season and is dispensed with.",
      "That is the culture Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to get away from. It's why he's ripped up the football structure since his investment into the club was confirmed in February. It's also why bringing in his own man would have allowed the dynamics of power to be clearly defined.",
      "Instead, Ineos have to make it work with Ten Hag and Wilcox. They must find common ground this summer. The days of a five-man shortlist might be over but the window will present different challenges this summer. Ten Hag is unlikely to get it all his own way.",

      "Having played 90 minutes in all but one of his 35 Premier League appearances this season, the 21-year-old was also included in Gareth Southgate's provisional 33-man England squad ahead of the European Championships but was cut from the group as one of the seven players to not make it into the final 26.",
      "Following the departure of Raphael Varane at the end of the season, and the likely upcoming exit of Jonny Evans at the end of his contract, Erik ten Hag's priority this season must be to bolster up his defensive ranks after their calamitous displays throughout the past few months.",
      "Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof and Willy Kambwala would be the remaining quartet of centre-backs and it's clear now the Dutchman seeks to add Branthwaite to that list. With Everton also in financial trouble, it'd be no surprise to see them cash in on the star this summer in order to both balance out their books in terms of the Premier League's PSRs (Profit and Sustainability Regulations) as well as drum up some funds amid an ownership crisis that saw their prospective deal with 777 Partners fall through rapidly.",
      "The Toffees are said to hold Branthwaite in the same class as the likes of Maguire, who United splashed £80m on to bring him over from Leicester City back in 2019, and are likely to want to command a similar fee from the Red Devils after their primary new investor Sir Jim Ratcliffe confirmed Ten Hag would stay as manager this week.",
      "So with all that said, we've taken a look at the latest on the future of the Branthwaite-United saga this summer.",
      "Manchester United have formally submitted a £35m bid for Branthwaite, with Everton set to swiftly reject the offer. It's long been believed the Toffees will command a fee of at least £70m for the star after his performances under Sean Dyche led him to Gareth Southgate's 33-man provisional England squad for the Euros.",
      "Sean Dyche has already claimed he doesn't want to let the youngster go this summer, with the star having been such a pivotal part of his side's victorious fight against relegation this season.",
      "Speaking in March, he said: “We don’t want to sell any good players. It’s as simple as that and he’s proven to be a very good player. We’re not in the business of trying to sell players.",
      "\"You only sell players if you have to sell players or there’s a problem. There’s no problem, therefore I’m just hoping we don’t need to sell players. At the minute, we certainly don’t so we will see.",
      "\"What I saw of him, I liked. When the timing was right, I thought ‘go on then, go and enjoy it, go and have a go’. I didn’t have to say anything to him, just go and play. He’s adapted well.",
      "\"There are things he still needs to work on, but you unravel a player slowly, you can’t just fast-track everything into them and say ‘that’s it’. So while he’s developing nicely and while he’s learning, sometimes the hardest thing is not to coach at all when you just step away and go ‘no, no, you’re fine, you keep doing what you’re doing’.\"",
      "Reports seem to suggest that following discussions between the two camps, they have come to an agreement on personal terms but that there is still a large gap in between United's valuation of the player and Everton's which could hold the deal from going through in the next few days at least.",
      "With United's bid of £35m being around half of what Everton would ideally want for the star, it seems as though there's a lot more to be done at the negotiating table between the two clubs before Branthwaite truly has his say on the ordeal.",
      "Earlier in the season, when asked about the rumours of a potential move to Man United, Branthwaite simply shrugged off the comments and reiterated his focus to keeping Everton in the Premier League for next season.",
      "Speaking in April, he said: \"You have just got to block it all out. I think if you focus on the outside stuff, you get distracted from what you need to do on the pitch.\"",

      "Jose Mourinho and Paul Scholes were embroiled in a bitter spat while the Special One managed Manchester United, with the latter continually critiquing the legendary Portuguese",
      "Managers are no strangers to being targeted by footballers-turned-pundits.",
      "Few choose to retaliate, let alone engage in a full-blown war of words, particularly when managing one of the world's biggest clubs. Enter Jose Mourinho, the Special One, or rather, the Moody One, as he appeared increasingly agitated towards the end of his tenure as Manchester United manager.",
      "Mourinho began his stint at Old Trafford as he had everywhere else, by winning trophies in the form of the EFL Cup and the Europa League in the 2016/17 season. Yet as United's performance waned in the following seasons, his erratic outbursts and conflicts with players began to draw negative attention.",
      "No one was more critical than Red Devils legend Paul Scholes. Throughout the remainder of Mourinho's tenure, until his sacking in December 2018, the retired midfielder and United boss became embroiled in a very public feud.",
      "Tensions seemed to originate from Scholes' growing dissatisfaction with United's poor results during the 2017/18 season. After a 0-0 draw with Southampton halfway through the campaign, the Englishman criticised £90million signing Paul Pogba, accusing him of \"strolling through games\".",
      "He also targeted Mourinho, claiming that Pogba was being used in a role he was uncomfortable with and stating that the manager \"has to take responsibility for that\".",
      "Mourinho didn't take Scholes' comments lightly and hit back during a press conference in January 2018, saying: \"I think the only thing Paul Scholes does is criticise. I don't think he comments, he criticises which is different.",
      "\"He was a phenomenal player - that doesn't mean we all have to be phenomenal. Pogba tries his best all the time and sometimes he plays very well, sometimes he doesn't play so well. It's not Pogba's fault that he made much more money than Paul Scholes.",
      "\"He [Scholes] will go down in history as a phenomenal player. Not as a pundit. I prefer to look at him as a phenomenal player who gave so much to the club I am proud to represent. If Paul one day becomes a manager, I wish he can be 25 per cent as successful as myself. 25 per-cent is around six trophies. He will be quite happy.\"",
      "United finished second in the league that season, though they were 19 points behind Manchester City's Centurions and ended up without a trophy. Scholes took aim at Mourinho's defensive style after a disappointing pre-season, stating he \"hated what he was seeing”.",
      "Speaking told beIN Sports in July 2018: “He doesn't look happy to me. It's a team that grinds out results rather than really impresses you. That's probably what he's happy with. If I was a manager, or if anyone else was the manager of Man United, they would hate what they were seeing. And it would be different.",
      "\"The most important thing to him is results. Last year was a disappointing year, not to win a trophy. The way they performed in the league wasn't at the standard required. Every year when Manchester United don't win something, it's a disaster.”",
      "Mourinho and his team endured a challenging start to the 2018/19 season, going on a three-game winless streak in October that ended in a loss at West Ham. Scholes at this point continued with his scathing assessment of the Portuguese manager’s leadership while appearing as a BT Sport pundit.",
      "The former England star fumed: “I'm actually sat here surprised that he survived after Saturday, the performance was that bad. Attitude and performance. It just wasn't anywhere near... he's coming out in press conferences and he's constantly having a go at players. He's having a go at people above him because he's not getting what he wants. I think his mouth is probably out of control and he's embarrassing the club.\"",
      "When questioned about Scholes’ comments in a press conference, Mourinho interrupted a reporter by saying: \"I don't need to know what he said. He says what he wants to say. I'm not interested.\" Asked whether he thought Scholes had crossed the line, Mourinho replied: \"Freedom of speech. Free country. He can say what he wants.\"",
      "Scholes suddenly seemed to change his stance on Mourinho, then 55, backing him to turn things around just days later after a defeat against Juventus in the Champions League group stages. He stated: \"No I wouldn't change him. He has the experience to turn it around. The last couple of weeks he's been different. His attitude has been better towards players.\"",
      "However, any hope of burying the hatchet was short-lived as Scholes soon resumed his scathing comments, targeting Mourinho's controversial ear-cupping celebration after a 2-1 victory Juventus at the Allianz Stadium, which sparked the fury of opposition defender Leonardo Bonucci.",
      "Scholes commented: \"This is everywhere he goes. You need to win with a bit of class sometimes, shake the manager's hand. I don't think there's any need for it but that's the way he is.\"",
      "Mourinho was finally dismissed on December 18, 2018, having made little progress despite £400m worth of investment in the squad. Months later, an unemployed Mourinho made a thinly-veiled jibe at both Scholes and Gary Neville regarding their brief and unsuccessful managerial stints at Oldham and Valencia, respectively.",
      "“We have even in England, former top players, amazing in front of the screen,\" Mourinho said in an interview with RT. \"They go to football clubs, and after two months, goodbye, let's go home because this is not right for us. So there are things, you have it or you don't have it.”",
      "Scholes returned the favour when Mourinho was in charge of Tottenham Hotspur, claiming that the Portuguese had \"dropped down a level\". He said: \"I think he's done all right but that's the club he's at now. He's not at a club where they are expected to win leagues.”",

      "The Frenchman will officially leave Old Trafford at the end of this month when his contract expires on June 30. His impending exit will leave Rasmus Hojlund as the only recognised senior striker on the club's books.",
      "United accept the Dane, despite scoring 16 goals in his maiden season at Old Trafford, needs a degree of competition. Martial missed most of the 2023/24 campaign, meaning the former Atalanta ace was unable to lean on any substantial support.",
      "It also meant that United, when Hojlund was unavailable through injury, did not have a like-for-like replacement they could call upon. Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford were sometimes deployed at the forefront of United's attack.",
      "In a bid to resolve that problem, United have made signing a striker one of their leading objectives. They accept they need a new No.9 and must find a suitable replacement for Martial.",
      "David, who scored 26 goals for Lille in 2023/24, has been linked with a move to Old Trafford at various junctures over the last couple of years and his contract status means he could be a viable option this summer; he has just 12 months remaining on his current deal in France. He has been linked with other clubs such as Chelsea, Napoli and Roma.",
      "Scoring 52 goals over the last two seasons in France, the attacker is on the brink of breaking into the category of being classed as an elite-level goal-getter. As a result, he is being linked with some of Europe's top leagues and he has already confessed that he can picture himself playing in England.",
      "Speaking back in 2022, David said: \"In England, when I watch the matches, everything is full each time. As a player, it motivates you even more.",
      "\"I don't know, I think it's possible, very possible [I could play in England one day]. I don't know if I can find myself anywhere other than the Premier League.",
      "\"It could well be the Premier League. It's a very nice atmosphere.\"",
      "He added: \"I am aware of nothing. When I am at the World Cup I am just focused on trying to enjoy the World Cup and enjoying the moment.",
      "\"What happens after I do not know, we will have to see. The Premier League is the best league in the world and I think every player would want to play there some day.\"",
      "David, who has been included in Canada's squad for the upcoming Copa America, could be available in a reduced-price deal this summer because of his contract status. However, the fact Erik ten Hag's preferred formation features just one striker could be a sticking point.",
      "David will not be prepared to come to Old Trafford and sit on the bench every week, watching Hojlund continue as chief striker. That is the main obstacle United will have to overcome when trying to strengthen their forward line this summer, regardless of who they attempt to bring in.",

      "Man Utd are keeping Erik ten Hag in charge but how contract negotiations develop will provide a fascinating insight into what comes next.",
      "How far, then, is either side willing to bend? That is going to be crux of the matter for Erik ten Hag and Ineos over the next few weeks as they seek to find some more common ground.",
      "Tuesday’s decision to stick with Ten Hag had felt like it was coming and it provides clarity heading into the summer, with the transfer window officially opening on Friday. It was inevitable that if the end-of-season review resulted in Ten Hag staying, a new contract had to be on the table.",
      "Contract talks usually centre around two things: Money and the length of any deal. On this occasion, those details aren’t likely to tax the parties involved. Instead, it will be about how this job is structured.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe hasn’t exactly hidden his desire to draw up a very different football structure at Old Trafford. But Ineos inherited something of a traditional, old-school manager and now they have decided to stick with him. Where do we go from here?",
      "These issues will be thrashed out in talks over the next few weeks. The first indication of how they’ve gone will be when the extension is announced in a press release. ‘Erik ten Hag has signed a new contract as Manchester Unitedmanager’, or ‘Erik ten Hag has signed a new contract as Manchester United head coach’.",
      "Ratcliffe’s ideal model is, at least on paper, in place. Omar Berrada as chief executive, Dan Ashworth as sporting director and Jason Wilcox as technical director. Ashworth oversees the football department and a head coach reports to him.",
      "But if there is an ideal flow chart for the structure sketched out in the Ineos offices, it will need to change. With his current contract, Ten Hag has at least as much power as Ashworth would, when he finally gets to Manchester.",
      "Ten Hag has always insisted control over transfers is absolutely essential for him and he is unlikely to give that up easily in contract talks. If the veto remains in the 54-year-old’s deal then it weakens Ashworth’s hand and goes against the grain for Ineos.",
      "Ten Hag seems to hold the better hand heading into talks after the last two weeks, but then he will be aware that being too intransigent won’t help his cause in the long term. There is a willingness on all sides to find a solution and the Dutchman is likely to accept he will have to bend a little.",
      "Will that be enough for Ineos? Having been so public in trying to outline a new structure, to bring the best people in but then stick with a powerful manager would be a strange compromise. Ratcliffe could accept that he can only turn to the head coach model when he appoints Ten Hag’s successor, whenever that will be.",
      "That doesn’t tend to be Ratcliffe’s style, however, and while the delay of the past two weeks hasn’t reflected well on Ineos, the zeal with which Ratcliffe has approached the task since February has generally been very impressive.",
      "These negotiations will take place behind closed doors but one insider described them as an “interesting dance” after confirmation came that Ten Hag is staying. Who will give up the most? A solution will be found but at least one party will have to give something up.",
      "It is entirely possible that Ten Hag retains his power but quickly builds up a strong relationship with Berrada, Ashworth and Wilcox. He worked well with previous football director John Murtough and had an excellent relationship with Ajax’s sporting director Marc Overmars.",
      "There is a suspicion those relationships stayed so strong because Ten Hag got what he wanted. He might not find the Ineos structure quite as accommodating but the ultimate ambition for both parties is the same.",
      "Ten Hag felt United were making up ground in many departments when he started in May 2022. Now, they have a football operations department that, once everyone is in place, looks equipped to drive the club forward. How the manager - or head coach - fits into that will be fascinating.",

      "Manchester United have sorted their first key decision of the summer in keeping Erik ten Hag and now the focus turns to the transfer window and who stays and leaves",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has been entrusted to steer the club forward next season after INEOS' season review concluded.",
      "It has been a disruptive couple of weeks for the Reds but it ultimately feels like the correct decision has been made. There is a severe lack of managers who would be noticeably better than Ten Hag and another summer of disruption is the last thing United need.",
      "But now that the dust is beginning to settle on the season review saga, the focus must now turn to the summer transfer window and having lost a fortnight already, Ten Hag will be looking to act fast. Here is what MEN Sport expects the Dutchman to do next at Old Trafford.",
      "Ultimately there will be a few players that United will want to sell in the summer transfer window but one that will be at the top of Ten Hag's list will be Casemiro. The Dutchman did sign the former Real Madrid man but he will be aware that the Brazilian's performances were not up to the standard needed this season.",
      "A move to Saudi Arabia seems the most likely option at this stage with a reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo high on both players' wishlist. But the question will come as to whether or not the likes of Al Nassr or Al Ahli will be open to paying a good fee to capture the defensive midfielder.",
      "Over the weekend it became clear that Jarrad Branthwaite is on United's radar and the Reds are becoming confident they will sign him. MEN Sport understands Ratcliffe and Co. do not want to be held to ransom over a price tag for the Englishman but if they want to add him to the squad they may have to pay around £75m.",
      "At his age, the Toffees' centre-back could be the ideal future investment and fits the bill for what INEOS wants the club to be doing. He would also fill the gap left behind by Raphael Varane and offer good competition for Harry Maguire in the battle to partner Lisandro Martinez.",
      "When Ronaldo left in November 2022 few would have thought it would take until the summer of 2024 to finally solve the issue of replacing him. Wout Weghorst's signature was a stop-gap and the decision to only bring Rasmus Hojlund in when Anthony Martial was firmly out of favour was unwise.",
      "Now, United must sign one if not two centre-forwards to strengthen their squad. Who they will be is up for debate at this stage but Brentford's Ivan Toney could appeal to United, especially if he performs well at the European Championships.",

      "Former Premier League defender Jose Enrique believes a Manchester United departure could benefit Marcus Rashford.",

After hitting the heights in his early career, he has struggled within Erik ten Hag's side following the emergence of Alejandro Garnacho, which has left the England international swapping out of his natural left-wing position into a central role.",
      "Rashford was in the headlines throughout United's worst English top-flight performance in 30 years after enduring spells on the bench and out of the squad. As a result of his form, Gareth Southgate opted against selecting Rashford in his 33-man preliminary squad ahead of the Three Lions' European Championships campaign in Germany.",
      "The attacker has spoken out defiantly against questions over his commitment to United and cut an emotional figure after their FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City, last month. However, Enrique feels that Rashford's career could be boosted with a move abroad citing the likes of Barcelona and Bayern Munich as possible destinations.",
      "\"Rashford needs to leave Manchester United – a move abroad may help him,\" he told Grosvenor Sports. \"Enrique was also asked about Manchester United's Marcus Rashford, who has been linked to a move away from Old Trafford and was left out of Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024.",
      "\"I think Marcus Rashford needs to leave Manchester United. I think he needs to move to another country, Germany or Spain perhaps. Especially if Joao Felix doesn’t continue at Barcelona, Rashford could definitely go and play on that left side.",

      "Speaking on Reach's new Euro Thrash podcast – which you can find on YouTube, Apple and Spotify – Brown said that once the two players returned to Manchester United after the fallout between England and Portugal, the pair simply 'got on with it'. Brown also added that a lot of the drama was instigated by the press but the lethal duo just carried on as usual.",
      "\"It's football and you do things in the heat of the moment. And you know what never happened? There was never one argument,\" Brown said. \"They just knew to get back to the club and to the be the best players in the world. And we just got on with it. The press took a lot out of it, but them two as individuals just got on with it because there's no point in keeping on with stuff when it's gone.\"",
      "The drama unfolded as the 2006 World Cup quarter final between Portugal and England was on a knife edge. Chaos then ensured after referee Horacio Marcelo Elizondo showed a red card to England's Wayne Rooney – but nobody was quite sure as to why. A replay then appeared to show that Rooney had stamped on Ricardo Carvalho. England were down to 10 men and ultimately lost the game on penalties, however the real controversy was in the moments following the red card.",
      "As Elizondo brandished the card, following protests from the Portugal side, a small fracas broke out with United team-mates Rooney and Ronaldo clashing. Following the mini flare-up Ronaldo then winked and the seemingly innocuous act was pounced upon by the media and fans alike as a sign that Ronaldo had succeeded in getting England's star player dismissed.",
      "Ronaldo quickly became public Enemy No.1 and the idea of the two United players meeting back at Carrington post World Cup became a huge talking point all summer. However Brown has admitted that despite Rooney's obvious disappointment, it had all blown over by the time the new season came around.",
      "\"Obviously Wayne would have been disappointed at the time. But when they all got back two, three, four weeks later, it had all gone by then,\" he said.",
      "Brown conceded that Ronaldo was trying to get Rooney sent off but also said that it was standard practice, and there was nothing more to be read into the wink other than it being business as usual for the two professionals. \"It was two lads and one was trying to get the other one sent off,\" Brown added.\"It's as simple as that. And then winking just to say, 'cheers mate, I see you in a few weeks back at the club'. That's honestly what happened and they just got on with it.\"",

      "Ten Hag exiled Sancho from the United first-team squad for the majority of the first-half of the season following an incident after their defeat at Arsenal last September. Sancho accused Ten Hag of not telling the truth about his absence from the squad that lost at the Emirates. The Dutchman had claimed it was down to the poor training performances from Sancho.",
      "Sancho issued a fiery statement hitting out at his manager, telling people to \"not believe everything they read\" and that he was a \"scapegoat\". In response, Ten Hag banned Sancho from first-team training facilities and issued him to train by himself. The 24-year-old trained on his own up until January before forcing himself a move to Borussia Dortmund on loan for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "It was a move that has reignited his career. Sancho has been rejuvenated ever since his switch to the Signal Iduna Park, helping Dortmund reach the Champions League final. He netted three goals and added three assists in 24 appearances for the German club.",
      "But Sancho is set for a return to Manchester as the club decides the next step for Sancho. Reports circulated last week suggesting that Sancho would be open to continuing his career at Old Trafford if Ten Hag is axed, with the Dutchman then facing major uncertainty over his future.",
      "However, it was confirmed on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos have decided to keep Ten Hag at the helm ahead of the 2024/25 season, following an end-of-season review. That decision is set to see Sancho push for another move away from the club, whether that be on loan or in a permanent deal.",
      "On Sunday, reports claimed that United want £40million to sanction the departure of Sancho this summer. That is a far cry from the £73m they paid Dortmund three years ago.",
      "Interested parties might even try and lower that valuation now they know Ten Hag doesn't want him and United are not going for a change of manager - meaning the Reds could lose out on millions.",
      "Dortmund want to sign Sancho once again on loan, while Juventus have been linked with a move for the England international.

      "United have Lindelof, Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at the club, with Jonny Evans out of contract this summer and it remains to be seen if an extension will be agreed. Raphael Varane is set to depart as a free agent, and United are known to be looking at signing at least one centre-back this summer before any departures are factored into the situation.",

      "David recorded a league ratio better than a goal-every-other-game last season while defender Yoro has attracted the eye of several big clubs.",
      "Lille president Olivier Letang has told Manchester United that Jonathan David is available for transfer this summer, as is defender Leny Yoro.",
      "United have been linked with Canada attacker David amid their search for a new striker. Rasmus Hojlund is now the only natural centre-forward at the club with Anthony Martial leaving upon the end of his contract this month.",
      "David, 24, scored 26 goals in 47 matches across all competitions for Lille last season, and finished as the second highest scorer in Ligue 1 with 19 strikes in 34 outings. The forward only has 12 months remaining on his deal and a renewal with his current employers is unlikely to be agreed.",
      "Lille president Letang has in fact told David that he can leave this summer with the club at risk of seeing him leave for nothing if not sold within the next two windows.",
      "The same message has been shared with Leny Yoro, who is said to be attracting interest from United and other Premier League clubs although Real Madrid are said to be leading the way.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Letang said: \"Leny Yoro and Jonathan David can leave the club this summer. Both have the 'exit voucher' due to their contract situation.\"",
      "It’s thought the phrase ‘exit voucher’ refers to the 12 months left on their deals, rather than a release clause - despite reports mooting that David has one. Any deal for the forward could be delayed by his inclusion in Canada’s squad for their inaugural Copa America campaign this summer.",
      "Canada begin their tournament against Lisandro Martinez’s Argentina on Friday with their final group match taking place on June 30, while the knockout phase takes place over the proceeding two weeks.",

      "\"It's a sign that people expect a lot from the national team and it means that we have the quality to do more, we know that and in this game, we have the opportunity to rectify it.\"",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo will wear the captain's armband for Portugal at this summer's tournament in Germany, but Manchester United's captain is set to play a crucial role.",
      "Although Portugal are the bookies' fourth favourites to win Euro 2024, shrewd judges have backed them to go far in the tournament. Portugal need Fernandes to enjoy an excellent tournament to make the final and perhaps a sprinkling of stardust from a 39-year-old Ronaldo.",
      "The good news for Portugal is Fernandes enjoyed a wonderful season for United and enters the tournament with a point to prove, as he wants a new contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes' deal with United expires in the summer of 2026 and there's an option for another year, but he's thought to want better terms that reflect his importance to the team.",
      "There's no player in the United dressing room who has greater importance than Fernandes. He's been the most consistent performer since signing from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020 and delivered strong displays last season in a struggling side that finished eighth in the table.",
      "United would have finished even lower in the Premier League without Fernandes and his absence was felt when he succumbed to injury for the first time in his club career in May. Fernandes returned for the final home game of the season against Newcastle and United won.",
      "Fernandes makes the difference when he plays and thankfully for United he's been an ever-present in the last few years, avoiding injury when others have picked up issues.",
      "The midfielder has regularly played through pain and joked in the mixed zone after the win against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals that his robustness was down to his parents.",
      "\"I just have to be grateful for my father and my mum because they made me the right way, the strong way,\" he laughed. Fernandes' parents will be closely following him as he represents his nation at Euro 2024 in Germany and it wouldn't be a surprise to see him pick up another individual award.",
      "Fernandes won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for a third time last season and has an opportunity to win the Player of the Tournament at Euro 2024.",
      "The Euros begin on Friday night and Portugal will play their first game on Tuesday against the Czech Republic. After that opening game, they will face Turkey and Georgia, and reaching the final should be easier - providing they win Group F - because of their side of the bracket.",
      "Portugal will likely play Hungary, Croatia or Serbia in the Round of 16, the Netherlands in the quarter-finals and Spain or Germany in the semi-finals. They are expected to go deep into the competition and Fernandes will be in contention to win Player of the Tournament if they do.",
      "Fernandes is equally important for Portugal and United. Since he arrived in the Premier League, no player has created more chances or big chances and he's consistently produced goals and assists when United have needed him most, so he will influence how far Portugal progress.",
      "He will be at the heart of everything Portugal do in Germany. That will place Fernandes in the shop window - more than he already is - and United must tie him down to a new deal to prevent clubs like Bayern Munich and Inter Milan from acting on their interest in signing him.",
      "Fernandes should enjoy a superb Euro 2024 and he must be a United player when next season starts.",

      "The summer transfer window officially opens today, which means Man United can begin to make sales and sign new players.",
      "Premier League clubs can officially begin trading in the summer transfer window.",
      "This summer's window will run between June 14 and August 30 and Manchester United will look to strengthen their squad after a disappointing 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United finished eighth in the league and recorded a minus goal difference, but Erik ten Hag will remain in charge and get the opportunity to build on his first two years.",
      "Ten Hag has spent over £400million in two summer windows and the early suggestion is United will have £50m to spend in this window. There will have to be sales to offset other arrivals but, fortunately, there are sellable assets in the squad that can be disposed of.",
      "United will look to raise funds by clearing out players who are surplus to requirements and they must improve their record of selling players. Historically, United have struggled to offload unwanted players and to obtain decent fees, which needs to change under Sir Jim Ratcliffe's regime, so here is what United must achieve in the next few months...",
      "United must sign a new core of the team: a striker, a midfielder and a centre-back. They have budgeted for those positions and fans will be particularly excited about the prospect of signing a new striker because scoring goals makes more headlines than keeping clean sheets.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund scored 16 goals in 43 appearances, which represented a respectable return in his first season in England, but there were times when he struggled and that was to be expected",
      "The 21-year-old needs support and another forward will be brought in. United have been linked with Joshua Zirkzee, whose goals in Serie A helped the Bologna qualify for the Champions League against the odds. Bologna enjoyed their best season since 1967/1968, Zirkzee finished the campaign as their top goalscorer and he's said to have a release clause of £34m.",
      "Michael Olise, a boyhood United fan, has the profile of a player United would target, but he plays on the right wing and that position has received heavy investment in the last few years.",
      "The midfield was a huge problem last season and Casemiro's drop-off was a large contributing factor. However, there were structural issues caused by Ten Hag's tactics and the Dutchman must tighten up the midfield, which will be made easier by the signing of a No.6.",
      "United's priority in the market should be signing a quality defensive midfielder who can provide the level of defensive cover that Casemiro delivered during his first season. A player who possesses the discipline to play that role, someone who can thwart the danger, is crucial for how Ten Hag wants to play.",
      "In defence, Raphael Varane has left on a free transfer and Jonny Evans is in talks over a new deal. The defensive upheaval has begun and another centre-back is required this summer. United have shown an interest in Jarrad Branthwaite but Everton value him between £70 and £80m.",
      "Although Braithwaite's potential is vast, there is better value in the market and United will have to spend intelligently in the window considering their stretched budget.",
      "There have been a handful of players whose departures on free transfers have already been confirmed and their exits will help to generate room in a bloated wage bill.",
      "It will also help create room for new signings, as will sales of players like Victor Lindelof, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro; Hannibal Mejbri, Donny van de Beek, Facundo Pellistri; Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood. They will be key in raising money to sign fresh arrivals.",
      "Lindelof joined United in 2017 and has entered the final year of his contract, as the one-year extension in his deal was triggered in December. The defender has been a useful squad player, but he's below the quality to start every week for United and should be sold.",
      "Wan-Bissaka is also into the final year of his deal with United and could be sold this summer, so the club can obtain a fee for a player they signed for £50million from Crystal Palace in the summer of 2019. The logic in selling Wan-Bissaka this summer is that United can bank a fee and sign a better-balanced right-back, someone who can provide value in defence and attack.",
      "Casemiro was outstanding in his first season at United and awful in his second. His decline has been stark and he should be offloaded to Saudi Arabia if the opportunity is there.",
      "Hannibal is another in the final year of his contract. He recently spent time on loan with Sevilla, although the Spanish club didn't exercise their option to sign him permanently for £17m and his future needs to be addressed because he isn't good enough to regularly start for United.",
      "Donny van de Beek's nightmare continued at Eintracht Frankfurt and any permanent sale of the Dutchman would be good enough - it's been a shame to watch his decline unfold.",
      "Faundo Pellistri left on loan in January after spending the first half of the season with United. Again, the winger looked below the level required for a starting role at Old Trafford - he was limited to mostly substitute appearances - but should still raise a decent fee.",
      "United paid £9m to sign Pellistri from Penarol in 2020 and although he hasn't developed into a first-team starter, he's an Urguray international and still only 22 years old.",
      "Jadon Sancho retains value after his loan with Borussia Dortmund and a bid in the region of £30m for him would be acceptable. United must act swiftly and arrange Mason Greenwood's next move because their conclusion that 'he should continue his career elsewhere' remains true.",
      "Ten Hag signed Tyrell Malacia, Christian Eriksen, Lisandro Martinez, Antony and Casemiro in his first summer in charge and only the latter arrived without having once played in the Eredivisie.",
      "Mason Mount, Andre Onana, Rasmus Hojlund, Altay Bayindir and Jonny Evans were signed permanently last summer, which means six of the ten players permanently signed on Ten Hag's watch have history in the Eredivisie.",
      "United must move away from predominantly signing players with Eredivisie pedigree. Only Casemiro, Hojlund, Evans and Bayindir haven't played in the division on the list of Ten Hag's permanent signings and anyone who has watched the Eredivisie will know the standard is a world away from the Premier League.",
      "It's inadvisable to operate with such a Dutch-heavy influenced transfer policy and that explains why the club's recruitment has continued to be hit-and-miss.",
      "Bruno Fernandes attracted interest from Bayern Munich and Inter Milan ahead of the summer transfer window and discussed his future after the final home game of the season.",
      "\"I will be here until I've said, the club needs to want me,\" said Fernandes. \"I feel the club wants me to be part of the future, so as I said, I don't want to be a player the club doesn't want to have. If for some reason they don't want to have me, I will go... but.\"",
      "Fernandes was pulled away by Ten Hag before he could finish his answer. He wants a new contract - his current deal expires in 2026 and has the option of another year - that reflects his importance to the team and United must do everything they can to tie him down.",
      "Although the 29-year-old is at the stage of his career when he could be tempted by a title-challenging club in Europe, he is settled in Manchester and must be kept.",
      "Since Fernandes arrived in the Premier League, no player has created more chances or big chances and he's consistently produced goals and assists when United have needed him most.",

      "EXCLUSIVE: Man Utd have opened talks with Erik ten Hag over a new contract at Old Trafford and the discussions are likely to centre around two key issues.",
      "Erik ten Hag is reluctant to cede too much power over transfers at Manchester United as he prepares for contract talks with the club.",
      "Ineos have opted to keep Ten Hag in charge after an end-of-season review and with only a year left on his existing terms talks over an extension have commenced.",
      "While the financial package and the length of any deal will be key to those negotiations, the most important factor will be the concessions Ten Hag is willing to make when it comes to how Ineos want to redraw the football structure at Old Trafford.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has developed plans to change how the club operates, with a sporting director set to lead on recruitment and the head coach then reporting into that figure. Ratcliffe has also appointed a technical director - Jason Wilcox - to draw up a 'game model' for a playing style to be implemented across the club.",
      "But having opted to keep Ten Hag, Ineos must now convince the Dutchman to either fit into that structure or accept that he will maintain the power he has held for the previous two years. Talks over a new deal will thrash those issues out and sources have said there is a genuine desire on both sides to find some middle ground.",
      "Ten Hag was appointed United's manager in 2022 and sees himself as a traditional manager, who oversees all aspects of the football side of the business. That includes recruitment and in his two years at the club, he has been the key figure when it comes to the signing of new players as well as departures.",
      "That desire for control on recruitment led to Ten Hag having a veto on new signings written into his contract and that is likely to be a contentious sticking point during negotiations over a new deal, with Ratcliffe making it clear he wants to move away from a model that hands so much power to a manager.",
      "Talks over the next couple of weeks will focus on what each side is willing to give up as they seek to come to an agreement. Having seen Ineos speak to potential replacements before deciding to keep him, Ten Hag holds plenty of power heading into the negotiations and is set to be reluctant to lose control over transfers or accept a change in title to head coach.",
      "Ineos will hope to find some compromise with Ten Hag, rather than pushing back their plans to completely remodel the football structure to the next time the manager's position becomes vacant. If the two sides can't agree on terms then United do have an option to extend Ten Hag's contract by a further year.",
      "Ten Hag will be represented by his agent Kees Vos while for United, interim chief executive Jean-Claude Blanc and Ineos' director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford will be key figures during the talks. Blanc, Brailsford and technical director Wilcox led the end-of-season review that ended with the decision to stick with Ten Hag on Tuesday, with constructive talks taking place in person.",
      "A source said that Ten Hag never gave up hope that United would stick with him this summer and never lost faith that he remained the best man for the job, pointing to his record of two trophies in two seasons as evidence. But Ineos conducted their review without input from the 54-year-old and talks took place for the first time on Tuesday.",
      "Now Ten Hag will work with Wilcox on plans for the summer. United have identified Dan Ashworth as the sporting director but he is still on gardening leave and negotiations with Newcastle to secure his release remain complicated. Omar Berrada will replace Blanc as chief executive on July 13.",

      "Latest Manchester United transfer news and gossip with updates on Jadon Sancho's future and Erik ten Hag's coaching staff following the revelation that he is staying as manager",
      "Erik ten Hag is staying at Manchester United, and that means transfer business can fully kick into gear with the Reds needing plenty of signings and sales during the summer window.",
      "United need reinforcements all across the squad, but goals were particularly hard to come by last season with Ten Hag's side scoring just 57 Premier League goals during the 2023/24 campaign. Money will be tight for United this summer after missing out on Champions League football, but some key sales - such as Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood - could raise some serious funds to reinvest in the squad.",
      "While United are targeting at least one centre-back, a left-back and a central midfielder, a striker is also on the wishlist - but it won't be Benjamin Sesko, who has opted to sign a new contract at RB Leipzig despite reported interest from United, Chelsea and Arsenal. Ivan Toney has been repeatedly linked with a move to Old Trafford and with just a year remaining on his Brentford contract, the forward - currently at Euro 2024 with England - could be a smart option for the Reds.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT on Tuesday regarding his future, Toney said \"I'm a Brentford player. I have a year left [at Brentford]. Going into a major tournament, that is my main focus now. But after this, I'll be going back to Brentford and I will be a Brentford player still. It's nice to be linked with other clubs. But I've had this in the past. Nothing is done until it's done.\"",
      "When pressed on whether he is prepared for a big move if the call comes this summer, Toney replied: \"Obviously, if it was to come, I would be ready. But I’ve got to remain focused and not let other things and other noise get the best of me and just focus on what I need to do for my club.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Benni McCarthy has worked as an attacking coach for United since 2022 but is coming to the end of his contract this summer. While he admitted that he 'absolutely adores and loves' his role at United, he is itching to be a manager.",
      "According to The Times, Ten Hag would like United to hand McCarthy fresh terms after bringing him to Old Trafford in 2022. The Dutch boss sees the former FC Porto and Ajax forward as an integral part of his set-up at United.",
      "Elsewhere, Juventus are said to retain an interest in Jadon Sancho, who is set for an awkward reunion with Ten Hag. The 24-year-old spent the last six months on loan at his former club Borussia Dortmund and helped them to the Champions League final.",
      "Following the news that Ten Hag will remain as manager, there seems to be no future for Sancho at Old Trafford. Dortmund are unable to afford him on a permanent basis however, as they prefer to sign Ian Maatsen from Chelsea and also have Stuttgart striker Serhou Guirassy on their list.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, United have made Sancho available for a knockdown price of around £40million following his time on loan in Germany. They are trying to raise transfer funds to spend in the transfer market and also plan to sell Mason Greenwood.",

      "If Ten Hag had been sacked, he would have been remembered for winning two trophies in two seasons and reconnecting harmony between players and fans during an excellent first year in charge. He will get the opportunity to further build on that legacy instead.",
      "Ten Hag made a superb first impression and looked capable of dealing with the intricacies of the role, but many believed he'd become the fifth United boss to be sacked in the last 11 years after overseeing a joyless Premier League campaign that produced an eighth-placed finish.",
      "Ratcliffe's co-ownership is at the beginning of its journey and Ten Hag has been kept on the bus. Only time will reveal whether the right roads are taken, but there must be doubts the right decision has been made considering the large bank of evidence stacked against the case to keep him.",
      "United suffered a record number of defeats in a Premier League season and conceded their most goals in a campaign. Ten Hag oversaw a total of 19 defeats across all competitions in 2023/24 and that was the joint most since 1977/78 when United finished 10th in the table.",
      "The unwanted records have stacked up. United were out of Europe and the Carabao Cup before Christmas and only briefly flirted with Champions League qualification.",
      "Regardless of the outcome of the FA Cup final, a swift decision on Ten Hag was expected to be communicated and perhaps emotion crept into INEOS' season review process.",
      "It took more than two weeks after the FA Cup triumph to announce Ten Hag would be kept and many fans have been delighted at the news. Others who became in favour of sacking Ten Hag in the middle of a challenging season expect another season of mediocrity in the league.",
      "The truth is Ratcliffe had to make a ruthless decision on Ten Hag. It couldn't be decided on emotion - it had to be calculated - and a friendly handshake goodbye was required.",
      "Ten Hag wouldn't have been able to complain if he'd been sacked and it wouldn't have taken the gloss off what he achieved as United boss, particularly during his first year in charge.",
      "The power struggle with Ronaldo during the first months of Ten Hag's tenure was a test of his mettle. The eyes of the world were watching and his authority was challenged, but he saw Ronaldo off in no-nonsense fashion and the forward made an escape to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ronaldo's interview with Piers Morgan was an extraordinary episode and Ten Hag handled it with class. He didn't say a word during the ordeal and yet he was the biggest winner. Ten Hag's standing at Old Trafford was only enhanced by disposing of a petulant Ronaldo and his handling of one of football's all-time greats sent a clear message to the dressing room. United hired Ten Hag because he was a disciplinarian and he restored standards at Carrington.",
      "For too long, player power had festered and there was an unsatisfactory culture, but Ten Hag addressed those issues and reaped the awards on the pitch in his first season.",
      "After defeats against Brighton and Brentford in the opening two games of the season, there were suggestions United could finish in the bottom half of the table, but a 2-1 victory against Liverpool at Old Trafford came next and that provided a spark for the subsequent turnaround.",
      "Ten Hag approached the Premier League naively in his first two games, setting up United as he would with an Eredivisie side, but tweaked his tactics against Liverpool. A tactical compromise was settled on and Casemiro was signed, despite Frenkie de Jong being identified as the manager's first choice target at the start of the summer window.",
      "De Jong not coming to United was a blessing in disguise. The midfield would have continued to be a problem and it needed someone with the defensive presence of Casemiro, who provided cover to the defensive line and was exceptional in his first year in Manchester.",
      "Lisandro Martinez was another excellent arrival. The defender's skillset is unique and Ten Hag reiterated the importance of having a left-footed centre-back for build-up play.",
      "Martinez built a formidable partnership with Raphael Varane and with Casemiro sitting in front of the pair, United had a solid defensive foundation that was tough to break down. Marcus Rashford was scoring for fun at the other side of the pitch and there were some memorable wins.",
      "The victories against Manchester City and Barcelona at the beginning of 2023 were special results. The Manchester derby win was secured after quick-fire goals from Bruno Fernandes and Rashford and there was a stirring atmosphere at Old Trafford against Barcelona.",
      "The Carabao Cup final came a few days after that win in Europe and Ten Hag ended a six-year trophy drought by overseeing a comfortable 2-0 victory over Newcastle.",
      "\"We are still in a start to restore Man United to where they belong, which is winning trophies and this is the first one,\" said Ten Hag, whose popularity was at an all-time high.",
      "In the spring of 2023, United collapsed against Sevilla in the quarter-finals of the Europa League. Ten Hag looked incensed at that defeat, but a third-placed finish in the Premier League was secured and his first season in charge was considered a resounding success.",
      "Ten Hag signed Mason Mount, Andre Onana, Rasmus Hojlund, Altay Bayindir and Jonny Evans on permanent deals, which took his United spending beyond the £400million mark in two summer windows. Sofyan Amrabat and Sergio Reguilon were also signed on loan.",
      "The Dutchman received the heaviest backing of any other manager in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era and was given a large degree of influence over transfers, which led to an influx of players with Eredivisie pedigree, including the signing of Antony from Ajax for £86million.",
      "Further progress was expected but the wheels spectacularly fell off. United were fortunate to beat Wolves 1-0 on the opening day of the 2023/24 season - the midfield was too open and a flurry of shots were conceded - and that performance set the tone for the rest of the campaign.",
      "United conceded seven goals against Bayern Munich and Galatasaray in their opening two games of the Champions League group stage. They were forced to come from behind to win against Nottingham Forest, they lost against Brighton and Crystal Palace, and would have lost against Brentford at home if not for a remarkable Scott McTominay brace deep into added time.",
      "It became clear a few months into the season there were problems. There was a gap the size of the Grand Canyon in midfield and too many chances were being conceded. Jadon Sancho had already been banished from the first-team at that stage and Ten Hag correctly dealt with him.",
      "United were hammered 3-0 by Manchester City at the end of October and lost 3-0 against a third-string Newcastle team in the Carabao Cup just a few days later.",
      "By then, the United squad had been hit by injuries, but a makeshift Newcastle dominated the game with Paul Dummet and Emil Krafth at centre half. Casemiro's decline was becoming apparent, Martinez had been ruled out for three months and Rashford's goals had dried up.",
      "A 4-3 defeat against Copenhagen, a result that essentially condemned United to finish bottom of their Champions League group, came next and it was another example of reckless United, who comfortably had a 2-0 lead and somehow managed to lose the game.",
      "Rashford was sent off in the 42nd minute, but United conceded twice in quick succession before half-time and conceding in that manner became a theme of the campaign. The in-game management was awful and the questions for Ten Hag were beginning to mount.",
      "Even when United won matches, like their 2-1 win against Chelsea on December 6, they never did it convincingly and gave the impression they were just getting by. They conceded far too many chances and the lack of clear style and structure was a stick to beat Ten Hag with. Bournemouth also humiliated United at Old Trafford by winning 3-0 during the winter.",
      "After making a tactical compromise in his first season, Ten Hag was determined to usher in the next stage of his vision and Onana was signed to help execute that plan. Ten Hag wanted United to play a more expensive, front-foot style but it left huge space for the opposition to exploit.",
      "United suddenly looked like a poorly coached team and although Tottenham drew 2-2 at Old Trafford in January, the away side controlled the contest and played with a recognisable style, despite Ange Postecoglou not having his five best players in Spurs' squad available.",
      "The Reds had become reliant on moments of individual brilliance from their stars and that was an accusation Ole Gunnar Solskjaer faced during the final months of his tenure. United were supposed to progress in Ten Hag's second season but produced Solskjaer-esque displays instead.",
      "Ten Hag's tactics became heavily scrutinised and he pointed toward the injury list as results worsened. The injury crisis last season was unrelenting - United recorded over 60 separate cases of injury or illness - and it posed the kind of challenges a manager prays to never encounter.",
      "It was hard not to sympathise with Ten Hag, who had to pick a different defensive line almost every week and was forced to include youngsters from the academy in the squad. It's also understood INEOS' season review concluded injuries were concentrated in key positions.",
      "But Ten Hag didn't help himself. He failed to tactically adapt, couldn't address the gaping space in midfield and began to sound like a manager on his way out in post-match interviews. He spoke notably more upbeat after defeats and insisted there should be belief in his project.",
      "United enjoyed a five-game unbeaten streak between January and February. Hojlund found his groove in front of goal, Kobbie Mainoo was confirmed as one of Europe's brightest young talents and there was briefly a chance United could finish in the Champions League places.",
      "Ten Hag was brilliant for the development of Alejandro Garnacho and Mainoo and continued to give them starts, despite privately conceding they were being overplayed. Both players paid back the faith shown in them by their manager by scoring in the FA Cup final in May.",
      "In the weeks leading up to the FA Cup final and with Ratcliffe's investment having been made official, it felt like Ten Hag was on trial and the evidence against him was compelling. Brentford dominated United and it was a miracle the game ended as a 1-1 draw, there was a 4-3 loss against Chelsea, despite a win looking secured again, and a tepid performance against Bournemouth.",
      "A special victory against Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup came before that run of fixtures. That result will be remembered for decades and fans leaving Old Trafford on that evening floated through the exits, but it felt like a single performance wasn't going to decide Ten Hag's future.",
      "On that note, Ten Hag's tactics in the FA Cup final against City at Wembley were perfect, his team selection was emphatically vindicated and it was the finest win of his tenure, but it feels like the eight months before that triumph have been ignored. United were objectively awful.",
      "The semi-final win against Coventry City was chaotic and a symbol of everything that had gone wrong with his reign. United won the competition and that display didn't matter, but it suggested it would be a risk for INEOS to persist with Ten Hag into the new season.",
      "Ten Hag has been backed and the risk could pay off. The managerial market wasn't inspiring and with a fully fit squad again, he will be given time to build on his first two seasons.",
      "Ten Hag has done a lot of great work at United. He oversaw special victories in his first season in charge, won two trophies, he addressed the poor culture at Carrington and embedded Garnacho and Mainoo, yet the bad had begun to outweigh the good throughout 2023/24.",
      "The team's lack of style, the failure to revert to a Plan B before the FA Cup final, the questionable transfer record; suffering a record number of Premier League defeats and breaking a list of unwanted records are all just some of the reasons that some fans wanted to see him sacked. But he refused to lie down, kept battling and has speared the critics.",
      "Ten Hag has been backed and lives to fight another day as king. His reign will continue.",

      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has discussed his plans for the pre-season preparations after INEOS' season review has concluded",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has confirmed he will take a gamble on younger players during the pre-season tour of the United States in his first released interview after the season review concluded.",
      "On Tuesday night, MEN Sport understands that the Reds reached the conclusion to continue with the Dutchman as their manager for next season. Ten Hag's future had been uncertain after reports before the FA Cup final deemed he was set to leave the club.",
      "However, following the victory over Manchester City at Wembley Stadium there was an outpouring of support for Ten Hag and it appears Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are willing to give him more time in the role. It is also understood that United's co-owners met with other managers about the possibility of replacing him as head coach but the ultimate decision was to stick with the former Ajax man.",
      "While no public decision has been made that Ten Hag will be staying at the club, United's official website has released an interview with the Dutchman about the plans for this summer's pre-season tour. When asked about the squad he will be taking over the pond, Ten Hag insisted there is likely to be names going who will play a big part next season.",
      "\"Pre-season is about preparing for the season and we have to make that our next step,\" he explained. \"It is one of the only times when you have the team together, and you can work in training on structures, the way of play, but also on certain standards around the team and that’s very important to take this period and use it effectively.",
      "\"We will bring players like Kobbie [Mainoo], who was very unknown by that time, and now everyone knows him. So if you want to have the first glimpse of players - maybe new players or young players who are coming up through the Academy, then this is your opportunity.\"",
      "United will play two matches in Europe - one against Rosenborg in Trondheim on July 15 and another against Rangers at Edinburgh's Murrayfield on July 20 before jetting off to America shortly afterwards for three matches against Arsenal on July 27, Real Betis on July 31 and Liverpool on August 3.",

      "Man United manager Erik ten Hag will stay in his position as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS conclude their end-of-season review into his position",
      "The news that Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag will remain in charge at Old Trafford has come as a massive U-turn after Ineos power brokers looked all set to sack him.",
      "Before the FA Cup final, all signs pointed toward the Dutchman being relieved of his duties at United after a disappointing eighth-place finish in the Premier League. However, victory over Manchester City at Wembley Stadium and the subsequent outpouring of approval for Ten Hag looks like it was enough to move the dial in favour of the incumbent.",
      "Ipswich Town's Kieran McKenna was the forerunner to replace Ten Hag but he signed a new deal at Portman Road. Gareth Southgate, Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter were all mentioned as possible replacements but the 54-year-old has now been given another season to turn around United's fortunes.",
      "While this is likely to be welcomed by most of the squad considering how well-received he was toward the end of last season, there are five players who may not be overjoyed to see their manager stay. This may not be because their personal relationship is fractured but rather because their playing time could be affected due to him staying.",
      "One man who is likely to fit in the former camp is Jadon Sancho. The Englishman's relationship with Ten Hag looks to be beyond repair at this point as witnessed by his exile from the squad from September onwards.",
      "While Ten Hag is manager, there seems to be no future for Sancho at Old Trafford which may come as a relief considering how well his loan move went at Borussia Dortmund. Should he leave the club, many would hope that Amad is given more of a chance in the starting line-up.",
      "Towards the end of last season, the Ivorian was given more of an opportunity in the first-team but Ten Hag still seems to prefer Antony for whatever reason. If he was to stay, Amad may not be as regular in the matchday squad as he would hope to be leading perhaps towards another push for the exit door come January.",
      "Facundo Pellistri is another young winger who seems destined to exit under Ten Hag. It has not just been the Dutchman who has not seen enough from the Uruguayan to warrant a place in the team but it seems to be the current boss who is likely to green-light his exit.",
      "Last winter, Altay Bayindir must have been scratching his head as he wondered how Andre Onana was managing to keep his place in the squad. At times, the Cameroonian had become a liability and even he admitted he was worried about his place in the starting XI as he delayed his trip to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "But Ten Hag stuck by his first-choice and he managed to get out the other end of his rough patch. It leads you now to question whether the Turkish player will ever get a chance to be a regular for United and considering he was not even utilised much in cup competitions, the 26-year-old is bound to be questioning if moving to Old Trafford was the right move.",
      "Finally, Ten Hag's extended stay at United would prove disastrous for Christian Eriksen. The Dane has fallen out of favour thanks to the emergence of Kobbie Mainoo and now it seems unlikely under Ten Hag he will win his place back.",
      "Eriksen expressed his frustration at his lack of minutes during the season and will be considering his options as his career starts to draw to a close. Perhaps a move back to Thomas Frank's Brentford could be on the cards.",

      "Erik ten Hag will be determined to take Manchester United back into the Premier League top-four next season, but he'll need to settle his differences with Jadon Sancho first",
      "Jadon Sancho and Erik ten Hag could be set for an awkward reunion. The duo fell out almost a year ago before parting ways in the January transfer window; the 24-year-old winger joined Borussia Dortmund on loan while the Manchester United boss fought for his job.",
      "Playing a key role in Edin Terzic's side, Sancho helped the German club reach the Champions League final. He started each of Dortmund's knockout ties, appearing in wins against PSV Eindhoven, Atletico Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain before losing to Real Madrid at the last hurdle.",
      "Meanwhile, Ten Hag led United to the FA Cup glory, defeating Manchester City at Wembley Stadium. Despite getting his hands on some silverware, the Dutchman still faced an uncertain future after a poor end to the Premier League campaign.",
      "United finished eighth in the Premier League and only clinched Europa League qualification through the FA Cup. Nevertheless, the Manchester Evening News Ten Hag will remain in his post and negotiations have begun over a contract extension.",
      "With the 54-year-old staying and Sancho set to return to pre-season training next month, the duo will be in for an awkward reunion at Carrington. United get the ball rolling against Rosenborg on July 15 before facing Rangers on July 20 and Arsenal on July 28.",
      "Then, at the start of August, the Reds lock horns with Real Betis and Liverpool. In September 2023, the winger was omitted from the matchday squad to face Arsenal due to 'his performance in training'. The Dutchman said: \"Jadon, on his performance in training, was not selected.",
      "\"You have to reach a level at Manchester United every day and we can make choices in the front line. So for this game he was not selected.\"",
      "Shortly after Ten Hag's comment, Sancho posted a statement on social media. He wrote: \"Please don't believe everything you read! I will not allow people saying things that is completely untrue, I have conducted myself in training very well this week.",
      "\"I believe there are other reasons for this matter that I won't go into, I've been a scapegoat for a long time which isn't fair! All I want to do is play football with a smile on my face and contribute to my team.",
      "\"I respect all decisions that are made by the coaching staff, I play with fantastic players and grateful to do so which I know every week is a challenge. I will continue to fight for this badge no matter what!\"",
      "Later that month, Ten Hag was quizzed on Sancho's rebuttal. In his press conference before United's clash against Brighton, he said: \"It's about team construction, the group dynamic. But it's about the team, the team is above everything else.",
      "\"In that team, anyone plays their role and anyone is different. There are different characters and you have to manage those characters. But the team is always above everything else.\"",
      "Ten Hag added: \"The club asked me, because there was no good culture before I entered last season, to set some standards. So it's my job to control the standards.",
      "\"Of course, it's never been someone making one mistake, it's a whole process before you come to a certain outcome about strict lines. Staff, players, or whoever, if there is a structure to cross lines, you have to be strong, absolutely.\"",
      "Then, when asked whether Sancho would don the United shirt again, Ten Hag replied: \"I don't know. I am sitting here. Tomorrow we have a big game, we are going into a new block of games, many games in a condensed programme. I focus on that. He is not available, so in this moment, he is not important, because he can't contribute.\"",

      "The core purpose of Manchester United's academy is to produce players for the first team.",

      "There have been 250 players to make a senior debut from the academy, which is a remarkable record, but the reality is the majority of hopefuls pursue careers elsewhere.",
      "It's a challenge for any young player to be on the fringe of the senior squad, nevermind earn a regular starting role, and United's academy has been responsible for the early development of hundreds of players who enjoyed fulfilling careers throughout the English pyramid.",
      "From the outside, it can be seen as a failure for a youngster to leave United's academy and join a club in a lower division, but that's not the view of staff at Carrington or players' families.",
      "There are many reasons why young players leave United and context is important ahead of the departure of Omari Forson and the likely exit of Shola Shoretire this summer.",
      "Forson has been in protracted talks over a new contract, but new proposals from United have been rejected and he's set to leave on a free transfer at the end of this month.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands United will continue to offer Forson competitive contracts in the hope he will sign a new deal. However, the club have conceded he's expected to leave, which isn't a surprise after months of stalled contract negotiations over a fresh deal.",
      "United wanted to keep Forson and their contract proposals reflected that. He will leave with well wishes but the club won't lose sleep over his departure this summer.",
      "There is a promising young player in Forson and it will be fascinating to see what he can achieve when he leaves, but he looked raw and inexperienced when he was given a shock start against Fulham in the Premier League on February 24 - his full debut for the club.",
      "Just a day before the Fulham game, Rasmus Hojlund was ruled out with a muscle injury and Forson was selected to start on the right wing instead of £86million signing Antony.",
      "Moments after the first whistle, the 19-year-old charged down the Fulham defence and lunged into a reckless challenge, which he was lucky to escape a yellow card for. The adrenaline of the occasion had rushed to Forson's head and Erik ten Hag responded by gesturing to calm down.",
      "Ten Hag named Forson in the senior squad for the pre-season tour of the United States last summer and gave him first-team opportunities throughout 2024.",
      "Forson made his debut against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup in January, made a cameo against Newport County and was given substitute appearances against Manchester City and Arsenal in the Premier League, which felt like an effort from Ten Hag to get him to sign a new deal. He also assisted Kobbie Mainoo for his matchwinner in the 4-3 win against Wolves at Molineux.",
      "Those efforts have been in vain and the only regret United might have over his departure is not obtaining a transfer fee for him in January, although he was on track to sign a new contract in the winter and they will receive compensation when he joins a new side this summer.",
      "United will also be entitled to compensation if Shoretire leaves upon the expiry of his contract this month, which seems increasingly likely. Last month, sources indicated United remained hopeful an agreement could be reached with Shoretire but an exit is probable.",
      "Shoretire was given his first-team debut by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer against Newcastle in February 2021 before playing in the Europa League just a few days later, an appearance which meant he became the youngest player to appear for the club in European competition.",
      "Shoretire's progress has stalled in the last 18 months and now aged 20, it's within the player's interest to pursue regular starts at a competitive senior level.",
      "Forson and Shoretire have both fallen below the level needed to regularly start for the first team but should enjoy fulfilling careers and will always be United academy alumni.",

      "The Portuguese coach, who has just signed a contract with Turkish club Fenerbahce, has never been shy when it comes to giving his opinion on players and rivals alike.",
      "Whether you love or hate him, there have been numerous occasions where he has stated his opinion and been proven right in the long run. However, nobody is perfect and there have been times where the 'Special One' has got it wrong – during his stint at Old Trafford and beyond.",
      "READ MORE:Manchester United appoint former Man City and Chelsea figure in further Ineos shake-up",
      "United fans were graced with plenty of memorable moments while Mourinho was the boss – during his press conferences, on match days, and in some controversial training session scenes.",
      "Back in the summer of 2017, while still holding the reins at Old Trafford, Mourinho defended his record of giving academy players a platform to succeed and also tipped five current players to achieve greatness at the club.",
      "At the time, Mourinho said: \"Probably in a few years Man United will also have half a dozen of these kids [in the team]. So when the kids are good and have potential, there is no problem.\"",
      "The manager was sacked by United in December 2018 and has since had coaching stints at Tottenham, AS Roma and now at Fenerbahce. But what happened to those five players he was impressed with while with the Red Devils? The Manchester Evening News has looked into their careers.",
      "By the time Mourinho named McTominay as one of the players to watch out for, he had already handed the Scot a Premier League debut for United against Arsenal in May 2017.",
      "Fast forward to 2024 and McTominay is still performing well at the club, scoring 10 goals and assisting three times in the 2023/24 season. He has appeared 289 times for United, scoring 29 times over eight seasons with the club.",
      "McTominay has also been performing exceptionally well for his home nation of Scotland, scoring seven times during the European Qualifiers in the latest round of matches and helped them qualify for Euro 2024.",
      "Mitchell was handed a Premier League start not long after McTominay in a season finale against Crystal Palace – but the left-back's career at Old Trafford ultimately never got going.",
      "Mitchell headed further north for the 2018/19 season with Hearts and spent his time on loan with the Edinburgh club. After 12 months back in the United academy, the young full-back departed on a permanent basis and made his breakthrough in the professional game.",
      "Mitchell was signed by League One promotion hopefuls Blackpool, and played 25 matches under ex-Liverpool youth-team manager Neil Critchley.",
      "The now-27-year-old then headed across the Scottish capital and joined Hibernian on a £300K permanent transfer – just three years on after playing for their city rivals, Hearts.",
      "He lasted just one year with the Scottish Premiership outfit and is now nursing a cruciate ligament injury at League One outfit Exeter City.",
      "Pereira is a curious case for United fans as the potential seemed to be in abundance for the young midfielder – yet he never really got going under any manager.",
      "The now-28-year-old signed for United from Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in 2014 and was introduced to the first team squad in a fairly quick fashion. However, he was then sent out on a multitude of loans that included La Liga clubs Granada and Valencia, as well as Italian outfit Lazio and Brazilian club Flamengo.",
      "In the summer of 2022, United finally parted ways with Pereira and he joined fellow Premier League club Fulham in a deal reportedly worth £8million.",
      "Since then, the Brazilian international has impressed, appearing 82 times for the west London club, scoring eight times and assisting a total of 15 goals.",
      "Tuanzebe was handed his Premier League debut by Mourinho in the same game as McTominay but struggled to hold down a first-team place following that match.",
      "The centre-back has been loaned to Aston Villa a total of three times and has also spent time at Napoli and Stoke City.",
      "He was released by United in the summer of 2023 and found his home at Ipswich Town, scoring and assisting once during their successful 2023/24 campaign.",
      "The club completed promotion to the Premier League after defeating Huddersfield 2-0 in the final game of the Championship campaign – meaning that Tuanzebe will be facing his old club once again in the new season.",
      "Similar to fellow full-back Mitchell, Warren was surplus to United's requirements once he graduated from the club's academy system.",
      "This is a fate that many players before Warren have suffered as plenty of academy players at multiple clubs have to strive for the very best in order to compete for the first team.",
      "Warren has had a troubling time since leaving United, bouncing between various teams that included Salford's Under-21s, Boston United, Halifax Town and Barrow.",
      "The right-back's most recent move was from League Two outfit Barrow to fellow league side Grimsby Town in a £170K permanent transfer. Hopefully, the now-25-year-old can get some solid minutes under his belt and kick off his footballing career with a long-term club.",

      "Man United's academy enjoyed a superb season and there are plenty of young talents emerging in the youth set-up.",
      "Manchester United's academy is the beating heart of the club and continues to produce.",
      "United have an unrivalled track record of nurturing talent from the academy and Erik ten Hag deserves praise for giving opportunities to young players who have potential.",
      "Since the emergence of Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo has been the most recent academy success story and Willy Kambwala has also contributed to the senior squad.",
      "Ethan Wheatley was the latest academy talent to be given his senior debut and became the 250th player in the club's history to do so, which represented a significant milestone.",
      "So who are the rising stars in the academy? We've made a list of eight and provided background on who they are, which position they play and what the future could hold for them.",
      "Harry Amass turned 17 in March and was named in United's squad to face Liverpool a few weeks later, which was the reward for his excellent progress in the academy.",
      "The youngster joined United from Watford last summer and his first year in Manchester saw him become a key player for the Under-18s and train with the first team.",
      "Amass, who plays at left-back, is considered one of the most exciting talents in English football and his signing from Watford was regarded as a coup by many familiar with youth football.",
      "The Hornets were desperate to keep hold of Amass beyond his scholarship deal, but United won the race for his signature and he's bound to have a bright future.",
      "Every successful team needs a forward who can find the back of the net and Wheatley was a prolific scorer for an Under-18 United side that won a treble.",
      "Wheatley scored eight goals in seven league appearances for the U18s and that included a special hat-trick against Liverpool, which came in an emphatic 9-1 victory.",
      "The striker stepped up to the Under-21s when required and scored the opening goal in the mini-Manchester derby against Manchester City in February.",
      "His debut against Sheffield United in April came next and it seems the best is yet to come from Wheatley, who won the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award.",
      "The promising Lacey has regularly gone viral on social media over the last few years, with footage of his goals amassing millions of views and creating a buzz among supporters.",
      "Lacey signed his first professional contract after celebrating his 17th birthday in mid-April and only the most highly regarded prospects are given pro deals at that age.",
      "The youngster was limited to just 10 appearances last season due to an injury - the first of his career - and fans who follow the academy are eager to see him back in action.",
      "Jack Fletcher signed for United from Manchester City with his twin brother Tyler Fletcher last summer and was involved in multiple first-team training sessions during the season.",
      "Darren Fletcher's sons had been in the City academy for nine years but opted to move to United and a £1.25million fee was paid to sign the pair. Both are highly regarded and sources at United believe they have first-team potential.",
      "Jack Fletcher will make the step up to the Under-21 side next term and will be exciting to follow.",
      "United youngster Bendito Mantato was in excellent form for the academy in the spring, which explained why he was the subject of interest from Premier League rivals.",
      "Although Mantato can play at left-back, it's thought his future will lie on the right wing due to his attacking quality and he scored four goals in one game against Blackburn last season.",
      "Mantato has gone from strength to strength after taking part in first-team training. His dribbling is a huge asset and he's been backed to continue to make strong headway.",
      "Ethan Williams contributed 17 goals and nine assists in academy fixtures in 2023/24 and played a crucial role in a supremely talented Under-18 side that claimed a treble.",
      "Williams signed a pre-professional contract earlier in the season, which is set to officially begin this summer, and he now has the challenge of attempting to make his senior bow.",
      "The youngster celebrated his 18th birthday in November and is the nephew of Alex Williams, who rose to prominence in the early 1980s as one of the first black goalkeepers in the modern top flight, making over 100 appearances for Manchester City in a trailblazing career.",
      "The Manchester Evening News revealed in April last year that Ibragimov had trained with the first team at just 15 years old. That was a remarkable achievement, but those who know the Russian-born midfielder best believe there is plenty more to come from him.",
      "Ibragimov was initially part of Sheffield United's academy after his family moved to England, but he underwent a successful trial with United and he's settled in Manchester.",
      "He's worn the armband for United in various age groups and is expected to feature regularly for the U18s next season. \"There aren't many I’ve seen that can run like him,\" Raducio King, who has coached Ibragimov, told the MEN in an interview last year.",
      "\"I could see him playing as a No.10, like a Wayne Rooney role, driving forward, switching balls, tackling, attacking, you name it. Just making sure the team does well - he can attack and defend.\"",
      "Ibragimov returned from an injury during the festive period and was among the goals again when he returned to fitness, pointing toward an exciting future.",
      "In August, goalkeeper Elyh Harrison did a Cruyff turn with Stockport's striker closing him down at Edgeley Park, which provoked audible gasps from the fans in attendance.",
      "Nine months later, Harrison was named Reserve Player of the Year and that award was thoroughly deserved because he was brilliant in between the sticks last season.",
      "Harrison's shot-stopping display was crucial in the U18s' victory in the Premier League Cup and he's a ball-playing 'keeper, whose distribution is a strength.",
      "That should bode well for his future and he'll look to follow in the footsteps of Dean Henderson, who broke into the first team from the academy.",

      "England boss Sarina Wiegman has offered a promising update on Mary Earps after the Manchester United goalkeeper picked up an injury against France on Friday.",
      "Earps was forced off just seven minutes into the Lionesses' EURO 2025 qualifier at St James' Park and it was confirmed on Sunday she has had to withdraw from the squad with a hip problem. As such, she will not be available to feature for England when they face France again in Saint-Etienne on Tuesday but Wiegman does not expect the shot-stopper's injury to keep her sidelined for long.",
      "\"She can’t play tomorrow,\" Wiegman said in her pre-match press conference. \"She left as you know but it’s not too big of an injury so we expect her to be back next camp.\"",

      "Beth Mead gave Sarina Wiegman's side the lead at St James' Park before a stunning volley from Elisa De Almeida and a fantastic first-time finish from Marie-Antoinette Katoto saw the French come from behind to further strengthen their position at the top of their EURO 2025 qualifying group.",
      "\"It's disappointing more than anything because I thought we were the better team,\" the Manchester United star Toone told the Manchester Evening News and other reporters after the game. \"I felt like we played really well.",
      "\"It was just a lapse in concentration on two set pieces which we knew they were good at. We know they've got some big players who are really good in the air and we had to make sure we concentrated so we're really disappointed to concede two goals like that. It's not the best feeling right now but I know we can learn a lot from it.",

      "The club is running out of time to convince players like Earps that it's worth staying in Manchester long-term",
      "As the clock ticked down at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, the pocket of travelling Chelsea fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand opted to make Mary Earps the subject of their derision.",
      "\"Mary, what's the score?\" they crowed at the Manchester United goalkeeper, who cut a solitary, slightly despondent figure in her 18-yard box. The score, in fact, was 6-0 to Chelsea.",
      "It was United's heaviest defeat of the season and, just a week on from the Reds' FA Cup triumph at Wembley, it served as a chastening reminder of their deficiencies. Twelve months ago, there was little to separate these two sides but, in the balmy Manchester sunshine, the gulf in quality looked every bit as large as the 20-point gap between them would suggest.",
      "At the full-time whistle, Earps joined her teammates in parading the FA Cup trophy around the stadium but it was not quite the euphoric homecoming the United players had surely been hoping for. At the other end of the pitch, the away fans rubbed further salt into Earps' wound by striking up a chorus of 'England's No.1', directed at Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.",
      "While their serenade was more than a little tongue in cheek, the sentiment behind it was not as outlandish as it might have seemed last summer, when Earps won the Golden Glove at the Women's World Cup. Last month, England boss Sarina Wiegman gave the clearest indication yet that Earps' undisputed No.1 status was under threat when she gave Hampton the nod in the Lionesses' EURO 2025 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland.",
      "\"I think we're in a very luxurious position that we have two incredible goalkeepers,\" Wiegman said when quizzed on her decision to drop the United shot-stopper. \"As we saw with Mary (against Sweden), she did an incredible job but I also think that Hannah is doing a great job for Chelsea. She's growing into competition with Mary so this is a moment for her to shine.\"",
      "United's collective malaise this term has been such that it has been difficult for anyone in red to truly shine. After narrowly missing out on the Women's Super League (WSL) title in 2022/23, Marc Skinner's side have struggled to recover their best form and finished the season in fifth place - six points behind a Liverpool team who were plying their trade in the Championship only two years ago.",
      "It's little wonder, then, that Earps - whose contract expires this summer - is considering her future at the club. \"The honest reality is that conversations are still ongoing,\" the 31-year-old told Sky Sports News this week when asked about her next steps. \"I've been clear I don't want to make an emotional decision.",
      "\"The beginning of the season was really tough, I felt really upset about things that were being said about me and things that came out that weren't true.",
      "\"I've tried to be professional, keep my head down, work hard, get on with my job and that's been hard. I've been a punching bag at times. I know I've given my heart and soul for the whole season. It's a tough situation.",
      "\"I've asked the club for some confirmation on what they're trying to achieve and when I have those answers I'll be able to make a decision. It's up to the club.\"",
      "It's unsurprising that Earps has been feeling the heat of the media spotlight; she has been at the centre of intense transfer speculation since last summer, when it emerged Arsenal were interested in capturing her signature. That interest appears to have cooled of late, with the Gunners now reportedly preferring a move for Aston Villa goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar.",
      "But, while her form may have dipped slightly this season, Earps would certainly not be short of suitors should she choose to seek pastures new. She has been linked with French giants Paris Saint-Germain and her situation is being monitored by a host of top European clubs.",
      "That she appeared to put the ball in United's court in with her latest comments on her future is telling. The club came under fire last term for their inability to tie down first-team duo Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new deals, with the pair departing for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively.",
      "Though United's underwhelming campaign cannot solely be attributed to their exits, it was an indictment of the club's hierarchy that both were allowed to leave on free transfers. Now, the Reds risk losing Earps in the same manner, with the Daily Mail reporting last week that midfielder Ella Toone is also attracting interest from Barcelona.",
      "While that particular move may not materialise, with Toone under contract until June 2026, it is clear United need to do more to convince their star players that the club has a clear formula for success. Over the past 18 months, United has felt like a club in flux.",
      "In February, it was confirmed that head of women's football Polly Bancroft was set to depart at the season to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town. Matt Johnson, who currently works for the club's Foundation as well as overseeing the girls' regional and emerging talent centres (RTCs), is set to take over on an interim basis at the end of the campaign but Bancroft's long-term successor has not yet been named.",
      "Her exit comes after Skinner's highly-rated assistant Martin Ho left the club last summer to become head coach at Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner, while several other key personnel - including physiotherapist Ibrahim Kerem and performance analyst Luke Wright - have moved over to join Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "This, of course, has all occurred against the backdrop of takeover uncertainty, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe eventually having acquired a minority stake in the club back in February The Ineos chief is now responsible for sporting operations, with United seeking to emerge into a brave new era under his stewardship.",
      "The fact that Ratcliffe chose to attend United's Premier League clash with Arsenal instead of watching Skinner's side lift their first piece of silverware earlier this month, however, does not instill confidence that the women's team ranks very highly on his list of priorities.",
      "Ineos director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford was in attendance on Saturday afternoon and will surely have been mildly perturbed by what he witnessed. The United hierarchy awarded Skinner - whose contract was due to expire this summer - with a new deal last week, although negotiations had been underway for some time.",
      "It was a controversial call considering the backlash Skinner has faced from some quarters of the fanbase at various points throughout the season and only time will tell whether the 41-year-old has what it takes to turn the Reds into a European force.",
      "\"I need to go away and reflect on what we need to do as a team,\" Skinner admitted in his post-match press conference at the weekend. \"I need to work with the club to make sure we know those areas. I've known for a while where we fall short, but there's also a time that you need to be able to develop those areas.\"",
      "For Skinner, there is at least the assurance he has another season to try and turn things around. But for United's decision makers, time is running out to convince players like Earps that it's worth staying in Manchester and the club need to show they have learnt from their mistakes before it is too late.",

      "The former Manchester United man was in attendance at Old Trafford as the Blues romped to a 6-0 victory over Marc Skinner's side, pipping Manchester City to the title on goal difference. Though it was a difficult afternoon for United, it was heartening to see Ferguson's show of support for the women's team less than a week on from Sir Jim Ratcliffe's controversial absence at Wembley.",

      "It's not the first time Hayes has referenced her friendship with Ferguson. After the Chelsea manager announced her departure back in November, she said: \"He calls me from time to time so I wasn't surprised.",
      "\"Anything he says to me I always take with such pride. He is a legend of the game and someone whose opinion I value and he has a love of America. We talked a little bit about that, a little bit about legacy, a little bit about leaving at the top. So there were wise words from him.

      "Sir Alex Ferguson was in attendance at Old Trafford on the final day of the Women's Super League (WSL) season. With Manchester United hosting Chelsea, the influential figure made his presence at the ground felt.",
      "United and Mark Skinner had little to play for other than seeking to finish above Liverpool as fourth spot remained up for grabs. Just one week on from their FA Cup demolition of Tottenham at Wembley, the big names were out in force once again.",
      "Emma Hayes and Chelsea entered the game knowing that a win would give them a strong chance of claiming a fifth WSL title in a row. It is the last match in charge of the club for Hayes as she looks to leave with a bang.",
      "However, despite the positivity of Ferguson being at the ground, it was noticeable for many how that contrasted with the absence of Sir Jim Ratcliffe last weekend.",
      "Writing from Old Trafford, Reach PLC's women's football writer Beth Lindop said: \"If there's anyone who knows what it's like to leave a club while on top, it's Ferguson. The legendary Manchester United boss is at Old Trafford today to watch Skinner's side take on title-chasing Chelsea.",
      "\"But, while his heart may belong in the red corner, there might just be a part of him that is rooting for departing Blues boss Emma Hayes too.",
      "\"The soon-to-be US Women's National Team coach revealed last November that Ferguson had been in touch to wish her well ahead of her move Stateside. \"He calls me from time to time so I wasn't surprised,\" she said.",

I'm sure it won't be the last phone call I get from him this season.\"",

      "The summer transfer window is open but what does every Premier League team need? Sky Sports statistician Paul Harrison dives into the data to find out...",
      "Few flaws can be found in a team who have finished runners-up to Manchester City in successive seasons. However not a single Arsenal player has surpassed 16 Premier League goals in four campaigns.",
      "This season, Kai Havertz's return of nine goals in his final 14 league appearances this season was promising, but Eddie Nketiah and Gabriel Jesus failed to reach double figures between them from a combined 54 league appearances, with neither finding the net after January.",
      "Aston Villa will compete in Europe's elite competition next season for the first time since 1982/83 when they were reigning European champions.",
      "Their defensive record will surely need improvement to reach such heights again. They started and ended the season conceding five goals at Newcastle and Crystal Palace, while no team has conceded more Premier League goals when qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Only Norwich - who finished third in the inaugural Premier League campaign - have ever finished in the top four and conceded more goals.",
      "Bournemouth won a club-record 48 Premier League points this season. After a slow start under Andoni Iraola, the Cherries took 42 points from their final 27 league games - a total bettered only by the top four and Chelsea.",
      "Next season's success could depend on retaining top scorer Dominic Solanke as much as any potential incomings. The former Liverpool and Chelsea forward featured in all 38 league games this season - the only Bournemouth player to do so.",
      "Not only were his 19 league goals more than twice as many as any team-mate, but, without them, Bournemouth would have finished 17th in the table - only six points clear of relegation.",
      "This season was Brentford's lowest finish (16th) and points total of their three Premier League campaigns (39) - they won just five of their final 24 league games.",
      "For the first half of the season, they caught a glimpse of life without talisman Ivan Toney - something likely to become a permanent feature this summer with only one year left on his contract.",
      "Thomas Frank has acted fast with the signing of Brazilian striker Igor Thiago being confirmed in February. Only Kevin Denkey scored more league goals in Belgium's top tier this season than Thiago, whose conversion rate was nearly three times that of his potential predecessor.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi's departure maintains the club's customary seasonal churn within its ranks.",
      "Over the past two years, Brighton have seen key players Marc Cucurella, Yves Bissouma, Leandro Trossard, Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo depart for significant fees, with Graham Potter following suit in September 2022.",
      "The constant changes have been reflected on the pitch: they made 36 more changes to their starting XI than any other team in the division - only one behind the Premier League record.",
      "Stability and consistency next season could be as important as any new signing. The Seagulls are close to finalising a deal to appoint 31-year-old St Pauli boss Fabian Hurzeler as their new head coach, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Chelsea showed signs of progress in the final three months - losing only one of their final 15 league games - but their young squad would benefit from an injection of experience if the top four is a realistic aim.",
      "Thiago Silva, now 39 years of age, followed Mauricio Pochettino out of the club at the end of June. The Blues had the youngest average starting XI in the division this season - despite the Brazilian starting 27 games. Replacing him will be key: they conceded eight more goals than any previous Premier League campaign.",
      "Crystal Palace had lost 10 of their previous 17 league games when Oliver Glasner was appointed in February. Following his first game in charge, only Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea won more points.",
      "This transformation was primarily due to the remarkable form of Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta, who scored a combined 23 league goals in 13 games under the Austrian.",
      "Keeping hold of their attacking trio - and keeping Olise fit - could be the Eagles' best business this summer.",
      "Without the eight-point deduction, Sean Dyche's team would have finished within touching distance of the top half - winning four of their final six league games.",
      "However, their reliance on set-piece goals will need addressing if a fourth successive relegation dogfight is to be avoided.",
      "The Toffees scored five fewer open-play goals than rock-bottom Sheffield United and easing the burden on Dwight McNeil as their only natural, creative outlet should be a priority.",
      "Fulham's hopes of European football disappeared with just two wins in their final nine Premier League games. The Cottagers' late-season slump could be attributed to having the oldest starting XI in the division and using the joint-fewest number of players.",
      "Some younger legs and depth would not go amiss if Fulham were to push for a return to the top half next season.",
      "Successive promotions from League One to the Premier League means expectations at Portman Road are likely to be realistic next season: only six members of their current squad have played previously in England's top tier.",
      "A key issue for Luton this season was the lack of experience at this level, something Kieran McKenna would be wise to address this summer.",
      "The Foxes' surprise relegation in 2022/23 was primarily due to their defensive issues. At the other end of the pitch, their 51 league goals matched seventh-placed Aston Villa.",
      "However, their top two scorers that season - Harvey Barnes and James Maddison - departed last summer and the third top scorer, Kelechi Iheanacho, is out of contract this summer.",
      "The burden will be on Jamie Vardy, but, at 37, and after struggling in the Premier League last time out, a guaranteed goalscorer seems a must as Leicester boasted the best defence in the Championship this season.",
      "A summer rebuild was already touted at Anfield before Jurgen Klopp's departure after a trophy-laden eight years at Liverpool.",
      "After a midfield shake-up last summer, the focus is likely to be on defensive reinforcement: Virgil van Dijk's future remains uncertain, Joel Matip's contract has expired, Trent Alexander-Arnold is entering the final 12 months of his current deal and Andy Robertson's injury issues remain a concern.",
      "Their defensive stats this season are noticeably worse than in recent years.",
      "After winning an unprecedented fourth successive top-flight English league title, Manchester City will be hard-pressed to find any major flaws ahead of the summer.",
      "With Kalvin Phillips expected to depart after two underwhelming seasons, a deputy for the influential Rodri could be a priority: all three of City's league defeats came when the Spaniard was suspended this season.",
      "Manchester United's inevitable summer of upheaval could see additions in all areas of the pitch - they have struggled both defensively and offensively.",
      "The departure of the experienced Raphael Varane will leave the club light at the back, especially with Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw's ongoing injury concerns.",
      "They used 14 different centre-back partnerships this season and veteran Jonny Evans clocked more league appearances than any other centre-back at the club. So, a keen eye will be cast over a defence that conceded a Premier League club-record 58 goals this term.",
      "Balancing expectations and Europe was always going to be a challenge for Eddie Howe's side this season. They conceded nearly twice as many league goals this campaign (62) compared to 2022/23 (33), when they had the joint-best defence in the division.",
      "Both full-back positions have been problematic of late and freshening up the backline seems likely - especially if they can retain the services of Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak. The Magpies were among the first out of the traps this summer, signing Bournemouth centre-back Lloyd Kelly on a free transfer.",
      "Nuno Santo Espirito's impressive defensive record at Wolves helped persuade Nottingham Forest to appoint him mid-season after axing Steve Cooper. He appeared unconvinced about his goalkeeper options and signed Matz Sels in January.",
      "The Belgian has struggled since joining Forest, with only team-mate Odysseas Vlachodimos and Brighton's Jason Steele registering lower save ratios this season.",
      "A consistent presence between the sticks would help complement an attack that began to gel on the home stretch.",
      "Southampton failed to score in only five Championship games this season - the best record in the division.",
      "The Saints often depended on their potent attack to bail out a defence that ranked midtable for goals conceded and clean sheets. Experience and quality at the back are imperative to avoid a second relegation in three seasons.",
      "Another false dawn at Tottenham, who were top of the table and unbeaten after 10 Premier League games under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Their capitulation in the 4-1 home defeat against Chelsea in November became the norm as the season progressed. Their defensive stats in the final 28 games resembled a team in a relegation battle.",
      "Better midfield protection and competent defensive depth are required - if they are to stand any chance of fighting for a top-four finish next term.",
      "With Lucas Paqueta potentially facing a multi-year ban for alleged breaches of betting rules, replacing the Brazil international's creative qualities would be essential.",
      "Paqueta made six times as many through-balls as any team-mate this season and was comfortably their most potent creator from open play.",
      "Only the three relegated teams conceded more goals than West Ham this term, and Paqueta's skillset was one of the key factors behind their ninth-placed finish.",
      "The Hammers have already snapped up a potential creator in 18-year-old winger Luis Guilherme, signed from Palmeiras for £25m.",
      "A steady but unspectacular debut season for Gary O'Neil ended in disappointment: his team won just one of their final 10 league games.",
      "Goals were rarely an issue for a team boasting the talents of Pedro Neto, Matheus Cunha and Hee-Chan Hwang, but a defence that kept just one clean sheet in their final 17 games will need work if they are to arrest their poor form when the new season arrives.",
      "Wolves have already signed versatile Braga right-back Rodrigo Gomes, who can play as a wing-back or winger, in a £12.7m deal.",
      "The 2024 summer transfer window in Premier League officially opens on Friday June 14 - the same day that Euro 2024 starts.",
      "The window will close on August 30 at 11pm UK time.",

      "In the coming market, there appears to be a few tiers to what is on offer at centre-forward, depending on their quality and market value; from the top strikers in the world such as Victor Osimhen - worth at least £100m to Napoli - to potential bargains such as Serhou Guirassy, who has a release clause of little more than £15m.",
      "Here, Sky Sports takes a look at 15 of the best strikers out there in 2024 - some very much available, others near-impossible to get - and uses Wyscout data to showcase their potential for the Premier League.",
      "Club: StuttgartAge: 28Approximate market value: £15.6m (€18.5m) release clauseContract expires: 2026",
      "Every team in the Premier League watched Guirassy last season as he spearheaded Stuttgart's successful league campaign, which saw them earn Champions League qualification.",
      "Sky Sports News mentioned him with the likes of Manchester United, West Ham, Fulham and Nottingham Forest during the January transfer window - but he stayed and finished the season on 28 goals in 28 Bundesliga games, the second-most in Europe's top-five leagues behind only Harry Kane.",
      "Inevitably, the Guinea international is on the list again at every club this summer, mainly due to his relatively cheap release clause, which leaves Stuttgart very exposed to losing him.",
      "However, Champions League football helps them in their bid to keep him, at least from clubs outside European competition next term, although some of the interested clubs could blow them out of the water on wages, especially in England.",
      "In a Bundesliga with a number of top strikers, Guirassy ranks third behind only Kane and Lois Openda in Wyscout's ranking system, which incorporates all of a player's data over the course of a season. He has got a lot about him; great movement, good feet, and knows where the goal is.",
      "Club: Cercle BruggeAge: 23Approximate market value: £16.9m (€20m+)Contract expires: 2026",
      "Belgium is usually a cheaper market for Premier League clubs to shop in and has an increasing number of exciting young players, Denkey being one who is banging in goals in the Jupiler League for fun.",
      "There is yet to emerge a firm Premier League suitor for him, but he is undoubtedly one that the majority of clubs have been watching considering his strong data set. According to Wyscout's rankings, he is the best striker in Belgium currently.",
      "He is also the fourth top-scorer with 31 goals and has the second-best xG rating (35.04) of all the strikers in this list. He is also second on this list for shots per 90 (3.52). He has speed and power going for him.",
      "Club: LilleAge: 24Approximate market value: £34m-£42m (€40m-€50m)Contract expires: 2025",
      "With just a year left on his contract, Jonathan David is another seemingly affordable option for a Premier League club, and a good one after his exploits in the French league over the last few seasons.",
      "He was behind only Kylian Mbappe for goals and assists among centre forwards in France last season, with 19 and four respectively. In 2022-23 season, he was top of the combined xG and xA metric for any striker across the top-five leagues, according to Wyscout's data.",
      "This season, David has the second-best xG (30.15) of the strikers in this list, hits more than half of his shots on target in all competitions and, again in Europe's top-five leagues, David was second only to Jean Philippe-Mateta in terms of shot accuracy, with 60.5 per cent of his Ligue 1 shots hitting the mark.",
      "France's leading newspaper L'Equipe seem to be aware of the Premier League interest and have also mentioned Atletico Madrid. Further reports say Lille want €50m but with only a year left on his contract that seems optimistic.",

      "Just called up to the Netherlands squad for Euro 2024, Manchester United and Arsenal are currently very interested in Zirkzee as AC Milan push to try and sign him from Serie A rivals Bologna.",
      "Milan are confident of getting a deal done but almost a week has gone by since talks intensified and it is not there yet, which has seen United and Arsenal monitor things more closely this week. Bologna, meanwhile, really want him to stay for another year and are even willing to increase his wages.",
      "Zirkzee stepped-up last season with 11 goals to help Bologna qualify for the Champions League.",
      "He is a really attractive prospect on the market, because of his dynamic profile and relatively young age, with plenty of room for improvement, especially for a relatively modest fee. Juventus also like him a lot but need to sell a striker before they can go after another one.",
      "Club: GironaAge: 26Approximate market value: £34m+ (€40m+)Contract expiry: 2028",
      "Ukraine international Dovbyk scored 24 goals in 36 LaLiga games last season as Girona - Manchester City's sister club - finished in the Champions League places.",
      "AC Milan have him on their list if the Zirkzee deal collapses, according to Sky in Italy, while reports in Spain have linked him with Atletico Madrid and Napoli. He is unlikely to be a player for City and their owners are unlikely to want to see him strengthen their rivals, so perhaps a move to the Premier League is unlikely.",
      "Astoundingly, Dovbyk has the third-highest xG (23.87) in top-five leagues behind Haaland (29.04) and Kane (23.9), according to Wyscout data. He is a top attacker, no doubt.",
      "Club: Aston VillaAge: 20Approximate market value: UnknownContract expiry: 2028",
      "Chelsea have been interested in Jhon Duran since January and he remains on their list of strikers as they re-work the squad for new manager Enzo Maresca.",
      "He has played second fiddle to Ollie Watkins since his £18m arrival from Chicago Fire in 2022, but that is to be expected given Watkins' outstanding form. Duran has nonetheless shown what he is capable of when he is on the pitch, scoring five goals mostly as a substitute. Some of those have been absolute spectacular, though.",
      "Duran is undoubtedly a top up and coming striker who needs to player regularly to realise his potential and, given Watkins' status at the club, that may have to be away from Villa Park.",
      "His value has risen and he has a lot of time left on his contract but Duran's price cannot have increased that much given his lack of playing time and recent move to England.",
      "Club: Bayer LeverkusenAge: 23Approximate market value: £42m+ (€50m+)Contract expiry: 2028",
      "The Nigeria goalscorer scored 19 goals as Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen won the Bundesliga. He would have scored more had he not missed a portion of the season through injury.",
      "His valuation has therefore increased and, following Alonso's decision to stay, it will be harder to prize players from his team. Leverkusen have a real chance to solidify their place at the top of the Bundesliga and go further in the Champions League next season.",
      "Boniface has the best xG per 90 (0.71) of any player in this list, above Viktor Gyokeres (0.67) and Jonathan David (0.65), and the second-most shots per 90 (4.05) in Europe's top-five leagues behind Kylian Mbappe.",
      "Club: FeyenoordAge: 23Approximate market value: £42m-£50m (€50m-€60m)Contract expiry: 2027",
      "The Mexican had a sterling season in the Eredivisie under Arne Slot, whose move to Liverpool has raised inevitable speculation that the striker could follow him to Anfield.",
      "Gimenez was also spotted watching a Tottenham game this season and they are among the Premier League clubs who are on the lookout for a young striker they can develop.",
      "He is highly rated by scouts and sporting directors at a number of Premier League clubs and his relative affordability makes him a likely proposition to come to England. However, the record that precedes him for players making the jump from the Eredivisie to the Premier League is not a great one and does create reservations among scouts.",
      "Gimenez's xG is good at 26.39 but he did not provided many assists over the past season. He very much leads the line, plays on the shoulder of the last defender and is devilish in the box, even with his head.",
      "Club: BournemouthAge: 26Approximate market value: £65m release clauseContract expiry: 2027",
      "Dominic Solanke is understood to have a release clause that can be activated by only the 'big six' clubs, reportedly to the tune of £65m.",
      "Andoni Iraola has helped develop him into a prolific Premier League goalscorer and that is what is attracting top clubs to his name again after it did not work out for him at Chelsea and Liverpool earlier in his career.",
      "Inevitable speculation has been made linking him to Eddie Howe at Newcastle, given they worked together at Bournemouth, but Alexander Isak is clearly the first choice there. The top clubs looking at strikers appear to be after someone younger than 26 but if they do not get their first choices, could Solanke come into their sights?",
      "According to Wyscout's index based on performance data, Solanke was the fourth best-performing centre-forward in the Premier League last season, behind Ollie Watkins, Heung-Min Son and Jarrod Bowen. That's quite something.",
      "Club: BrentfordAge: 28Approximate market value: In the region of £70mContract expiry: 2025",
      "If not for his ban from football last season, Ivan Toney would undoubtedly already be at a top club. He was the coveted centre-forward, newly in the England setup, and of interest to Arsenal and Chelsea last year, but instead spent most of last season on the sidelines and was not quite the same player after he returned.",
      "Sky Sports News understands Arsenal have turned their attentions away from Toney and Isak and towards a younger profile of striker they can develop, and Chelsea too seem to be looking at younger players like Duran.",
      "In January, Toney's valuation at Brentford was £100m and that has dropped somewhat, as he enters the final year of his contract at the West London club, and if he has an impactful Euros with England, interest will inevitably pick back up. He needs to show his best again.",
      "Brentford have been preparing themselves to lose Toney this summer, signing £30m striker Igor Thiago from Club Brugge in Belgium, but they will not let Toney go on the cheap.",
      "Club: RB LeipzigAge: 24Approximate market value: £67.6m-£75m (€80m-€88m)Contract expiry: 2028",
      "Although Openda's £67.6m (€80m) release clause is not effective until 2025, it does give a guide as to his valuation. Why wouldn't Leipzig argue he is worth that much now given the season he has had?",
      "Twenty-four goals in 34 appearances in the Bundesliga and four in the Champions League has seen him form a formidable partnership with Benjamin Sesko, in a very exciting RB Leipzig team that has finished in the Champions League places in a very competitive division.",
      "Openda is up there among the best performers for xG (22.98), goals-per90 (0.67), and shots per90 (3.37) - and he has, of course, been linked with all the top Premier League clubs over the last 12 months or so.",
      "Club: NapoliAge: 25Approximate market value: £100m+ (€120m+)Contract expiry: 2026",
      "Only a handful of clubs in the world can afford to spend £100m on one player, which limits the market for players such as Victor Osimhen. With two years left on his contract, a move is more practical but Napoli will not let him go for less than his value.",
      "That is surely a reason why the prolific goalscorer is still at Napoli despite speculation that he would move elsewhere nearly every season.",
      "Every top club has been linked with him at one stage or another, including Chelsea, but at such a high price, there are only a handful of clubs worldwide that could spend that kind of money - and most have their centre-forwards.",
      "Reports earlier this year claimed he was high on PSG's wishlist to replace Mbappe, but Antonio Conte will be hoping he sticks around for his first season in charge at Napoli.",
      "Club: Sporting CPAge: 26Approximate market value: £84m (€100m+) release clauseContract expiry: 2028",
      "The Sweden striker only signed for Sporting last summer from Coventry and is thought to have had a €100m release clause inserted into his contract.",
      "He has found the step from Championship to the Portuguese top-flight and European competition a relative breeze, scoring 29 in 33 league games and five more in the Europa League, which is what has alerted clubs to want to bring him back to England.",
      "It will be an expensive job though and only one or two clubs could afford to do it, making it unlikely, especially given the current PSR rules.",
      "Gyokeres' stats are really strong; he has the best xG (36.94) and xAssist (8.8) of any strikers in this list over the course of last season, according to Wyscout data.",
      "Club: NewcastleAge: 24Approximate market value: £100m+Contract expiry: 2028",
      "There is no sign that Newcastle would consider selling their star striker - only speculation that he is of interest to top clubs, which is inevitable given his record and performances last season.",
      "Again, only a handful of clubs in the world could afford Isak and the market is just not fluid enough at the moment for a credible bid to appear on the horizon.",
      "According to Wyscout data, Isak has the best goal conversion rate (28.9 per cent) of any of the strikers in this list.",
      "Club: Aston VillaAge: 28Approximate market value: £100m+Contract expiry: 2028",
      "Again, Watkins is another player nigh-on untouchable at his club unless for a stratospheric bid, and those buyers are just not out there at the moment.",
      "Watkins is central to Aston Villa's push to join the elite clubs and he has been superb under Unai Emery last season, scoring 27 times in all competitions. Villa are also in the Champions League now, so the list of reasons to go elsewhere is shrunk.",
      "According to Wyscout's index based on performance data, Watkins was the best-performing centre-forward in the Premier League last season."

      "Erik ten Hag is staying at Manchester United after the club finished their end-of-season review; the Dutchman is in talks over a new contract at Old Trafford with one year left on his current deal; United did speak to other managers before sticking with their current coach",
      "Thursday 13 June 2024 09:22, UK",
      "Erik Ten Hag is set to stay at Manchester United after the club finalised their end-of-season review. But what happens now?",
      "United finished a disappointing eighth, their worst finish in the Premier League era, and despite beating rivals Manchester City to lift the FA Cup and Ten Hag's second trophy in as many years, speculation was still rife over the Dutchman's future after INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe took over the club's football operations in February.",
      "But United have now confirmed that Ten Hag will be staying on as their manager and the 54-year-old is now in talks with the club over an improved contract.",
      "To explain how United came to this decision, Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol goes through all the details.",
      "Solhekol: Ten Hag was aware that it was touch and go as to whether he kept his job or not.",
      "Man Utd had their post-season review and they did explore all options. Ten Hag won the FA Cup at the end of the season, against the backdrop of lots of reports that he was going to lose his job. No sooner are the celebrations over after losing the FA Cup, United are contacting other managers - either directly or through their representatives.",
      "It has obviously been well-documented that they looked at other managers like Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Frank.",
      "There were widespread reports in the UK and Germany that Tuchel met Sir Jim Ratcliffe in Monaco last week. We know there has been contact with representatives of Pochettino. Hiring Gareth Southgate is impossible as he is managing England at the Euros.",
      "United were exploring all eventualities, but ultimately, they decided they would stick with Ten Hag.",
      "Although it can't have been a particularly nice experience for Ten Hag to have had this after winning the FA Cup, he's been in football a long time and knows how these things work.",
      "Solhekol: United were very clear that they were having a post-season review and that the review was going to look at the manager's position.",
      "When Ratcliffe and INEOS came in, they invested in the business and it was their right to look at all areas of the business.",
      "Ten Hag was someone they inherited as a manager and you could argue they were doing what every owner would do when coming into a club by looking at all facets of the business.",
      "Solhekol: You can certainly make the case that if Man Utd hadn't won the FA Cup then Ten Hag would have lost his job.",
      "But you can also make the case that if it wasn't for Haji Wright being offside in the semi-final against Coventry, he also would have lost his job.",
      "It's a game of fine margins but in a post-season review, having the FA Cup and European football from that, it makes a decent case for him to stay. Without those things it's a difficult case to make for him to stay in the job.",
      "Solhekol: INEOS have been impressed with the way Ten Hag has handled the development of Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "INEOS do now want to go in a different direction at Man Utd and the days of spending £80m on one player is over.",
      "They want to sign young players and Ten Hag has proven that he is the right man for those players.",
      "That is definitely one of the reasons why they have stuck with him.",
      "Solhekol: The complication is he's only got one year left on his contract. When you're a manager of the stature of Erik ten Hag, someone who has had a lot of success in the game, you need more security than that. He will want more certainty going forward.",
      "This summer, if he had left United, he could have managed Ajax again and he could have managed Bayern Munich. If he had done that, he would have got the security of a three or four-year contract.",
      "It doesn't help Man Utd or Ten Hag if you are going into a new season with the clock ticking on the manager's future. You want to avoid any more speculation about his future. If there's no new deal, United are just kicking the managerial decision down the road.",
      "It's not good enough for United to have a review and say 'we've explored all eventualities and you'll do for the time being'. Ten Hag deserves more than that. He needs to be backed fully.",
      "That means giving him a contract and the security of a three or four-year deal and that will send a message out to the fans, to the wider community and to the United squad that Ten Hag is here to stay, he's the owners' man and he is the one who calls the shots.",
      "It's also an important decision for transfers at Man Utd. Players coming in will want to know what's going on and they will want security that a manager will not just be off after only a few months of the season.",
      "Solhekol: If he gets his new deal, Ten Hag will have no excuses. Because Sir Jim Ratcliffe will say he is now calling the shots in the club's football operations.",
      "With a new chief executive, a new sporting director and a new technical director, everything is in place for Ten Hag to be successful. No excuses.",
      "Obviously, United still need to work on their training ground and do up Old Trafford as well. But plans are in place to do that.",
      "INEOS are now committed to this project.",
      "Ten Hag has been true to his word. He's said all along he's had a good working relationship with INEOS and now we are getting a clear indication that they want to work with him long-term as well.",
      "The only issue has been the way this has been conducted. There will be people who say that if INEOS loved Ten Hag so much, why were they talking to other managers? However, in this day and age, it might not be the right thing to do to speak to other managers in football terms, but it is the right thing to do in business.",
      "INEOS have come in and made a lot of changes already at Man Utd and there will be more, but they think Ten Hag is the right man to coach the team. But I do not think he is as powerful as he was before INEOS arrived.",
      "Ten Hag will be happy that he is keeping his job, but I don't think it is a massive cause for celebration for him because I'm sure he thinks it should have been dealt with much quicker and that his position wouldn't have been under so much scrutiny for so long.",
      "Solhekol: It is a massive summer for Man Utd.",
      "It's not just about players coming in either. It's also about players going out the door.",
      "Ten Hag has said he wants another centre-back, he wants another central midfielder and he wants another striker.",
      "There's also the Jadon Sancho situation which has to be dealt with. You'd think that with Ten Hag staying it makes it much more likely that Sancho will leave Old Trafford, unless there's some sort of twist and peace talks with everybody making up.",
      "But in terms of transfers, I don't think Ten Hag will have the sort of control and influence that he previously had because of the new structure that has been put in place at United.",
      "There's also still a lot of uncertainty around the club with new chief executive Omar Berrada not starting yet, Dan Ashworth is embroiled in a legal dispute with Newcastle United and the transfer window will be open on Friday.",
      "It is good news for United that they have Jason Wilcox in place and, now they know Ten Hag will be the manager, it will help them in the market."

      "Manchester United's FA Cup success has helped to save Erik ten Hag's job, but he now has to turn things around after the club's worst Premier League finish since Sir Alex Ferguson retired; here Sky Sports takes a look at last season's issues and the reasons for optimism under Ten Hag",
      "Wednesday 12 June 2024 17:05, UK",
      "Manchester United are sticking with Erik ten Hag, but the alarming numbers from the past season show he has his work cut out for him.",
      "United ended the campaign eighth, their worst finish in the Premier League era, after Ten Hag failed to curb the team's worrying performances amid an almost constant injury crisis.",
      "Their unlikely win over Manchester City in the FA Cup final was the only saving grace, and perhaps what kept Ten Hag from being sacked, as his team saved their best until last. Helped, importantly, by key players returning from injury.",
      "Seventy per cent of you voted that this had been United's worst season since Sir Alex Ferguson retired when asked with four games to go. The outlook, of course, has changed a lot since then.",
      "Rightly so, an FA Cup trophy and Europa League qualification after a season with so many issues is admirable. Ten Hag has now won two trophies in as many seasons, none of Ferguson's successors can boast a better return.",
      "He and Jose Mourinho are the most successful United managers of the past decade.",
      "Scenes of jubilation at Wembley have somewhat pushed the memories from the rest of United's season to the back of our thinking, however. Ten Hag is yet to find anywhere near the consistency required to make this an elite side.",
      "That is reflected in the 31-point gap between themselves and champions Manchester City in the table.",
      "Arsenal were only two points from finishing above City, but in some quarters the question of whether United have enjoyed a better season has been raised because of their cup success.",
      "That argument only has legs if Mikel Arteta's side never go on to achieve more, though. Arsenal have built a team capable of pushing the Premier League's most successful side all the way. United can't dream of that right now.",
      "Replicating a rise akin to that of Arsenal is the end goal for INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has set an optimistic timeline of three years to knock City off their perch.",
      "That will take some going considering United rode their luck this season, according to the data.",
      "The table based on xG has them finishing in 14th, six places lower than they actually did, with a paltry 40 points, often the target for teams hoping to avoid relegation. Things could've been a lot worse.",
      "Across Europe's top five leagues, with 96 teams competing, only Sheffield United - relegated to the Championship with 16 points and 104 goals shipped - conceded more shots than Manchester United over the whole season.",
      "Ten Hag puts this down to the injuries he has had to contend with, particularly in defence. Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez, the left side of a solid United defence last season, were more absent than present.",
      "The volume of injuries, no side in the league had more injuries resulting in a player missing one or more games (Premier Injuries), also prevented United from finding any consistency when Ten Hag was forced to make alterations.",
      "United used 15 different centre-back pairings this season, closing the campaign with Casemiro at the heart of defence for the final six league games. He had three separate centre-back partners in that time.",
      "There were signs of Casemiro finding his feet at centre-back by the end, although it was his performances in midfield that drew most criticism. Ten Hag's set-up didn't help the 31-year-old.",
      "The chasm so often seen between United's midfield and defence was alarming. A high press with a low block? \"They defend like no team I've seen before,\" said Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher in a scathing assessment in February on Monday Night Football.",
      "Casemiro's time could be up at the top level and a transfer this summer has been widely mooted. On-loan midfielder Sofyan Amrabat appears unlikely to remain, either. Finding a more suitable defensive midfielder will be crucial.",
      "United need a player who can also bring control after recording their lowest average possession for a season since records began.",
      "Ten Hag defended the way his side were set up when they conceded 31 shots in a 1-1 draw at Brentford, a game United were very fortunate not to lose. \"We concede shots, but we don't concede so many goals\", he said.",
      "True on that occasion, but not an accurate reflection of the whole season. United have never conceded so many goals in a Premier League season. The 58 goals let in this season surpasses the year when the wheels came off for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021/22.",
      "Unsurprisingly, a team that ships so many goals tends to lose quite often. Ten Hag lost more games this season than any other United manager has in the Premier League era.",
      "They lost 14 times in the league, twice more than in 2021/22. Going further back, this is United's most league defeats since 1989/90, when they lost 16 times under Ferguson.",
      "It has been the nature of certain defeats which has made the season particularly painful for United. They've lost by two or more goals on nine occasions across all competitions.",
      "Results such as the 4-0 thrashing at Crystal Palace and being comfortably beaten 3-0 at home by Bournemouth paint a picture of a side that has the propensity to crumble.",
      "Ten Hag kept his job in part because of his work developing academy products Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho. The two teenagers being the match-winners in the game that may have saved his job was apt.",
      "Garnacho's opener was the first goal a teenager had scored in an FA Cup final since 2004. That was Cristiano Ronaldo for United against Millwall. Sir Matt Busby's, 'If you're good enough, you're old', philosophy endures at United under Ten Hag.",
      "The manager's faith in youth was perhaps one of the most powerful arguments for staying on. It would've felt like a case of unfinished business had he been let go.",
      "On top of Mainoo and Garnacho, there are a raft of promising young players coming through the academy and Ten Hag is not afraid to use them.",
      "Ethan Wheatley became the 250th academy player to represent United at senior level earlier this season. He is part of a cohort that just won a domestic treble at U18 level. Financial constraints could open the door for some to make the leap.",
      "United, of course, have had an academy player in every matchday squad since 1937. Under Ten Hag there appears to be no chance of that run, lasting more than 4,000 matches, ending anytime soon.",
      "Add in the likes of Rasmus Hojlund to that equation and Ten Hag is building a young core of players to develop over the next season at the very least.",
      "This injection of enthusiasm has been vital for Ten Hag to instil his high-energy approach - United were pressing more than ever this season.",
      "There have been signs of the out-of-possession work paying off - take Garnacho's goal against City when he forced an error by Josko Gvardiol. The hope is another season with the same ideas brings more consistency.",
      "Ten Hag's first season, which secured a third-place finish and success in the Carabao Cup, provides more room for optimism. For now, he's been given the benefit of the doubt that he can deliver when not dealing with an injury crisis."

      "Erik ten Hag had looked doomed at Manchester United but that FA Cup win over Manchester City at Wembley has changed the mood. Will he be able to build on this belated backing? In The Debrief, Adam Bate takes a look...",
      "Wednesday 12 June 2024 10:27, UK",
      "When Manchester United were crushed 4-0 by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park at the start of May, there had appeared no way back for Erik ten Hag. Even the manager admitted that his team had been “easy to beat” – it felt like the end.",
      "There was some sympathy for the injuries that had robbed him of the opportunity to field his best team and an appreciation that off-field issues had complicated his two years in charge. Still, it did not seem enough to make the case for a third.",
      "And yet, victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup final altered that view more than many might have imagined any one game could. United were deserved winners, Ten Hag executing his tactical plan to perfection in confounding Pep Guardiola.",
      "The unexpected triumph meant that he had delivered a trophy in each of his first two seasons, something no United manager had done before, and, just as pertinently, something neither Guardiola nor Jurgen Klopp had managed either.",
      "In doing so, it not only secured European football but, with the goals scored by two teenagers, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, it lent credence to the notion that Ten Hag was building something, that there was cause for optimism after all.",
      "Even his manner seemed to change. After offering so many excuses for the inexcusable, Ten Hag roused the club with his robust words. Essentially, he came out fighting, addressing the supporters on the pitch after the final home game of the season.",
      "\"This season is not over yet,\" he told them. \"First, we go to Brighton, where we travel for three points, and then we go to Wembley. And I promise you those players will give everything to get that cup and bring it to Old Trafford.\" They won both matches.",
      "Emboldened in the aftermath of his FA Cup final victory, Ten Hag almost dared the decision-makers at United to find someone better. \"If they do not want me, I go anywhere else and do what I did my whole career, winning games and trophies.\"",
      "Whether any of this means that the club's new hierarchy have made the right decision in continuing with Ten Hag remains to be seen. While the past month has seen the Dutchman's reputation enhanced, the same cannot be said for their conduct.",
      "Talk of a 'full review' sounded professional in theory but in practice it was an awkward process. The public pursuit of alternative options was messy, those apparently targeted so different in profile that it looked like a scattergun approach.",
      "That the conclusion of their review now looks likely to result in a new contract for the man they had actively considered removing from his job speaks to the paucity of options rather than any great conviction in his work to date. Concerns remain.",
      "What if options improve and results do not? This summer was an opportunity for a fresh start under new leadership. If United begin next season badly that opportunity will have been wasted. They will hardly be able to claim the warning signs were not there.",
      "Ten Hag has much work to do to show that he can address the issues that have arisen on his watch, the extraordinary number of shots conceded being among them. There are those supporters still waiting for a clear style of play to emerge too.",
      "Any kind of continuation of those problems risks this move eventually coming to be seen as wishful thinking rather than a cold analysis of the facts. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his advisers really are invested now. He is no longer just the coach they inherited.",
      "For now, as unlikely as it had once seemed, Ten Hag is their man. After plumbing the depths that night against Palace, it is some comeback already. If this were to prove a turning point as Manchester United rise again, it would be truly remarkable."

      "\"It was apparent from a very early stage that he was an exceptional kid,\" Vare tells Sky Sports. \"It's hard to say when they're so young but you could just tell from the minute he came in.\"",
      "Mainoo grew up in nearby Cheadle Hulme and joined Cheadle and Gatley when he was just four.",

      "To anyone who witnessed the dramatic winner against Wolves in February, Mainoo's ability to beat several opponents before calmly producing a finish from the edge of the area in the dying minutes of the game may have raised eyebrows. But Vare had seen something similar over a decade previously.",

      "\"All of our boys are high-potential but you certainly could see that Kobbie had some attributes that meant we wanted to continue working with him,\" he tells Sky Sports.",

      "\"I've seen him play in all sorts of attacking positions. Around the age of 15, 16, he was more of an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "Not that United was Mainoo's only focus. He continued to play for Shots, a grassroots club coached by Paul Newton, who previously worked with Mainoo at Cheadle and Gatley.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo may be known all over Europe now but Shots was home to some famous names - Kai Rooney, Jacey Carrick, Ben Aguero, Roman Walker and Tyler and Jack Fletcher have all been through the club.",
      "But Mainoo's ability to make a name for himself was in evidence back in 2017, when he scored the winning goal as Shots claimed the North West Junior Champions League  - a competition Newton said he had been trying to win for a decade.",
      "'He was a little bit too comfortable'",
      "It's not just Mainoo's technical abilities that were immediately obvious to the coaches that helped guide him during his childhood. Time and again, it's Mainoo's calm temperament that those who worked with him remember.",
      "\"One of the things that struck me with Kobbie was, even at that young age, he was very calm, very laid back and soaked everything up,\" says Vare.",
      "\"That's one of his super strengths. He doesn't seem to be phased by anything.\"",
      "Cox tells a similar story, saying: \"Probably his most impressive quality was his character and his personality.",
      "\"Kobbie's always been humble, laid back - maybe even quiet off the pitch.\"",
      "As others fell by the wayside, Mainoo's progress through the age groups at United was smooth and he made his debut in the UEFA Youth League - an U19s tournament - aged just 16.",
      "But the highlight came at Old Trafford in May 2022, when United beat Nottingham Forest 3-1 in the FA Youth Cup final. Alejandro Garnacho scored a brace as United lifted the trophy in front of more than 67,000 fans.",
      "That same month, Mainoo signed a professional contract with United. Eleven years after first training with the club, he was now finally on the verge of the first team.",
      "Yet the cool, calm and composed Mainoo still had some improvements to make in the eyes of Erik ten Hag. The manager felt he was possibly a little too laid back.",
      "\"I think very quickly I saw him,\" explained Ten Hag, who joined United in the summer of 2022.",
      "\"I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable in the U21s. He should be much more dominant.\"",
      "A first-team debut came against Charlton in the Carabao Cup in January 2023, followed by one brief appearance each in the FA Cup and Premier League.",
      "The plan was for Mainoo to be incorporated into Ten Hag's squad for the 2023/24 season - that was until he suffered an ankle injury on United's pre-season tour of the USA that would keep him sidelined well into the campaign.",
      "For the first time, events were conspiring against Mainoo. But his time was coming.",
      "Picture courtesy of @kobbie",
      "Picture courtesy of @kobbie",
      "'This boy is special'",
      "Mainoo isn't used to being upstaged but, after seeing Garnacho grab the headlines in the FA Youth Cup final two seasons earlier, the Argentina international did it again at Goodison Park last November.",
      "Aged 18, Ten Hag handed Mainoo his first Premier League start against Everton. All eyes were on the academy graduate - at least until the third minute, when Garnacho scored a goal for the ages.",
      "No matter. United won 3-0 and Ten Hag had been convinced by Mainoo. Having never previously started a top-flight game, he was only left out twice for the remainder of the season.",
      "Gareth Southgate was convinced, too. Less than five months after his first Premier League start, Mainoo skipped the U21s and made his senior England debut against Brazil - although 17-year-old Endrick snatched the headlines by scoring the winner.",
      "Not to be outdone, Mainoo ensured he was the star act three days later, being named player of the match on his first international start as England drew 2-2 with Belgium in the final camp before the Euros squad was announced. Once again, Mainoo's timing was impeccable.",
      "Less than two weeks later, he scored that goal against Liverpool. Less than two months later, he scored that winner against City - the team he turned down more than a decade ago.",
      "Mainoo's rise is no doubt a source of pride for Cox - who first encountered the local boy when he was just 11 - but it's not just his exploits on the field that have caught his eye.",
      "\"As much as I've been impressed by what he's done on the pitch, I've been really impressed with the way he's dealt with the media and coped with the spotlight,\" says Cox.",
      "\"He's remained cool but expressed the side of him that we've known since he was a little boy.\"",
      "But for United midfielders - especially those emerging from the academy - there can be few greater sources of praise than the player Xavi and Zinedine Zidane agreed was the greatest of their generation.",
      "After witnessing Mainoo's match-winning display in the FA Cup final, Paul Scholes wrote on social media: \"Read a few comparisons between me and this kid last week... don't waste your time. He is 10 times the player I was at 19.",
      "\"Just love the way he receives the ball, the calmness, the awareness of what's around him and of course big goals in big games. This boy is special.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is Next Up.",
      "- Next Up: Endrick is no longer a name, he is a reality",
      "- Next Up: How to follow and what's coming up..."

      "Scott Law, 43, pleaded not guilty to a charge of common assault after being accused of headbutting Roy Keane during Arsenal's 3-1 win over Manchester United in September; the former Man Utd captain was working as a Sky Sports pundit at the Emirates Stadium",
      "Thursday 6 June 2024 15:35, UK",
      "A man has been found guilty of headbutting Roy Keane at a Premier League match.",
      "Scott Law, 43, of Waltham Abbey, Essex, was accused of assaulting the former Manchester United captain on September 3 last year.",
      "The confrontation took place as Arsenal beat Manchester United 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium, where Keane was working as a pundit.",
      "Footage on social media appeared to show Micah Richards stepping in. Keane said he was left \"in shock\" by the clash.",
      "Law, who pleaded not guilty to a charge of common assault, had told the court Keane told him to \"meet him outside\" after \"banter turned more aggressive\".",
      "The fracas began when Keane and Richards were walking to do the final match analysis after Arsenal's win, the trial at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court heard.",
      "Keane was then allegedly headbutted through doors at the Emirates by Law, whose defence team said CCTV footage from inside the stadium - shown in court - displayed the pundit elbowing the defendant in the face.",
      "Giving evidence, Keane told the court: \"There was lots of noise and shouting, as you would expect at a football match.",
      "\"I was just walking and, before I knew it, I was hit. I felt the contact and fell back through some doors.",
      "\"I was absolutely not expecting it. The only way I can describe it is that I was in shock. I didn't expect it to happen, not when I was in my workplace.\"",
      "Keane said he suffered bruising on his chest and arms as a result of the incident.",
      "Giving evidence to the court, Richards denied accusations by Law's defence barrister that he had claimed to see the headbutt because he was \"Roy's mate\" and had become his \"puppy\" and \"stooge\".",
      "Richards said he \"grappled\" with Law following the alleged incident, adding he was in \"disbelief\" at what he witnessed.",
      "Richards added: \"I felt sorry for Roy. Just because of the fact you've come to work, to do your job and you've been assaulted.",
      "\"I could see he was physically shaken up. You do what any friend would do, or any colleague - step in and try to help the situation.\"",
      "He added: \"It was a surreal moment. We weren't going to a UFC match. We were at work.\"",
      "Law, who was sat beneath the Sky Sports studio during the match, said Keane was \"angry\" throughout the entire game.",
      "He claimed Keane \"picked me out and started telling me to see him outside\". Then, when Law claimed he went inside the stadium to go to the toilet, he said he encountered the pundit, who \"collided into him\".",
      "Prosecutor Simon Jones KC asked Law: \"Are you seriously saying that Roy Keane ran into the top of your head?\"",
      "Law, who cried while being questioned, said: \"I put my head down in a defensive manner to protect my face.\"",
      "Jones said Law's \"ridiculous\" defence had \"changed dramatically\" from a prepared statement he gave to police the day after the incident.",
      "Asked about the apparent differences in this statement, Law replied: \"I'd had no sleep - I was guilty by media. It was the worst night of my life.\"",
      "Delivering his verdict, District Judge Angus Hamilton said he believed Law had been \"untruthful about what happened\" during the match.",
      "Mr Hamilton continued: \"There was no reason Mr Keane should have picked on him in particular.\" Keane \"was calm and not agitated\" when he left the studio, he added.",
      "The judge said Keane's reputation as the so-called \"hard man of football\" was \"years ago and was confined to the football pitch\".",
      "\"I'm sure Mr Law assaulted Mr Keane,\" concluded the judge.",
      "Law did not react as the verdict was delivered."
