      "Ayden Heaven says Manchester United need to copy Arsenal’s ruthlessness when it comes to scoring from set-pieces.",
      "The Gunners scored 22 goals from set-pieces in the Premier League last season on their way to finishing runners-up to champions Liverpool.",
      "Defender Heaven joined United from Arsenal in January for £1.5million and says he wants to emulate the goalscoring exploits of former team-mates Gabriel and William Saliba.",
      "“I watched them very closely, the likes of Saliba and Gabriel,” said Heaven. “I learned a lot from them.",
      "“You can see they're quite good in the air, aren't they, from corners. I've said in the past I want to score more, and I'm working on that. That's what I want to add to my game, scoring from set pieces.”",
      "Heaven, 18, had a run of starts for United last season before an injury at Leicester sidelined him, although he returned towards the end of the campaign.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim has huge faith in the versatile centre-back and Heaven intends to make his mark in the upcoming season and stake his claim for a regular starting place.",
      "“I just want to focus on the basics at the moment, and getting in the United team for the new season,” said Heaven.",
      "“I'm really happy. I played in the last couple of games of the season, I've played more than I probably expected and I've done well in them.",
      "“I was surprised at the amount of games I played, but I knew when I was going to play, I was going to make an impact.",
      "“I can play in the middle, on the left, but the left probably more suits me more because of my ability with the ball.",
      "“I can drive with the ball, I can overlap if I'm needed to and I can get forward more. That's one of my biggest strengths.”",

      "Ruben Amorim presided over a horror campaign last term as United finished 15th in the Premier League, and marked improvements are now being demanded after a summer on the training pitch and some shrewd recruitment.",
      "The club have been keen to bolster their misfiring attack this summer, alongside Mbeumo and Cunha, Diego Leon has been added, but there are several issues that still exist within the United squad and Shearer claims they have a number of problems areas to address before they can even think about trying to qualify for the Europa League.",
      "United are yet to add a No 9 given the struggles experienced by the likes of Rasmus Hojlund. No new wing-backs have come in despite Amorim playing a 3-4-3 formation and they continue to persevere with Andre Onana in goal.",
      "Shearer told Betfair: \"Last year was a disaster for Man United. It will be better than that this season I've no doubt, but how much better will depend on how much business they do between now and the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"There's no doubt they need a top-class centre-forward which would go well with Cunha and Mbuemo so they've still got business to do and it depends on what quality they bring in. Even with just Cunha and Mbuemo, there's no doubt they'll improve on last season. As I said, they're still three, maybe four top players away from challenging for the top six.\"",
      "Amorim has claimed that, should he begin the season against Arsenal in mid-August with his current squad then he would be happy. However concerns remain around United, who ended up being 24 points off the Champions League spots and 42 off champions Liverpool.",
      "Shearer has also been quick to point out that Mbeumo, one of their major recruits, will leave midseason to take part in the Africa Cup of Nations. That will place more pressure on United's depth.",
      "He said: \"Mbuemo will likely be going to AFCON, but you know that when you sign these players. You just have to get on with it and accept it. He'll be a big player for Man United so to be without him for that amount of time will hurt him and Man United but other clubs will have the same problem.\"",
      "United have reportedly had a loan offer for Emi Martinez turned down. Aston Villa have also made it clear that Ollie Watkins is not for sale. Earlier in the summer Liam Delap, who was on the club's radar, picked a move to Chelsea ahead of a switch to Manchester.",

      "Manchester United take on West Ham on Sunday as the two Premier League sides look to ready themselves for the new season. Ruben Amorim has been incredibly busy this summer with regards to enhancing the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag in November, welcoming a host of fresh faces to Old Trafford.",
      "United struck a deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha as the early window opened in June in a £59.5million move, before finally sealing a deal for Bryan Mbeumo after negotiations with Brentford dragged out for the best part of a month. In the end, the two sides agreed a fee which could reach as high as £71m including add-ons, as the Cameroon international looks to hit the ground running in the north west.",
      "It comes after United suffered a sub-par 16th-place finish in the Premier League last season, and fans will hope for a better showing in 2025/26 given that Amorim has received the backing of the board and a full pre-season campaign. West Ham, meanwhile, finished 14th last time around, and will hope to start the season strongly when they kick off their Premier League campaign against newly-promoted Sunderland next month.",
      "Graham Potter has also been active during thetransfer window, welcoming Kyle Walker-Peters from Southampton on a free, as well as acquiring El Hadji Malick Diouf from Slavia Prague for £19m and Jean-Clair Todibo from Nice in a £32.8m move after a successful loan spell.",
      "Manchester United's pre-season clash with West Ham is a part of the Premier League Summer Series mini-tournament which is taking place in the USA this weekend, with Bournemouth and Everton also taking part. As a result, the Red Devils will meet the Hammers at the 82,500-capacity MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which is home to the New York Giants and the New York Jets of the NFL.",
      "Unfortunately for UK-based fans keen on watching the game live, it will be a late one. That's because the game is set to take place at 7pm local time in New Jersey, which is 12am Sunday in the UK.",
      "It's not the only late game of the tournament either, with Everton's clash with Bournemouth having taken place at 9pm, also on Saturday. West Ham's game with Everton on Wednesday gets underway at 11.30pm, and United's clash with Bournemouth starts at 2.30am UK time on Thursday.",

      "Ruben Amorim is wasting no time in ensuring last season's worst-ever Premier League campaign for Manchester United was a one-off.",
      "Amorim has been up at 6am on United's pre-season tour of the US, wasting no time and using every minute to plan with his coaching staff ahead of the new campaign.",
      "The United head coach is relishing a first full pre-season with his squad, having wanted to wait until this summer to take over, but being forced to take over midway through last term.",
      "Taking charge midway through a season is never ideal, not least when Amorim changed United's system from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3, a radical departure from what the players were used to. United's players struggled to get to grips with the new formation, the upshot a 15th-placed finish, the club's worst position for 51 years, while they also missed out on Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "But the doom and gloom of last season has been replaced by a tangible air of optimism and excitement among the United squad and management during the first week of their three-game US tour.",
      "Amorim has left behind those players who want out of United and who could spread a negative influence within the US tour party, namely Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia. Marcus Rashford, who fell out with Amorim within weeks of the new manager's arrival, has begun a new chapter at Barcelona, and only players fully committed to the team are present in the US.",
      "Amorim underlined that message ahead of United's tour opener, against Premier League rivals West Ham, in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, where next year's World Cup final will be held. The United boss stressed the importance of his first pre-season in terms of building a bond with his players, for them to strengthen existing relationships and build new ones with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The connection between £133.5million duo Cunha and Mbeumo will be crucial as Amorim looks to solve United's goal scoring problems, his side having only managed to find the net 44 times in the league last season.",
      "Amorim still wants to recruit a new No.9 to lead United's attack, but knows that in Cunha and Mbeumo, he has two players with a proven ability to score in the league, the pair netting 15 and 20 goals respectively last season.",
      "“They can both play as a striker,” said Amorim. “But we also have Josh [Zirkzee], we have Rasmus [Hojlund], so our focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the position is there for them. They have to work and they have other players who are fighting for that position.",
      "“But again, I'm really pleased, because they proved that the qualities that they have, they are really humble, which is really important, and the best thing is that they chose to be here. In our club at the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player. So if we have to start the season with this squad, I'm happy, because all the players who are here want to be here - that for me is the most important thing.",
      "“With Matheus and Brian - also Diego, but Diego is a different situation because he's a potential player. But with Matheus and Bryan, we are clearly a better team.”",

      "A move for Benjamin Sesko to Manchester United appears unlikely - at least if the striker's past comments are anything to go by. United have been searching for a new centre forward all summer, but have so far failed to secure a suitable signing.",
      "They missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal and Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool, while efforts to land Victor Osimhen and Ollie Watkins have also come up short. As a result, they've turned their attention to Sesko - who was previously in talks to join Arsenal before negotiations stalled and the Gunners pivoted to Gyokeres instead.",
      "RB Leipzig are believed to have lowered their asking price for Sesko, with the Slovenian striker now available for around £60million, according to BILD. However, any hopes United have of securing his signature may depend on whether Sesko has softened his stance on the club.",
      "United made an approach for him in 2023 following his breakout season at Red Bull Salzburg, where he netted 18 goals in all competitions and attracted interest from several top European sides. In the end, Sesko opted for a move to Leipzig - and later hinted that United's style of play had been a key factor in his decision to turn down a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "\"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations [about which club I would sign for]. But I think it was better to come [to RB Leipzig],\" he admitted in 2024.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",
      "After missing out on Sesko, the Red Devils turned to another highly rated but similarly unproven talent in Rasmus Hojlund, spending £72m on the young Dane. Two years on, however, the career trajectories of the two strikers have diverged significantly.",
      "Sesko has gone from strength to strength, scoring 18 and then 21 goals in successive seasons for RB Leipzig. Hojlund, on the other hand, has struggled to find his footing.",
      "After being thrown into a faltering United side, he has battled inconsistency and a lack of goals, and now appears likely to leave the club with his reputation diminished. Hojlund's struggles suggest Sesko was right to pick Leipzig - a club where he could hone his skills and develop without the weight of expectation that comes with leading the line for a Premier League colossal like United.",
      "Ironically, two years later, Sesko may yet make the move he once rejected. United's head of scouting, Christopher Vivell, is a known admirer and has personally watched the Slovenian striker in action.",
      "The 22-year-old could become the focal point of United's new-look front line, joining recent arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to form a revamped attacking trio. The club have already splashed £133m this summer, and signing Sesko would take their total outlay close to £200m.",
      "But with Marcus Rashford being shipped off to Barcelona and Hojlund heavily linked with an exit, reinforcements up front aren't just a priority - they're a necessity.",
      "Sesko is not agitating for a move, and with his contract running until 2029, Leipzig are under no immediate pressure to sell. However, it's understood that if their £60m valuation is met, they would be open to letting him speak with interested clubs.",
      "The fee could represent a relative bargain in today's market, but United had the chance to sign him for a fraction of that price just a few years ago. Back in 2021, then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer recommended the club move for the then-18-year-old, who was available for just £2.5m. United declined, viewing the deal as too risky.",

      "Ed Woodward believed that Manchester United's 2015 acquisition of Bastian Schweinsteiger would \"send shivers down the spines of rivals,\" only for the player to turn out to be a sensational flop. Woodward joined the board of directors of Old Trafford as an executive vice-chairman in 2012, before assuming David Gill's role of CEO the following year.",
      "And while the now 53-year-old aimed to hit the ground running with regards to welcoming fresh faces to the Red Devils squad, many of his transfers completely missed the mark. For instance, Woodward was at the helm when Paul Pogba' returned to United from Juventus in August 2016 in a mammoth deal.",
      "Of course, Pogba came through the youth system at United in 2011 before joining the Serie A stalwarts for a reported £1.5million the following year. But four years later, realising the error of their ways, the Red Devils board opted to bring him back to Old Trafford for a then-world-record fee of £89m.",
      "However, Pogba then returned to Juventus once more in 2022 on a free transfer, failing to recuperate even a fraction of the fee that they had spent bringing their academy graduate back to the northwest of England six years earlier. Pogba was just one of many expensive signings during Woodward's time at the club that failed to live up to expectations.",
      "Woodward was also at the helm when Schweinsteiger arrived from Bayern Munich in a £6.5m deal back in 2015, a move which on paper looked like a steal for the 13-time Premier League winners.",
      "After progressing through the Bavarian youth system in 2002, Schweinsteiger spent 13 years with Bayern, lifting eight Bundesliga titles, nine domestic cups and a Champions League. He also managed 121 caps for Germany and lifted the 2014 World Cup, before being named team captain following Philipp Lahm's retirement from international football.",
      "Given his wealth of experience at the highest levels, Woodward went as far as claiming that Schweinsteiger would leave rivals quaking in their boots when coming up against the midfield maestro shortly after his arrival in England. He was quoted as saying at the time: \"It’s fantastic to see a player like that come to Manchester United.",
      "\"He’s our first ever German, and what a German – he’s won absolutely everything and comes here with fantastic experience. When people see Bastian on the team sheet, that’s going to send some shivers down the spine.\"",
      "However, the reality is that Woodward may have set unreasonable expectations on the star, given how his tenure with the Premier League giants actually played out. During his maiden season with United, Schweinsteiger spent more than 130 days sidelined through injury.",
      "And when Jose Mourinho took the reins of the club from Louis van Gaal in the spring of 2016, he made it clear that Schweinsteiger was not part of his plans going forward, demoting the player to training with the U23 set-up in a move he faced heavy criticism for and that he has since admitted was a big mistake.",
      "Schweinsteiger played for United just 35 times over the course of his two-year stint with the club before he moved on to MLS outfit Chicago Fire in 2017. There, he scored eight goals and created 11 assists in 92 outings before retiring in 2019.",
      "Woodward, meanwhile, announced in 2021 that he would be resigning from his position at Manchester United. He parted ways with the club on February 1, 2022, but has since returned to work, having been appointed to the board of trustees for Bloomsbury Football Foundation last year.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Red Devils are on the lookout for a No 9 and have shortlisted three players with the England international among them. Villa signed Watkins several years ago after he impressed in the Championship and he's since proven himself in the Premier League.",
      "Villa, who lost Jhon Duran back in January, have made it known that they have no interest in selling their forward despite interest from those on the red half of Manchester. Watkins will hope to return to the club's first choice striker after a difficult few months to end the season.",
      "Ironically it was the loan arrival of Marcus Rashford from United that saw Watkins' playing time suffer as a result. Rashford has since left and joined Barcelona on loan, but it means Watkins will face less competition as things stand.",
      "Last term Villa enjoyed a run to the last eight of the Champions League, beating Club Brugge, before running PSG close in the quarter-finals. For that tie Unai Emery opted for Rashford over Watkins - which was not well received.",
      "The ex-Brentford striker made it clear that was not a role he wanted. Watkins said last season: \"He's the manager at the end of the day and you've got to respect his decision, but I'm not one of those players that's happy to sit on the bench.

      "Matheus Cunha says he does not feel the pressure of hauling fallen giants Manchester United back to the top after last season's disastrous campaign. United signed Cunha for £62.5million and followed that up with the £71m capture of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford to strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Cunha scored 12 Premier League goals last season and there will be a huge onus on him to solve United's goalscoring crisis, but the 26-year-old played down the pressure.",
      "“I really think the pressure at this club is not really pressure it's a privilege, because this is one of the biggest clubs in the world,” said Brazil star Cunha.",
      "“When Ruben comes to me and shows all the pressure that I have to help put the club back in the perfect times again, I feel like it's a challenge that I want to do for me and my career.",
      "“United is always one of the clubs that needs to be there and to be someone who can be a part of the process is something that, like I say, is a big privilege.",
      "“So I don't think about being perfect at the start, honestly. I think to be myself and to help the team. I have started to feel that I'm part of the group, we start to do everything very well and then start thinking about doing everything well.",
      "“So I'm very comfortable to be here, I'm very comfortable with the pressure right now, and I hope everything can be better too - don't think about the bad times.”",
      "Asked why he chose United, when he could have joined a club that could offer him Champions League football next season, Cunha said: “United was always my dream club and when you can make a dream come true, it's an easy decision to make.",
      "“But of course he [Amorim] was one of the big parts, he talked to me always, and then showed how important I am for him, and of course I felt very well about that.”",
      "Earlier this week, Bryan Mbeumo said he's overjoyed to have the chance to follow in Cristiano Ronaldo's footsteps at the “biggest club in the world”. After seven weeks and some tense talks between the clubs, the 25-year-old finally completed his move from Brentford on Monday for £65million plus a potential £6million in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo has signed a deal until 2030, with the option of a further season, at what he calls the “club of my dreams” – one whose shirt he wore as a kid growing up in France. “From the start I wanted to join this club, this massive club, and now I’m here and I’m just really happy,” the Cameroon international told club media.",
      "“For me, it’s the biggest club in the world, in England as well. I think the fans are crazy, the stadium is amazing, and I think every player wants to play here. I think my first top was a Manchester United top with Ronaldo behind. It’s just such a big club and, yeah, I’m really happy to be here.”",
      "Mbeumo says he idolised Ronaldo and Lionel Messi growing up, as well as admiring Neymar and Eden Hazard, and joins Cunha in bolstering what has been a blunt United attack. The forward says the Brazil international will “bring something new” to a team that he is excited to get to know better when they head to the United States for their pre-season tour on Tuesday.",
      "“I think it’s really important for me joining a new club,” Mbeumo said. “It’s important to create links as soon as possible, automatism as well with the team-mates, so in and out the pitch.",
      "“The spirit is really important. Yeah, create a group, being involved as soon as possible, for me, it’s something really important.”",

The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss though has been given the opportunity to work consistently on the training ground, which he wasn't afforded throughout last season.",

      "The club recently wrapped up a deal for Mbeumo after negotiating with Brentford for weeks, before their third bid was finally accepted. Earlier in the summer they were able to land Cunha, owing to a release clause in his Wolves contract.",
      "United have fallen foul in the past of signing players who have not produced. Amorim is clearly keen to avoid a repeat but believes the group he currently has have developed an understanding. He claimed: \"You feel the bond between the players in the best teams. We remind ourself how special it is to be at the best club in the world. I really like to be in a group that is healthy. We are going to suffer but that feeling of bonding is really important. The spirit is positive.\"",

      "It's now being reported that Wrexham have also made an approach for Eriksen, who left United this summer. The midfielder, who has also turned out for Ajax, Tottenham, Inter Milan and Brentford during his career, has an impressive CV.",
      "The Danish international has won league titles in the Netherlands and Italy, as well as English domestic cup wins with United. Eriksen joining Wrexham would therefore represent a major coup for the Championship new boys.",
      "However, despite being impressed by the club's offer, the 33-year-old has turned down the chance to move to North Wales. According to Eriksen's agent, Martin Schoot, Eriksen is keen to play at the highest level for as long as possible and has been approached by clubs from around the globe, including Saudi Arabia, the United States, Turkey and Brazil.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Mail, Schoot said: \"Wrexham are really upgrading everything both on and off the field, and it is a hugely impressive project, as you can see from the presence of people like Michael Williamson [chief executive] there.",

      "Wrexham's chief executive previously worked at Inter Milan in several senior roles between 2014 and 2018. While Williamson had already left by the time Eriksen arrived in 2020, the American is understood to be making the most of his Italian contacts to aid the Red Dragons' recruitment.",

      "Alexander Isak's potential departure from Newcastle United could jeopardise Manchester United's pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. Despite securing the services of Matheus Cunha in early June and recently finalising the signing of Bryan Mbeumo, United are still on the hunt for attacking reinforcements.",
      "After Viktor Gyokeres rejected a reunion with Ruben Amorim to join Arsenal, the Red Devils' focus has reportedly shifted to Sesko. With the north Londoners close to sealing a deal for Gyokeres, United seemed to have had a clear path to the towering Slovenian forward.",
      "However, if Newcastle offload Isak, who has been linked with Liverpool and Saudi Arabian outfit Al Hilal after informing Eddie Howe's side that he would like to explore an exit from St James' Park, the Magpies will be expected to move for Sesko. This could spell trouble for United, who have already missed out on many striking targets this summer.",
      "According to The Athletic, Newcastle are considering a move for Sesko, who boasts a record of 27 goals and seven assists in 64 Bundesliga outings for Leipzig. The Daily Mail have also claimed that Newcastle have approached Leipzig about the possibility of signing Sesko, who could command a fee in the region of £60m to £70m.",
      "With Isak seemingly looking for an exit, Newcastle might decide to capitalise on what could potentially be a Premier League record transfer fee for a player. If this happens, they will likely speed up their chase for another prolific goal-scorer and Sesko seems to fit the bill.",
      "Given that the Magpies are competing in the Champions League this season, United may struggle to lure Sesko to Old Trafford. Furthermore, having already splashed out around £132.5m on Mbeumo and Cunha, United will probably need to offload players before they can make a serious offer, while Newcastle could have ample funds to spend if Isak's departure is accelerated.",
      "After netting only 44 goals in the Premier League last season, United are still in dire need of a lethal striker. Cunha and Mbeumo are both sharp finishers, with 35 goals and 14 assists between them for their respective clubs last year.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, neither are traditional centre forwards, which United have been searching for this summer. The Red Devils have already missed out on Delap, Gyokeres and, most recently, Hugo Ekitike, who secured a £79m move to Liverpool this week.",
      "United reportedly held discussions with the representatives of Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson, who is now thought to carry an £80m price tag. It's now understood a bid for the Senegal international from the Red Devils is unexpected.",
      "French outlet Foot Mercato also reported that Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani, who spent last season on loan at Juventus, is another potential target for United. However, Sesko could be the preferred choice for United.",
      "German media suggests he carries a price tag of around £60m - £12m less than what United shelled out to Atalanta for Rasmus Hojlund in 2023 - making the 22-year-old an attractive prospect.",
      "United still have Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee in their squad, but neither have proven they can lead the attack. The loan move of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona has freed up space and about £12m in wages, but United will still need to generate funds first before they can entertain bidding for another forward.",
      "Resolving the futures of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, who the club are openly willing to sale, will likely be top of Amorim's agenda, especially now Newcastle are putting pressure on them in the race for Sesko.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United’s hopes of selling Antony this summer have been boosted amid reported interest from Saudi Arabia. Antony is part of the so-called ‘bomb squad’ at United, having been frozen out of the first-team set-up by Ruben Amorim, who is desperate to offload him.",
      "United have signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer for a combined total of £133.5million and know they need to sell players in order to balance the books. Marcus Rashford has been sent on loan to Barcelona, who are covering his wages, but Antony remains on the books along with Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Amorim has jetted off to Chicago to start United’s pre-season tour without the exiled foursome, who have been told to look for new clubs. Antony spent the second half of last season on loan at Real Betis and had hoped to move to Seville permanently.",
      "The Brazilian winger got nine goals and five assists in 26 games for Betis last season, reviving his career and earning many new fans in the process. Betis are keen to re-sign him for the 2025/26 season, but want another loan, rather than a permanent deal.",
      "United have different ideas and are seeking a club who will sign Antony, who cost £85m from Ajax in 2022. They have received some interest from Atletico Madrid, but the Spanish side have not followed up on it yet.",
      "It is understood that Antony would prefer to stay in Europe’s top leagues, rather than move to the Middle East. Erik ten Hag – the man who oversaw his best form at Ajax and authorised his big-money move to United – is now in charge of Leverkusen, but he has distanced himself from a transfer.",
      "“He has great quality,” he told BILD recently. “I signed him twice. He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.”",
      "Antony has returned just 12 goals and five assists in 96 games for United and is a major drain on resources. He earns £200,000-a-week at Old Trafford, where he is under contract until June 2027.",
      "After a miserable time at United, he loved his stint at Betis, who he helped reached the Conference League final. “Yes, I'm very happy. I found myself,” he said at the time. “I needed to find myself and be happy. My family needed to be happy too. Every day that passes confirms it was the best decision and as you said, I'm enjoying the city and the club every day.”",

      "Manchester United icon Rio Ferdinand has advised the club to avoid RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko in their quest for a new striker. The Red Devils have already secured the services of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer to bolster their attack.",
      "Last season, Ruben Amorim's team lacked a reliable goalscorer, with Amad and Bruno Fernandes leading the scoring charts with a mere eight league goals each. United have been linked with a move for Sesko as the club attempt to improve their striking options.",
      "The 22-year-old, who has also been on Arsenal's radar, scored 21 goals across all competitions last term. Yet, Ferdinand has warned United that they need a more experienced forward than Sesko.",
      "\"I think you've got to look at the here and now at the moment with Man United. That's what I said about a number nine,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel. \"I'm not really doubting [Sesko] as a player. I'm saying Man United need experience at the top of the pitch.",
      "\"They've got Hojlund, they've got Zirkzee, they've got Chido. Young, inexperienced players. They need someone to look at and go, 'That's how you play as a number nine.' That's how you do it. When you're going to buy somebody who hasn't got as much experience as I'd like, I think that's another risk. Is it worth taking with inexperienced players at this level?\".",
      "Ferdinand has hinted that Ollie Watkins, who is on United's radar, could be the perfect fit due to the Aston Villa striker's Premier League pedigree. While Ferdinand has emphasised the need for a new striker, the former defender confessed he'd be willing for United to overlook a forward in favour of splashing out on Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "\"If I don't get a striker, I'd go midfield. There's only one name I'm thinking about, I've got to be honest, who I think fits the bill for what we need,\" Ferdinand explained. \"An Amorim-type player as well. Physically great, can drive with the ball, can take it in all areas, very good tactically, great energy, great legs, Premier League experience, centre midfield. Baleba.",
      "\"That's who I go and get. That's my man. That's the one I go and get. I go and break the bank. So if I got the money for the four players that are surplus to requirements now, would I get a number nine or would I get Baleba?",
      "\"Would I get a number nine I'm not sure about, who's a bit young, inexperienced, or would I get Baleba with Premier League experience and know what he can do here? I'm going Baleba, sorry.",
      "\"I'm going to go with Baleba. I think he'll have a huge impact on this squad, on this team. You free up a few people in that midfield area as well to have a little less responsibility defensively because I think he's all-action. He can do it all.\"",
      "Baleba was signed by Brighton from Lille for approximately £26million (€30m) in 2023. The young midfielder, aged 21, made 34 appearances in the league for the Seagulls last season.",
      "Meanwhile, United's current striking options, consisting of Rasmus Hojlund, Josha Zikzee and highly-rated prospect Chido Obi, managed to score a total of seven league goals last season. United are hoping to boost their transfer budget through the potential sales of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia, who have all been omitted from the club's US pre-season tour.",

      "Luke Shaw is 'ready to quit' Manchester United and willing to listen to offers from other clubs. The defender has spent more than a decade at Old Trafford but is open to an exit from the side as interest gathers in his signature.",
      "Shaw, 30, appears ready to accept that his Red Devils career is coming to an end. The Southampton academy product is reported to be aware of 'serious' interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "The England international still has two years remaining on his contract and is in the United squad that travelled to the United States for their pre-season tour. Shaw will be in contention to face West Ham on Sunday and played against Leeds as Ruben Amorim's side returned to action for pre-season.",
      "Shaw will have to battle for his place in the team come the start of the season. While the full-back started in the Europa League final against Tottenham last term, he is set to face competition from the likes of Diogo Dalot, January arrival Patrick Dorgu and summer signing Diego Leon.",
      "Dorgu is perhaps favourite to be Amorim's first option at wingback for the new season. There are high hopes for £3.3million man Leon who joined from Cerro Porteno of Paraguay too.",
      "The 18-year-old played in the opening half of the draw with Leeds and was praised by head coach Amorim. “He did really well,\" said the Portuguese boss.",
      "\"He’s learning things, he’s powerful, he’s going to be a very good player.”",
      "Amorim is said to be in no rush to lose Shaw from his squad, despite the injury-plagued star carrying £150,000-a-week wages. But the versatile defender is keen to secure playing time having missed out on a number of opportunities due to his injury record.",
      "If Shaw decides to leave in the coming months, it appears unlikely that United would stand in his way. The defender has only made 27 appearances across the last two seasons.",
      "The 13-times Premier League champions will hope to earn fees from the exits of the likes of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia. United have already facilitated a move for Marcus Rashford but only on loan, despite wanting to bolster their transfer funds.",
      "In addition to Leon, United have spent significant sums on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a bid to revitalise the club's forward line.",

      "At one point, a hefty £100million price tag was attached to him, although there were no indications that United were prepared to shell out such an amount for the youngster. Last summer, it was rumoured that United were contemplating a £50million swoop for Ferguson, with Chelsea also reportedly showing interest.",
      "However, a move to Old Trafford never materialised and Ferguson's career hit a rough patch last season due to a lack of goals and persistent injuries. The 20-year-old spent the second half of the campaign at West Ham on loan after finding opportunities hard to come by at Brighton, but only managed to start one game for the Hammers.",
      "He is now looking to kickstart his career with Roma after joining the Serie A club on a season-long loan, a deal which includes a £32million right-to-buy option.",
      "Partnering Argentina World Cup-winning striker Paulo Dybala, Ferguson hit the ground running with his new club, scoring four times and providing an assist as Roma thrashed Italian lower-league side UniPomezia 9-0 in a friendly. United are on the hunt for a new striker this summer but abandoned their pursuit of him at the turn of the year, which may well come back to bite them if his debut performance is anything to by.",
      "Ferguson will return to England next month, with Roma set to play friendly matches against Aston Villa and Everton before commencing their Serie A campaign at home against Bologna on August 23.",
      "United's interest in Ferguson will have waned following his tough 2024/25 campaign. With young strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee both struggling, Ruben Amorim desperately required established Premier League attackers, leading to the summer arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to address those needs.",
      "Nevertheless, an impressive spell in Serie A could thrust Ferguson back into the thoughts of England's elite clubs. Following confirmation of his Roma loan switch, Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler explained: \"Evan had a challenging period across the past season and a half, and it has been one disrupted by niggling injury issues, which hasn't allowed him a run of games.",
      "\"He is over those injuries and has come back in great shape. Now he really wants to play regularly. This is an exciting opportunity in a strong league and with the prospect of European football.\"",

      "United did a reconnaissance of the SoFi Stadium in LA last year and are likely to have done so at this one. The press lounges are so vast they could house an away following. It is not an exaggeration to say that the one here is five times the size of Old Trafford's, at the very least.",
      "The majority of those starters could line up against Arsenal in 22 days. I interviewed Ayden Heaven in midweek and he flagged his preference to play on the left of the back three. He is going to get a chance to do so here in New Jersey.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could be one of the midfielders or one of the playmakers. I asked Ruben Amorim about Fernandes's role in the team and he suggested he would still occupy one of the two playmaker roles, despite the unconvincing state of United's midfield.",
      "Mainoo was excellent here two years ago against Arsenal and was the talk of the tour. Crushingly for him, he suffered an ankle injury 80-odd seconds into United's next game against Real Madrid in Houston and had to wait four months to play again.",

      "I warned Bryan Mbeumo might be named on the bench tonight - but he is actually absent from the squad. The forward missed time training with Brentford after returning from his summer holiday and is clearly not ready to feature in a competitive fixture, which is a shame.",
      "Ruben Amorim has gone with Bruno Fernandes, Rasmus Hojlund and Matheus Cunha in the attacking positions instead. Hojlund came off the bench for the second half against Leeds and would like to get a goal under his belt at the start of the USA tour.",

      "The Dane has not had a full pre-season since joining the club almost two years ago, arriving after the tour in 2023 and getting injured in the first game of it last year.",
      "Even if Hojlund ends this tour with, for example, four goals to his name, United will still need a new marksman before the transfer window shuts. However, a strong crop of performances and some goals could boost the Dane's chances of still having an important role to play this coming season.",
      "Furthermore, a strong pre-season could also put interested parties on red alert. He has already been of interest to Inter Milan this summer.",
      "West Ham opened their pre-season schedule with a 3-1 win against Grasshoppers (a Swiss football team, not insects) last weekend. The Irons won 2-0 at Old Trafford on May 11, with Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen firing them to a comfortable victory.",
      "At that stage, United's season was all about the Europa League final in Bilbao and the lifeless performance did not surprise. West Ham did the double over United in the Premier League last season, which should be a source of motivation for tonight in New Jersey, albeit the game is a friendly.",

Amorim said his two new signings, Matheus Cunha and Byran Mbeumo, can play down the middle, but his quote about being \"happy\" to start the season with his current squad would have made ears perk up amongst the press pack.",
      "Amorim ultimately provided a diplomatic answer and backed the current players at his disposal, which is common-sense management, although he surely cannot be content with potentially starting the new campaign without a new striker.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are guaranteed to provide goals, but a new centre-forward is still needed and United would be setting up Amorim to fail in 2025/2026 without strengthening that key position. They need a centre-forward who can put the ball in the net. It's not rocket science.",
      "United's pre-season tour of the United States this year is seeing them compete in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "The pre-season tournament features United, West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",

      "The competition does not feature extra-time or penalty shootouts.",
      "Tonight will be the first chance for fans to get a glimpse of Bryan Mbeumo following his £65million (with £6m in add-ons) transfer from Brentford.",
      "Mbeumo is a hugely exciting arrival, although he might not be ready to start against West Ham after supposedly missing time in training with Brentford after coming back from his summer holiday. It would be great to see Mbeumo start, preferably alongside Matheus Cunha, but prepare yourself because he might come on from the bench.",
      "Mbeumo will be desperate to show what he can do. He developed into one of the Premier League's finest forwards during his time in London and should provide cutting edge in front of goal this season. Most football fans have watched Mbeumo at some point and have thought, why hasn't a big club signed him yet?",
      "Mbeumo seemed destined for a multi-million pound move away from the Gtech Stadium and it's brilliant to see him in Manchester.",
      "I've been banging the drum about relocating Kobbie Mainoo back to a deeper midfield role for a while now and it was interesting to hear Ruben Amorim discuss which position his future lies in during yesterday's press conference.",
      "\"I think he can play in both positions, in the midfield,\" Amorim said. \"Last year, he played more in front. I think his perfect position is more near the ball, always with the ball.\"",
      "Amorim added that he is always on top of Mainoo to increase his rhythm and pace on the ball, but also said he has \"big plans\" for the youngster. Mainoo suffered from a few injuries last season, and chopping and changing his role did not make it easy for him to give the best account of himself.",
      "It feels like Amorim needs to decide on his best position for the new season and perhaps that will be in the pivot after experimenting with Mainoo in the No.10 role.",
      "I had the privilege of flying to Stockholm to cover the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds last weekend, although the game itself was entirely forgettable. United drew 0-0 with their historic rivals and Leeds probably deserved to win.",
      "The match was essentially about blowing away the cobwebs before the USA pre-season tour, so tonight's match against West Ham should have better intensity and flow. The players were given individual fitness programs to work on throughout their summer break and have looked notably lean in training photos.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has said that being in \"perfect\" condition is the minimum expectation and the players will go through the gears as the USA tour progresses.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim has confirmed he will wait until the second half of tonight's game before turning to his substitutes bench.",
      "The United chief made wholesale changes at half-time against Leeds United in Stockholm last weekend, meaning he deployed two completely different XIs.",
      "But following another week's worth of training, it is likely players could store a minimum of 60 minutes under their belts.",
      "He told club media:",
      "\"We are going to give more time to the starting XI. We are going to make changes during the second half, but we need to give more time, to have that impact in the players. It's important for them to have more time to feel the game, but it's not a decision [about] who's the best starting XI to start against Arsenal. We are going to see things. But, of course, we need to give more time because it's not the same to play for just 45. We need to increase the time.\"",
      "Ahead of United's opening game of their pre-season tour of the United States tonight, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see the Reds line up...",
      "Steven Railston:",
      "Tom Heaton should be the second-choice goalkeeper, so he should start against West Ham. Leny Yoro came on for the second half in the opening friendly against Leeds in Stockholm and it's logical to start him.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo caught the eye when he played in the deeper midfield role against Leeds and I would start him alongside Bruno Fernandes in the pivot, as I still believe that's where his future lies.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo needs to get up to speed after signing for United earlier in the week - he should start if he can manage the opening 45 minutes. Pre-season is the perfect time to experiment and I'd play Amad down the middle because it would be exciting to see him alongside Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "George Smith:",
      "Heaton did his chances of moving up the pecking order no harm at all in the second half against Leeds, making a handful of good saves. With Andre Onana absent through injury, he will be hoping to take full advantage.",
      "Ruben Amorim has plenty of scope to mix things up across the back line, meaning he could deploy one of several centre-back combinations. But after starting on the bench last weekend, I would like to see Yoro and Ayden Heaven in from the start.",
      "Diogo Dalot was bright off the bench in Stockholm and deserves a starting berth for this one, likewise Patrick Dorgu. Mainoo and Fernandes are a logical paring in midfield.",
      "Mbeumo is who everyone wants to catch a glimpse of this weekend and he should start if he is ready to. Cunha and Rasmus Hojlund can join him in attack.",
      "Coverage on MUTV will begin at 11pm, offering an hour's worth of build up ahead of kick-off at 12am. Coverage will conclude at 2.30am.",
      "Sky are running an identical schedule, meaning coverage of United against West Ham will follow coverage of Everton's clash with Bournemouth.",
      "United are competing in the Premier League Summer Series over the next week or so, meaning their tour will consist of three matches, and they will be keen to make a winning start.",
      "We will bring you regular updates and plenty of analysis throughout the night."

      "Heaven has only played six times for United but he made a stunning impression on his first Champions League and Premier League starts in back-to-back victories against Real Sociedad and Leicester City.",
      "A foot injury in the latter fixture sidelined Heaven for two months but the Londoner is well placed to challenge for a starting spot in head coach Ruben Amorim's back three.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Matheus Cunha led Ruben Amorim into the room at Soldier Field. A minor observation but one that highlights the confidence with which he has settled in at Manchester United.",
      "Leading from the front is expected of the United No.10 dating back beyond the first permanent recipient of that squad number, Mark Hughes. Amorim acknowledged Cunha could also play up front in the absence of a new striker.",
      "There was a breeziness about Cunha one seldom encounters with a new United signing that speaks. They can be stilted, reluctant or shielded from the press. It spoke volumes that Cunha was picked to flank Amorim for his first United press engagement. He spoke enthusiastically and engagingly.",
      "“I'm part of the group already,” Cunha said, “and everything that I can bring to help the team to go forward I'm very humble to do, because I think this is the most important point right now",
      "“I am maybe around two weeks already with the group, it's pre-season, there's a lot of physical things to do also. But yeah, I feel completely fine with all the tactics, everything, and every time he can give a little bit of time to explain to me some new things, so it's kind of very important to be new and then to adapt.",
      "“But I think with the time, everything will go off and then everyone will show what we do.”",
      "Cunha is a polyglot, which has eased his transition. He was conversing with Luke Shaw during training before Bruno Fernandes fixed the GPS tracker in his training top.",
      "Amorim was always bound to field more questions yet Cunha’s assuredness suggested he would have been at ease approaching the dais without his new coach. His English was fluent and delivered with a charm that belied the spikiness that caused Cunha to miss six games last season through ill-discipline. Cunha’s wife gave birth to their second child last week and he did radiate that bliss a father feels, however much he must miss his newborn daughter.",
      "Cunha shouldered the pressure in a Wolves team dependent on him to retain their Premier League status last season. ‘Scrutiny’ was mentioned in a question posed to him as it will be tenfold at United. Cunha was blasé about that.",
      "“I really think the pressure of this club is not really pressure,” he opined. “It’s between a privilege, because this is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and like I say, when Ruben comes to me and shows all the pressure that I have to put the club in the perfect times again, I feel like it's a challenge that I want to do for my career.",
      "“And for me, United is always one of the clubs that need to be there, and for someone that can be part of the process is something that, like I say, is a big privilege.",
      "“So I don't think about being perfect at the start, honestly, I think to be myself and help the team. But of course, the first time I start to feel I'm part of the group, we start to do everything very well, and then think about doing everything well.",
      "“So I'm very comfortable to be here, I'm very comfortable with the press right now, and honestly, I hope everything can be better, too. Don’t think about the wrong time.”",
      "Amorim made a beeline for Cunha after Wolves won at Old Trafford in April and the Brazilian admitted he had a bearing on his decision to choose United.",
      "“He is a big part of this kind of decision,” Cunha clarified. “Like I said, United was always a major club and when you can make a dream come true, it's an easy decision to make.",
      "“But of course, like everything inside of the club, he was one of the big parts. He talked to me always and showed how important I am to him. And of course, I fell very in love with that. And it's easy to make a choice after everything.“",
      "Cunha tallied 15 Premier League goals last season - almost twice as many as United’s leading league scorer, Fernandes. The only United signing who tallied that amount in his first full campaign this decade was Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Cunha did not sound like the task was onerous. “Of course, like a striker, everyone thinks about scoring goals, something that is the most important thing in football, to score goals, help the team. And I completely understand the situation, but I think every single detail that I can do to help the team, for me, will be important, like scoring goals.",
      "“You know, of course, like I say, scoring goals is the most important part of the game. I come here, I understand everything. It can be part of my game to come in: goals, assists, and then everything around this.",
      "“I feel comfortable. I hope I can do my best. And of course, I hope in the end we can talk about many goals and I score.”",
      "Leading from the front of the goals tally would be an achievement.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, July 26.",
      "The transfer market has exploded into life this week after the shock news that Alexander Isak has informed Newcastle that he wishes to seek opportunities elsewhere. Unfortunately for United fans, the Reds are not currently planning to bid for the Swede with his potential £150m price tag being too high for the club.",
      "A more likely option is Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins but similarly to Newcastle, his club are likely to dig their heels in to keep their man. Another player who has emerged as an alternative for the frontline is Metz's teenager Idrissa Gueye.",
      "Not to be confused with the Everton midfielder, the 18-year-old broke into the second-tier French club's first team last season and scored five goals in 17 appearances. Meanwhile, Benjamin Sesko continues to be linked with teams including United and Newcastle, should Isak leave them.",
      "Ultimately, the sale of Alejandro Garnacho and some of his teammates could determine the money on offer for United to spend. However, Ruben Amorim has warned the winger, and his teammates, may not necessarily leave this summer.",
      "Keep across all the latest United news as we get it in our live blog below:",
      "Ayden Heaven is intent on becoming a goalscoring centre back for Man United.",

      "\"It negates the risk to a certain extent, you’re not worried about adaptation to the league and culture [about signing a Premier League proven player],\" he said.",
      "“We need someone with experience who the other centre-forwards can look at and go ‘that’s a bit of me’, without any doubts, Ollie Watkins says that. Premier League proven, played in the Champions League last year, and has done his thing consistently for a while, plays for England as well. He ticks all the boxes.",
      "\"Looking at it now, I would go Watkins if you can get him at the right price. He’s 29, no sell on value he would be purely to have an impact over the next two or three years.\"",
      "Barcelona star Lewandowski has offered his verdict on Marcus Rashford's move to the Nou Camp from Man United.",

      "\"I just felt that it was the right club for me,\" the former Sporting CP star said in an interview with Arsenal. \"What I heard from Mikel and Andrea when I was speaking with them, and just what I’ve seen in the past years, how they’ve been playing football.",
      "\"When I was playing against Arsenal last season, I could really feel it was a very strong team and very difficult to play against. That made me choose Arsenal, and of course all the history the club has and the massive fanbase.",
      "\"It’s been amazing to see all the support that they have already given me before I even arrived. That’s what it’s all about. It’s going to be very nice to see them in the stadiums as well.\"",

      "The Reds are in America for three fixtures against Premier League opposition as they prepare for the new season. United take on West Ham in their first fixture before matches against Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Amorim has shown he is prepared to offer the next generation an opportunity with Chido Obi, Ayden Heaven and Tyler Fredricson given first team minutes last term. That trio are in America but there are seven others coming through the ranks who will be hoping they can break through.",
      "We have taken a look at who those may be, here.",
      "According to Tuttosport, the message conveyed by Ruben Amorim has raised concerns at Juventus, as it indicates that Man United may not be as eager to offload Jadon Sancho as previously believed.",
      "Amorim said: \"Some players have to move to make space in the team, others want a new challenge. We are giving them time to think, and if they reach a point where they have to join the team, they will.",
      "\"Omar [Berrada] and Jason [Wilcox] have a number for these players; if that isn’t reached, they will be United players. I am ready to receive the players. I have more options, and if they have to fight each other to play that is perfect.\"",
      "The Turin-based outlet reports that Juventus' £15million offer is just a few million shy of United’s valuation.",
      "Meanwhile, the 25-year-old winger has reportedly agreed to take a substantial pay cut - from €10m to €6m — to help push the move through.",
      "According to Rob Dawson of ESPN, Bayern Munich have identified Alejandro Garnacho in their search for a winger, with the Bundesliga champions making an approach to explore what it would take to secure a deal.",
      "In addition to Chelsea and Bayern Munich, Dawson also reports that Aston Villa are interested in the Argentine - a move Garnacho might favour, given his desire to stay in England and play in what he views as the toughest league in the world.",

      "Currently, Antony is in Manchester while his United teammates are touring the US. It is unlikely that the Brazilian will link up with the Reds while they are on their pre-season tour.",
      "Ruben Amorim insisted that there was a possibility that Antony, and the rest of the wantaway players, could still be Reds at the end of the summer transfer window. \"If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players,\" the Portuguese head coach explained.",

      "Matheus Cunha was charged with misconduct by the FA last season following an altercation with an Ipswich staff member.",
      "Now representing Manchester United, Cunha has told MUTV how he hopes to control himself better.",
      "\"Yeah, this [passion] is sometimes something that is very good but sometimes not the best way to do, but I am very emotional. I agree that I show my emotions in the game, I give 100% or even more because I love this game.",
      "\"Like I say, it is a privilege to play for this team, I have had a beautiful career but when you start here, I hope I can control it a little bit more.\"",
      "Manchester United supporters could get their first opportunity in the early hours of Sunday morning to see Bryan Mbeumo in his new surroundings.",
      "The trip to the US kicks off with a clash against West Ham, at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, which should provide another opportunity for Ruben Amorim to assess the players at his disposal. After the Premier League Series, there will be a desire for United to look closer to a squad ready to challenge at the right end of the table, yet again.",
      "So with that in mind prior to the start of their US fixtures, MEN Sport has taken a look at what we would do if we were in Amorim's hot-seat heading into the new campaign and the remainder of the summer transfer window.",
      "Two Saudi Arabian sides have been linked with an interest in Antony who is set to depart Manchester United this summer.",
      "Amongst the transfer rumours, Antony's agent, Junior Pedroso, has spoken on his clients future.",

      "Robert Lewandowski has given his true feelings on Marcus Rashford's arrival at Barcelona.",
      "\"Marcus has great talent,\" he told Catalunya Radio. \"He showed it a few years ago, when he played against us in the Europa League.",
      "“He is also a player who can play in several positions. There will be many games during the season, so it will be very good for us to have players who can help us. Rashford’s arrival is good for the team.”",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta has admitted that his head coach, Hansi Flick, demanded more fire-power this summer which ultimately led to Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford joining on loan.",
      "For Rashford, the move was one which he was always aiming for after spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa. Upon his return to Manchester, the 62-cap England player informed the club that he wished to leave and it was clear his priority was Barcelona.",
      "Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams was the first target for the Catalan club and Liverpool's Luis Diaz was also considered. But after Williams signed a new deal in the Basque Country and the Diaz deal was clearly too expensive, Rashford's move to Catalonia became plausible and then a reality...",
      "Ruben Amorim took it upon himself to debunk 'lies' regarding Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha's transfer to Manchester United.",
      "He told ManUtd.com: “Cunha and Bryan, they had different solutions [offers]. They had Champions League offers. And they wanted to come here. People that say that they come here because of the money… that is a lie. That I know for sure. So, I’m really happy with that.",
      "“That is the key point. They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it’s an important time in our club.”",
      "Manchester United are 'making no progress' in their pursuit of Emi Martinez according to Ole.",
      "The club aren't sure whether to pay Aston Villa's €40m price-tag, especially when Andre Onana hasn't been sold this summer.",
      "The Argentine goalkeeper has travelled with Villa on their pre-season tour in America and should feature in their friendly tonight against Frankfurt.",
      "\"The gaps between our sectors was sometimes too big,\" Ruben Amorim told the Manchester United press conference following the goalless draw with Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "\"We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and bring the ball. But we created chances.\"",
      "This was probably the clearest message we have seen from the United boss so far this summer as to where he wants to actually strengthen next. Last season, United looked overrun in the middle of the park, particularly just in front of their defence, and at present they have not done anything to change that...",
      "Juventus are edging closer to securing a deal this summer for Jadon Sancho.",
      "The 25-year-old returned to Old Trafford after Chelsea rejected the chance to sign him permanently following a loan spell. The negotiations with Juventus are active, but Italian outlet Corriere dello sport claim it is not easy.",
      "They wrote: “One intermediary hired by Manchester United has emerged in the city: Matthew Conning, a transfer operator who, along with the player’s large team, is handling one of the most complex transfers of the summer...",
      "\"...while waiting for a breakthrough, Juventus ironed out the details with Sancho, reaching an agreement with the winger on a contract worth €6 million net plus bonuses until 2030.\"",
      "Speaking to Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona president Joan Laporta has opened up on the Rashford deal and his club's plans for the remainder of the window.",
      "Our main interest and obsession was to keep the team from last season, because it was historic. We wanted to maintain that team spirit with the players we had, which is why many offers that have been received have not even been considered. The coach asked us for more firepower up front. With Marcus Rashford, we have it. And Deco’s vision of what could happen with Marc-André has been fundamental to strengthen the goal very well. Joan Garcia is doing some spectacular training sessions and will please Barca.",
      "Amid these links to Donnarumma and even Emi Martinez, MEN Sport understands there is not currently a budget set aside to fund a new No.1 for the Reds.",
      "On top of this, Andre Onana both wants to stay in Manchester and has received reassurances that he won't be sold or replaced.",
      "If a goalkeeper were to arrive, the most likely departure there would perhaps be Bayindir.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United are lining up an audacious offer for Champions League winner Gianluigi Donnarumma during the summer transfer window.",
      "It is claimed that PSG's talks with Donnarumma have stalled in recent months and the French club have come to the realisation that they will need to sell.",
      "The Italian has just one year remaining on his contract in France and it is claimed United are eyeing up the possibility to snag a bargain.",
      "However, his salary could be an issue with Donnarumma understood to be earning £6.1m per year plus a £2.6m bonus. United would more than likely need to better that offer to bring him to Old Trafford.",
      "When discussing his decision to remain in the Red Bull project back in 2024, Sesko explained it was a tactical decision which could hinder United this summer.",
      "The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations [about which club I would sign for]. But I think it was better to come [to RB Leipzig]. It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.",
      "Leipzig currently favour a two up top system in the Bundesliga while Amorim is hoping his centre-forward can lead the line.",
      "While the resistance to change is understandable when a younger player, United would have to hope that stance has changed now he is a little older.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand has cast doubt that Benjamin Sesko is the right player for the Reds at this current juncture in the summer transfer window.",
      "I think you've got to look at the here and now at the moment with Man United. That's what I said about a No.9. I'm not really doubting [Sesko] as a player. I'm saying Man United need experience at the top of the pitch. They've got Hojlund, they've got Zirkzee, they've got Chido. Young, inexperienced players. They need someone to look at and go: 'That's how you play as a No.9. That's how you do it.'",
      "After being linked with a move for Sesko at the start of the week, it looks as though Newcastle have jumped into the race.",
      "According to The Times, Eddie Howe's men are keen on the RB Leipzig striker but insist they will not sell Isak.",
      "It is currently unclear if the Magpies will match the £70m price tag that the Bundesliga club have set.",
      "Speaking to the media ahead of their first fixture in the States against West Ham, Amorim has insisted that he would be happy to start the season now without another centre-forward arriving at the club.",
      "They can play as a striker [Cunha and Mbeumo]. We have Josh, we have Rasmus, so our focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the positions are there for them. They have to work. They have other players that are fighting for that position. But again, I'm really pleased. Because they proved that the goals that they have, they are really humble. That is really important.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "Currently, MEN Sport understands that United have not made direct contact with Watkins over a move to Old Trafford.",
      "At the moment, Villa are insistent their forward is not for sale this summer.",
      "However, Newcastle had been giving the same message surrounding Isak but this week has proven that the transfer market can change things in an instant.",
      "The arrival of Gueye would be a trademark move for Ineos considering there passion for signing younger players with high potential.",
      "While he would probably be used in the first team during training sessions and as a fringe player in the squad, similar to Chido Obi, United would need to sign another forward.",
      "This is where talk of this man begins...",
      "According to L'Equipe, United are interested in the signing of Metz striker Idrissa Gueye.",
      "It is understood that the 18-year-old has caught the eye of some of the world's biggest clubs thanks to his appearances for the French team last season.",
      "Despite his modest goalscoring record of five goals in 17 appearances, it is believed that a fee around the £13m mark could be paid for the up and coming forward.",

      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be keeping you across all the latest United news throughout the morning.",

      "Mbeumo is expected to line up alongside the Brazilian in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 set-up but the Cameroon international could also be deployed on the right hand side as an attacking wing back, while he can operate as a central striker.",
      "Logic dictates that a player who scored 20 Premier League goals last season would play in an attacking role but where he is handed his first minutes will give a clear indication of Amorim's long-term plan for the 25-year-old. That number 10 role looks the favourite.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is likely to be deployed in one of the central midfield roles but who partners the skipper is up for debate. It's a position that in an ideal world United would look to strengthen but with a new forward higher up the pecking order, Amorim will likely have the same options as he had last term.",

      "However, it quickly emerged that Gyokeres was leaning towards a move to Arsenal, effectively ruling United out of the race. There were some reports last week that United had attempted a late hijack of the deal, but as reported by MEN Sport, United had no intention of making any move for the forward who was destined for a move to the Emirates Stadium.",

      "Importantly, Garnacho is attainable after a breakdown in communications with Ruben Amorim at the end of last season. It would also take a sum in the region of £50million to sign him.",
      "Liverpool have knocked back a bid of £58m for Diaz from the German champions and have allocated cash to strengthen their left wing. Garnacho is not as proven as Diaz, but it wouldn't be a surprise to see Bayern explore a deal for him, provided Liverpool stand firm with their stance on Diaz.",

But Garnacho was reintegrated into the squad, demonstrating a willingness to put things right, before making further headlines with his social media activity.",

      "Garnacho reacted poorly to not starting in the Europa League final and his brother wrote on social media: \"Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe, hahahaha.\"",
      "The Garnachos have become an unhelpful distraction and Amorim has drawn a line in the sand, telling the youngster to find a new club this summer, which is the right thing to do.",
      "Garnacho is leaving United because of his own actions. Amorim has handled Garnacho correctly and cannot be undermined. That's why there will be no regrets even if Garnahco becomes a star at his next club.",
      "Last weekend, the MEN mingled among fans in Sweden and the general consensus in a supporters' club was that Garnacho must leave. Local fans in Manchester will agree with their assessment.",
      "United have already got an upgrade on Garnacho, having signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m, and the Brazilian is expected to provide a better cutting edge in front of goal.",

      "Arsenal, who are hoping to add Viktor Gyokeres to their ranks in the coming days, have spent the sixth most (£137m) ahead of North London rivals Tottenham (£122m). Premier League new boys Sunderland, Spanish side Atletico Madrid, and Saudi Arabia club Al-Qadsiah round out the top 10.",
      "The so-called top six in the Premier League have spent around £1billion since the start of the transfer window.",
      "That total rises to £1.63bn when the rest of the top flight is taken into account with newly-promoted trio Sunderland, Burnley and Leeds United among the league's top 10 biggest spenders.",
      "Of the 10 most expensive transfers this summer, eight are Premier League purchases with the outliers being Mateo Retegui's £56.3m switch from Atalanta to Al Qadsiah and Dean Huijsen's £50m switch to Real Madrid from Bournemouth.",
      "The transfer window remains open until September 1, when it shuts at the earlier time of 7pm.",

      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta has admitted there were two other players under consideration while the club worked on a deal for Marcus Rashford.",
      "The Catalan club will cover Rashford's wages during his loan at Camp Nou, which is estimated to save Manchester United around £12million, and have the option to sign him permanently.",
      "Barcelona were linked with Liverpool forward Luis Diaz before reaching an agreement to sign Rashford. Liverpool have reiterated that the Colombia international is not for sale this summer, which Laporta has revealed contributed to finding an agreement with United to sign Rashford on loan.",
      "The La Liga champions also considered signing Nico Williams from Athletic Bilbao. The winger was offered to Barcelona, but eventually signed a new long-term contract with the Basque club.",
      "Laporta spoke to Mundo Deportivo to give insight on the Rashford deal and the 63-year-old admitted Rashford was an option alongside Diaz and Williams this summer.",
      "\"It was a more complex matter than the goalkeeper situation due to the variety of opinions coming from all sides,\" Barcelona's president said. \"There were several options, and I’m very pleased that we ultimately secured the one I liked the most.",
      "\"It’s true I also liked Luis Diaz, a very complete player, but given Liverpool’s rigid stance, it was difficult. Still, I’m grateful that the player showed interest in joining us at all times.",
      "\"Then there was the case of Nico Williams. Seeing that the Diaz option was complicated and while we were in talks with Rashford, Nico’s agent came forward offering a deal.",
      "\"Deco brought it to my attention. At first, I preferred to focus on the other two options, but in these cases, I always trust the sporting director’s judgment. Deco suggested we at least hear them out because Nico is an interesting player who can hold the width on the wing.",
      "\"Negotiations were held, but the gap between what was initially presented and the final terms was significant — in terms of payment timelines, agent fees, and other variables — to the point where the deal no longer looked feasible.",
      "\"Deco set a 48-hour deadline, and if our conditions weren’t accepted, the deal would be off. In the end, it didn’t happen. Meanwhile, we kept working on the other two deals, and Rashford’s situation began to take shape.\"",
      "Laporta was asked what he liked about Rashford and responded: \"We’re very pleased because we’re bringing in a player of outstanding quality, at a great age to join Barca, and with exceptional motivation.",
      "\"I’ve personally seen just how excited he is about coming here. One of his greatest virtues is his sincerity. His dream was to play his entire career at Manchester United.",
      "\"He joined them at age seven and built a meaningful life there. He wanted to be a 'one-club man.' It’s heartwarming when a player says that so openly. But when something happened in his life that he didn’t expect, he looked toward the team he had always admired - Barca.",
      "\"He had faced us before and already had Barca on his radar. He was loaned to Aston Villa to showcase that he’s the best player of his generation, the best in England, and he now says his greatest motivation is to win the Champions League with Barca and the World Cup with England.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim sits at the front of the Manchester United team bus. This is a season that demands a start on the front foot.",
      "The opening fixture against Arsenal at Old Trafford will evoke memories for many United fans of the sun-kissed 4-1 thrashing of the champions in 1989. United invested strikingly that summer, too, yet lost three of their first five matches.",
      "After Arsenal visit, United are at Manchester City and host Chelsea in September. David Moyes complained that the fixture computer had pitted United against Chelsea, Liverpool and City in his first five fixtures. That defeatist attitude was one of innumerable reasons why he was always ill-suited to United.",
      "Amorim’s first full season begins similarly (Liverpool are also lurking around the corner in October). United were actually unbeaten in three games with City last season, two of their best performances were against Arsenal and they narrowly lost at Chelsea five days before the Europa League final.",
      "United will not look markedly different when they line-up against Arsenal. The best-case scenario is there will be three new starting signings: Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and a new striker. The sight of his former Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres with a cannon stitched to his shirt rather than a devil may cause Amorim to drop to his haunches sooner than usual.",
      "Gyokeres was never a realistic target. The top-tier strikers on the market want to stay or play in the Champions League. United do not have the clout or wherewithal to move for Gyokeres or Alexander Isak. There was concrete competition for Cunha and Mbeumo but United were never going to be a tough sell for players at Wolves and Brentford.",
      "Every Premier League club last season possessed a superior striker to United, bar sorry Southampton. Southampton looked at signing Rasmus Hojlund a year before he joined United.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s director of football, has overseen a shift to focus on Premier League recruits after United bought only one senior player from a Premier League club in nearly six years. At the time of writing, Ollie Watkins and Jean-Philippe Mateta are realistic options who would fit the bill up front: two centre forwards in their late 20s whose value is bound to dwindle after this summer.",
      "Unai Emery’s curious handling of Watkins when Marcus Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa piqued the striker. Mateta caused United plenty of grief at Selhurst Park and Old Trafford in two memorable Palace victories.",
      "Watkins has never broken the 20-goal barrier for Villa, though. Mateta hasn’t for Crystal Palace, either. It would be a stretch to bill either as 'proven'. They would still have a worthy support cast of Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad, Bruno Fernandes et al. and represent an upgrade on Hojlund.",
      "After successive seasons where they recorded a minus goal difference and their worst campaign in 51 years, United need a frontman they can get behind. That extends to the players, too. Plenty have always been unconvinced by Hojlund, a signing destined to fail through his exorbitant £72million fee and ties to Erik ten Hag’s agent, Kees Vos.",
      "Between the sticks is a goalkeeper lacking confidence from supporters. Andre Onana is set to continue as No.1 by default as United have focused their investments at the top end of the pitch.",
      "Onana is at least shielded by a quintet of centre backs with a promising blend of youth and experience. United signed a centre half in seven of the past nine summer transfer windows. They will not be acquiring one this summer and what has been one of their weakest areas of the squad in recent years is now one of their strongest.",
      "Leny Yoro has found his feet, Harry Maguire has become a captain without the armband, Ayden Heaven has been a revelation and Matthijs de Ligt looked to have got to grips with the Premier League before injury. Lisandro Martinez - when he has recovered from injury - could be more influential in Amorim’s back three than he was for Ten Hag.",
      "There is a potential midfield minefield, though. Bruno Fernandes seems likely to be permanently relocated to a deeper role and you could play him in goal and he would still be the most influential player in the United side.",
      "But beyond him there are glaring issues. Manuel Ugarte’s form towards the end of last season was so poor he was benched for the Europa League final. Casemiro’s good form was reserved almost exclusively for the Europa League, so he could become redundant with no European football. Kobbie Mainoo has been primarily recognised by Ruben Amorim as a playmaker and Toby Collyer has started three games in his career against teams from League 1, Scotland and Romania.",
      "United would like to strengthen in midfield but the issue is the unshiftable Casemiro. Sources say four different figures were given mandates to sell him yet he seems certain to see out the final year of his United contract.",
      "Casemiro is valued at £15million and, realistically, no club is forking out that fee for a 33-year-old who will be free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement in January. Casemiro has regained his place in the Brazil squad after an 18-month exile but it helps matters that his former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti is in charge.",
      "United have valuable assets in midfield in Fernandes and Mainoo but the former rejected the opportunity to move to Saudi Arabia. The concern would be that United could cash in on Mainoo if a late bid comes in and frees up funds.",
      "There would be parallels with Scott McTominay, only this time last year Fulham’s interest in McTominay and United’s interest in Ugarte were well documented. McTominay was a sellable asset and always seemed likely to leave.",
      "Mainoo’s future is uncertain but there has not been a lot of noise around him so far this summer. His contract has a maximum expiry date of 2028 but he rejected United’s initial proposal of a renewal at the start of the year and it has been quiet on that front.",
      "Realistically, United could get through a lighter season with the aforementioned midfield quintet. A new midfielder should be at the top of the shopping list in 12 months.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon are imperfect options on the left wing but there are senior auxiliary alternatives. Mbeumo has to operate on the right-hand side, a problem position that United have struggled to solve for upwards of a decade. Mbeumo represents the best of both worlds in that he is adept at attacking and defending but United have to play to his strengths after a 20-goal season.",
      "Senior figures at United are targeting a top six finish. That is not pie-in-the-sky stuff when recent history shows clubs have shot up the table without European commitments. Newcastle United nabbed Champions League qualification in 2023 and 2025. Liverpool nearly won the league in 2014. Leicester City did win the league in 2016. So did Chelsea a year later.",
      "The exception is United. The last time they were out of Europe, they scraped fourth under Louis van Gaal in 2014-15, winning one of their final six fixtures. Van Gaal’s tenure got off to a startling start with defeat to Swansea City.",
      "He was never one to play on the front foot, though.",

      "The players seemed in high spirits during their flight and they trained for the first time since touching down on American soil on Wednesday at the Endeavour Health Performance Centre.",
      "So, here are four things we spotted from the first USA training session...",
      "The signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for £65m plus £6m in add-ons was announced on Monday evening, just in time for Mbeumo to join his new teammates on the USA plane.",
      "Club figures admitted they were delighted to have their top targets, Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, signed in time to travel on the pre-season tour, meaning Ruben Amorim has the chance to work closely with his new additions and convey his expectations for the season during an intense schedule.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are tremendous signings and should provide creativity and goals to the front line. United are in the market for a striker, which feels like the missing piece of the jigsaw for a formidable attack.",
      "United's new signings were pictured smiling during the session and it will be exciting to see them play alongside each other in the States, which could happen for the first time against West Ham.",
      "United often play small-sided games during training at Carrington and the photo of the 'winning team' is shared on social media. That looked to be the case again on Wednesday, as an eight-man team spearheaded by Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro posed for a celebratory picture.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Tom Heaton were the other senior players involved in the team, with youngsters Tyler Fredricson, Reece Munro, Bendito Mantato and Ethan Williams also playing a role.",
      "The pre-season tours are a brilliant chance for players to bond, given the time they are spending in close proximity to each other over a fortnight, and those benefits will be reaped later in the campaign.",
      "Leny Yoro grew in confidence each month last season. He was excellent after being moved to the left side of the three-man defence and could reach another level in his second year.",
      "Yoro has become comfortable in Manchester and spoke in the mixed zone after the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds. The Frenchman was also pictured conducting an in-house interview with MUTV after the training session and it's encouraging to see him speaking to the media more regularly.",
      "The 19-year-old has the qualities to become a leader in the United dressing room.",
      "Williams joined Cheltenham Town on a six-month loan in the January window and he was one of the most successful loans at United, making 17 appearances for the League Two side.",
      "The 19-year-old can play at left-wing back, or in one of the No.10 roles, and will be hopeful of making a strong impression during the USA tour, as he was picked ahead of a handful of other promising players.",

      "Manchester United are yet to add a new striker to their squad, despite links to Benjamin Sesko, with the new Premier League season set to kick off at home against Arsenal on August 17.\"",
      "A host of players have been linked with a move to Old Trafford, including Viktor Gyokeres, Ollie Watkins, and Nicolas Jackson. On Thursday, talkSPORT reported that United had made fresh contact with Aston Villa regarding Watkins, but the 29-year-old is believed to be valued at around £60million.",
      "But the club hierarchy are also keeping a close eye on Sesko’s situation after Arsenal abandoned negotiations for his services. The Gunners have instead chosen to pursue a deal for Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "Here, MEN Sport takes a look at the latest developments surrounding Sesko.",
      "According to journalist Christian Falk, Leipzig could consider a sale if an offer around the €70million (£60.6m) mark. Speaking to Caught Offside, Falk revealed United are closely monitoring the situation.",
      "\"When one door closes, another opens! Arsenal have withdrawn their pursuit of Benjamin Sesko, which creates an opportunity for Manchester United,\" he said. \"The Red Devils weren’t in the front row for the club and player. However, there’s a key executive involved in all of this – Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting.",
      "\"He’s previously worked for RB Leipzig, and he’s now supporting the potential deal. Vivell’s also been watching the situation develop since April. He was at the match between Leipzig and Wolfsburg to scout Sesko again. The striker (22) is still very, very young. He can leave with a good offer; I think Leipzig are willing to talk if they receive a fee closer to €70m [£60.6m].\"",
      "United could now be facing tough competition for Sesko, following the news that Alexander Isak is considering a move away from Newcastle United. On Thursday Fabrizio Romano reported that Newcastle were alert to Sesko's situation at Leipzig and have been informed about what it would take to sign him.",
      "Meanwhile, The Athletic's David Ornstein added that the Magpies are 'exploring a move' for the 22-year-old as a potential replacement for Isak. Eddie Howe's side have had a long-standing interest in the Slovenia star.",
      "However, it's said that a deal is challenging from a financial perspective.",
      "However, United hold a secret weapon over Newcastle. Recruitment director Christopher Vivell is now based at Old Trafford, but he previously worked with Sesko during his time at Leipzig.",
      "Vivell not only understands the strengths and weaknesses of pursuing a deal for Sesko, but he also has existing relationships with the player and his representatives - connections that could help facilitate a smoother negotiation process if United decide to make a move.",
      "\"Our striker Sesko, I was really impressed, to be honest,\" Ridle Baku, who joined Leipzig from Wolfsburg in January told FourFourTwo in March. \"The first training session, I knew already that he's a good player. But I'm speaking about potential, probably he's not [currently at] potential he could be, but right now, what I saw already, very impressive. He has everything to be a world-class player.\"",
      "\"He's still young, he still needs to learn, not the technical things about being a striker but maybe more the finesse side. He has everything, strength shooting, technique, everything. I like working with him and I'm trying to get him there – he'll go on and score a lot of goals for us and some point go to the club he'll love to play for.\""

      "Not only does he fit the youthful profile United are prioritising, but with Arsenal no longer in the race the path to securing him is less congested - making it a smarter, more strategic move for the club.",

      "MEN Sport says: The 18-year-old perfectly embodies the type of young, high-potential talent United are targeting as part of their long-term strategy.

Got the here we go treatment from Romano before Forest pulled the plug and threatened legal action against Spurs for knowing the player’s release clause, and now according to Ornstein is all set for a new deal at his current club. A deal that presumably includes an even more super secret release clause that specifically states Spurs can’t activate it.",
      "",
      "18) Malick Fofana – Lyon to Everton\nFabrizio says ‘advanced talks’ but Everton making a high-profile attempt to sign a Liverpool target just feels like something destined to end in pain just because that’s the way of the world.",
      "",
      "17) Luke Shaw – Manchester United to Saudi\nThis hasn’t reached the stage yet of a suitor being named but reports suggest Shaw has seen the writing on the wall for his United career and he’s willing to make the best of it by taking the Saudi coin. Sadly, Ruben Amorim will have taken the view that Shaw’s fitness cannot be relied upon, and he is now well-stocked for left wing-backs. There is no urgency here – it could be one for January.",

      "",
      "16) Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nUnited are ready to get a deal done quickly, apparently, at around £20million for the Spain Under-21 midfielder who has just rejected Valencia’s latest offer of a contract renewal. Reports suggest Guerra is hoping for a better offer from Valencia so this could simply be a case of his representatives using United and the oldest trick in the agents’ book.",
      "",
      "15) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko seemed to be going nowhere while Leipzig were demanding in excess of £75million but in news sure to grind Arsenal’s gears, reports in Germany suggest that demand could have fallen to £59million, which would make the Slovenian much more appealing to United.",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nNo sooner had we reports of renewed interest from United in Watkins did we have the rebuttal from Villa. The England striker is considered by the Villans as ‘not for sale’. Which is what anyone looking to sell for top dollar would say at first. Watkins is valued at £60million by Villa. United would doubtless seek to negotiate down from there but we’re struggling to see where the two clubs find common ground here if this was a deal done in isolation.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £50m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "12) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, reaffirming somewhat that the winger has a higher opinion of himself than most others do. Chelsea and Spurs have been linked but it has always been tentative. The noise has been building around Villa’s interest in Garnacho, but like United’s view on Watkins, they can’t pay the amount requested. With all the accounting sorcery prompted by PSR, we’re sure there’s a workaround here that leaves everyone happy.",
      "",
      "11) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Nothing on Isak, mind…",
      "",
      "",
      "9) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "8) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Sancho’s agent has been in Turin this week to attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "7) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and he is the first on their list should Isak get his wish.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Viktor Gyokeres is in London, which means Arsenal can ramp up their pursuit of the Palace star, which they intend to do…",
      "",
      "5) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way. The latest: the two clubs are ‘in dialogue’, while Diaz was left out of Liverpool’s squad for Saturday’s pre-season friendly defeat to Milan.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "3)🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe didn’t think this done just because Newcastle had told Liverpool that Isak was not for sale. Their stance hasn’t changed – but everything else has after Isak agitated for a move. If only he had done it sooner, Liverpool might not have spent the money on Hugo Ekitike, who might have filled the Isak void at Newcastle. Instead, the expectation is the pair will team up at Anfield. It won’t happen quick – Newcastle are determined to dig in and their worst-case scenario has to involve a British transfer record fee – but it’ll probably happen.",
      "",
      "2)🔼 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThe Netherlands defender’s agent is quite open about talks that have taken place with Chelsea, who have also been in touch with Ajax. Hato has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Real Madrid, but he’s apparently already ‘said yes’ to Chelsea, who seem intent on getting to the teenager first. Hato was left out of the Ajax squad for Thursday night’s friendly against Celtic in Como.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nPoor Newcastle. They are having a shocker, and City haven’t helped. Newcastle took forever to finally agree a deal with Burnley for the England goalkeeper, only for City to exercise their option to match any offer. Trafford will re-join City for £27million to compete with Ederson. Who, no doubt, is delighted at the prospect.",

      "",
      "10) Juventus – £91.84m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",

      "9) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "8) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",

      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Garnacho has fallen in the pecking order at Man Utd as he has butted heads with Ruben Amorim over his poor form and attitude during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The winger has also been impacted by the implementation of Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation as he is not suited to the No.10 position in this system.",
      "This situation boiled over following United‘s loss to Spurs in the Europa League final as Garnacho publicly hit out at the club after he only made a brief cameo off the bench in the 1-0 defeat.",
      "Amorim subsequently informed Garnacho that he needs to ‘find a new club’ this summer, but he is yet to secure a move elsewhere.",
      "READ: Top 10 Alexander Isak clones only leave three options for Newcastle, Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho are also part of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ as Old Trafford chiefs look to raise funds for signings, but the club’s desperation is limiting their negotiating power.",
      "Despite this, Amorim claimed on Friday that they will not be held to ransom by interested clubs as they remain intent on sticking to their demands for unwanted talents.",
      "Amorim explained: “Some players have to move to make space in the team, others want a new challenge.",
      "“We are giving them time to think and if they reach a point where they have to join the team they will.",
      "“Omar [Berrada] and Jason [Wilcox] have a number for these players, if that isn’t reached they will be United players.",
      "“I am ready to receive the players. I have more options and if they have to fight each other to play that is perfect.”",
      "While this indicates that the Red Devils are willing to be patient with the Garnacho saga, a report from GiveMeSport claims they have set a deadline for his exit as they ‘want to sell him in days’.",
      "Though an ‘added layer of difficulty’ has been added to a proposed deal, as £60m-rated Garnacho’s preference is to remain in the Premier League.",
      "This is while there have been fresh ‘private talks’ over Garnacho. The report adds:",
      "‘Serie A champions Napoli had shown a strong interest in January and also before the summer window officially opened, but because of Garnacho’s preference to remain in the Premier League, they have looked at alternative options instead.",
      "‘GMS sources understand that Garnacho’s exit has now been made a priority by club chiefs, and private talks in recent days have seen them push to get the player to make a decision on his next club before the end of the month.’",
      "Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive the players” that Manchester United are actively trying to offload – if they don’t secure moves this summer.",

      "It has been widely reported that Barcelona has been his preferred destination since he announced at the end of December that he intended to leave Man Utd.",
      "It was hoped that Ruben Amorim’s appointment would inspire Rashford‘s return to form at Man Utd, but they butted heads en route to him leaving in January.",
      "Rashford eventually had to settle on a loan move to Aston Villa as his poor form/attitude and huge salary provided stumbling blocks for other clubs in the winter window, but he returned to form under Unai Emery.",
      "The England international contributed four goals and six assists for Aston Villa to spark more widespread interest this summer and he’s got a move to Barcelona after they missed out on Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.",
      "READ: Top 10 Alexander Isak clones only leave three options for Newcastle, Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "Barcelona already have two of the best wingers in the world as Lamine Yamal and Raphinha are credible 2025 Ballon d’Or contenders, but Rashford’s versatility will be useful as he will provide quality cover in various positions.",
      "Still, a report in Spain claims Raphinha, Ferran Torres, and Robert Lewandowski have been ‘genuinely upset by Joan Laporta and Deco’s decision to sign him’.",
      "This is while fellow summer signing Roony Bardghji has been ‘affected’ as he faces having limited opportunities in his debut campaign.",
      "Barcelona are also known to have financial difficulties and Rashford’s move could be set to ‘trigger’ three exits in ‘inevitable consequences’, with a ‘loan exit’ for Bardghji ‘not ruled out’.",
      "This is while other players are ‘already completely sentenced and have been forced to pack their bags’. This is the case with Pau Víctor and Jan Virgili.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Victor is already negotiating to leave Camp Nou as soon as possible. He won’t be travelling on the Asian tour, and his future was set to be with Valencia, but in the last few hours, everything has taken a radical turn, and he’s most likely moving to Portugal. More specifically, to Sporting Braga, who are willing to pay around €12 million for his signing.",
      "‘And Virgili soon received the first blow, after Flick decided to drop him after the first training sessions and didn’t call him up for the trip to Asia. It seems that RCD Mallorca will be the team that ends up recruiting the winger born in 2006 , who could follow Pablo Torre’s example.’",
      "Marcus Rashford is said to be a “very lucky boy” to leave Manchester United for Barcelona as a move to the Championship club would be more “logical”.",
      "Lamine Yamal reportedly feels he has been ‘deceived’ by Barcelona over the signing of Marcus Rashford, and is angry that he was not ‘involved’ in the transfer decision, like Lionel ...",
      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Man Utd.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford should’ve departed Manchester United a hero. Instead, his exit prompts barely a shrug as he gambles on Barca levers…",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports."

      "Either Newcastle United will be targeting a player similar to Alexander Isak if he leaves for Liverpool, or the Reds might be looking for another alternative to the Swede even after signing Hugo Ekitike, especially when they realise he is the worst finisher in Europe.",
      "Newcastle have been linked with Benjamin Sesko but FBRef’s statistical models claim these are the closest 10 players to Isak across Europe’s big five leagues.",
      "We take a look and wonder whether Liverpool or Newcastle might be interested, or maybe even Manchester United; they need a striker more than anybody.",
      "",
      "10) Kylian Mbappe (Real Madrid)\nWe start with a player obviously very attainable. A ridiculous player with ridiculous statistics. Didn’t help Real Madrid win any trophies last season though, did he?In all seriousness, Liverpool really did come relatively close to signing the Frenchman, who apparently agreed to join the Reds three years ago for £169m. But PSG wanted a world-record fee, just two years before losing him for nowt.",
      "And now Liverpool are briefing the media that they think they have signed a player with Mbappe-like potential in Ekitike. Even better than the real thing?",
      "",
      "9) Vinicius Jnr (Real Madrid)\nThis is why Real Madrid are not in the market for Isak; they already have two pretty good clones. And with the Brazilian’s price being in the £300m-plus bracket, the only suitors are likely to come from the Middle East. Remember when Vinicius being a target for Manchester United was briefly A Thing? Good times.",
      "",
      "8) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nWe took the pee out of Liverpool’s attempts to brush over the fact that the Frenchman has a poor goalscoring record but he was probably the very closest they could sign to Isak in terms of style, which will be handy if they don’t manage to sign the original too…",
      "",
      "7) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nNow this one really does make sense for Newcastle. He’s likely to be pushed down the Chelsea pecking order by Joao Pedro and Liam Delap and Manchester United have been strongly linked. But Newcastle can offer a) Champions League football and b) a style that suits Jackson rather more than the Pep-ball Lite at Stamford Bridge. All Chelsea need to do is stop pretending he is worth £80m and double their money at around £65m instead.",
      "",
      "6) Mateo Retegui (Al-Qadsiah)\nThe Italian striker has already taken the filthy lucre (over £50m over three years, according to reports) to leave Atalanta for Saudi Arabia, so it will be a hot year at least before he is looking for a transfer back to Europe.",
      "",
      "5) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City)\nPoor Eintracht Frankfurt. They lost Marmoush to Man City in January after an excellent 15-goal half-season and then lost Ekitike to Liverpool in July after a 15-goal full season. We have a feeling that Marmoush may be brilliant for City in 25/26 after a full Pep pre-season.",
      "But it does mean that we only have Jackson as a viable alternative to Isak so far and things are not about to get any better…",
      "",
      "4) Jonathan Burkardt (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nThe 18-goal Mainz striker is the replacement for Ekitike (or is it Marmoush?) so he’s another Isak-like footballer who is not available to Newcastle United, Liverpool or Manchester United.",
      "",
      "3) Marcus Thuram (Inter Milan)\nNow this is genuinely interesting as the Frenchman was strongly linked with Newcastle United two years ago, while links with Manchester United have been persistent, and even Arsenal have had a sniff.",
      "He scored 14 Serie A goals last season and outscored his xG by 4.1, but the number that might put off potential suitors is his age: He will be 28 next month, making him over two years older than Isak.",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)\nEx-Manchester United footballers will never tire of telling you Manchester United should sign Harry Kane. It ain’t going to happen yet, but we think he will be back.",
      "",
      "1) Georges Mikautadze (Lyon)\nWe predicted a Manchester United move in the wake of his brilliance at Euro 2024 and he has since been linked with the Reds, Tottenham, Nottingham Forest, Newcastle United and Sunderland. He would be the cheapest option on this list by some margin, with Lyon looking for around £25m for the Georgian striker who scored 11 Ligue Un goals last season despite starting just 13 games as he found Alexandre Lacazette a difficult man to shift."

      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",

      "Marcus Rashford is said to be a “very lucky boy” to leave Manchester United for Barcelona as a move to the Championship club would be more “logical”.",
      "Rashford has fallen on his feet as he’s secured a move to La Liga champions Barcelona. He has joined the Spanish giants on loan with an option to buy for around £26m.",
      "The Man Utd outcast is fortunate to get this move as he has been heavily criticised for his poor form and attitude over the past couple of years.",
      "Ruben Amorim could not inspire the England international to return to form at Old Trafford as they butted heads before he joined Aston Villa on loan in January.",
      "Rashford boosted his reputation during his brief stint at Villa as he grabbed six goals and four assists in 17 appearances.",

      "His recent upturn sparked interest from elsewhere and Barcelona eventually decided to take a calculated punt on him after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams.",
      "Former Premier League forward Stan Collymore thinks Barcelona are “getting the best of the deal”, which is “poor” for Man Utd.",
      "“I think this Rashford deal is poor for Man United. For a player at the peak of his career that they’ve nurtured to possibly only get £25m for him if Barcelona buy him next summer, having paid an absolute arm and a leg in wages over the years, isn’t recompense at all,” Collymore told Caught Offside.",
      "“For the player, it’s quite unbelievable. He had a poor last season at Man United, goes to Aston Villa. Cameo appearances that were not particularly great, but by the way that Gary Lineker talks, you’d thought it was Lionel Messi playing for Villa last season.",
      "“For Barcelona, what do they get? They get a player on the cheap whose wages will be nowhere near the £300k mark if they were to buy him permanently next summer.",
      "“But they get the best of the deal, quite simply, because they’re going to get a player that’s motivated to play for them. All that was coming out through the season last season was, Marcus Rashford won’t sign for Aston Villa permanently because he’s waiting for Barcelona.”",
      "Collymore has also explained why a move to a Championship team would make more sense for Rashford at this stage.",
      "“I think the greatest story here is how players can effectively be so poor for a couple of seasons, basically, including the loan at Villa, and still dictate where they want to go to a club that’s playing in the Champions League and arguably among the four or five biggest clubs on the planet. And I find that remarkable,” Collymore continued.",
      "“I think that from a Barcelona perspective, it’s only because they’re still coming out of that negative financial situation that they were in, so that they were doing lots of wheeling and dealing in the last three or four years.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford, make no bones about it, he’s a very, very, very lucky boy, because if football had any logic, he would probably be getting a move to Blackburn, Norwich or another aspirational championship club – certainly not one of the top four or five clubs in the world.”",
      "According to reports, three Barcelona stars are ‘genuinely upset’ at Marcus Rashford’s transfer as he is to ‘trigger’ three summer exits.",
      "Lamine Yamal reportedly feels he has been ‘deceived’ by Barcelona over the signing of Marcus Rashford, and is angry that he was not ‘involved’ in the transfer decision, like Lionel ...",
      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Man Utd.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",

In the club they see him as a natural relief for key positions in the midfield and a piece with a lot of future. United squeezes, but Barça and the player, for now, stand firm.’",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a final decision on whether to offload Rasmus Hojlund this summer amid two key factors.",
      "Hojlund joined Man Utd from Serie A outfit Atalanta during the 2023 summer transfer window in a deal worth around £64m plus add-ons.",
      "The Denmark international was in a difficult situation during his debut campaign in 2023/24 as he spent most of the season as United‘s only fit striker, but he earned plaudits as he scored 16 goals in all competitions.",
      "However, the 22-year-old regressed last season and was heavily criticised for his dire performances, as he struggled to perform the basics. He only scored four Premier League goals in 32 appearances as Joshua Zirkzee outshone him during the run-in.",
      "Hojlund’s disappointing decline has fuelled exit speculation as he has been heavily linked with a return to Serie A in recent months, with Inter Milan and Juventus mooted as possible destinations for the £40m-rated forward.",
      "READ: Premier League Bomb Squad XI includes Manchester United trio and Newcastle’s PSR pawn",
      "It has been suggested that Hojlund’s exit could fund a move for a new striker, as Man Utd do not currently have the financial means to buy before selling pricey assets.",
      "United are currently sixth in our ranking of this summer’s biggest spenders in Europe as they have invested around £130m to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "But they are struggling to recoup funds through player sales as Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan, while Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony remain contracted to Man Utd.",
      "After landing Mbeumo and Cunha, it has been reported that United’s next priority is to sign a striker. However, their limited budget is causing problems after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Now, The Sun reports that the Red Devils have ‘ruled out breaking the bank’ to sign a new No.9 as ‘the club is not in a position to go large unless there are significant exits’.",
      "This is a factor in Hojlund’s favour as ‘the decision not to push the boat out opens the door’ for him ‘to stake his claim during the three-match Premier League Summer Series tournament against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton’.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s verdict on the striker is another reason behind United’s sale decision. The report adds:",
      "‘United chief Ruben Amorim, though, looks set to give the Dane, 22, a final chance to show he can be the Old Trafford spearhead.",
      "‘Amorim believes the arrivals of Cunha and Mbeumo will give United a new attacking dynamism, allowing Hojlund to flourish in front of goal.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have set a deadline to offload Alejandro Garnacho following fresh ‘private talks’ over his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive the players” that Manchester United are actively trying to offload – if they don’t secure moves this summer.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund’s agent is pushing his client towards a return move to Serie A this summer as Man Utd set their price, according to reports.",
      "Lots of Premier League managers will start the 25/26 season under pretty hefty pressure. Here then are their potential successors.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made the ‘fastest move’ as they look to fend off competition from rivals to sign a £45m Premier League star.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘frustrated’ at how this summer transfer window is going for Manchester United after making two ‘priority demands’."

      "Arsenal: Add an elite left-sided attacker\nEasier said than done for Arsenal, who have spent the kind of money needed for Alexander Isak on Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres. The Newcastle striker’s transfer request came at the worst time for the Gunners, while Liverpool might already be feeling some buyer’s remorse after spending big on the versatile Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Madueke gives Mikel Arteta a new wide option, but he’s not a significant upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli on the left. He offers outstanding depth for Bukayo Saka and, considering Liverpool just won the title with Luis Diaz, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota as their left-wingers – after City dominated with Jeremy Doku, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez – it’s a smarter signing than most realise.",
      "Martinelli’s development has stalled, scoring just 14 goals across the last two seasons after netting 15 in 2022/23, and Leandro Trossard is more bench spark than starter. The next big-money addition for the Gunners after Madueke, Gyokeres and Martin Zubimendi should be a top-tier left-sided forward.",
      "Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze – naturally a midfielder – is a possible option, but the dream is Real Madrid winger Rodrygo. He’s available, and selling Martinelli to fund that move would be smart business.",

      "They made two smart January loan signings, Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio, who contributed to 29.3% of their goals from February onwards. Both have returned to their parent clubs, and that output now needs replacing. Only Fulham (£0) and Crystal Palace (£2m) have spent less this summer.",
      "Villa are in their best position in decades, but they risk falling behind as the teams around them strengthen. Clubs that finished above them are pulling away again and those below, like Manchester United, Spurs and Brighton, are closing the gap.",
      "Back in April, we said Emery needed a right-back. That still hasn’t happened. Once that’s sorted, they can get moving on the rest. They’ll need an attacker and a goalkeeper if Emiliano Martinez departs.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Defensive recruits\nIt’s rare to lose four of your back five in one summer, but that’s where Bournemouth find themselves. They’ve already lost 60%, and PSG target Illia Zabarnyi could soon make that 80%, joining Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and on-loan goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga out the door.",
      "They’ve signed a goalkeeper in Djordje Petrovic and a left-back in Adrien Truffert, but they’re yet to add a centre-back, when they might actually need two. And just like Villa, the one position that needed addressing most going into the window (right-back) still hasn’t been sorted.",
      "The priorities are obvious and Bournemouth need to get moving.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Replace Bryan Mbeumo\nChristian Norgaard has been replaced by Jordan Henderson. Caoimhin Kelleher is in for Mark Flekken. Attacking midfielder Antoni Milambo has joined. Now comes the hard part: replacing their best player.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 league goals last season before joining Manchester United for an initial £65million. That’s a massive hole to fill, but Brentford have the money and are one of the savviest recruitment teams in the league. Their most impressive work came in the Championship, but they’ve earned trust.",

      "With Isak now pushing to leave Newcastle, Liverpool are back in the mix. That could mean Luis Diaz joins Bayern and Darwin Nunez is finally moved on.",

      "Manchester United are ‘prohibited’ from signing a top target this summer thanks to one current Red Devils star after ‘four intermediaries’ failed in their ‘mandate’.",
      "United completed deals for Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon early in the window and finally announced the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford after protracted talks with the Premier League side.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim now wants to add a new No.9 and a central midfielder to his ranks, with the focus primarily on a striker.",
      "A report last week claimed RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko ‘wants Man Utd move’ despite the Red Devils being unable to offer European football to the Slovenia international.",
      "The Athletic‘s Ornstein has confirmed that United have held ‘talks’ over a move for Sesko, along with Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson.",
      "Ornstein said: “Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "After claiming Sesko is “the one to watch”, Ben Jacobs revealed ‘fresh talks’ over a move for Watkins.",
      "Jacobs wrote on X: Manchester United have held fresh talks over Ollie Watkins. Villa’s £60m valuation currently deemed as too high, but #MUFC prepared to advance things if price drops. Villa have no plans to alter their position unless a replacement is found. Nicolas Jackson one player appreciated’.",
      "United are also interested in Valencia’s Javi Guerra and were handed a huge boost in their bid to land the midfielder on Wednesday, with Spanish newspaper Marca claiming that Spain Under-21 international Guerra ‘has decided to reject the renewal offer’ from Valencia.",
      "The player’s representatives expect ‘something better’ and Man Utd ‘continues to work behind the scenes to bring him to the Premier League’.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Tottenham make ‘shock’ approach for Man Utd star as they ‘actually stand a chance’ of doing a deal\n👉 Rodrygo set to top terrible list of Real Madrid stars moving to the Premier League\n👉 Man Utd ‘open talks’ with Ligue 1 teen as Zirkzee taps up £34.6m star in Nottingham Forest hijack",
      "Journalist Sebastien Vidal later revealed that Guerra has given United the ‘green light’ to seal a transfer.",
      "Vidal wrote on X: ‘Man Utd are ready to finalise the £21.5m signing of Javi Guerra. The Valencia midfielder has given a verbal green light to join Old Trafford despite interest from elsewhere. The Red Devils want to wrap up the deal quickly.’",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Well-placed sources say four intermediaries had a mandate to try and sell Casemiro, who has entered the last year of his United contract and earns around £300,000-a-week.",
      "‘United would require a fee of £15million to avoid a loss on Casemiro under the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules but an offer is unlikely to be forthcoming.’",
      "Man Utd are looking to ‘wrap up the deal quickly’ for Valencia midfielder Javi Guerra after he rejected a new contract, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly now moving to seal their next two signings this summer after getting a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly reached a ‘verbal agreement’ for their fourth summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Premier League outfit Man Utd are on the verge of signing Spain Under-21 midfielder Javi Guerra from La Liga side Valencia, according to reports.",

      "Gyokeres has come to an ‘agreement’ with Sporting over his transfer this summer while one ‘condemned’ Man Utd star is ‘set to stay’ after a shock U-turn."

      "The former is heading to Arsenal, United have reportedly left the race for Sesko, though there is still seemingly active interest in the latter pair.",
      "On Thursday, it was reported that the Red Devils had held fresh talks over Watkins, but deemed his £60million price tag too high.",
      "It was said they would be ‘prepared to advance’ if the price dropped, but Villa were not willing to shift their demands unless a replacement was found.",
      "However, a fresh report has suggested that Villa have responded with a different stance.",
      "Indeed, The Telegraph states the Villans have told United that Watkins is ‘not for sale’. There is no mention of £60million being enough to land him, with no price at all reported.",
      "Indeed, Villa have ‘no plans’ to part with Watkins and ‘insist he is not for sale at any price’. There seems more chance of United landing Watkins’ Villa team-mate Emi Martinez, though.",
      "The Villa goalkeeper has been on United’s radar since the end of last season, and with his future uncertain, he will be allowed to leave if a club meets their £40million asking price.",
      "United have still seemed to be in the mix for him, but had their last offer, for a loan, turned away.",
      "It seems Villa were somewhat offended by the offer of taking Martinez on a short-term basis, as it was reported it was ‘met with incredulity and and rebuffed immediately‘.",
      "But there have since been reports that United don’t want to pay Villa’s asking price for the Argentine, and therefore have ‘cooled’ their interest.",
      "Beyond that, it’s been suggested that the possibility of the goalkeeper leaving the Premier League for Saudi Arabia has been floated.",
      "Martinez was linked with Saudi sides at the end of last season, but reports since then have suggested he’d rather go to United. If he can’t make that move, though, a Saudi switch might be the best course of action.",
      "Newcastle have reportedly identified two Premier League strikers as alternatives to Yoane Wissa after Brentford ‘closed the door’ on his exit.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have received a new ‘concrete offer’ to get rid of another ‘bomb squad’ member after offloading Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has told Manchester United to “break the bank” to sign a “Ruben Amorim-type player” in the Premier League over an “inexperienced” striker.",
      "Man Utd are “not actively pursuing” Sesko as he didn’t “tear it up” for RB Leipzig last season and have been told a second striker target is ‘not for sale’.",
      "Man Utd have ‘cooled’ their interest in signing Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez this summer, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are signing Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool have signed Hugo Ekitike, but Alexander Isak has become the best striker available this summer."

      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are exploring moves away from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Asked if the club was concerned about losing value on those players in order to sell them, Amorim said: \"That is not the case because there are different reasons for the players [wanting to leave]. Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",
      "\"I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.\"",
      "United agreed the season-long loan of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona this week having brought in forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as Amorim looks to revamp his front line.",
      "\"At the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player,\" said Amorim. \"If we have to start the season with this squad, then I'm happy because all the players want to be here. That is the most important thing.",
      "\"With Bryan and Matheus, we are clearly a better team.\"",
      "United have always been in the market for a striker, but their focus is on player sales.",
      "Amorim said: \"They (Mbeumo/Cunha) can play as a striker. We have Josh (Zirkzee) and Rasmus (Hojlund), the focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the position is there for them. They have to work. They have other players fighting for that position.",
      "\"I'm really pleased. They are really humble, that is really important, and they chose to be here. They had other options, Champions League options, they read everything people say about our club, but they chose to be here. That is a key point for me.\"",
      "Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have been training separately from the first team and are not on the pre-season tour of the United States amid their wish to leave.",

      "Juventus' move for Sancho is on hold until sales are made after they signed Francisco Conceicao this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Malacia spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven while Antony thrived at Real Betis.",
      "A move to Real Betis is looking unrealistic at this stage of the window while several clubs from across Europe, including Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich, have been monitoring his situation.",

      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.",
      "\"This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",
      "Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.",
      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",
      "\"I've nothing bad to say,\" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.",
      "The only slight hiccup Rashford made all day was timekeeping. He arrived 15 minutes late for the contract signing ceremony, but no one seemed to mind.",
      "The first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker posed near an old English telephone box as part of his official club video.",
      "Apt.",
      "Because at his media unveiling, Marcus Rashford rang the right tone and kept everyone engaged. He may well have found his calling.",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself.

      "Marcus Rashford has completed his season-long loan move to Barcelona, which, SSN understands, includes an option to buy for £26m; Rashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa; now Spain switch presents a big opportunity",
      "Thursday 24 July 2025 11:34, UK",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 14:33, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Already linked with Manchester United and West Ham, Parma's Zion Suzuki is one of the great young goalkeeping talents. Adam Bate speaks to those who have worked with the Japan international to find out why clubs are so excited about his potential...",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:19, UK",
      "It seems inevitable that Zion Suzuki will move to the Premier League one day. Already courted by Manchester United and West Ham, it is just a matter of when. The hype is justified. This 22-year-old Japan international is seen as a new breed of goalkeeper.",
      "It is by design. Japan have been throwing resources at football with a specific target in mind. Project 2050. The aim is to win a World Cup by then. Frans Hoek, the legendary goalkeeping coach, has been tasked with identifying the traits of the goalkeeper of the future.",
      "In Suzuki, back when he was sat among the substitutes for Urawa Red Diamonds, Hoek spotted all the ingredients required to do it all. \"I saw him in a camp and said, 'This guy has to go to Europe as soon as possible. It does not matter what league it is. He has to play.'\"",
      "And so, Suzuki embarked on the adventure that has taken him to Belgium with Sint-Truiden, onto Italy with Parma and now linked with some of the richest clubs in Europe. Still only 22, the only question is when to make the leap. Those who know him do not doubt his talent.",
      "\"He is a really quiet guy, a really calm character. That is him off the pitch.\" On the pitch, Suzuki becomes something else entirely. He dominates. \"He is really aggressive because he has massive physical strength.\" He is 6'3\" but looks bigger. \"He is so powerful, so dynamic.\"",
      "That physicality clearly underpins his potential. \"It is like his body is just made of muscles. And I have never seen in my life a goalkeeper who can jump higher. His physical tests were off the charts.\" But it is what this physicality enables him to do that is particularly intriguing.",
      "Rudel enjoys telling the story of one of his first sessions with Suzuki. As the goalkeeper coach, he was setting up a drill. \"I said to him, 'Okay, now show me how far you can throw.' I looked away and then saw this ball flying 20 metres over the halfway line,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I turned around and said to him, 'I told you to throw it not kick it.' He just smiled back at me and replied, 'But I did throw it.' I told him to show me again because I could not believe that someone had that much power in their body that they could throw the ball that far.\"",
      "Rudel rates Suzuki as \"above average\" with his feet but as has been seen with Ederson at Manchester City, the tactical significance of being able to pass short and long has increased. Suzuki ranked third for long passes in Serie A last season and second for throws.",
      "In Belgium, Rudel remembers some stunning saves away to Club Brugge, with one stop in particular becoming his trademark. \"It is those low saves because he is so dynamic and so quick to get down. He has unbelievable reflexes. For me, that is his biggest strength.\"",
      "There have been many examples of that for Parma. One down to his left to keep out Tijjani Reijnders' shot for AC Milan in the San Siro stands out, while the save away to Empoli against Ismael Konate was similar. Denying Como's Marc Kempf a headed goal was even better.",
      "The pick of the lot came against Roma in February when he produced an outrageous double save that defied belief. After keeping out Matias Soule's shot, he somehow scrambled to claw away Anass Salah-Eddine's follow-up. It was the save of the season.",
      "\"With those low power saves, his arms are so strong,\" says Rudel in reference to the technique behind it. \"Sometimes when goalkeepers go down fast and get their fingers to the ball, it still goes backwards. That never happens to him. He has crazy power in his hands.\"",
      "What makes Suzuki so fascinating is that he combines these reflex stops with a commanding presence. Think of the great goalkeepers and they tend to favour one or the other. But Suzuki does more than get down low to make saves, he gets high to snuff out the danger.",
      "He caught 55 crosses for Parma last season, 21 more than his nearest rival in Serie A. Across Europe's five major leagues, only Joan Garcia, snapped up by Barcelona this summer, claimed more crosses. Outside the area, Suzuki ranked second in Serie A for sweeping up.",
      "There are still things to work on, as one might expect of a goalkeeper who is still only 22 years old. He also dropped nine catches - a Serie A high - reflecting the fact that this desire to be proactive comes with risk. But he continues to progress, a theme of his short career.",
      "\"That is another of his strengths and why I am convinced that he can perform in the Premier League,\" says Rudel. \"He went from Japan to Belgium and then Belgium to Italy. Those are big adaptations but he did it really quickly. That is what separates the really good ones.\"",
      "Asked if Suzuki will go to the very top, Rudel has no doubts. \"One hundred per cent.\" The only question is how best to manage the journey. Some advise him to wait and play one more season with Parma. But sooner or later, Zion Suzuki will make a very big move.",
