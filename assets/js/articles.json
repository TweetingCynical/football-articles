      "Martin Zubimendi has already identified the biggest change since swapping Arsenal for Real Sociedad. This season, failing to win is just not an option.",
      "New £60million signing Zubimendi, who finished 11th in La Liga last term with Sociedad, said ahead of his Premier League debut against Manchester United : “The main change will be in mentality; dropping points is not allowed here. Mikel [Arteta] is very detail-oriented, he is obsessed with taking advantage of every play.",
      "\"He’ll certainly ask a lot of things from me and it's been a very different summer. The change hasn't been easy, but I'm here now and eager to get started.\"",
      "Zubimendi snubbed the chance to join Liverpool last summer in favour of staying with boyhood club Sociedad However, when Arsenal came calling, he did not need convincing to sign on the dotted line at the Emirates.",
      "He continued: \"Last year, I also had doubts. I felt I could still contribute a lot to Real Sociedad and that I still had steps to take.",
      "\"But this summer, I felt like my time had come.Once the signing was close, we talked, but he didn't need to convince me as I already knew what I wanted by seeing how the team played.\"",
      "If Arsenal are to finally end their 20-year wait for Premier League title glory they will not only have to oust champions Liverpool but also Manchester City and Chelsea.",
      "Zubimendi is seeking to take inspiration from Spain team-mate and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri as he bids to conquer English football.",
      "He said of his compatriot, who has won four top-flight titles since swapping Atletico Madrid for City in the summer of 2019: “I admire him a lot, although I think we are totally different players. I hope to be able to have the success that Rodri has had in the Premier League.\"",
      "Arteta confirmed on Friday that Zubimendi will be fit to the trip to Old Trafford after some speculation he was nursing a fitness issue.",
      "The Spaniard said of his compatriot: “[On Zubi], he had a great integration. As everybody can see this immediately, a very big impact on the team. I'm really happy and he will be fit.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Despite the move being approved, Barcelona were unable to register Rashford for the forthcoming La Liga season. And should that not have been approved, then the forward could have potentially been sidelined until January.",
      "It appears however that Barcelona have managed to find a solution to the issue. Rashford’s profile appeared on the La Liga website appeared for the first time alongside that of Joan Garcia - who was also facing registration problems following his summer switch.",
      "Gerard Martin and Wojciech Szczesny remained absent, potentially suggesting that Barcelona were attempting to stagger the registrations. Barcelona have needed help from goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to alleviate their financial difficulties.",
      "They have agreed that the German serves a temporary medical leave agreement that frees up around 80 percent of his wages. The news that both Rashford and Garcia are available for this weekend’s season opener vs Mallorca will be welcome news for boss Hansi Flick, who made his displeasure at the ongoing situation known.",
      "“For me, the situation, you can imagine I’m not happy about that. But I know the situation and I believe in the club,” the German said on Friday.",
      "“We have to wait till tomorrow. It was the same situation last season. We will focus on what we can change and what is in our hands. The other things, I believe in the club.”",
      "Elsewhere, Rashford has already spoken out on his first few weeks with Barcelona and claimed that he has found it easy to adapt. Speaking on The Rest is Football podcast, he said: “There are good people who are like a bridge.",

      "Ruben Amorim has switched up Manchester United's pre-match preparations ahead of their first game of the new season on Sunday. United host Arsenal at Old Trafford and will be keen to get off to a good start, having endured their worst Premier League campaign last season.",
      "And in a bid to ensure his players are as well-prepared for the game as possible, Amorim has scrapped something introduced by his predecessor Erik ten Hag. The Dutchman wanted his players to be at Old Trafford four hours before kick-off, travelling to the ground from their homes to share a pre-match meal.",
      "However, Amorim has changed the routine and the players will now meet up at Carrington to eat before travelling to Old Trafford together. Explaining the move, Amorim told MUTV: \"I always had the feeling that we arrive at Old Trafford and Old Trafford must be the centre of the game, but we cannot spend four hours there waiting for the game.",
      "\"And I feel with these facilities [at Carrington] we can be here, preparing for the game away from Old Trafford, and when we arrive at Old Trafford, we have to feel the fans and then go directly to the game, not killing the momentum of the connection with our fans.",
      "\"We know that we have a lot of people waiting there for us, to be with the players and to sign autographs. We will try to do the same.",
      "\"So, it's going to be the same experience for the fans. But for us it's going to be better because we are going to feel nearer the game, the momentum with the fans, and we will spend less time in there.\"",
      "Amorim's decision comes after United spent £50million revamping Carrington over the summer, with chief executive Omar Berrada confident the changes will \"positively impact the performance of our teams\".",
      "During the unveiling, Berrada said: \"I have no doubt that it will positively impact the performance of our teams. This project represents a clear step towards unifying every part of the club around a shared footballing vision.",
      "\"By bringing our staff and players closer together in one integrated environment, we are creating a culture of collaboration and high-performance.\"",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe added: \"Following a review of the facility last year, we made a quick decision to invest significantly in the creation of a world-class performance environment for staff and players to reflect our ambition and vision for Manchester United.",
      "\"We are delighted with the outcome and are confident the new facility will play an important role in building a winning culture at the club.\"",

      "Few footballers can relate to Alexander Isak's current situation better than Wayne Rooney. Like Isak, the Manchester United legend once found himself at the centre of his fanbase's fury - leading to a frightening situation involving multiple men in balaclavas.",
      "Back in 2010, Rooney told United he wanted to leave, having grown disillusioned with the club's direction. Whispers of moves to both Manchester City and Chelsea were rife, and the uncertainty surrounding his future was badly affecting his form, having scored just one Premier League goal by New Year's Day.",
      "Such was the outrage in United circles that several angry supporters turned up outside Rooney's house in the middle of the night in an apparent attempt to intimidate him. \"We had a group of lads outside my house in balaclavas at 3am in the morning,\" he recalled, speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "\"It is scary. Coleen was sat up feeding Kai and she woke me up, we phoned the police and I went down. What they didn't know was that I was going in the next morning to sign a new deal.",
      "\"I went down to say, 'What are you doing at this time in the morning, it is not right.' I think that they thought them coming to my house made me sign my new deal!",
      "\"If you have frustration, I think there's banter, and fans will have a go at players on the pitch, but sometimes it goes too far. Turning up at players' houses, I think that is wrong.\"",
      "Rooney's standoff with United was quickly forgotten once he signed fresh terms. For Isak, though, a similar resolution feels far less likely.",
      "The 25-year-old Swede looks to have burned bridges at Newcastle by refusing to play as he pushes for a blockbuster move to Liverpool. With the Magpies holding firm on their £150million valuation, Isak has resorted to drastic measures - skipping the club's pre-season tour of Asia and pledging to never represent the club again, even if a move away doesn't materialise.",
      "While Rooney's own flirtation with the exit door ended in reconciliation, the former England captain believes that ship has sailed for Isak, and that a clean break might now suit all parties.",
      "\"Isak is a top player,\" he said. \"It is very difficult for him to stay at Newcastle - I have seen a lot of things with the club's fans saying he has gone about it the wrong way.",
      "\"You don't know what they are saying at board level but you imagine they would want him to stay, because for Newcastle to lose Isak when they are trying to build and try and form a squad to challenge for the league - it is a big loss for them.",
      "\"The difference now, with all the financial fair play and PSR, for Newcastle, it might benefit them to sell him to free up money, bring more players in and actually make the squad a little bit stronger.",
      "\"For Isak as well, it is an opportunity to join Liverpool, who have just won the Premier League. It is such a huge opportunity for him.\"",

      "Manchester United are so far behind Arsenal that just one of their players would make it into the Gunners' starting XI, according to Lee Dixon. The two clubs meet at Old Trafford on Sunday and the former Arsenal defender is convinced the away side will leave victorious.",

      "The club have responded by spending over £200million to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to bolster a front line which managed a meagre 44 goals in 38 league games last season.",
      "But despite their ambitious summer recruitment, Dixon still believes that United's team is lagging far behind the Gunners, who finished second for the third straight campaign in 2024/25.",
      "\"I’m struggling to think of a Manchester United player that would get into Arsenal's first 11. Only Bruno Fernandes could lay claim to a spot,\" he told 10bet while predicting a 3-1 win for Arsenal.",
      "\"You’d have to put Sesko and Gyokeres in the same bracket, because neither of them have shown what they can do in the Premier League yet. We need to see them here and see how they handle it. Sesko could score 10 in the first six, who knows, and then he’d walk into a best-of 11.",
      "\"But the standout for United over the years has been Bruno. He’s got match-winning ability. We’ve all got an opinion on when he has a strop and throws his arms up, but he is a winning character. He’d be getting in there, but it would be him and him alone.\"",
      "Dixon feels that, while they've recruited well up front, United have neglected their defence. \"They won a few games and while it wasn't a scintillating summer, they bought well,\" he added.",
      "\"Mbeumo’s a good player, so is Sesko, and obviously Cunha too. We know what they can do, and if that works in that little triangle, with Fernandes behind them somewhere, it should be dangerous,",
      "\"I'm still unsure about them at the back. I'm still unsure about them in midfield. Has a lot changed at United? I wouldn't say a huge amount. They look a bit top heavy. I think there's still a lot of questions.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Arsenal have signed Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke, Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard, Cristhian Mosquera and Kepa Arrizabalaga to balance their squad out better.",
      "\"If you're Mikel Arteta, you are way more comfortable with the balance of your team in comparison to United. But it's Old Trafford, anything can happen there,\" Dixon said.",
      "\"Amorim’s got a big season ahead because he's been given money, this is going to be his team. He’s been unwavering in his approach tactically, he won’t change that, but now he has to deliver results. I'm still not sure that the players he's got from midfield, backwards, are gonna help those three up front.\"",

      "The Portuguese midfielder spent a few days considering the proposition along with his family before turning it down. His decision came on the back of one of United’s worst ever seasons in which they finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final against Tottenham.",

I know that in the public eye it will be bad if things go wrong. But it would be very good if things go well – if they sell me and they get more players and whatever.",

Obviously I know people will have different opinions – he’s 30 years old, he’s getting old…”",

      "Rio Ferdinand has urged Manchester United fans to keep their expectations in check when it comes to Carlos Baleba. The Brighton enforcer, 21, is top of United's midfield wishlist, but the nine-figure sum required to bring him to Manchester likely means another year before a transfer materialises.",
      "Ferdinand admits he would love to see Baleba in a United shirt this season, but whether it happens or not, he warned that the Cameroon international wouldn't be able to solve all of manager Rubem Amorim's problems. Instead, the former United defender believes Baleba would need time to adapt and develop before he can make a lasting impact.",
      "\"Baleba, he's a young kid, he's a wonderful talent, high ceiling. [But] what I would say is, it's about managing expectations if someone like him does come in,\" Ferdinand said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube show.",
      "\"By no means am I saying that you buy him and he's the absolute answer and he's the key to everything being unlocked. He's a young kid who will need to develop. He'll need to be integrated into the squad, into the system.",
      "\"He'll have to learn and understand the responsibilities of being at Manchester United. Different requirements. Different pressure. All these things come into it when you sign for Manchester United. He'll make mistakes, but that's part of it.\"",
      "Despite calling for patience, Ferdinand insists Baleba has the potential to be a transformative signing and urged United to wrap up a deal this month regardless of the price tag to avoid fierce competition for his signature next year.",
      "\"He's something different to everything we've got there [in midfield]. And that difference is something that can really push this squad on. Not immediately, but it can happen. He'll learn,\" the 46-year-old said.",
      "\"My biggest fear is if we don't get him this window, everyone is awake now. Other teams will be at the desk next time with their chequebooks out and Brighton's asking price will be higher.\"",
      "It's understood the Seagulls have no intention of parting ways with Baleba this summer and have slapped a £104million asking price on him to deter United and any other potential suitors - a figure influenced by Moises Caicedo's £115m move to Chelsea just two years ago.",
      "Ferdinand believes the fee would be worth paying, but his former United team-mate Roy Keane isn't so sure. \"I'd be surprised if it happened. Because I still think that kid, he's got to do a bit more,\" Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",
      "Baleba joined Brighton from Lille for £26m in 2023, stepping in to fill the void left by Caicedo following his mega-money move to Stamford Bridge. He's gone from strength to strength ever since, establishing himself as one of the Premier League's most dynamic ball-winning midfielders, with composure in possession to match.",
      "He is understood to be open to a switch to Old Trafford and is prepared to keep pushing despite terms between the clubs being the glaring issue with regards to a move coming to fruition this summer. United are reportedly reluctant to meet Brighton's valuation.",
      "According to The Athletic, they aren't expected to lodge a formal bid, mindful that Baleba has just two Premier League seasons behind him and is still developing. They're also wary of Brighton's reputation as tough negotiators, with the south coast club commanding big fees for not only Caicedo, but also the likes of Marc Cucurella, Joao Pedro and Ben White in recent years.",
      "The financial context is also significant. Having already spent more than £200m this summer on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, United would see a move for Baleba take their outlay beyond £300m - and eclipse their transfer record, set when Paul Pogba returned for £89m in 2016.",

      "Theo Walcott told Arsenal that they would have been massively helping Bukayo Saka by signing Bryan Mbeumo. The 26-year-old left Brentford last month after he was signed by Manchester United in a blockbuster £71million transfer.",
      "The Cameroon international was said to be of interest to the Gunners as well as Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea but Mbeumo made clear to his former side that a move to Old Trafford was his dream destination.",
      "While Mbeumo and Saka both play on the right side of attack, Walcott admitted he would have been a shrewd signing for Mikel Arteta in order to lessen the workload on the England star.",
      "Saka, 23, has played a whopping 263 games for Arsenal since breaking into the team in 2019 and has lacked competition in his position for the majority of his career in north London.",
      "The absence of a player capable of filling in for him has meant he's played a considerable number of games. His lack of rest may have contributed to the torn hamstring he suffered last season against Crystal Palace, which ruled him out for over three months.",
      "Speaking on the It's Called Soccer podcast with Rebecca Lowe, the 36-year-old was adamant as he said: \"Arsenal should have got Mbeumo many years ago. That was one player I thought, 'take the load off Saka'. I'm a big fan of him.\"",
      "Arsenal fans have already received an injury scare over their prized player after Saka limped off the pitch in their 1-0 pre-season loss to Tottenham last month. Their fears were soon downplayed after he started in their 3-2 loss to Villarreal a week later.",
      "Despite missing out on Mbeumo, the north London side did add attacking firepower in Noni Madueke whose favoured position is on the right wing. The ex-Chelsea man cost £52m and is certainly highly thought of by Arteta who explained what the Englishman will bring to his side.",
      "\"We're all so happy to welcome Noni Madueke to the team,\" the Spaniard said. \"Noni is an exciting and powerful young player, with his performances and numbers in recent seasons being of consistently high quality. He is one of the most talented wide forward players in the Premier League.",
      "\"At just 23, Noni already brings experience of club and international football, and he knows the Premier League very well. Having seen the quality of Noni’s performances up close in recent seasons, we’re really excited he is joining us.",
      "\"Noni joins our group with familiar England teammates and other players he knows. He will be made to feel at home straight away. His arrival will really improve our squad - we’re all thrilled to have him here. From all of us, welcome Noni and welcome to your family.\" Arsenal will kick off their Premier League season away to Manchester United on Sunday.",

      "United have signed Matheus Cunha (£62.5m from Wolves), Bryan Mbeumo (£71m from Brentford) and Benjamin Sesko (£74m from RB Leipzig) this summer. Ruben Amorim’s side only scored 44 times in 38 Premier League games last season and have acted to add more firepower to the squad that finished 15th.",
      "They managed to attract the trio of forwards despite not being able to offer any European football this season after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham in May. United have undoubtedly strengthened their attack, but the only other arrival so far this summer is Diego Leon, an 18-year-old left-back.",
      "Former United defender Neville is pleased with the new signings, but thinks there are still major problems that need to be addressed. He has urged them to buy a new goalkeeper after Andre Onana struggled for consistency once again last season.",
      "“We thought that obviously after the Europa League final, that the money wouldn’t be there at that level. So to get those three players, who look like a really good profile – two of them have Premier League experience – we need them to do well, because the rest of the team…",
      "“We need a goalkeeper. There are definitely issues with the defence and midfield. But if the three strikers are a real handful and are scoring goals… last season United’s return in front of goal was really poor, so it’s really important that Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha get off to a really good start.",
      "“We’ve seen a Liverpool striker (Hugo Ekitike) do that tonight. There’s no reason why United strikers can’t go and do that on Sunday.”",
      "United begin their campaign against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday and have until September 1 to make any more additions to their side. The club are desperately trying to offload Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia so they can reinvest in Amorim’s squad.",
      "They are prioritising a holding midfielder, but have also been linked with goalkeepers, including Gianluigi Donnarumma, who is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain, Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez and Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Asked what a good season would be for United, Neville replied: “I think top six would be a good season. I think the four at the top – Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, City – will be difficult to challenge.",
      "“But they could slip into that space where other clubs are, Newcastle, Tottenham, Villa, so that fifth place would be absolutely amazing. Realistically, I think it’s probably going to be between sixth and eighth, but I think fifth is where they have to target.”",

Ruben Amorim's side will be keen to prove they are no pushovers after a dismal 15th-placed finish, while Mikel Arteta's men have their eyes on the crown after playing second-fiddle for three consecutive seasons.",
      "Van Persie has controversially donned the kits of both English heavyweights, but he refused to nail his colours to either mast when questioned in March about his preferences.",
      "Speaking to ESPN at the beginning of the year, the Dutchman was quizzed on whether he favoured former team-mates Wayne Rooney or Thierry Henry, and opted to sit on the fence.",
      "He simply replied: \"Pass because they're both so different and very good.\" He was then pressed to choose between his legendary managers Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson, but gave a similar response, reports the Mirror.",
      "Van Persie added: \"Definitely both,\" whilst offering the same diplomatic answer when asked to pick between former employers Arsenal or United.",
      "His indecision even extended to the clubs' respective rivals, Manchester City and Tottenham, with the ex-striker sighing in frustration before dodging a question about them entirely.",
      "The Dutchman netted 132 goals in 278 appearances for Arsenal before his contentious switch to United, where he claimed the Premier League title in his first campaign.",
      "Despite the backlash over the move, Wenger revealed that Van Persie had expressed a desire to return to North London, but it simply could not materialise.",
      "Speaking about their relationship, Wenger said: \"In 2012, he announced his intention not to extend his contract. All the big clubs were courting him. I sold him to Manchester United.",
      "\"The supporters were angry with me for this but we could not match the offer. I managed to negotiate his departure for £24million, which was a huge amount at the time for a player with a year left on his contract. I had only the interest of the club in mind.",
      "\"My relationship with Alex Ferguson and Manchester United had improved by then, but every transfer is a polite game of poker where you attempt to give not anything away.",
      "\"Van Persie had a fantastic first six months at Old Trafford: he put the team on track for the Premiership title and made it even more difficult for us.\"",
      "Wenger added: \"After three years of the four that he signed for, he was injured and Van Gaal sold him to the Turkish club Fenerbahce. He called me because he wanted to come back, but it was impossible: he was at the end of his career and we were investing in young players.\"",

      "With Manchester United splashing the cash on Benjamin Sesko, Rasmus Hojlund has essentially been told to pack his bags. The Danish striker, 22, has mustered just 26 goals over two years for the Red Devils.",
      "Ruben Amorim's arsenal has been significantly bolstered during this window, with over £200million spent on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and now athletic marksman Sesko, whose £74m arrival was announced last weekend. With so many ins, there must be outs, and one name who looks all but certain to depart is Hojlund.",
      "Despite decreeing in pre-season that he would remain and fight for his spot at Old Trafford no matter what, a sharp change in tune has been reported, with the likes of AC Milan lining up to take on the £72m man. While an expected exit has only materialised this summer, Hojlund's ability has been leaving people unconvinced for some time.",
      "He arrived fresh-faced in 2023, having looked a raw but talented prospect for Serie A side Atalanta. Some immediately baulked at his price tag, as he had only scored 10 times for the Italian side, and it continued to loom as he settled in under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Hojlund took until December to score his first Premier League goal, raising further doubts. Heading into early 2024, after a barren run of just one goal in 10 matches, worrying rumours spilled from Old Trafford.",
      "It was reported in May of 2024 that some of the striker's team-mates were reluctant to pass Hojlund the ball during matches, as they were concerned about his finishing abilities. These suggestions were denied by the club.",
      "Although his debut campaign saw him register a modest 16 goals across all competitions, last season saw a significant drop-off and lack of trust from new boss Amorim. Hojlund netted just four times in the top flight as United finished 15th.",
      "Hojlund was bullish when this pre-season arrived, declaring last month that he would fight for his place in Manchester. But after Sesko's services were secured, an interview given by United's head coach and a telling team selection acted as a coup de grâce.",
      "Sesko was presented to the Old Trafford faithful last Saturday before a pre-season friendly against Fiorentina, which ended 1-1, and Amorim was asked about his new signing, dishing out a sucker punch in Hojlund's direction.",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" Amorim told MUTV regarding Sesko, suggesting that Hojlund does not possess such attributes. \"Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite!",
      "\"That is also important. He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential.",
      "\"I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.\"",
      "A second blow was dealt when it came to team selections. Even with new recruit Sesko ineligible, Amorim opted for usual midfielder Mason Mount as a false nine instead of Hojlund.",
      "This move essentially signalled Hojlund's exit and absence from Amorim's plans, and talkSPORT have reported that he has come to terms with a move away after his pre-season plea fell on deaf ears.",
      "Milan looks the most likely destination, with it being suggested a fee in the region of £30m could be enough to get a deal done. What is almost certain is that Hojlund's nightmare in Manchester will soon come to an end, and for potentially less than half of what he was purchased for.",

      "Talks began with Brighton earlier this month via intermediaries who were working on United's behalf. The two clubs then engaged in direct contact, as Brighton made it clear that they don't intend to sell the Cameroonian.",
      "Baleba's side informed United that it'd take a bid of around £120m - more than what Brighton sold Moises Caicedo to Chelsea for in 2023 - for them to consider his sale. As reported by the Athletic, that's beyond what Red Devils would be willing to pay this summer.",
      "The development reflects Fabian Hurzeler's comments on Friday, as the Brighton manager declared that he was 'very, very, very confident' about Baleba staying. When asked why, Hurzeler replied: \"Just my belief.\"",
      "United have already welcomed three signings for a combined £207.5m - Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. All three of them are forwards and Ruben Amorim's priority is now in midfield, specifically the No.6 role.",
      "The Red Devils could choose to be patient and return to the negotiating table next year or sign an alternative now. Personal terms wouldn't have been a problem with Baleba, as he's willing to push for the move even if it means waiting.",
      "However, there's no suggestion that the ex-Lille starlet is unhappy at Brighton. At Old Trafford, there's an acceptance that Baleba is still developing after two seasons in the Premier League.",
      "The 21-year-old will hope to boost his stock over the course of the new season and Hurzeler is excited to keep working with him. \"I didn't see any change [in Baleba],\" the Seagulls boss added ahead of Saturday's season opener against Fulham.",
      "\"He only changed his hair, so I think that was the only change he made the last two weeks. But overall, he seems to be in a really good place. He's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player.",

The Chilean spent three-and-a-half years in north London and accrued an impressive 80 goals and 44 assists in 160 games for the Gunners.",
      "Having established himself as one of the best players in the Premier League after a three-year stint at Barcelona, where he won everything but the Champions League, then-United boss Jose Mourinho came calling in 2018.",
      "In what was a rare transfer situation, United and Arsenal - who clash on Sunday in their first Premier League game of the season -opted to complete a swap deal, with Sanchez moving to Manchester, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan going in the opposite direction in January 2018.",
      "Prior to the move being completed, Sanchez had scored seven goals in 19 league games, a relatively slow start for the winger, given that he had netted 24 goals the season before.",
      "In a devastating drop-off in form, Sanchez scored just two more league goals for the rest of the season. He ended his first six months as a Red Devil with three goals in 18 games across all competitions.",
      "Speaking in 2020, Sanchez admitted he was initially positive about becoming a United player but those thoughts were swiftly dashed after just one training session. \"I accepted the opportunity to go to United, it felt tempting, and it was something good for me,\" he said.",
      "\"I liked this club a lot when I was a kid. Eventually, I signed, but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club. Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things.",
      "\"After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?' They laughed. I told them there was something that didn't sit right, it didn't seem good. But I had already signed; I was already there. After the first few months, I carried on having the same feeling. We weren't united as a team in that moment.\"",
      "Sanchez's sophomore season at United, which was also his last, was even worse than his debut campaign. He managed just one league goal in 20 games and was resigned to a bench role for much of the season.",
      "After being dropped for an away trip to West Ham because he failed to score in the first six league games of the season, Sanchez said Mourinho's decision to relegate him dented his confidence.",
      "\"In a game with West Ham, I wasn't picked,\" Sanchez continued. \"That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me, and I said it couldn't be possible. \"To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house, and I was very sad. The next day, I trained in a double shift because I love what I do.\"",

      "Manchester United have been told their decision to sign Benjamin Sesko is a \"mistake\" and that they should have bought Ollie Watkins instead. United have spent big on attacking reinforcements this summer, forking out almost £200million for Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "However, former Red Devils star Nicky Butt, who won six Premier League titles at Old Trafford, believes Watkins would have been a better option due to his experience. Watkins has spent five season in the Premier League with Aston Villa and hit double figures in all of them.",
      "\"I know Cunha has done really well over the last couple of seasons but I would really like an experienced striker,\" Butt told BetMGM. \"I hope I'm wrong but I really hope they aren't making the same mistakes with Sesko as they did with Rasmus [Hojlund].",
      "\"A young player coming in with no Premier League experience, it just feels like history repeating itself. Honestly, for what it would have cost, I would have gone and brought in someone like Ollie Watkins, someone to help and pull the young strikers out of a bad patch.",
      "\"When young players are just coming into the club, when the onus is on them to score goals, if they're having a few bad games they have to have the safety net of being pulled out of the firing line. Ollie Watkins, or someone like that, would be who I would have been looking to bring in.\"",
      "Butt's comments come after Arsenal legend Tony Adams expressed a similar sentiment, claiming the Gunners should have signed Watkins instead of Viktor Gyokeres. When asked about Gyokeres during a Q & A for Indo Sport, Adams said: \"I don't know yet.",
      "\"He's not tried and tested. I would have liked to have seen them get Ollie Watkins to be honest with you. He's a Gooner, he might have given us a year and we might have won the title.\"",
      "Adams also expressed concerns about Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta and club captain Martin Odegaard. When asked for his thoughts on Arteta, Adams responded: \"Ahhhh… [audience laughs]… What?! Was there too much of a long pause there?",
      "\"I think he's got a really big call to make this year and, for me, he hasn't done it and the call is to make Declan Rice captain. Declan is my kind of captain and it might free up [Martin] Odegaard up to play with a bit more freedom because he had a very average season last year.\"",
      "\"But I think sometimes when you've got the main man and the captain of the club… Terry Venables did it, he took it off David Platt and he put me as captain and Glenn Hoddle took me out and put Alan Shearer, which was a silly decision!",
      "\"But every now and again, as a manager, you have to put someone that reflects you, reflects the football club, someone who thinks can actually take you to the next level. I think Rice is an Arsenal leader, I think he is.",
      "\"He's good in the dressing room, around the training camp. He's got standards, he's got principles and I can see the man and he's a proper player, a proper captain. I would have done it, but Arteta hasn't done it so I'm being critical of Arteta at the moment. Big managers go, 'Right actually, you're my man now!'\"",

      "Arsenal are now just one day from their Premier League opener against Manchester United. The Gunners travel to Old Trafford on Sunday keen for a positive start to the season.",
      "And supporters will get the chance to see a host of new signings for the first time. Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi and Noni Madueke are among Arsenal’s headline signings this summer and will hope to be included.",
      "Meanwhile, Christian Norgaard, Cristhian Mosquera and Kepa Arrizabalaga have all been signed to add increased strength in depth. But Arsenal might not be done there.",
      "Eberechi Eze remains linked with a move to the Emirates, albeit it looks unlikely that he will pitch up in North London before the trip to Manchester.",
      "With all of that being said, take a look at the latest transfer news and rumours - both on the incoming and outgoing fronts - all in one place:",
      "Arsenal chose not to pursue a move for Man United misfit Alejandro Garnacho having kept tabs on the Argentine. Garnacho is expected to leave Old Trafford this summer after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Arsenal and Spurs hold an interest in Crystal Palace wideman Eze, with the latter also keen on a deal for Manchester City's Savinho. Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid have elected to move for Villarreal star Alex Baena.",
      "Mikel Arteta has revealed the importance he places upon first impressions when it comes to picking Arsenal's transfer targets. The Spaniard is known for his eccentric methods when it comes to management, but with signings...the old classics remain - a good chat and determining whether they are ready for the task.",
      "He said: “Personality [is the most important attribute for a player]. Without that, you have no chance. You have to look at somebody’s eyes.",
      "“When I go to sign a player, sometimes it’s on Zoom and I open the laptop, it’s the first impression. Is this guy ready to put that jersey on, work in that dressing room and take all the noise that is surrounding his signing and deal with it in the right way?”",
      "Arsenal star Martin Zubimendi has revealed why he chose to pursue a move to the Emirates just 12 months after rejecting Liverpool. Speaking to DAZN Espana, the midfielder said: “Last year, I also had my doubts.",
      "“I felt I could still contribute a lot to Real Sociedad and that I still had steps to take. But this summer, I felt like my time had come.",
      "“Once the signing was close, we talked, but he [Arteta] didn’t need to convince me. I already knew what I wanted by seeing how the team played.”",

      "The new season will get underway for Manchester United on Sunday when they host rivals Arsenal at Old Trafford. The Red Devils will be hoping to make a winning start as they look to bounce back from their worst Premier League finish last season.",
      "United finished 15th in the league and failed to qualify for the Champions League after they were beaten in the Europa League final by Tottenham. Ruben Amorim has strengthened his squad this summer, bringing in Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Marcus Rashford has left the club, joining Barcelona on loan with an option to buy, while Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof have been released and veteran defender Jonny Evans has retired.",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler says he is \"very confident\" that Carlos Baleba will not be sold this summer, despite strong interest from Old Trafford.",
      "When asked about the midfielder's future ahead of Brighton's opening game of the new season, Hurzeler said: \"I didn't see any change, he's only changed his hair. I think that's the change he's made in the last two weeks.",
      "\"But overall he seems to be in a really good place, he's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player. I didn't see any big changes and he's an option to start tomorrow. Very very very confident [he will stay], that's just my belief.\"",
      "According to a report from the Sun, Manchester United are considering a move for Morten Hjulmand as a potential alternative to Carlos Baleba. The report states that the Sporting captain would 'cost less than half' what it would take to sign Baleba, with Hjulmand valued at around £50m.",
      "As a result, it is claimed that United could use the money saved by signing Hjulmand to fund a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Paris Saint-Germain star is expected to leave this summer after they signed a new goalkeeper in Lucas Chevalier.",
      "Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy, having been frozen out at Old Trafford by Ruben Amorim. However, Steve McManaman believes the forward has no place at Barcelona.",
      "\"It's certainly important that he hits the ground running,\" he said at an event with ESPN. \"I thought it was an incredible move for him, to be very honest. The last couple of seasons at Manchester United, the way Manchester United performed - for him to leave and go to arguably one of the most exciting teams in Europe, I thought: 'He's got an amazing agent.'",
      "\"Where's he going to fit in? The answer is, I don't know. Because Raphinha, Robert [Lewandowski] and Lamine [Yamal], they had the most incredible season. So you think that is set in stone. You've got Ferran [Torres] behind them. They've moved a couple of players out - if anything, when you look at Barcelona's team, they need a couple of more defenders... but they go and bring in yet another forward. So we'll wait and see.\"",

      "Arsenal considered a move for Manchester United outcast Alejandro Garnacho before opting against a move, it has been claimed. The winger has been left out of United's pre-season tour, with Chelsea closing in on a cut-price deal, but their London rivals turned to other targets after exploring a shock deal.",
      "The Gunners ended up turning their attentions to Noni Madueke, who joined from Chelsea in a £48millon deal. And they weren't the only ones to move on from Garnacho.",
      "Those teams also ultimately looked elsewhere. Spurs paid £55m to sign Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, while Atleti added both Alex Baena and Thiago Almada.",
      "Chelsea are understood to have agreed personal terms with Garnacho, with negotiations over a fee ongoing. They have until September 1 to get a deal done, with United already dropping their asking price since the Blues' January interest.",
      "Garnacho featured in all but two of United's Premier League matches last season, scoring six goals. He didn't start any of the final three games, though, and the writing appeared to be on the wall after he was left out of the starting line-up for the Europa League final.",
      "\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" he said after the defeat against Spurs. \"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "In early August, United boss Ruben Amorim made his feelings clear when it came to Garnacho's future. \"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” the boss said.",
      "\"But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that.",
      "\"So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection. Other times you want a new challenge. So we try to make everything OK for all parties. To the club, to the coach and to the player. It's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "Trossard, 30, missed Arsenal's final two friendlies with a muscle injury while 26-year-old Zubimendi wasn't seen in any images from the club's media day ahead of the 2025-26 campaign. Spain international Zubimendi has been signed to take Arsenal to the next level and improve their midfield.",
      "The playmaker cost £55.8million from Real Sociedad, making him the Gunners' second-most expensive signing of the summer transfer window. And it's good news for fans wanting to see him in competitive action for the first time, having shown glimpses of his quality in pre-season.",
      "\"Yes, he had a great integration,\" Arteta told reporters when asked if Zubimendi would be available. \"As everybody can see this immediately, he's had a very big impact on the team. I'm really happy and he will be fit.",
      "Trossard, who's been linked with a move away this summer, is expected to join him in Arsenal's matchday squad. \"Yeah, I think he's much better,\" Arteta added. \"I think he will be able to train again tomorrow (Saturday) and if that's the case, he will be fit.\"",
      "The Gunners manager will have numerous difficult decisions to make when he selects his starting XI. The most noteworthy is who'll get the nod up front?",

That's the next level that we're going to face, something that we probably haven't faced before.",
      "How should Arsenal line up against Manchester United? Let us know your starting XI in the comments section.",

It's going to be about earning the right to play, to compete and when you don't have the chance to do that, to cooperate in the right way with any teammate to improve the level.",
      "\"It's going to happen to all of them because the season is going to be so demanding that the first week is going to be a little bit different. But the moment we start to play three times a week, it's going to flow in a really natural way.\"",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has faced a barrage of questions about Manchester United's interest in Carlos Baleba. However, he remains confident that the £100million-rated youngster will stay put this summer.",
      "United already splashed out over £200m to strengthen Ruben Amorim's attack with the likes of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko, following a lengthy saga, and Bryan Mbeumo all recruited. The Red Devils are now keen to bolster their midfield and some United stars are believed to have even reached out to Baleba in order to convince him to move to Old Trafford.",
      "The Seagulls' young Cameroonian star is top of United's wish list, and it's reported that contact was made last week, although United do have alternatives in mind. Ahead of Brighton's season opener against Fulham on Saturday, head coach Hurzeler fielded numerous queries about Baleba, with the German showing a defiant stance on his young star.",
      "It's now believed that United have decided to postpone a move for the 21-year-old due to his hefty £100m plus price tag. Interest is set to be reignited next year, and while all hope isn't lost, senior figures at the club think a deal in this transfer window before 1 September is unlikely.",
      "Nevertheless, in Hurzeler's view, any potential move for the costly Baleba will definitely have to wait until this current Premier League campaign concludes. Here's what he revealed about the United target on Friday as three crucial questions were addressed.",
      "Hurzeler: \"Very, very, very confident [that he will not leave]. Yes. This is just my belief.\"",
      "Hurzeler: \"I didn't see any change in him. He only changed his hair, so I think that was the only change he made in the last two weeks! But overall, he seems to be in a really good place.",
      "\"He's enjoying it with his team-mates. He's enjoying being a Brighton player. He's very grateful to have the progress he made in the last season. So I didn't see any big change.\"",
      "Hurzeler: \"He is an option to start tomorrow, yes. Now I only have to mention two names [out injured]. It's a big change compared to last season. So a big thank you to my medical staff, to my physios.",
      "\"They did a great job during the summer, so the only players are not available are Adam Webster and Solly March, they are the long-term ones.",

      "Baleba has missed Brighton's last four pre-season friendlies with a knee injury, but Hurzeler confirmed he could start against Fulham, ending conspiracy theories about his absence.",
      "Some Manchester United fans speculated Baleba was missing from Brighton's pre-season because a move to Old Trafford was imminent. The truth is a deal for Baleba was always bound to be unlikely this summer.",
      "Brighton value Baleba at around £100million and have planned for him to stay for another season. United have spent close to £200m on their attack, making it difficult to finance a marquee midfield signing.",
      "Having said that, it's obvious that Ruben Amorim needs a new addition in that area because there are concerns about who is best to partner Bruno Fernandes in the deeper midfield roles.",
      "Manuel Ugarte is likely to start alongside Fernandes in the pivot against Arsenal, but Ugarte hasn't truly convinced since his arrival last summer. Kobbie Mainoo has played in that role in pre-season, while Casemiro is over the hill and shouldn't be starting Premier League games in 2025.",
      "Speaking at Friday's press conference, Amorim discussed signing a midfielder and insisted: \"I'm really happy with our players, they are working really well and we have players in that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players.\"",
      "He added: \"Maybe Mason Mount is a player who can play in that position if we want something different. But we have players to cope and win games in the Premier League.\"",
      "Ugarte was supposed to be a midfield solution. The 24-year-old was signed to provide defensive cover and it doesn't reflect well on him that United are planning to invest in that area again.",
      "Baleba would be an exciting addition and he could be the perfect foil for Mainoo with a long-term view, but United are now prepared to delay their interest in the Brighton midfielder until next summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "That means an alternative may need to be signed before the transfer deadline day. United look light in midfield, especially after Toby Collyer's departure to West Brom on loan, and a fresh face is required.",
      "Perhaps Sporting Lisbon captain Morten Hjulmand could be an option. Hjulmand worked with Amorim during his time in Portugal and has been linked with a move away from Sporting.",
      "Hjulmand is a defensive midfielder and would be a cheaper option until United revisit their interest in Baleba at the end of the season. It would surely be better to bring in a midfielder instead of no new signing.",
      "The 26-year-old is a Denmark international and scored an equaliser against England at Euro 2024, finishing brilliantly from 30 yards to secure a point for his country in the group stage.",
      "It's thought Hjulmand could be available for around £50m. That is half of Brighton's valuation of Baleba, but it's still a significant fee and Amorim would have to be convinced Hjulmand would improve the team.",
      "And interestingly, Amorim discussed the differences between Hjulmand and Ugarte when he managed the pair. \"They are completely different characteristics\", he said in September 2023.",
      "\"Morten doesn’t have Ugarte’s ability to find players from all sides of the pitch with incredible speed. Morten has, and Ugarte didn’t have, the ability to read the game, anticipate moves and be well-positioned.",
      "\"We have to adapt the team to the players we have and Morten will also adapt to our way of playing, to our high pressing.\"",

      "Ten Hag made the players arrive at Old Trafford four hours before kick-off. They would arrive individually in their own cars and enjoy a pre-match meal at the stadium. The Dutchman also repurposed a large hospitality suite at Old Trafford and turned it into a pre-match room for his squad.",

      "What can Manchester United fans expect from Matheus Cunha this season? \"He's the kind of player who gets fans off their seats because he can produce moments of brilliance out of nowhere,\" responded Ian Burchnall.",
      "\"Matheus is a sort of player that you don’t see as much now because the game is extremely tactical. I've talked to him on a matchday about something and he's been like ‘it’s okay, I’ll figure it out, don’t worry’.",
      "\"I remember Bobby Robson telling a story about Paul Gascoigne at the 1990 World Cup when England played against Germany. He wanted to speak to Gazza about Lothar Matthaus and he just said 'boss, smoke your cigar and leave him to me.' That’s a little bit like Matheus. He wants to feel the game.\"",
      "Burchnall spent a season and a half working as a first-team coach at Wolves when Gary O'Neil was in charge and his time at Molineux coincided with Cunha playing the most consistent football of his career.",
      "Cunha has said O'Neil \"understood him completely\" at Wolves and credited him for finding joy in his football again. The Brazilian was not an established starter during Julen Lopetegui's tenure as Wolves boss, but affection from O'Neil and his coaching staff was the catalyst to get him motoring in the Premier League.",
      "\"We were still trying to find the best role for him when we arrived,\" Burchnall said. \"I joined six games into the campaign, but Cunha was superb in the opening game against Man United.",
      "\"I think Gary was playing around a little bit with the system and shape, with Pedro Neto switching sides, and that obviously affected Cunha, so we moved him around a little bit. But we played Manchester City at the end of September and Cunha was magnificent, especially defensively.",
      "\"We settled on a 3-4-3 with Pedro Neto, Hwang Hee-chan and Cunha. Once Matheus started to bed into the left No.10 role, he started to fly. He didn’t get going under Lopetegui, but he started to flourish.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Burchnall continued: \"You can see it straight away with Matheus. His technical capabilities are unbelievable, his finishing is superb and he hits with crazy power. I remember talking to him and he said he didn’t play any formal football until he was 14. He was big on playing futsal.",
      "\"You see how he receives the ball with his sole and manipulates it, it’s futsal-driven. He can kill the ball and go from being stationary to accelerating past people - he does that ridiculously well.\"",
      "Cunha is preparing for the 2025/2026 season as a United player, following a £62.5million move from the West Midlands at the start of July.",
      "\"We had a lot of discussions about how to get the best out of Matheus Cunha because he’s such a fantastic talent,\" admitted Burchnall.",
      "\"If you get the best out of him, there’s a good chance you’re going to win football matches. And a lot of the games we were successful in at Wolves, Matheus had a huge hand in that.",
      "\"We knew he would be important, so we spent a lot of time thinking about how we could get him into the best positions and into space. Gary spent a lot of time one-to-one with Matheus, trying to help get the best out of him.",
      "\"If you look at his career so far, he’s probably had his most consistent period of good performances in a Wolves shirt. We got to where we wanted to be with him and got a lot of him.\"",
      "There were two keys to unlocking the best from Cunha at Wolves: playing him in the left side No.10 role and giving him freedom.",
      "\"I can totally understand why Manchester United would sign him, especially because of the system Ruben Amorim likes to play,\" Burchnall said.",
      "\"He is tailor-made for that left No.10 role, the left forward position in the 3-4-3. It’s the perfect position for him. Sometimes, if we played 4-2-3-1 with a central No. 10 at Wolves, there was a big demand on the defensive role of that position out of possession.",
      "\"With a back five, I think he got more freedom, he could drift in and make a lot things happen. Matheus likes freedom. Too many constraints on training and too much coach-led stuff is not his favourite because he likes to be able to play and express himself in that setting.",
      "\"Of course, you have to work on other bits in training and those are the bits Matheus probably isn’t best at, but as soon as he gets some freedom and the chance to get on the ball, he can do some fantastic stuff.",
      "\"I think trying to understand the human on a deeper level helped get the best out of him. I think that’s something we were really conscious of because we gave him the freedom to be himself.",
      "\"After he signed for Man United, I sent him a text to say congratulations, it’s a fantastic move, and I said just keep being yourself, Matheus, because that’s really important. And he just responded, 'of course, my friend, I’ll keep being myself, but maybe just a little bit better'.",
      "\"The out-of-possession areas were probably where we felt we needed to demand a bit more from Matheus. But there’s always that trade-off where he needs energy for transitions and counter-attacks.",
      "\"We knew sometimes some others would have to do that work to enable him to get on the ball. We were conscious that it was never going to be the biggest part of his game.",
      "\"He isn’t known for that and rightly so, so we had to create a situation where we got him defensively into shape and with enough energy to impact the game when we needed him.\"",
      "Cunha was a priority target for Amorim and he has settled into his new surroundings better than anyone could have hoped for, moving into a house and becoming immediately popular at Carrington",
      "Amorim has praised Cunha's character and outgoing personality. The Brazilian is understood to be popular with staff at Carrington and is naturally closest with fellow Portuguese speakers, Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte in the dressing room.",
      "\"He’s a really nice guy, always smiling and upbeat,\" said Burchnall. \"He’s a character and enjoys football. But you saw it in some moments last season, like against Ipswich, which was our last game, and later down the line against Bournemouth in the FA Cup, he’s an emotional guy.",
      "\"He’s passionate, your typical South American, so he has that side to him as well. He trains and plays on the edge a little bit, but when it’s done and dusted, he’s a nice guy, a family guy and a funny guy, so I’m sure he’s going to have an influence in the dressing room and be a really good guy to have around.\"",
      "Burchnall laughed as he explained Cunha would like to play a game with a reserve goalkeeper in the training session before a match. \"He would like to do certain shooting exercises right at the end of sessions, getting balls served into him to take different shots, and he would take a penalty,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd end by taking a pen and would definitely offer the keeper something if he would save it - and I rarely saw the goalkeeper get near one. I think that was just to keep himself on the edge. There's no pressure in training, so offering the goalkeeper money or a dinner would focus his mind.\"",
      "Cunha was excellent in home and away fixtures against United last season, but his standout performance for Wolves came against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in February 2024.",
      "\"He scored an amazing goal against West Brom in the FA Cup and another against Nottingham Forest,\" Burchnall said. \"He was struggling with a calf injury and was playing through it, to be honest, and he scored an individual goal against Forest away that was just breathtaking.",
      "\"We weren’t sure whether he was going to be fit and available to play - and he scored two goals in that game. But Chelsea away was the standout. Matheus and Rayan Ait-Nouri were brilliant together down that side and some of the things they did were completely off the cuff.",
      "\"We would laugh on the bench and they were superb against Chelsea. We were 4-1 up in that game, Cunha scored a hat-trick, and the two of them were rotating positions, and you could see how much they were enjoying it.",
      "\"Thiago Silva scored a header from a corner to make it 4-2 with a few minutes to go and added time to follow, so it was panic stations. There was a little break and Gary got the players over to pass on tactical information.",
      "\"We couldn't find Cunha, we looked across and he was sat down with his arm around the ball boy, having a chat with him. At the time, we were so stressed, but afterwards we laughed when we watched it back. He was so relaxed and that’s just him. He loves playing and expressing himself.\"",
      "Cunha was linked to other Premier League clubs ahead of the summer transfer window, but he only wanted to sign for United, which Burchnall believes should be a good career decision.",
      "\"There was talk of lots of different clubs being interested,\" he said. \"But Arsenal, for example, use a very different No.10. Martin Odegaard is one of the best No.10s out of possession and can drop deep, but it’s a very different role.",
      "\"I don’t know if Arsenal’s system would have got the best of Cunha because of their set-up, while Amorim has been uncompromising with his system and I think it's very much a tailor-made for him.\"",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, August 16.",
      "The Premier League got back up and running Friday night with Liverpool beating Bournemouth in an eventful 4-2 victory. If that has wet your appetite for the return of competitive football, strap yourself in as you do not have long to wait until the Reds start their campaign against Arsenal.",
      "We shall be previewing the big match today as well as keeping you up to date with the summer transfer window. MEN Sport understands the move for Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the deadline but United are relaxed about the situation and are happy to delay the move until next year.",
      "In the meantime, thoughts turn to who could be United's alternative this summer. Sporting Lisbon's captain Morten Hjulmand is a player familiar to Ruben Amorim and is thought to be on the radar.",
      "Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is a player that the Reds also admire with some claiming the long-term plan is to play the Englishman alongside Baleba in the future. There is also the small matter of sales to discuss too with Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia all expected to depart before the window closes.",
      "Keep across all the latest United news, views and transfer rumours below...",
      "Man United-linked Baleba took to social media to share a message after featuring for Brighton in their 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "He wrote: \"Just me doing the thing I love most. Had fun playing at home with the boys. Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut.\"",
      "United had identified the youngster as a potential reinforcement, but Brighton’s £100m valuation, and their stance that he is not for sale, has forced United to wait at least another year.",
      "Patrick Dorgu has hinted that he could be in-line for a start on Sunday afternoon when the Premier League returns.",
      "United enter the new season tomorrow, at home to Arsenal, with expectations high. They struggled desperately in the Premier League last campaign after practically giving up on their domestic form to focus on the Europa League.",
      "Ahead of the match, posting on his story, Dorgu shared a custom match graphic for tomorrow afternoon's opener. While not a sure fire sign that he will be starting against the Gunners, players often share these posts on social media when they are all set to feature in some capacity.",
      "It is seen as a subtle nod to family and friends to tune in for the fixture. 2025 has been a break-out year for Dorgu after he was signed from Lecce in January.",
      "Manchester United and Jadon Sancho's working relationship looks all-set to come to an end this summer after a tumultuous couple of years.",
      "Sancho was banished from the first-team under the club's previous manager, Erik ten Hag, after claiming he was a scapegoat for the Dutchman. He joined Borussia Dortmund on loan in January and when he eventually returned to Old Trafford, Ten Hag claimed he had patched things up with the winger.",
      "After a loan spell with Chelsea last season, Sancho informed the club that he wanted to leave this summer and now it is a race against the clock to get that deal done.",
      "Football Italia understand that Hjulmand is one of the midfielders Juventus are interested in signing this summer.",
      "The Danish international has reportedly been on Juventus’ radar since his time at Lecce, before his move to Portugal. The report adds that while Sporting CP are keen to keep their captain until next summer, they may consider selling if a 'suitable offer' comes in.",
      "Having decided against pursuing a deal for Carlos Baleba, United have shifted their focus to Hjulmand, alongside Adam Wharton.",
      "As per Football Insider, former Man United chief scout Mick Brown has confirmed that Maguire will not leave the club this summer.",
      "He claims United have turned down multiple offers from interested parties. \"Man United aren’t going to let Maguire leave,\" he said. \"A few clubs have been interested and had made contact to check whether he would be available, but those talks have not been allowed to develop.",
      "\"They see Maguire as a very important part of the squad, both on the pitch and off it.He’s played consistently with all sorts of pressure, speculation and issues around him, and he’s come through that and proved himself. From what I hear, Ruben Amorim is a fan of him and he doesn’t want to see him go.",
      "\"He’s a leader and an experienced head in the dressing room for the younger players, but he’s also one of their better centre-backs every time he plays. He’s an integral part of what Amorim is looking to do, and there are no plans to let him go. As long as he’s fit, he’s an important part of the squad.\"",
      "According to Caught Offside, Man United are considering a summer move for Lee Kang-in from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "The winger is reportedly free to leave due to competition for places in France and has already been in direct contact with Arsenal.",
      "The report claims that it seems the South Korean could also depart alongside Gianluigi Donnarumma, as he is reportedly 'seriously' considering a move before the summer deadline.",
      "It's said that if Chelsea only manage to sell one member of that unwanted trio, Maresca may have to make do with the attacking options currently available to him.",
      "Reports from Portugal (via the Daily Mail) suggest that Gyokeres' representatives were left 'hurt' by the lack of a formal approach from Man United, which came as a surprise at Old Trafford.",
      "From United's perspective, Gyokeres' appearance at the stadium this season was always expected to be in an Arsenal shirt. Mikel Arteta also believed that Gyokeres' preference was clear after just one phone call.",
      "Behind the scenes, it's said that United had no interest in publicly losing a race they were never truly in.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims Roma are 'still waiting' for Sancho's final decision after putting forward a contract proposal.",
      "Taking to X, Romano added: \"United are ready to accept £20m fee on loan + obligation, they want to get it done ASAP. Final green light now up to Jadon.\"",
      "Betis' No.7 shirt, worn by Antony during his loan from Man United in the second half of last season, is currently unassigned.",
      "Spanish newspaper Marca reports that it will remain so, with no current first-team player expected to take the number. Betis also still have an available non-EU spot, meaning Antony could return easily if a transfer is agreed.",
      "Betis porting director Manu Fajardo has confirmed the Spanish club is not giving up on re-signing the Brazilian. \"Both parties want him to be here this season,\" said Fajardo.",
      "\"Every day that passes allows us to dream of him being here. If Antony is here, it's because the numbers add up. The most important thing is the club's sustainability; we can't do anything crazy. It's okay to think big, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground.",
      "\"If he doesn't sign with a club, there are still options, but the deal would take place within the parameters we have budgeted at the club.\"",
      "According to reports in Italy, Sancho's salary demands is a problem for AS Roma.",
      "Italian media believe that the deal is likely to be structured as a loan with an obligation to buy, for a total fee of around €23m. However, Sancho's hefty salary is said to be beyond Roma's means, and the club are proposing a five-year contract to spread the salary over a longer period.",
      "It remains unclear whether he will accept the offer or hold out for more, with interest also coming from Juventus and Besiktas.",
      "Man United are not planning to proceed with a move for Baleba this summer despite being an admirer of the Brighton midfielder.",
      "United first held discussions with Brighton through intermediaries before the two clubs later spoke directly. But the Seagulls made it clear they do not intend to sell Baleba in this transfer window.",
      "The 21-year-old has started for Brighton against Fulham this afternoon.",
      "Both Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton have emerged as potential options.",
      "Man United face strong competiton for goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "Providing an update, Fabrizio Romano said on YouTube: \"In case they go for a goalkeeper don’t forget the name I gave you in July. Lammens, the young goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp.",
      "\"United still like the player, they still have him on their shortlist. They still have to decide whether they want to go for a goalkeeper or not. It will also depend on the budget and the [new] midfielder. So there is a kind of puzzle for Man Utd in these final two weeks of the window, also including Senne Lammens at the moment.\"",
      "Meanwhile, The Telegraph suggests United must now choose whether to persist with their pursuit of Lammens or change course, as Inter Milan are said to have entered the race 'strongly.'",
      "Reports from Belgium suggested that Antwerp would demand an upfront fee in the region of €15m-€20m (£13m-£17.3m).",
      "According to reports in Portugal, Sporting CP have no intention of selling any more of their key players this summer.",
      "It’s noted that Hjulmand’s €80m (£69m) release clause was only valid until June 15, meaning there is currently no fixed price for the midfielder. As a result, Sporting would now be free to demand whatever fee they see fit.",
      "With Manchester United also exploring alternatives to Carlos Baleba, both Hjulmand and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are believed to be under consideration.",
      "Sporting boss Rui Borges has already issued a warning to interested clubs. Speaking in his press conference this week, he said: \"They know the club's plans for potential departures. They [players] have [release] clauses; whoever wants to [sign them] has to trigger those clauses, of course.\"",
      "Ex-United captain Keane has warned that the price for Baleba's potential may be too high to pay. Speaking to the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"I'd be surprised if it happened.",
      "\"Because I still think that kid... he's got to do a bit more. You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",
      "More here.",
      "Brighton have named Manchester United-linked midfielder Carlos Baleba in the starting XI for this afternoon's Premier League clash against Fulham.",
      "The Seagulls value the midfielder at £115m.",
      "Manchester United reporter Steven Railston has looked at some alternative targets to Carlos Baleba this summer.",
      "Read the full story, here.",
      "After Liverpool and Bournemouth kicked off the new Premier League season last night, there are a further nine games across the next three days.",
      "Here is a full run-down of the fixtures across Saturday, Sunday and Monday:",
      "Aston Villa vs Newcastle",
      "Brighton vs Fulham",
      "Sunderland vs West Ham",
      "Tottenham vs Burnley",
      "Wolverhampton vs Manchester City",
      "Chelsea vs Crystal Palace",
      "Forest vs Brentford",
      "United vs Arsenal",
      "Leeds vs Everton",
      "After being linked with a move to United, it appears the La Liga giants are wanting to snap up another English gem in the form of Crystal Palace's Wharton.",
      "The Daily Mail understands scouts from Madrid have watched Wharton in action and like what they see.",
      "Manchester City are also thought to be looking at Wharton with the Reds believed to be keen too.",
      "Speaking to BetVictor Casino, former Premier League manager Harry Redknapp has urged United to complete sales before the transfer window closes at the beginning of September.",
      "A successful season for Manchester United would be obviously a trophy of some sort but a top six finish would be a massive improvement. Ruben Amorim has got a hard job on his hands but they have brought some decent players in, I think that the recruitment looks like it's okay and they're not finished yet they're gonna bring a few more in so it all depends who they bring in. Really the team needs rebuilding and he needs to get a few out. He's got a few there that he doesn't fancy who are not probably good around the place attitude wise and you know you only need a few bad apples at your club and they can absolutely destroy your football club and it seems to me that he has got one or two there that he feels are bad apples and until he gets them out he's always going to have a problem. He's obviously pushed them to one side. He's not taking players on the trip that he didn't feel were part of what he's looking to do. It's been bold and I like the manager. I think he comes over great, full of enthusiasm and he knows what he wants. But good players are the most important thing. To be a great manager, the most important ingredient is to have great players. Manchester United certainly didn't have great players last year. They were a very, very poor group. Hopefully they are improving this year. I'd love to see them do better.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United are among the clubs looking at PSG midfielder Lee Kang-in.",
      "The attacking midfielder has a contract until 2028 at the French giants and therefore would not be considered an easy or cheap acquisition.",
      "Napoli and Arsenal are also thought to be keen on the 24-year-old with the latter claimed to have made direct contact for the South Korean.",
      "Speaking ahead of the clash with Arsenal on Friday, Amorim suggested that Mason Mount could hold the solution in midfield should the Reds be unable to strengthen before the window closes.",
      "I’m really happy with our players, they are working really well, we have different players for that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players. Maybe Mason Mount is a player that can play in that position if we want something different. But then we are going to find out during the season. But we have players to cope and win games in the Premier League.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano has suggested that United made club-to-club contact with Brighton for the signing of Baleba.",
      "It is claimed that United, as reported by MEN Sport, were told by Brighton that Baleba is not for sale.",
      "Baleba has not told Brighton that he wants to leave but would be interested in joining the Reds if an agreement can be reached between the clubs.",
      "Ahead of the new Premier League campaign, Betfair and YouGov have polled 2,000 football fans on their thoughts for the new season.",
      "United supporters have been deemed the least confident in terms of the 'Big Six' clubs.",
      "43 per cent of the Reds' fanbase think the club will end the campaign trophyless once again.",
      "According to The Sun, United are now in the midst of preparing a £50m transfer approach for Morten Hjulmand.",
      "They claimed this week that should a move for Baleba prove impossible, attention would turn to the Danish international.",
      "Hjulmand is thought to have a £68m release clause but Sporting could look to sell him for £10m less including add-ons.",
      "That being said, it seems United could be a tad short of the Lisbon club's asking price.",
      "In case you missed it yesterday, MEN Sport understands that a move for Baleba before the window closes is unlikely.",
      "United remain fans of the midfielder but are too far away on his price tag.",
      "The Reds are willing to wait until next year to complete the deal though.",

      "The Reds' captain said via O Jogo: \"I know that numbers are the most important thing in football, and obviously, the figure the club was going to get for me was a big one. So, I know it was difficult for the club.",
      "\"I only spoke to the Al Hilal president once and told him I never thought about leaving. Whatever he wanted to do or not, he should discuss it with the club. I always said that if the club wanted to sell, then yes, they would have to make a decision.",
      "\"If they didn't want to, there's nothing to decide because my goal was to stay. It's a lot of money for me too, but that's how it is. People make decisions. I know I won't regret it because I'm where I want to be.\"",

      "Manchester United wing-back Patrick Dorgu has hinted that he could be in-line for a start on Sunday afternoon when the Premier League returns.",
      "United enter the new season tomorrow, at home to Arsenal, with expectations high. They struggled desperately in the Premier League last campaign after practically giving up on their domestic form to focus on the Europa League.",
      "This would ultimately backfire as United lost 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur in the competition's final in Bilbao, ensuring that they would be without European football this season. With their focus, now, solely on the Premier League and English cup competitions, there are no excuses for United to not improve drastically.",
      "In the summer window, United have bolstered their attack with three new additions, while Diego Leon has been signed to provide cover at left wing-back. It seems that the Reds will be sticking with Leon's teammate Dorgu on the left flank for the start of the season, though, should his Instagram activity be anything to go by.",
      "Posting on his story, Dorgu shared a custom match graphic for tomorrow afternoon's opener. While not a sure fire sign that he will be starting against the Gunners, players often share these posts on social media when they are all set to feature in some capacity.",

      "Manchester United were reportedly left surprised after hearing suggestions that Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres was hurt by the lack of interest in him from the Reds this summer.",
      "During his time at Sporting Lisbon, the Swede became a talisman as he scored 97 goals in 102 appearances for the club. Most of those goals were bagged while Ruben Amorim was in the hot seat at the Portuguese club.",
      "However, when the Reds swooped in to hire Amorim following Erik ten Hag's departure, the rumour mill soon began. With United needing a new No.9, it was expected that they would bid for Gyokeres.",
      "Said bid never arrived with MEN Sport understanding that United felt it would be futile to move for the striker as his heart was set on the Emirates Stadium. However, the Daily Mail has reported on Saturday evening that they were taken aback when Gyokeres felt disappointed that his old boss did not try to sign him.",
      "In his pre-match press conference at Carrington, Amorim was quizzed on Gyokeres but decided to keep his reply brief. \"That is a question for Mikel [Arteta],\" he explained.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"Viktor is in a different league. Sporting have good scouting because they live from the players they can buy and sell to survive.",
      "\"I think he’s a very good player. It’s not a surprise to see him with a big club in England.\"",
      "Of course, United would eventually splash the cash on RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko who, ironically enough, was a target for Arsenal both this year and last. Speaking on his new centre-forward, Amorim said: \"I think he has great potential in everything he does.",
      "\"He can play different types of football. He's going to feel that the Premier League is really aggressive, he's going to learn, but he has a great potential and I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "\"That's why we paid so much money - to have a striker that will have his history in our club. The guy is always thinking about football.",
      "\"He's really obsessed by that and that is a good thing because you don't have to think about that aspect with that young guy. I don't need to tell Ben: 'This is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready for every game, it's like do-or-die'.",
      "\"With that guy, I have not that concern. I have the opposite, [he needs to] enjoy [himself] a little bit.",
      "\"He's listening, and he wants to perform, so that is really good.\"",

      "It is understood that while he is not officially banned from the East Midlands club, Forest have no plans to welcome him until an agreement has been reached over his attitude towards the club's owner Evangelos Marinakis. Neville has been critical of the owner, most recently following the draw against Leicester City where he described it as 'scandalous' that Marinakis entered the field of play at full-time.",
      "A conversation was had between Marinakis and his head coach Nuno Espirito Santo on the pitch. Forest later released an indirect statement calling on ex-players not to spread 'fake news online' after the insinuation was made that Marinakis entered the field of play to confront the manager.",
      "Forest claim the owner had actually entered the field of play to check on the wellbeing of forward Taiwo Awoniyi who picked up a serious injury. In a bid to stir the pot on Friday night, Jamie Carragher asked Neville if he would be in the East Midlands this weekend as Sky cover Forest's opener against Brentford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Football fans will get a chance to see several new Premier League rules for the first time on Friday night when Liverpool take on Bournemouth. Anthony Taylor will oversee proceedings as the Reds welcome Andoni Iraola's side to Anfield on Friday evening, with Michael Oliver and Thomas Bramall monitoring the action from Stockley Park.",
      "Gary Beswick and Craig Taylor will assist on the sidelines in Merseyside, providing support to the on-field referee. Meanwhile, Farai Hallam will keep an eye on the dugout, liaising closely with the two head coaches in their respective technical areas.",
      "The Football Association and Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) faced significant criticism last season, with contentious decisions frequently making headlines. As such, Taylor has been tasked with enforcing the key law amendments.",
      "The referee, who hasn't taken charge of the opening match of a new English top-flight season since 2022, will face pressure to ensure the campaign begins smoothly. With that in mind, we take a look all the new rule changes, what they entail, and how they'll all affect all the Premier League sides including Manchester United and Manchester City this weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "This season, only team captains will be permitted to approach the referee during the 90 minutes of play. Yellow cards will be issued to those who do not have permission to speak to the referee or players who act disrespectfully.",
      "If the goalkeeper is wearing the armband, one outfield player can be nominated to liaise with the referee. It is a clear push to have minimal players communicating directly with the officials this season.",
      "This season, all Premier League goalkeepers, including Allison, will face penalties if they hold onto the ball for more than eight seconds. If a goalkeeper exceeds this time limit, with the on-field referee counting down the final five seconds of the eight-second restriction, a corner will be awarded to the opposing team.",
      "This rule has been implemented to curb time-wasting. A similar regulation concerning the length of time goalkeepers could handle the ball was previously in place, but it was not strictly enforced.",
      "The Premier League now has the option to instruct the on-field referee to make an announcement following a VAR 'review' or a lengthy VAR 'check'. This protocol, which involves declaring and explaining decisions to the spectators, was similarly enforced by on-field officials at the Club World Cup.",
      "There have been minor modifications to several set-piece rules. If a player accidentally touches the ball twice when taking their penalty, they will be allowed to retake it.",
      "However, this rule will only apply if their shot is successful.",
      "An indirect free-kick will be awarded if a player, substitute or coach off the pitch touches the ball before it goes out of play. A drop ball will be given to the team that did not touch the ball last before the game was stopped, so long as the referee believes said team would've retrieved possession.",
      "Regarding offsides, this season, when the goalkeeper throws the ball, the last point of contact should be used for the purpose of determining an offside position. So, if Alisson were to start a counter-attack with a long throw, the officials – and VAR, if called upon – will review the pass from the moment it leaves his glove.",

      "Sancho was an England international and one of the most exciting players in Europe when he arrived at United.",
      "However, Sancho contributed 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for United before his fallout with Erik ten Hag. He missed four months of competitive football due to that disagreement and re-signed for Dortmund on loan for the second half of 2023/2024 in an attempt to rediscover form.",

      "Over the past couple of weeks, speculation has been rife over Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba leaving the south coast to join Manchester United.",
      "On the surface, it almost felt too good to be true for United considering how much they have already spent this summer. And, as it turns out, that appears to be exactly the case.",
      "MEN Sport understands that while Baleba is believed to be keen on a move to United this summer, a deal being agreed before the end of the transfer window is unlikely. Instead, the Reds are happy to wait until next year and return for the player then when, hopefully, their finances look stronger too.",
      "In truth, this decision has probably been made due to the feeling coming out of Baleba's camp on his feelings towards staying with the Seagulls. His manager, Fabian Hurzeler, shed some light on that in his pre-match press conference on Friday.",
      "\"Very, very, very confident (he will stay),\" the head coach said. \"It's just my belief.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I didn't see any change in him. He only changed his hair, that was the only change he made in the last two weeks.",
      "\"But overall, he seems to be in a really good place. He's enjoying it with his team-mates.",
      "\"He's enjoying being a Brighton player. He's very grateful to have the progress he made in the last season.",
      "\"I didn't see any big change. He is an option to start for tomorrow.\"",
      "Hurzeler's comments suggest that there was never likely to be a situation which Newcastle are currently finding with Alexander Isak, where he is refusing to play to push through a move elsewhere. And, actually, that is not a bad thing.",
      "Baleba is showing the sort of person that he is by choosing not to let the speculation bother him and getting on with the job that he is paid to do.",
      "Plus, United can now take the long approach and spend the next year negotiating a fee for the midfielder in order to get that business done early for the 2026/27 campaign.",
      "In the meantime, Baleba's stock rises, and everyone ends up winning. The only issue for United in the short term is that they will need to find an alternative this summer.",
      "The midfield still needs reinforcements, but perhaps the Reds will look towards a player like Morten Hjulmand from Sporting, who Ruben Amorim knows will fit straight into his system.",
      "But, in terms of Baleba, this slow and steady approach could be United's best bet of signing him.",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler was asked plenty of questions about Manchester United target Carlos Baleba as his side prepares to take on Fulham. He is confident that the 21-year-old, thought to be valued in excess of £100million, will be staying put this summer.",
      "Despite already parting with over £200m to bolster Ruben Amorim's forward line with trio Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, the Red Devils are now looking to boost their midfield ranks. The Seagulls' young Cameroonian sits atop the club's shortlist, and contact was reportedly made last week.",
      "It is now thought that United have decided to delay a move for the 21-year-old because of such an eye-watering £100m plus valuation. Interest is to be renewed next year, and though not all hope has been lost, senior sources at the club believe that a deal in this window before September 1 is not likely.",
      "The Cameroonian is contracted to Brighton until 2028. With Moises Caicedo moving to Chelsea just two years ago for a then-British record of £115m under similar circumstances, the Seagulls have a ballpark figure to demand.",
      "Regardless, in Hurzeler's mind, any move for the pricey Baleba will certainly have to wait until the completion of this upcoming Premier League season. Here's what he said about the United target on Friday as three key questions were answered...",
      "Hurzeler: \"Very, very, very confident [that he will not leave]. Yes. This is just my belief.\"",
      "Hurzeler: \"I didn't see any change in him. He only changed his hair, so I think that was the only change he made in the last two weeks! But overall, he seems to be in a really good place.",
      "\"He's enjoying it with his team-mates. He's enjoying being a Brighton player. He's very grateful to have the progress he made in the last season. So I didn't see any big change.\"",
      "Hurzeler: \"He is an option to start tomorrow, yes. Now I only have to mention two names [out injured]. It's a big change compared to last season. So a big thank you to my medical staff, to my physios.",
      "\"They did a great job during the summer, so the only players are not available are Adam Webster and Solly March, they are the long-term ones.",
      "\"I don't know the clear schedule about them but all the other players are available. So it's a big change and a positive change, and hopefully it stays like this.\"",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and even though we’re only halfway through the opening weekend there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "10) Richarlison (2)\nA surprise that he is still at Spurs to start the season, and might very well have been shipped out by now had Dominic Solanke not been injured. Instead, he started on the opening day against Burnley, and promptly sauntered halfway to matching his 24/25 Premier League goals tally while also making an audacious early bid for goal of the season.",
      "",
      "9) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this weekend, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame.",
      "",
      "7) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "6) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Pedro (0)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (0)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal?",
      "",
      "2) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side.",
      "Either Pep Guardiola’s new Man City are incredibly good, or denuded Wolves are incredibly bad. It could well prove to be both.",
      "Liverpool legend Mo Salah has broken record after record, adding another with an opening-day goal. Here are his best stats from a brilliant career.",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson thinks Liverpool should be looking to sign another centre-back before worrying about signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle.",
      "Nine Premier League players rank among the top 20 most valuable players in the world. They are joined by only one Paris Saint-Germain star.",
      "Manchester City have the most players in the top 10 as well as the highest-paid player for the 2025-26 Premier League season…",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have been dealt a double blow as they face losing two key stars over the next year amid interest from Real Madrid."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £53.1m",
      "2nd – £50.4m",
      "3rd – £47.7m",
      "4th – £45m",
      "5th – £42.4m",
      "6th – £39.8m",
      "7th – £37.1m",
      "8th – £34.5m",
      "9th – £31.9m",
      "10th – £29.1m",
      "11th – £26.5m",
      "12th – £23.8m",
      "13th – £21.2m",
      "14th – £18.6m",
      "15th – £15.9m",
      "16th – £13.3m",
      "17th – £10.7m",
      "18th – £7.9m",
      "19th – £5.2m",
      "20th (Bournemouth) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "But the Egyptian is not the favourite to retain his title in 2025/26, with the early favourites with the bookies as follows…",
      "",
      "9=) Rodri (Manchester City)\nThe current holder of the Ballon d’Or will be back at the base of Manchester City midfield and could be the difference between a trophyless season and the Quadruple.",
      "",
      "9=) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\nThe first of the former winners, Van Dijk was a moderately surprising exclusion from last season’s shortlist. Anybody laying money on the Dutchman obviously did not see him in the Community Shield.",
      "",
      "7=) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nAnother shortlisted player from the 2024/25 season, the Swede is currently in a stand-off at Newcastle as he pushes for a Liverpool transfer. He will have to either eat humble pie in the north east or hit the ground like a demon at Liverpool to win this award.",
      "",
      "7=) Phil Foden (Manchester City)\nGenuinely odd inclusion after a pretty universally rotten 24/25. But he is a former winner.",
      "",
      "4=) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nThe favourite to win the Golden Boot is pretty long odds to win the PFA Player of the Year despite being a former winner and really quite likely to score the goals to win the Premier League.",
      "",
      "4=) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe likely three-times winner of the PFA award is up there again in the betting, though we have a feeling this will be an After The Lord Mayor’s Show of a season from the Egyptian. It’s telling that Liverpool’s newest toy is higher in the betting.",
      "",
      "4=) Declan Rice (Arsenal)\nIt’s interesting that Viktor Gyokeres is a rank outsider for the PFA award when his signing is likely to be the difference between being runners-up and finally winning some kind of trophy. But Rice is clearly a popular figure with his peers.",
      "",
      "2=) Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nA phenomenal Club World Cup has raised expectations for Palmer, who is central to any Premier League title challenge from Chelsea.",
      "",
      "2=) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nThe most expensive signing of the summer is the only new signing of this list. There can be no bedding-in period when you cost upwards of £100m. If Liverpool are to retain the title, Wirtz needs to deliver a banger.",
      "",
      "1) Bukayo Saka (Arsenal)\nA curious one this but worth noting that he was an early favourite in the 24/25 betting before he got injured. Maybe everybody thinks he is due a trophy…"

      "We bring you the top 10 favourites for the Golden Boot according to the latest odds…",
      "",
      "10) Dominic Solanke (Tottenham)\nThe odds are long at 33/1 – he only scored nine Premier League goals last season – but he is still ahead of Omar Marmoush and Liam Delap among others. Perhaps the theory is that if Thomas Frank can coach a 20-goal campaign out of Bryan Mbeumo, he might just work wonders for Solanke. One thing we do know: The Golden Boot would get him on the plane to the World Cup.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nManchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million; it feels like they may have made a familiar mistake just because he is the wrong side of 28. But he scored 16 Premier League goals last season and remains Villa’s first-choice striker (we presume), and he will be supremely motivated ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United)\nSesko was the man left standing in the Manchester United striker position when the music stopped, but he scored only 13 Bundesliga goals in 24/25 so it feels like a massive ask for him to come to the Premier League and win the Golden Boot with a club that struggled with chance creation (and everything else) last season.",
      "",
      "6=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nThe odds have come in from 25/1 to 20/1 for the most expensive striker signing of the summer, but he did massively underscore according to his xG last season for Eintracht Frankfurt. Perhaps there is value to be found in backing Ekitike here; he did score in the Community Shield and then again in the opening-day clash with Bournemouth.",
      "Actual Premier League goals: 1",
      "",
      "6=) Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nThe stand-out player as Chelsea won the Club World Cup but it’s tricky to envision a 15-goal Premier League season becoming the 25 goals – at least – necessary to win the Golden Boot. Mind you, we do think Chelsea might win the Premier League title after that summer.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nLooked excellent for Chelsea at the Club World Cup and in pre-season, with the Brazilian seemingly ready to lead the line ahead of Delap. The Brazilian has never scored more than 10 Premier League goals before, but he has never played in the Premier League with Cole Palmer, Estevao, Jamie Gittens and Pedro Neto before.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United, for now)\nNow we hit the big boys. Isak is a 17/2 shot to win the Golden Boot despite the fact that he might not kick a ball in the Premier League until after the transfer window has closed. Will he eventually play for Newcastle United, Liverpool or (don’t laugh) Tottenham?",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nThe top scorer in 2024 is only being beaten in 2025 by Kylian Mbappe, but he is untested at this kind of level. The final piece of the Arsenal jigsaw? If that’s true, the Golden Boot trophy will surely come with a Premier League title win.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe Golden Boot holder broke several records on the final day of last season, but the Egyptian is now 33, it’s an Africa Cup of Nations season, and he’s no longer playing for a new contract. He did start with a goal v Bournemouth, mind.",
      "Actual Premier League goals: 1",

      "19) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners in what some say is a one-horse race. James Trafford will be dead chuffed.",

      "",
      "18) Morten Hjulmand – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nBrighton are refusing to sell Carlos Baleba, so Hjulmand is next on United’s list, apparently. The Dane has worked with Ruben Amorim and knows his system but links with United pre-date the manager’s appointment at Old Trafford. The 26-year-old would be available for around half the price Brighton expect for Baleba.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Rico Lewis – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nHmm. Interesting one, this. Forest could do with more quality in the full-back positions and Lewis still has so much room to improve at only 20 years young. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side are reportedly in talks with City after agreeing a fee for another academy graduate.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too. Friday night’s chaos against Bournemouth might spring them into action, mind…",
      "",
      "15) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nThe story that refuses to go away. Will it finally happen this month?",
      "",
      "13) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",
      "MORE ON EZE: Four real and compelling reasons why Eberechi Eze might choose Spurs over Arsenal",
      "",
      "12) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs are close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "10) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Christopher Nkunku in as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Douglas Luiz – Juventus to Nottingham Forest\nForest have seemingly only just realised the transfer window didn’t close at the end of July. The former Aston Villa captain is their top midfield target and would be one hell of an addition. Even if he’s been pants in Italy.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Roma\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days and Besiktas have emerged as a possible destination for Sancho, but a move to Roma is now looking likely. The Italians have reportedly bid £20m for the 25-year-old. That being true, United should be snapping their hand off.",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Omari Hutchinson – Ipswich to Nottingham Forest\nA club-record £37.5m deal has been agreed. Big money. Big pressure.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Nottingham Forest\nBlimey. Forest are moving mad now that their Europa League spot has been confirmed. £26m for Kalimuendo is good business. £37.5m for Hutchinson is…interesting business.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nIt turns out that Ouattara has been an unhappy bunny on the south coast, and Brentford are prepared to make him happy with a key role in their attack. More of a Bryan Mbeumo replacement than one for Wissa, this deal could still help Newcastle finally land the 28-year-old.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nForest have won the race for McAtee, who had attracted interest from Germany. They will pay £30m and City have managed to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on clause. They are terrified of a Cole Palmer repeat.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. A deal worth £39million plus another £4million in add-ons was agreed and Ramsey flew to Tyneside for a medical on Thursday evening."

      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",
      "Here are five things we can’t believe happened only a year ago…",
      "",
      "Scott McTominay replacing Kobbie Mainoo\nMainoo wasn’t quite ‘untouchable’ as he started at the base of Manchester United’s midfield in their opener against Fulham last season. Amid interest from Chelsea and financial constraints which were resulting in mass redundancies under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, no-one was. But he was The Future to a greater degree than the other two members of the trident of hope: Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "He still is in so far as Garnacho is the living, breathing antithesis of what Ruben Amorim wants to create at Old Trafford as the most unwelcome member of the current bomb squad, while Hojlund remains the ghost of the feast. But Mainoo, having been a beacon of light under Erik ten Hag after scoring in the FA Cup final and playing a major role for England at the Euros, now enters a season knowing any football he plays will be out of position under Amorim, who is currently desperate to source a new midfield destroyer who we suspect will limit Mainoo’s game time to such a degree that he will be pushing for the exit come January.",
      "McTominay meanwhile, having been either the midfield bridesmaid at United – as illustrated by his six-minute cameo against Fulham a year ago – or one half of the widely deplored McFred axis, heads into his second season with Napoli as the Scudetto winner and Serie A’s Most Valuable Player, given the freedom of a city in which the love bestowed upon him has rarely, if ever, been trumped since the deification of the arguably the greatest footballer to ever play the game, Diego Maradona.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho assist for Joshua Zirkzee winner\n“What a big moment for Joshua Zirkzee,” said Gary Neville on commentary, after the £36.5m summer signing came off the bench to score the winner two minutes from time at Old Trafford. We all assumed that was the first of many after that introduction to Premier League football.",
      "There was discussion after that game as to whether it was a “smart finish” or something closer to a lucky scuff, and there’s little doubt that the thousands of Manchester United fans who jeered Zirkzee off against Newcastle just over four months later plumped for the latter in hindsight.",
      "He scored just two further goals in the remaining 31 games of his debut Premier League season, combining with Hojlund’s goalscoring woes to force United into spending £74m on a Benjamin Sesko this summer, with Zirkzee’s game time surely set to be further limited by the arrivals of Matheus Cuha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It was Garnacho who came off the bench to provide the assist, having done his typical busy dribbling thing to get Ten Hag’s side back into the game and give the cartel of United pundits plenty of ammo to claim ‘this will be his season’, while the hackneyed insistence that Marcus Rashford ‘isn’t a kid anymore and needs to lead this team’ was also rolled out.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha on the bench\nIt says a fair bit about the management of Gary O’Neil that he opted for a three of Hwang Hee-chan, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Rodrigo Gomes – a right-back he fielded on the left wing – to operate behind Jorgen Strand-Larsen against Arsenal while Cunha sat on the bench for the first hour.",
      "The Brazilian who would go on to smash their club-record departure by moving to Manchester United for £62.5m at the end of a season in which he would score 15 Premier League goals. Hwang, Bellegarde and Gomes got six between them. It would make more sense if Cunha has been a bit sh*t the season before, but he also finished that campaign as top scorer with 12.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko starts\nHaving been one of Arsenal’s key players in his first season after arriving from Manchester City, Zinchenko should perhaps have seen the writing on the wall by the time his third season rolled around after the second ended with Mikel Arteta preferring to field Takehiro Tomiyasu out of position at left-back over the Ukrainian.",
      "The £42m spent on Calafiori and the return to fitness of Jurrien Timber will only have added to those fears, though those concerns will have been assuaged greatly by him being named in the starting XI to face Wolves on the opening day. But that was just one of five Premier League starts, and three of those were at the back end of the season when Premier League title hopes were lost and focus had shifted to the Champions League, with the stratospheric rise of young upstart Myles Lewis-Skelly doing nothing to improve his standing and mood at the club.",
      "And you get the sense that he doesn’t really know why he’s been sidelined – like he’s been ghosted by a lover whom he talked to about building a life together – as indicated by quite the harrowing excerpt from his recent autobiography.",
      "“In pure personal terms, it was easily the worst season I ever experienced as a professional. A player who doesn’t play is nothing. Imagine this little boy who’s dedicated his entire existence to becoming good at one particular thing and then finds at 28 that he’s essentially no longer needed, that there are others who can do the job for him. It’s not a nice feeling.”",
      "",
      "Jarell Quansah as Virgil van Dijk’s partner\nQuansah must have wondered while sitting on the bench for all but three of Liverpool’s remaining 37 Premier League games after the curtain-raiser at Ipswich just what Arne Slot had seen from him in that opening 45 minutes before he was hooked for Ibrahima Konate that caused the Liverpool boss to strip him of his badge as Van Dijk’s centre-back partner and hand it to the Frenchman.",
      "Liam Delap had made life difficult for him, but that proved to be a theme for Ipswich’s opponents throughout the season. They hadn’t conceded. It felt almost cruel at the time, but then, Slot will point to the title and the excellent defensive partnership which was crucial to that and shrug his shoulders.",
      "We would suggest that the thought of Quansah playing under Ten Hag in a year’s time as he walked out at Portman Road would have been met with open mouths and giggles, but then there can’t have been more than a dozen people thinking the Dutch manager would still be in charge of Manchester United at the start of this season.",
      "The actions of the Big Six are angering Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace fans as the Alexander Isak saga drags on.",
      "Arne Slot is expected to walk Liverpool to a second Premier League title with a squad with a helluva lot of holes in it. We might just be about to ...",
      "Nothing has actually changed in the Alexander Isak to Liverpool saga but don’t let that stop anybody trumpeting ‘decisions’ and ‘twists’.",
      "Are Newcastle fans deluded if they think they can keep Alexander Isak? And without him, have Liverpool actually strengthened at all?",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives.",
      "Newcastle are the Alexander Isak of the Premier League, with their transfer window amounting to a two-month sulk having not got their way."

      "",
      "20) Fulham\nThey’ve signed a back-up goalkeeper. That’s the summer. The only flicker of intrigue is the potential signing of a Brazilian called Kevin, which is as amusing as it is genuinely exciting.",
      "",
      "19) West Ham\nGraham Potter’s a top coach, but his first few months have been flat. Jarrod Bowen, an in-form Lucas Paqueta, and the occasional James Ward-Prowse free-kick are the only real reasons to tune in this campaign.",
      "",
      "18) Burnley\nTheir 100-point promotion was built on defence, and Scott Parker looks set to keep it that way. It might be smart, but it won’t be fun.",
      "",
      "17) Wolves\nMatheus Cunha was the one player worth watching. He’s gone. Unless Jhon Arias takes the league by storm, expect some dull viewing.",
      "",
      "16) Brentford\nThomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and (pretty much) Yoane Wissa have all gone. There’s still some talent here, but with rookie boss Keith Andrews in charge, survival looks tougher than entertainment.",
      "But the tough season people are expecting makes them one of the biggest talking points going into the opening weekend.",
      "",
      "15) Aston Villa\nMinimal changes this summer. Yawn. Unai Emery’s still brilliant, but the squad feels a bit samey compared to last year.",
      "",
      "14) Nottingham Forest\nLots of new signings, all attack-minded. Big fees for James McAtee and Omari Hutchinson add intrigue. I’m excited to see them, just less so than the teams above.",
      "",
      "13) Crystal Palace\nWithout Eberechi Eze, they lose some sparkle. Oliver Glasner’s style should keep them watchable, but the drop-off in quality will be obvious if he leaves.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nDefence has been gutted, attack remains strong. Andoni Iraola should still serve up entertaining football, though perhaps in the same way that Blackpool did under Ian Holloway in 2010/11.",
      "",
      "11) Leeds United\nLeeds are back, and that’s always fun. They’re back where they belong, people.",
      "Their signings haven’t necessarily been exciting, but they’ve been very smart and point to a more controlled, well-rounded Whites team this time around. We could get some delicious managerial drama as well, with Leeds reportedly considering sacking Daniel Farke at the end of 2024/25, despite leading them to the Championship title. A poor start could see the Elland Road bosses act…",
      "",
      "10) Newcastle United\nA grim summer in the transfer market, but still a squad full of players worth watching — Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Lewis Hall. Results might dip, but entertainment shouldn’t. Even without Alexander Isak, Newcastle are a good team.",
      "",
      "9) Everton\nDavid Moyes with Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye could be box-office. Throw in Tyler Dibling and I’m becoming a fully-fledged Evertonian.",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland\nA proper Barclays club returns, with a new face for the top flight in Regis Le Bris and a busy summer. Granit Xhaka might provide us with a lovely meltdown if Sunderland struggle. And lots of young players from foreign leagues are in, which is becoming the norm for a promoted club’s summer window. Not necessarily to great success.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal\nBig summer signings, big expectations. Viktor Gyokeres could be a hit or a disaster. Martin Zubimendi looks superb. Just hope Arsenal don’t go full set-piece robots again, otherwise they’ll plummet down to 20th here.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham Hotspur\nIf the Super Cup is any clue, they’ll attack big games the right way by not being completely gung-ho, while finally looking dangerous from set-pieces. Ange Postecoglou refused to work on the latter and was too proud to move away from the former.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton\nTalented squad, promising coach, attractive football. They should be right in the mix for a top-five finish. Yes, that’s right. I’m going big on Brighton this season.",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea\nCole Palmer is reason enough to watch, but there’s quality and flair all over the pitch. Estevao might make us forget Neymar never played in the Premier League. Joao Pedro looks f***ing brilliant. And as always, there are plenty of new faces around the place. The Blues are expected to challenge for the title this time around…",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United\nUnpredictable and capable of glorious chaos. Could be great, could be a mess, often in the same match. That’s why we love them. Kind of.",
      "Bring on a front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, though, with Bruno Fernandes pulling the strings behind them. Yum.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City\nRayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders are exciting additions. Pep Guardiola’s side already play some of the best football in the world, and these signings should make them even more entertaining. You’ve got to love a flying, skillful full-back, and Ait-Nouri is just that, while his arrival hints towards a change in style from natural centre-backs in left-back. And with natural midfielder Matheus Nunes on the other side? City should be attack, attack, attack, with Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush up front to combine for 50 league goals.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool\nChampions last season, and now even stronger. Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, two attacking full-backs (one of which is pretty much a winger), and a top young centre-back — the Slot machine is built for another year of high-tempo, high-quality football.",
      "If that opener against Bournemouth is anything to go by, Liverpool will provide us with a chaotic and very entertaining season.",

      "10) Nottingham Forest – £122.5m\nIt’s been another wheeler-dealer summer from Forest, who have spent big on Omari Hutchinson, Dan Ndoye, James Mcatee and Igor Jesus, but the outlay has been pretty much covered by the sales of Anthony Elanga and co.",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts.

      "Antony has recently been given an ultimatum by Manchester United, but is now said to be open to a shock new commitment which could help all parties.",
      "Antony spent the second half of last season out on loan with Real Betis. He immediately looked at home, and finished his spell there with nine goals and five assists in all competitions.",
      "It’s known that both he and the Spanish club want to reunite if possible, but so far, Betis have looked unable to drum up the required funds for the move for the United man.",
      "That issue could be taken off the table soon, though. According to Estadio Deportivo, one of the options being considered to ‘unblock the situation’ is a new deal being offered to the winger at Old Trafford.",
      "That is an option Antony is said to view ‘more favourably’ than in recent weeks.",
      "That is as it could open the door for a loan move which would be good for all parties. Antony will not want to be tied down to then sit on the bench, but this avenue should be good for him.",
      "If he was to go on loan in his current circumstances, with his contract ending in 2027, he’d have just a year left on his deal at the end of that, and United would either get a small fee, or Antony could see out the final year and leave for free.",
      "If he extends his deal, the Red Devils will surely be happier allowing him to go out on loan again, knowing there’s still a good chance of them receiving a fee in the future, particularly if Antony plays well.",
      "For Betis, a loan seems the best course of action as they don’t have to drum up cash for the winger, but they’ll be able to get him back on a short-term deal, potentially to pick up where he left off last term.",
      "It was suggested earlier in the week that Antony had been told he needs to accept an exit by the end of the week or the threat of him being sidelined until January looms.",
      "That would have been a huge shame for the forward in relation to his World Cup chances. He was in the latest Brazil squad off the back of his Betis performances, getting back into international contention for the first time since 2023.",
      "Continuing to play well at Betis would have given him the chance to stay in contention for Brazil and potentially to play in the World Cup.",
      "That gives the forward another reason to accept a contract offer, if he’s allowed a loan beyond that.",
      "Antony is angling for a return to Real Betis but his actions have reportedly not pleased the Man Utd hierarchy.",

      "Abdoulaye Toure (Le Havre, £2.5m)\nTen Ligue 1 goals from midfield for Le Havre last season sounds very promising indeed but a 15th-place finish having conceded 71 goals does raise the question as to how good Toure was at his primary job of protecting the defence.",
      "And there’s a suspicion of him taking a ‘f*** it, I’m going to enjoy myself’ approach to football at the age of 31 given his 11 previous seasons of senior football have yielded 17 goals in total.",

      "Mario Martin (Real Madrid, £1.3m)\nAfter 20 La Liga games for Real Valladolid last season the 21-year-old’s off to Getafe on loan this term. We wouldn’t be at all surprised to see Manchester United making a £50m-plus move for the graduate of the Real Madrid academy in 2027, because why sign burgeoning talent on the cheap when you can pay big bucks for them after developing elsewhere?",

      "Johnny Cardoso (Atletico Madrid, £22m)\nLinked with a move to Old Trafford earlier in the window as part of a possible Antony haggle, to the extent that there are several ‘Welcome to Manchester United’ videos on YouTube of the USMNT international, who instead swapped Real Betis for Atletico, which is in itself enough to suggest he would be the right sort of player to aid United. Diego Simeone loves a midfield pr*ck.",

      "Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham, £26m)\nHe was excellent against Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup and we love watching an on-song Bentancur, but he’s arguably the most Tottenham of all the Tottenham players, somehow managing to have the mercuriality of a 20-year-old winger as a 28-year-old defensive midfielder. We have every confidence that a move to Old Trafford would swallow him whole.",

      "Anton Stach (Leeds, £12m)\nAs much as we would enjoy the volume of boiled piss leaching into the rivers of West Yorkshire as a result of a player Leeds signed this summer moving immediately to Manchester United, it’s unfortunately unlikely to happen.",
      "",
      "Dario Essugo (Chelsea, £17m)\nWe have a sneaky feeling Chelsea may have another very, very good midfield destroyer on their hands in Essugo, who’s only just arrived from Sporting but will need at least one significant injury to play anything more than a bit-part role under Enzo Maresca this season, with Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Andrey Santos all very much above him in the pecking order. A loan move would be a smart option, but that’s not going to be to United.",
      "",

      "Saturday 16 August 2025 18:55, UK",
      "“We struggled without a reference as a striker.” That was Ruben Amorim’s verdict on Manchester United’s final pre-season game against Fiorentina. “We have a new player, so we will see.” The hope is that Benjamin Sesko can make the difference.",
      "The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.",
      "But the modern United has become, perhaps, the ultimate test of that theory. At £73.7m, taking the summer spending on their new forward trio to over £200m, Ruben Amorim has certainly been backed. That brings pressure to make it work - and quickly.",
      "Amorim has been open about the fact that he is fortunate still to be in the job, reliant on the support of those above him after a miserable run of results that led to United's worst league finish in over 50 years. The consensus is that the mood has now changed.",
      "Luke Shaw recently admitted that the environment inside the club could be \"extremely negative\" and \"quite toxic\" before going on to claim that it is different now. Unhappy players have moved on. New ones have arrived with a point to prove. A cultural reset.",
      "Time on the training ground has helped too and the absence of European football means that there will be more of that throughout the campaign. Amorim will have the opportunity to demonstrate why he was regarded as a top young coach in the first place.",
      "The summer spending raises expectations, however. United are already fifth favourites for the title. Fail to secure European qualification and they will be out of Europe for back-to-back seasons for the first time since the ban on English clubs was lifted.",
      "The challenge is that Sesko is not the finished article. For now, at least, United are not in that market. And their opening Premier League game of the season offers an intriguing contrast. Opponents Arsenal tracked Sesko for a long time, a move seeming imminent.",
      "In the end, they opted for Viktor Gyokeres. The Sweden international has plundered well over 100 goals for club and country over the past two seasons at Sporting - more than Sesko has yet managed in his career. But he is 27. A signing for the here and the now.",
      "Maybe that reflects Arsenal's sense of urgency, a side that has been so close to major silverware in recent seasons, one that is seeking the final piece of their own puzzle. United are earlier in the process, betting on Sesko to develop into the superior player.",
      "His goal output might not be as immediately impressive as that of Gyokeres, but his 39 goals for RB Leipzig in all competitions over the past two seasons means that he has scored more than anyone else aged under 23 in Europe's five major leagues in that time.",
      "It puts him top of an illustrious list, although the presence of another name a little further down it is a reminder that, as former United coach Rene Meulensteen puts it, they are doing \"basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund\" with this signing.",
      "That is to say, United are spending big hoping to develop their own elite forward. Hojlund scored nine for Atalanta in Serie A prior to his arrival. Joshua Zirkzee managed 11 for Bologna before signing the following summer. For Sesko, it was 13 at Leipzig.",
      "That might temper the expectations a little. But speak to others and they will tell you that Sesko has better instincts. He is a player capable of finding space in the penalty box, someone who can get his shots away unusually quickly for a player of his size.",
      "He is not yet Alexander Isak and that is reflected in the price tag. But Isak was 22 years old, as Sesko is now, when he arrived in the Premier League after a season in which he scored six times in 32 games for Real Sociedad in LaLiga. That is the trajectory to target.",
      "Making it happen is the difficult part and it is now Amorim's job to help Sesko succeed where so many in a United shirt have struggled in recent years and fulfil his potential. Flanked by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, there is at least creativity around him.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are strong ball carriers who draw others towards them, creating space. \"It is going to be special,\" said Amorim of his two new wide forwards after the Fiorentina game. \"I think that they are maybe at 50, 60 per cent of what they can do.\"",
      "Another word of caution, though. There is some risk that the opposite is true. There were only three players in the Premier League who outperformed their expected goals by six or more last season. One was Chris Wood. The other two were Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Of the 10 previous players to have done that over the past eight years, only Heung-Min Son has scored more goals in the following season - and he dipped dramatically the year after. The vast majority of players have seen their goal output regress to the mean.",
      "One of the reasons cited for Liverpool's signing of Hugo Ekitike is that he actually underperformed his expected goals - they recognised the potential for his numbers to explode. United appear to have gone the opposite route, trying to sign elite finishers.",
      "Sesko could fall into that category having scored 27 Bundesliga goals over the past two seasons from chances with an expected-goals value of just 17.6. Could he be another Son, another Harry Kane, who consistently finishes better than the metrics suggest?",
      "If so, it could define United's season and with it Amorim's reign. There are other factors, of course. The balance in midfield is a concern and the wing-backs will be key. But it is this new forward line that will probably dictate how the rebuild is perceived.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have Premier League pedigree which will buy them some time. Rather unfairly, the referendum on young Sesko may come sooner than that. A swift impact against Arsenal, with Gyokeres among the opposition, would be most helpful."

      "Liverpool are leading the way as they aim to consolidate their Premier League title win but Chelsea are close to their total for money spent, with Arsenal, Manchester City, and Manchester United next on the list respectively, and Spurs not far behind them.",
      "There is particular intrigue around the Manchester clubs.",
      "City recorded their lowest points total under Pep Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term. United plumbed far greater depths as they finished 15th and also failed to win silverware.",
      "So, are they on track to bounce back and enjoy the success their fans crave in the new season? Or is the road to the top longer? Much will depend on whether they can master the art of the rebuild, a process Sir Alex Ferguson once said he believed could take up to four years.",
      "Pep Guardiola and Manchester City have of course been here before.",
      "How they would love a repeat of the successful rebuild overseen early in his tenure following his arrival from Bayern Munich, when City recovered from a difficult first campaign, like the one they have just had, to win the first of many titles in 2017/18.",
      "\"They are one of the exceptions to that four-year rule,\" says Neville.",
      "\"Jose Mourinho came into Chelsea and won their first league title in a long, long time in his first season, creating a kind of unity straight away. Pep Guardiola got a great side that won the title in the space of two years at Manchester City.\"",
      "Neville also mentions Arne Slot's achievement in winning the Premier League straight after succeeding the legendary Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. \"I would say it was a very different team than under Klopp, with different components and ingredients.\"",
      "What they all have in common, and something key to a successful rebuild in Neville's eyes, is that they inherited the right type of characters in the dressing room.",
      "\"You think of what Slot was handed last season: [Virgil] Van Dijk, Alisson, [Mohamed] Salah, [Andrew] Robertson, [Alexis] Mac Allister, Trent [Alexander-Arnold].",
      "\"They are five or six proven winners at the highest level and they have been around the block. They've got pride and ego and they are not going to sit there and use the fact there's a new manager coming in as an excuse not to perform well.",
      "\"Players can hide behind managers. But if you've got good characters and leaders, people who have standards in their personal lives, you're going to get a better outcome.",
      "\"Slot harnessed that. He did a good job with those leaders. But he is not the one in the dressing room. People may or may not know this, but managers might not go in the dressing room at the training ground even for one minute during the week.",
      "\"For all those hours, it is policed by the senior players.\"",
      "Heavy investment was of course vital to the success of those previous Chelsea and Manchester City's rebuilds. But both Mourinho and Guardiola also inherited senior players to build around.",
      "For Mourinho at Chelsea, it was John Terry and Frank Lampard. Guardiola could call on Fernandinho, Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva at City.",
      "Guardiola has some similar characters now in Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, among others. At United, though, Amorim inherited very different personnel to the dressing room Neville experienced there in his playing days.",
      "\"For us it was Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes, Steve Bruce. Then when me, [Paul] Scholesy and others got older, it was us. When we left, others took over,\" he explains.",
      "\"You're asking those players in the dressing room to set the standards, to make sure negativity doesn't creep in. The people who sap energy, close them off straight away. Don't let them drain you, the people who constantly whinge in a negative way\"",
      "Amorim is still in the process of overhauling his dressing room as he aims to reverse a years-long slide from their success under Ferguson. Manchester United have signed three new attackers in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko but are still struggling to shift numerous unwanted players.",
      "\"This is a really unique situation,\" says Neville. \"I said before that you don't get three or four years to build a team, but because of Manchester United's relentless poor form over two, three, four or five years, it will take quite a bit to unwind that.",
      "\"Amorim has got players he quite clearly doesn't want and doesn't like, players on huge money, some of whom have cost huge money. And even if you do get them out, some of their wages will probably have to be subsidised by the club.",
      "\"So, I think he has a minimum of a two-and-a-half-year build to get to the point he wants with his unique system and buying the players he wants to fit that, just because of what has gone on there previously, but he's going to have to demonstrate progress.",
      "\"The problem he has is that you've got a top five now who like they are getting into the Champions League and the penalty for not being in the Champions League is big now because all these clubs - United, Villa, Newcastle, Chelsea - are on the edge on PSR.",
      "\"It's big for them if they drop out of those Champions League places. So Amorim has got to be relatively successful, which means finishing in the top four or top five, all while building a new team and recruiting the players he wants.\"",
      "Circumstances matter too when it comes to rebuilding efficiently. Guardiola knows that well given the importance of expiring contracts to his first Manchester City overhaul. A long list of departures in 2017 gave him space to reshape his squad.",
      "The list of players who reached the ends of their deals after Guardiola's first season included Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna and Jesus Navas. This summer, by contrast, the only one feels like a significant loss in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Guardiola points out there was a significant loss back in 2017 too. \"In that moment, we made one big mistake which was to not keep Jesus Navas with us,\" he says.",
      "\"I think he would have helped us a lot for the next years because he was a player who could play as a full-back, as a full-back inside, as a right-winger. He was incredible.",
      "\"For the rest, the club decided they needed new, fresh energy, so that's why we rebuilt. They bought some unbelievable players like Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva; top-class players who helped us start to do what we have done.\"",
      "Manchester City are having to work harder to shift players this time around. Their signings so far this summer have left them with a squad of 33 as things stand.",
      "Their plight last season shows the importance of forward planning. Could City's drop-off have been avoided if they had acted sooner to refresh their personnel?",
      "\"It's bloody hard when you've got a team that's won the treble, and a group of players who have been so good,\" says Neville. \"But they do tend to grow a little bit old together.",
      "\"It's about how you change it and when you change it when you have been as successful as they have been. To do it after a treble is the most difficult time.\"",
      "Neville sees some parallels between the plight of City's treble-winning team and that of United's in 1998/99.",
      "\"It felt like we only signed one or two players in the two years after the treble. We won the league in those years but then we saw a sharp decline and we only won one of the next four.",
      "\"You get this euphoric moment winning a treble, where you've built an unbelievable team, but within a couple of years they grow a little bit old together and you've got a situation where you can fall off the edge of a cliff and end up having to make big changes.\"",
      "Neville describes Manchester City's current rebuild as Guardiola's \"toughest job\" in management. \"You get to the point where you think, 'will he win it next season, or will it take two or three years?'\" he says. But the man himself sees it differently.",
      "\"The most challenging summer was when I was chosen to be the manager of the second team at Barcelona and prove myself to the board,\" he says with a smile.",
      "\"Then the challenge was to take over the Barcelona first team and prove myself, and after that go to Germany after the legend Jupp Heynckes had won the treble, when my German language was a disaster, to convince the players to keep going and winning.",
      "\"Then it was arriving here and in the first press conference they said, 'the club have brought you here to win the Champions League', and I said, 'wait a minute, please!' After that I was 'Fraudiola' and it was a disaster in the seasons we didn't win it.\"",
      "Guardiola is eager to point out that he saw progress even in his fraught first season, when he was assisted by now Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City finished 15 points behind eventual Premier League champions Chelsea.",
      "\"In the first season we played really, really well in moments,\" he says. \"Always with Mikel we talk about that, that in that first season we started to build something. This season is not the most difficult one because we did it. We proved we could do it.\"",
      "Guardiola is encouraged by how his side finished last season too, even if it ended in the disappointment of a second consecutive FA Cup final loss at Wembley, this time to Crystal Palace.",
      "\"I didn't like the way we lost against Man Utd in the [previous] FA Cup final. I was grumpy. This season, I was sad because we played really, really well. They know it. They knew we were there, the spirit was there, the chances were there.",
      "\"We missed something we have to recover next season. That belongs to me, it belongs to the players, it belongs to all of us. And after that we will create a team which can compete game by game and start in a better position in the Premier League.\"",
      "Guardiola stresses that pain forms part of every rebuild.",
      "That was true even for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, who mastered the art during his historic Old Trafford tenure, creating a series of trophy-winning teams.",
      "\"Each transition came with a bit of turbulence,\" says Neville.",
      "\"We then lost the first game of the next season and Alan Hansen said you can't win anything with kids. So, it was a lot of pressure at that time, changing and transitioning, and that is something you have to manage in a rebuild.",
      "\"We didn't win the league for three years between 2003 and 2006. That's the longest I ever went in my career. That was a point where Mourinho was absolutely on his game and [Arsene] Wenger's football was sensational. They were brilliant teams.",
      "\"Our recruitment wasn't the best. It took a while for Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to come through, for Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra to settle in.",
      "\"That was the time where I thought, 'will we win the league again?' We did it in 2006 and that set us up for another five or six years of winning titles because that team was amazing. But the key was the foresight and bravery Sir Alex had to let players go.\"",
      "The principles behind that ruthlessness remain crucial in today's game. It is about lowering the age of the squad and striking a balance between youth and experience while ensuring there is room for long-term growth and development.",
      "\"I used to think of it as a conveyer belt,\" says Neville. \"We came in in '92, '93, '94. We were the young ones at the start of the conveyor belt and we had the older ones falling off. We eventually moved on to the end of the conveyor belt and fell off ourselves.",
      "\"I always thought you needed a group of players that were young, a group of players in their peak, and then a few, four or five, who were in their 30s and set the standards. I think that was the sort of age profile Sir Alex considered when building teams, but there was always some turbulence.\"",
      "As their respective rebuilds continue, Manchester United and City will hope the turbulence eases for them in the new campaign.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows is back in the Premier League predictions chair to provide his insight and best bets.",
      "Trimmed from 20/1 to 8/1 in the summer to win the Premier League, there is a chance Enzo Maresca just might be building something extremely exciting at Chelsea.",
      "And why should we be taking them seriously? Moises Caicedo and Cole Palmer - they are Chelsea's assassins and quite possibly the core of what could be a title-winning side.",
      "Since Caicedo has found rhythm in the Chelsea midfield, he has owned so many games, including the Club World Cup final against PSG. If Chelsea are going to suffocate opponents and dominate the ball in big games - which they will need to do to win a title - it all starts with Caicedo.",
      "And Palmer is the stardust. When the spotlight is on, when the stage is at it's highest, Palmer performs. He can go to Eden Hazard's levels of domination at Chelsea this season.",
      "This axis puts Chelsea in the title mix, no question. It's a four-way fight. And they can start with a home win.",
      "Nottingham Forest played some unsustainable football last season and it's very hard to see how they're going to improve on what they achieved.",
      "Top goalscorer Chris Wood converted 30 per cent of his overall attempts in the Premier League last term, while goalkeeper Matz Sels enjoyed the season of his life, boasting the best save percentage in the league. They can't be expected to keep those numbers up.",
      "And Forest return to Europe this season which is bound to influence the side's performance. If you exclude Conference League participants, non-big-six teams who qualify for Europe win around 14 points fewer in the campaign immediately following qualification.",
      "That isn't too relevant for this devilishly difficult fixture to analyse from a betting perspective, but something to note when the fixtures start to pile up. This clash looks one where the draw is a huge runner at 12/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is going to a very watchable fixture, steeped in Premier League narrative - but one where goals could be lacking.",
      "I'm firmly in the under 2.5 goals camp - and at the prices on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet I'm happy to endorse it as one of the best bets of the weekend.",
      "Arsenal are traditionally a very reliable team to back under goals away from home, albeit also a risky favourite to back in these spots.",
      "When assessing the last nine games where they've gone off 11/10 or bigger on the road, they have won just once and the average goals per game sits at just 1.89 per 90 with seven of those nine going under 2.5 goals.",
      "Additionally, seven of those games finished all-square while four of the five meetings between Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have also ended level.",
      "Lots of the focus and pre-match narrative will be about Leeds, but I'm excited to see what Everton can do this season.",
      "I think we need to start putting some serious respect on what David Moyes is doing in the Premier League - I for one haven't given him enough credit. Since taking over at West Ham, he has recorded a 37 per cent win ratio in the Premier League - that's higher than Sean Dyche, Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "And when Jarrad Branthwaite was fit last season (he started 28 games), Everton conceded just 28 goals in those matches - that's one goal per game, which would equate to being the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season.",
      "With Branthwaite tied down to a new deal and money to spend, Moyes just may have the tools to overachieve on expectations. I like their chances at Elland Road, too, as Moyes has an exceptional record against newly-promoted teams, recording a 67-per-cent win rate from the last 16 fixtures. The away win looks big at 19/10 with Sky Bet.",

      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",

      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",

      "Are Liverpool destined to retain the title? Could Manchester United really finish in the bottom half of the table again?",
      "Liverpool are out to retain their crown. The champions are the Premier League's biggest spenders in this summer's transfer window as they look to build on the success of last season under Arne Slot.",
      "But will they see off the competition? Runners-up Arsenal have also strengthened. Manchester City have undergone a rebuild. Could Club World Cup winners Chelsea roar into contention?",
      "Opta predict Liverpool will retain the Premier League title following last season's success under Arne Slot, with Arsenal coming second again, albeit by a much narrower margin than last term.",
      "Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa are third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, meaning Opta's predicted top six mirrors the final top six last season.",
      "Opta's supercomputer is far from convinced when it comes to Manchester United and Spurs. They are predicted to come 12th and 14th respectively, only three places higher than last term.",
      "FA Cup and Community Shield winners Crystal Palace are predicted to clinch a seventh-placed finish, with Brighton, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest complete the top 10.",
      "At the other end of the table, Opta expect the promoted teams to go straight back down for the third season running, with Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland finishing 18th, 19th and 20th respectively, a long way off 17th-placed Wolves for expected points.",
      "Spurs, now under the management of Thomas Frank, and beaten on penalties by Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final, are predicted to come eighth.",
      "Liverpool, again, come out on top over Arsenal as champions, with Manchester City in third. But, as in Opta's table, the top two are only separated by a slender expected points margin.",
      "A key difference at the bottom of the table is that newly-promoted Leeds are predicted to survive at the expense of Wolves.",
      "The two tables feature key similarities, most notably in the make-up of their predicted top fours. But there are huge differences too.",
      "Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton are also given considerably lower predicted finishes, contrary to Opta's optimism.",
      "So why the differences? Both supercomputers are based on averages from 10,000 simulations, using bookmaker odds, historical and recent team performances, and transfer spending.",
      "But the intricacies of the algorithms are different, placing weight on varying factors, which helps to explain some of the disparities seen between the two predicted tables.",
      "The summer transfer window is of course a key factor in predicting how teams will fare. A high spend does not guarantee success. Far from it. But it can be vital to a team's capacity to improve.",
      "Their total spend is already close to £300m following the arrival of Florian Wirtz for a record fee along with the signings of Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "They are not the only ones to have strengthened at considerable expense. The so-called Big Six have spent over £1bn between them this summer. And in fact, Liverpool's net spend is much lower than most of their rivals thanks to some big sales, including those of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester City have work to do to shift their unwanted players but their high net spends help to explain why they are predicted to push Liverpool closer this term.",
      "Manchester United have overhauled their attack, making a trio of high-profile additions in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. So why the 12th-placed prediction from Opta?",
      "They are of course coming from a far lower starting point than Liverpool, having finished 15th last term, but it might also have something to do with how they have so far allocated their funds.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have plenty to offer offensively to a side that finished last season as the Premier League's biggest underperformers relative to their expected goals. The lack of firepower and cutting edge needed to be addressed.",
      "But have they overlooked other areas of their squad? Manchester United have invested nearly twice as much in forwards as any other club have invested in any position this summer, but there has been no turnover in goal or in midfield, and only £7m spent on defenders.",
      "This looks problematic given their issues last season were not limited to their attack. Ruben Amorim's side were far from solid in midfield or defence. Only nine Premier League sides conceded more goals. Only eight allowed more expected goals against.",
      "And yet, despite those issues, Manchester United look set to start the new Premier League season with roughly the same personnel as last season in goal, in defence and in midfield.",
      "Both predicted tables have Enzo Maresca's side in fourth place, and with near-identical points totals too, ensuring Champions League qualification for a second successive season, but falling a long way short of a push for Premier League glory.",
      "Chelsea, like their Big Six rivals, have invested heavily in new recruits this summer. There is excitement around Estevao, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in particular. They also start the campaign with a relatively favourable run of fixtures.",
      "But they haven't finished higher than third since their last title triumph in 2016/17. Could a tough run-in, when they face all of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Tottenham in the final 11 fixtures, and the exertions of an epic 2024/25 campaign, also bite them?",
      "Spurs finished last season on a Europa League-winning high but a 17th-placed Premier League finish did for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Frank has arrived from Brentford as his successor and the club have so far added six new players, including Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, both of whom impressed in their UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Daniel Farke's side, who pipped Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference last season, are predicted to finish 17th, fractionally ahead of Wolves, who have lost key players this summer in Cunha to Manchester United and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester City.",
      "The West Midlands club have so far spent modestly this summer, their outlay totalling just £48.4m, which ensures a healthy profit from the £103.7m received in sales, but raises questions about the quality and depth available to head coach Vitor Pereira.",
      "We asked our journalists to come up with their predicted tables too.",
      "As an average, Liverpool came out as champions, with Manchester United and Spurs in sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley are tipped for the drop.",

      "The superstars of the Premier League are ready to roll - but on the eve of the new season, who are the best players right here, right now?",
      "We asked them to rank a long list of Premier League talent and then took their average responses and honed it down to a top 25. So who came out on top?",
      "Read on to see our top 25 Premier League players - and then join the debate yourself in our live blog, where we want you to list your favourite footballers and debate and discuss our selections!",
      "Arsenal's defence was the meanest in the Premier League last season and Gabriel gets the recognition from our journalists and reporters - no doubt also impressed by his repeated threat from set-pieces at the other end of the pitch.",
      "Where would Man Utd be without Bruno Fernandes? That was a recurring question last season. Amid all of his team's travails, the Portugal midfielder's quality remains respected.",
      "Another driving force of Arsenal's title prospects, Declan Rice is becoming the complete midfielder in the centre of the park for the Gunners. If the football world is increasingly being filled by specialists, the England man can seemingly do it all.",
      "Arsenal supporters will surely want to see Bukayo Saka further up this list and their Star Boy could well prove this coming season he deserves a promotion. The next step is to inspire his team to success with his individual brilliance.",
      "Liverpool's imperious captain is the top-ranked defender and there will be few arguments with that. The Dutchman continues to be a commanding presence in the Reds' backline.",
      "The transfer saga of the summer? Alexander Isak's future at Newcastle is uncertain but his quality isn't in doubt. There's a reason why the Sweden striker is in demand after a brilliant campaign in black and white.",
      "Man City badly missed Rodri through his injury absence last season. If anything it underlined his importance to Pep Guardiola's side even more. He continues to be considered among the best in the world - fingers crossed he can return to his former levels.",
      "We love a maverick and Chelsea's Cole Palmer is one of the Premier League's top entertainers. He delivers in the big moments too - whether that's a Euros final with England or when Chelsea are in major finals.",
      "When you score 22 Premier League goals but are deemed to have had a disappointing season, you know you're a decent striker. Erling Haaland's goal-getting prowess continues to demand respect.",
      "No surprises here. Liverpool's star man swept the awards last season after inspiring the Reds to Premier League glory with one of the best individual campaigns we've seen.",
      "Premier League player of the year Mohamed Salah has taken the crown with Liverpool's Egyptian King voted ahead of Man City's Erling Haaland and Chelsea's Cole Palmer.",
      "Florian Wirtz - Liverpool's big-money summer signing - was the highest-ranked import, while it was Arsenal who had the most players in the top 10, with Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice and Gabriel Magalhaes making the cut.",
