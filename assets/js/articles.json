      "Marcus Rashford’s start to life at Barcelona has been praised by former Manchester City star Sergio Aguero. The Manchester United forward joined the Spanish giants on a season-long loan in the summer.",
      "Barcelona have the option to make the move permanent at the end of the season. Rashford, 27, has since had a bright start to life with his adoptive employers with three goals and five assists in all competitions.",
      "Aguero, who spent a few months with Barcelona following his exit from the Etihad, said to Mundo Deportivo: “ Marcus Rashford ’s start at Barcelona is doubly admirable. He has started very well being useful to the team with assists and goals. He has had a very good adaptation.",
      "“Who is the one who plays as a starter or not will be decided by the manager, but it is clear that a team like Barcelona needs to have many options to be able to perform in the different competitions in which they participate.”",
      "Aguero’s assessment of Rashford’s early season form comes after the striker has spoken out himself. He recently suggested that the environment at Old Trafford contributed to his inconsistent form while a United player.",
      "He said: \"For sure, consistency is a massive part of it. I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time, so it is even more difficult to be consistent.",
      "\"But I completely agree, I think consistency is what I need to bring into my game, and I am looking to do that. I want to be at my best, not sometimes, but as often as possible.",
      "\"When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything, not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life and the way you train. We have just had so many changes so far in my career.",
      "\"But I have to look forward, and that is definitely one of the things I want to put right and improve on to be at my best more often. When I am at my best, I really enjoy everything about the sport.\"",
      "Former United star Wayne Rooney has hit back at that claim and suggested that the environment wasn’t actually at fault, instead it was down to Rashford to ensure his mindset was in the right place. Rashford will be aiming to extend his positive form for Barcelona this weekend as the Spanish side take on Girona.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have appealed to the Government for help to fund the club's project to build a new stadium. United have launched plans to build a new state-of-the-art stadium close to Old Trafford, that is expected to cost in the region of £2billion.",
      "The project is expected to create around 92,000 new jobs and regenerate the surrounding area. United are looking for funding to help cover the cost of building the new ground. But club bosses want the government to contribute towards creating the infrastructure around the stadium, including transport links.",
      "United chief operating officer Collette Roche believes creating a new stadium is a \"once in a lifetime opportunity”. She said: \"It's very early in the journey, but it's an amazing opportunity that we've got, not just for Manchester United, but for the region.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"Whilst we'll build a stadium that's great for our team, and for the club and our fans, it's so much more than that. It’s become a regional project and probably will be one of the biggest in Europe.",
      "\"As such, it's bigger than us at Manchester United. So, we needed to get support and work with a lot of stakeholders across Manchester and central government.",
      "“It's not just a Manchester United vision. It's a vision for the region. It's a vision for Trafford and it's a vision for Manchester, and that's why Andy Burnham (Manchester mayor), and Trafford Council, are really keen to work with us.",
      "\"There's no point building the best and biggest stadium in the UK, and it being on an island where you can't get to it because the transport links aren't there, or people can't come on a non-match day, or local businesses can't be part of.",
      "\"So our ask of the government is that they support, not the stadium build, but support the infrastructure and the regeneration of the area. And when we've looked at it really closely, it actually ticks so many boxes for the government around their growth strategy.",
      "\"So it's very easy for us to use this as a catalyst to help deliver the government plans.”",
      "It's estimated that the new ground, designed by architect Lord Foster, would cost around £2billion and take around five years to build - but there are challenges that the club have to overcome. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham, has previously said that no public money would be used to build the club's proposed new stadium.",
      "Ratcliffe had previously referenced the Government on the day United's plans were shared with the world, declaring: \"If the government really gets behind this scheme, we will build an iconic football stadium.\"",

      "It is pretty difficult to pick much of a combined Liverpool and Manchester United XI right now. But Alan Shearer’s choice caught my eye because there was only one United player in the line-up.",
      "And I disagree with Shearer because I can’t even be that generous. I can’t even get one into my combined XI. It’s hard to think of a time when Liverpool have been so more dominant, so further ahead and such big odds-on favourites to win one of English football’s classic matches.",
      "Luke Shaw was the only outlier who made Shearer’s line-up which surprised me in itself because I think the only ones even in the conversation are Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Shaw has clearly made Shearer’s XI because of Liverpool’s problems at full back and Milos Kerkez is taking time to settle in. But I’d still have Andy Robertson ahead of everyone else.",

      "Szoboszlai’s work rate, his quality - from both right back where he has filled in and midfield - and his mindset have been incredible. There was a new challenge in Florian Wirtz, so Szoboszlai just took up his own game a notch and responded.",
      "You could not leave him out of a Liverpool XI let alone a combined XI even with Fernandes.",
      "Right back has also been Liverpool’s problem position but I would still go Jeremie Frimpong. Ibrahima Konate has not been very solid this season but he’s still better than anything United have got and Virgil van Dijk is untouchable.",

      "And you know you are asking for trouble with this. Just watch United go and get a result now. It’s like tempting fate. I remember something with Arsenal-Spurs a few years back. Tottenham were such favourites that it was hard to justify an Arsenal player… then Arsenal upset the odds.",

      "Due to a lack of game time, the youngster requested a loan move in the summer, but it was turned down. Meanwhile, United have reportedly shown interest in Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton ahead of the New Year.",

      "The report claims that Wharton's potential arrival could persuade Mainoo to 'seek pastures new.'",

      "Two leading pundits are backing Liverpool to halt their run of defeats when they play Manchester United this Sunday. Arne Slot's side have suffered defeats in their previous two Premier League outings against Chelsea and Crystal Palace, whilst Galatasaray also got the better of them in the Champions League.",
      "Following three successive away fixtures across all competitions, they make their return to Anfield on Sunday, where they boast a perfect record from five matches this season. The standout moment from those triumphs was their 1-0 victory over Arsenal, courtesy of Dominik Szoboszlai's dramatic late free kick.",
      "United are still searching for their first away victory, having suffered defeats against Brentford and Manchester City, while drawing 1-1 with Fulham. They also suffered a penalty shootout defeat away to Grimsby Town in the League Cup second round.",
      "Paul Merson has heaped the pressure on Liverpool, insisting that \"this title race may even be over\" if they fail to overcome United. He told Sportskeeda: \"If Arsenal win on Saturday, this is a must-win game for them.",
      "\"I thought Liverpool fully deserved to get beaten by Crystal Palace and Galatasaray. They must get back on track now.",
      "\"All three Liverpool defeats have come away from home, and now they return to Anfield. We all know Liverpool are a different beast on home turf, and Manchester United haven't been great on their travels!\"",
      "Merson went on: \"I have a feeling [Alexander] Isak will start this game because of the transfer fee. You just can't leave him out when you pay that kind of money, can you? If you pay over £100 million for players, they have to be in the line-up for the big games, and this is one of them.\"",
      "Discussing Liverpool's £116m summer signing, Merson added: \"I also think Florian Wirtz is a decent option for this game. Manchester United are not strong in midfield, and I wouldn't be surprised if Slot deploys Wirtz in that No. 10 role. I believe Wirtz can cause problems for United, too.",
      "\"I don't think Liverpool will lose at home; they will snap out of this run. Manchester United will be lucky if they can walk away with something from Anfield,\" Merson concluded, predicting a 2-0 home win.",
      "Chris Sutton echoed those thoughts to the BBC, though he was slightly more hopeful about United's chances. \"This is a huge game for Arne Slot's side,\" he said.",
      "\"United can definitely hurt Liverpool on the break, and that is clearly the way they will set up at Anfield.\"",
      "Sutton added\" \"There are definitely reasons for Manchester United to be optimistic here.",
      "\"Liverpool have issues defensively, and their weakness at full-back might suit United's tactics. I can see Bryan Mbeumo causing Arne Slot's side all sorts of problems.",
      "\"My head is telling me that Ruben Amorim's side will get something at Anfield, but I don't want to go for a draw, even though that's what I think will happen.\"",
      "He concluded: \"It is not in my nature to sit on the fence for a big game like this,\" predicting a 2-1 win for Liverpool.",

While Everton may have moved into a state-of-the-art arena on the banks of the River Mersey, there's another club who's added just six extra seats this year and a side who have even cut back on fans.",

      "Eric Cantona has already made his thoughts on Sir Jim Ratcliffe crystal clear after being linked with a potential Manchester United takeover. The Red Devils icon has been mentioned amid fresh investment talk from the Middle East.",
      "Takeover rumours were sparked over the international break when Saudi sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for United. He was later forced to clarify that he was not the potential investor.",
      "talkSPORT has since reported that a UAE-based consortium has contacted several United legends about being part of a potential takeover. According to United Stand, Cantona has held direct talks over potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him back a prospective consortium.",
      "The Frenchman, who made 185 appearances for United between 1992 and 1997, would welcome a change of ownership at United, having been critical of both the Glazers and minority owner Ratcliffe, whose Ineos group took control of football operations in early 2024 after paying £1.25billion for a 27.7 per cent stake in the club.",
      "Speaking in April at an event at non-league FC United of Manchester, the club founded by unhappy United fans in the wake of the controversial takeover by the Glazers in 2005, Cantona gave a scathing assessment of Ratcliffe’s tenure.",
      "“Since Ratcliffe arrived this team of directors try to destroy everything and they don't respect anybody,” said Cantona, a co-owner of FC United.",
      "“I feel sad to see United in this kind of situation. They decided something else. They have another strategy, another project. I support United because I really love United, but now if I was a fan and I had to choose a club I don't think I would choose United.”",
      "United’s fortunes have not improved since Ratcliffe bought into the club, while mass staff cuts have been made off the pitch. Despite underwhelming performances under current head coach Ruben Amorim, Ratcliffe is determined to give the Portuguese time to turn things around.",
      "“He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be,” he told The Times’ The Business podcast earlier this month.",
      "“The press, sometimes I don’t understand. They want overnight success. They think it’s a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it’s all going to be roses tomorrow. You can’t run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches. He said: “The costs were just too high.",
      "“There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one’s ever given me a free lunch.”",

      "Crystal Palace are unfazed about the future of Adam Wharton despite rumoured transfer interest from Manchester United. The 21-year-old has been linked with a move to the Red Devils as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his midfield.",
      "Even though there have been no discussions regarding a new contract for the England international, Palace are planning for the future with him as a key part of their team. He still has four years remaining on his current deal at Selhurst Park.",
      "Wharton made the switch to Palace from Blackburn in a deal estimated to be around £18million plus add-ons in January 2024. He quickly became a fan favourite and was rewarded with a spot in the England squad at Euro 2024.",
      "Although his opportunities with England have been limited since Thomas Tuchel took over as the national team's head coach, Wharton has continued to shine and make a name for himself at Palace in the Premier League. As per the i paper, Amorim is believed to be a big fan of Wharton and United may now choose to prioritise him over signing Carlos Baleba, who was previously reported to be a summer target for the Red Devils.",
      "It's suggested that Baleba's inconsistent start to the season at Brighton has raised some eyebrows at Old Trafford. As Brighton are expected to demand more than £100m for Baleba, it's thought that Wharton may be available for less.",
      "Last weekend, Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish revealed his thoughts on Wharton's situation, stating that the club are ready to fight to keep him. \"Look, I think Adam at some point will want to play, either in the Champions League with us, if we could make that happen, or probably with another club,\" he said.",
      "\"He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "\"He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had, which a lot of young players get. This season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us. I think he's very committed to the club.",
      "\"I mean, if Manchester United want Adam Wharton, that's nothing surprising really. The fact of the matter is he's got a long contract to run. There's no pressure on us to do it and I don't think there's any real pressure from the player either.\"",

      "Alan Shearer claims Luke Shaw would be the ONLY Manchester United star to get into a combined Red Devils and Liverpool XI. The two fierce rivals come together on Sunday afternoon in what is turning into a huge game.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are in dire need of three points after their woeful start to the season, while Liverpool come into the clash off the back of three consecutive defeats. Despite that, many would still fancy the reigning Premier League champions at Anfield on Sunday.",
      "And it appears that Shearer agrees with that emphatically, having named his combined XI between the two sides, with just a solitary United star making the cut. Brazilian goalkeeper Alisson is named between the sticks and is joined in the side by Liverpool teammates Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Conor Bradley.",
      "Red Devils’ defender Luke Shaw is selected at left-back despite huge competition from Milos Kerkez and Andrew Robertson. The England man has started every game for United so far this season.",
      "It’s a similar theme in midfield, with Liverpool dominating. Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai have all been selected by Shearer.",
      "That means that United captain Bruno Fernandes has been left out entirely despite arguably having been the Red Devils' best player over the past few seasons. Shearer’s combined XI is also exclusively Liverpool when it comes to the team’s attack.",
      "Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah is of course named in the teamm despite his early season struggles. He is joined by Dutchman Cody Gakpo.",
      "The final inclusion in the side is Liverpool’s summer signing Hugo Ekitike after his electric start to life at Anfield. That will of course see United’s own summer additions Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all ruled out.",
      "It also means there is no place for £125million star Alexander Isak - perhaps not a huge surprise given his Newcastle allegiance.",
      "Speaking to Betfair about the game, Shearer said: “Liverpool v Man United is always big because of the size of both clubs and former players will always tell you that the fixture is huge and one they look out for which means so much to both sets of fans and players.",
      "Who will win between Liverpool and Man United? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "“Because of the situation and hype around both clubs for different reasons; Liverpool have lost three on the spin which no one saw coming and Man United being the way they are, there's no doubt there is extra spice to this game. It's a game that both teams have to go and win for different reasons.",
      "“International breaks are always tricky because as a manager and club, you want to sit and work or go on the training ground and work on what's gone wrong but it's difficult when you've got so many international players away. It would've been a tricky two weeks for Slot and Amorim.",
      "“We don't know who will come back fit, who will come back at a certain time, are they going to come back on Thursday or Friday? That's always tough. If Slot has a full squad to pick from then it wouldn't surprise me if he went back again to what worked for him again last season, particularly in such a volatile fixture.”",

      "“I see him train, I see him play and he’s amazing. Not only do I think about it, we have talked about it with some teammates.",

      "He added: “From the squad, I look at Frenkie, Pedri or Olmo. They have a lot of quality and I try to apply what they do, even if it’s a little. From the outside, I look at those in my position, like Rodri or Zubimendi, for example, who are in the national team.”",
      "While United are long-term admirers of De Jong, he has recently committed his future to Barcelona after penning a new deal with the club until 2029.",

      "De Jong joined Barcelona in 2019 from Dutch side Ajax. He has gone on to make 267 appearances for the Spanish giants since then, winning two league titles and two Spanish cups.",

      "But his nod to a certain Sir Alex Ferguson, and how long it took him to find his feet as United manager, is also a reminder of where the club expects itself to be. The comparisons with Fergie, both good and bad, will forever haunt whoever happens to be walking in the great man's shoes.",
      "Amorim isn't stupid. He knows that three defeats in their next three would leave Ratcliffe ignoring those comments and looking for another new manager. Thus, Amorim must ignore those comments too.",
      "Amorim has been a bust so far, unable to win successive league matches, winning just 10 league games in 34 outings.",
      "He needs an improvement on those numbers, and quickly. Winning at Anfield would be the perfect place to start.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Andy Dunn is the Mirror's chief sports writer.",
      "During the international break, there has been quite a bit of news coming out of Manchester United. Well, out of Manchester United PLC, to be precise.",
      "Some casual speculation about a possible takeover and some relatively positive news about land needed for a new 100,000-seater stadium have meant the stock market value of the club has soared. Before trading opened in New York on Thursday, United’s share price was $18.24. On the previous Thursday, it was as low as $15.40.",
      "As there are 172 million shares in United, that means an increase in overall value of around half a billion dollars in a single week. As they are the main shareholders, that is great news for the Glazers and for Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Monaco Jim owns roughly 29 percent of United while the Glazers, over in Florida, own 49 percent. Some rudimentary maths tells you that, in that particular week-long stock market spell, the value of Ratcliffe’s stake went up by $145million (£108m) and the value of the Glazers’ stake went up by $245million (£182m).",
      "And United did not play a single match in that time. No wonder Ratcliffe and the Glazers do not appear overly concerned about Ruben Amorim winning only 20 of his first 50 matches with United. Why should they be concerned?",
      "Progress with a state-of-the-art complex which has the backing of local government, plus ever-increasing commercial strength, plus continuing takeover interest, adds up to more dollars on the club’s value. And that is the most prized target for the Glazers and Ratcliffe.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "I actually believe Amorim should indeed be given more time. But most owners would not be as patient as the Glazers and Ratcliffe appear to be. Most owners, though, probably don’t have the luxury of owning a club whose relative under-achievement on the field does not stop it being a commercial phenomenon.",
      "And that luxury is what allows Ratcliffe to suggest Amorim might get three years to prove his worth. And that luxury is what pretty much gives Amorim a free hit against Liverpool.",
      "Look, an absolute shellacking at Anfield will not do Amorim any favours but a bog-standard defeat at the hands of the Premier League champions will have no bearing on his United future. For United fans, there is no such thing as a free hit at Anfield but Amorim was beaten by Grimsby Town in Cleethorpes earlier this season and survived, so he will be ok with a loss at mighty Liverpool.",
      "And that creates a strange dynamic going into the match. It feels like Arne Slot - after three defeats on the bounce - needs the win more than Amorim needs the win. It feels like Slot is under more pressure than Amorim is under.",
      "Absolutely not in the sense that questions would be asked of Slot’s position, of course not - that would be utterly ludicrous, utterly bizarre, utterly laughable - but in the sense Amorim will want to prove he can respond to a tricky run. He will want to prove the summer’s big signings can be integrated quickly.",
      "He will want to prove he can get Mohamed Salah back to his best form. He will want to prove he can fix Liverpool’s defensive issues.",
      "Almost from day one, Slot - when not in the technical area - has been super-cool. But he has shown signs of mild irritation, most notably when claiming “pundits that favour some other clubs … cannot stop talking about £450million.”",
      "That is the amount of money Liverpool spent in the summer, with Slot claiming these pundits “forget about £300million we sold for.” Well, they probably don’t forget, they just know it does not matter.",
      "Never mind who Liverpool have sold for what, the club broke the British transfer record TWICE in one window. Just because you somehow managed to pocket over £50million for Darwin Nunez does not dilute the significance of the gargantuan spend.",
      "Quite simply, expectations on Slot after a truly brilliant first season and marquee recruitment are sky-high. Expectations on Amorim, from the moneymen, are limited. That is why, going into this most fierce of fixtures, it almost feels as though Slot is the one feeling the heat, not Amorim.",

      "Liverpool are set to host Manchester United at Anfield this Sunday, hoping to extend their impressive nine-year unbeaten streak at home against their arch-rivals. Over the last 10 encounters on Merseyside, the Reds have claimed five victories and drawn five times, with the most memorable clash being their 7-0 demolition of the Red Devils in March 2023.",
      "The last time United tasted victory at Anfield was way back in January 2016. Wayne Rooney netted a late winner as Jurgen Klopp took charge in the fixture for the first time, having assumed the role of Liverpool manager just months prior in October.",
      "Following Liverpool's recent three-game losing streak, United will be keen to capitalise and break their dry spell. However, one of their ex-players has his own upcoming battle with Liverpool to anticipate later in the season.",
      "Angel Gomes, who moved to Marseille on a free transfer from Lille last summer, is gearing up to go head-to-head with the Reds in the Champions League in January. Arne Slot's team journey to the south of France for their penultimate league phase match.",
      "The England international has already made seven appearances for the French side, netting one goal, with three of those games taking place at Stade Velodrome. Having also played there twice as a Lille player, Gomes has experienced enough to rank it among the top three stadiums in Europe.",
      "\"When you play in the Champions League and you get good results, everyone sees it,\" he told Le Phoccen. \"Here, it's really special. The connection between the fans, the players, the club.",
      "\"In England, of course, we breathe football. But in Marseille, it's something unique. And to understand that, you have to come here, go to the Velodrome, see it, feel the atmosphere.",
      "\"Only there do you understand what Marseille is, especially if you compare it with England. Personally, I think the Velodrome is one of the best stadiums in Europe, in the top three.\"",
      "When pressed further, he confessed he regards it as superior to grounds like Anfield and St. James' Park. \"Personally, yes, (it's a better atmosphere than Anfield and St. James' Park),\" he said.",
      "\"I've played in those stadiums, but the Velodrome... you have to be there to understand.\" Admittedly, Gomes has every right to his view. And as a fresh arrival at Marseille, he'll naturally want to impress both on the pitch and beyond.",
      "Nobody can question just how spectacular the Velodrome truly is. However, there's a significant problem with Gomes' assertion.",
      "He's never actually featured at either Anfield or St. James' Park. His nearest opportunity to play at Liverpool came last season in the Champions League whilst with Lille, yet he remained on the bench as an unused substitute in January.",
      "Similarly, an unused substitute appearance at Newcastle with Manchester United in October 2019 represents the extent of his involvement at St. James' Park. Despite making 10 appearances for the Red Devils, only three of these were starts - all in the Europa League",
      "Eight of his matches were against English teams, with six games at Old Trafford, one at West Ham's London Stadium and one at Yeovil Town's Huish Park.",
      "Additionally, he made a brief appearance as a substitute for Lille in a Europa League match against Aston Villa in April 2024. He also represented England twice at Wembley in the Nations League, playing against Finland and the Republic of Ireland.",
      "This sums up his experience in senior football at English stadiums. While it's often said that you have to be at the Velodrome 'to understand', the same could be said about Anfield and many other English football stadiums that Gomes has yet to play at.",

      "Both Liverpool and Manchester United are yet to hit their stride this season, which makes their meeting this weekend all the more intriguing. Despite winning their first five games, Liverpool have hit a block in the road and have lost three consecutive games in all competitions.",
      "Ex-United defender Paul Parker believes that Amorim has a personal issue with midfielder Kobbie Mainoo. The young star has played very little so far this season, despite receiving praise in recent years for his impressive skillset and ability to comfortably operate at the highest level.",
      "Erik ten Hag was a big fan of Mainoo and gave him his break, which led to him being selected for England at Euro 2024. However, he has not been fancied by Amorim at all, and his minutes have deteriorated massively. Speaking to MyBettingSites, Parker said: \"We also have to ask why Mainoo hasn't been used in that midfield.",
      "\"Somewhere along the line because I've been looking at it, it has to be personal. It has to be personal and the truth has to be told somewhere. He doesn't like him or he doesn't like him as a player. It doesn't make any sense at all.\"",
      "Mainoo has been the subject of transfer talk, having been interested in a loan deal during the summer to play in the World Cup next year. Parker touched on this: \"It would cause big problems if they allow Mainoo to go because he's a local boy. But it's not just about that. It's about what he's achieved in a short space of time, and he hasn't been given the time and the respect.\"",
      "Midfield icon Casemiro is expected to leave when his contract expires at the end of the current season, and Mainoo could be heading for the exit door too, so United will be in the market for midfielders next summer.",
      "Three names are reportedly in the mix for the Red Devils. Adam Wharton has been widely discussed as a potential addition to the squad, having impressed for Crystal Palace recently.",
      "Another is Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, who is also reportedly being pursued by rivals Manchester City, but United could look to swoop in for him in 2026. Anderson earned his debut for England in early September and impressed under Thomas Tuchel on his maiden outing.",
      "The third option is Brighton's Carlos Baleba, who United were targeting last summer; however, the Seagulls' £100m-plus valuation of the rising star was simply too much. Despite this, it seems as if United will be dipping back into negotiations with Brighton in the new year.",
      "Renowned journalist Fabrizio Romano told his audience that Baleba is a target for United, despite missing out on him last summer. He added that Baleba wanted the move but didn't want to force it, showing respect to his current club. Romano also mentioned that Brighton do not want to sell and it would be very unlikely that a deal is done in January, unless there was a significant proposal or a transfer request was handed in.",

      "Zirkzee was signed just over a year ago from Bologna but has struggled to make an impact. His lowest point saw his own fans cheer his withdrawal before half-time during a loss to Newcastle last December. He's scored 14 times in 58 outings but has slipped down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Roma are now weighing up a loan move for the 24-year-old and decision makers at Old Trafford will consider letting Zirkzee move on in the new year having spent more than £200million on new attacking talent back in the summer.",
      "The Times reports that Como are also tracking the Dutchman, who made his name in Italy, which convinced the Manchester outfit to spend £36.5million on the forward. He scored on his debut but has been able to establish himself since.",
      "Roma are second in Serie A, level on points with the leaders Napoli after six games, but have scored only seven goals in six games and their Ukrainian frontman Artem Dovbyk has scored just once - prompting their desire to add more firepower.",
      "Zirkzee may also see Hojlund's move as inspiration with the Dane, who also struggled in Manchester, deciding to move back to Italy in the summer by joining Napoli on loan. He didn't take long to find the net and has scored four times in six outings this term, looking far more confident.",
      "The Dutchman played for his country at Euro 2024, but is in danger of being overlooked for a potential place at next summer’s World Cup unless he can find himself some regular first-team football with boss Ronald Koeman looking at other options during qualifying.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was bought in from RB Leipzig and is the man now leading the line in Manchester - aided by two more recruits in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. That has limited Zirkzee to just four substitute appearances, adding up to a minimal 82 minutes.",
      "Seeing how Hojlund has rediscovered his goalscoring form since moving to Italy won't have gone unnoticed by Zirkzee. A move to Roma would also see the Dutchman play on the European stage with the capital outfit in the Europa League. They have two fixtures to come in Glasgow against both Celtic and Rangers.",

      "Sometimes things change really fast but when you see the history of both clubs, you can see one club can have bad runs. We can win any game, if we think about winning the next game, we can win the game. If we are to be the same level as Liverpool in the future, I am not sure who long it will take",

Sometimes the pressure I put on myself and the team is often so much bigger than them. I know it is going to take a while but I don't want to think like that, I said that last year. It is really good to hear that, I think it helps our fans understand that the leadership knows it will take a while but, at the same moment, I don't like that because it will give a feeling like we have time to work things out so I don't want that feeling here in our club. It is good to feel the support but we need to show people, at a big club, we are ready to win games.",

Whilst we'll build a stadium that's great for our team and for the club and our fans, it's so much more than that. We worked really closely with the local authority and thought this would be a fantastic opportunity to create a once in a lifetime project that would build, in effect, a big sports and entertainment district that will then join to Manchester.",

United had a better start than table is showing, so very interesting game, especially as it's at Anfield. The fans have always been supportive.

      "The club are optimistic of reaching an agreement to purchase the land in the next few months, while conversations are ongoing over the wider regeneration project and its benefits.",
      "A study by Oxford Economics found that the project could add £7.3billion annually to the United Kingdom's economy and create 92,000 jobs. The study predicted that the development has the potential to lead to 17,000 new homes and 1.8m additional visitors each year.",
      "Collette Roche, the chief operating officer at United, recently sat down for an interview with the We Built This City podcast and described the project as a “once in a lifetime opportunity\".",

      "“It's not just a Manchester United vision. It's a vision for the region. It's a vision for Trafford and it's a vision for Manchester, and that's why [Mayor] Andy Burnham and Trafford Council are really keen to work with us.",
      "“There's no point building the best and biggest stadium in the UK and it being on an island where you can't get to it because the transport links aren't there, or people can't come on a non-match day, or local businesses can't be part of.",
      "“So our ask of the government is that they support, not the stadium build, but support the infrastructure and the regeneration of the area.",

      "Foster + Partners have been selected to design the new Old Trafford and the stadium district, but the architectural firm is waiting in the wings until the land is acquired from Freightliner.",
      "United said: \"Early design work has been intentionally paused until we have greater clarity on land assembly and fan requirements. As with other aspects of the project, we encourage fans to treat speculative media reports with caution.",
      "\"We remain excited by the vision set out by Foster + Partners for a new stadium at the heart of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area.",
      "\"We always said this was a conceptual design, with more detailed architectural work to follow. While we remain keen to advance as quickly as possible, the timetable is subject to progress on land assembly and financing, which depends on key stakeholders working together.\"",

      "The second international break of the season is now over and with that focus is returning to domestic football. Ruben Amorim's side do not play until Sunday afternoon when they face historic rivals Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "While matters on the pitch will be the priority, there have been plenty of takeover and transfer updates in the background. Eric Cantona has been namechecked in a potentially huge takeover update while Sheikh Jassim is back in the headlines.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has also delivered some updates on what the potential future of the club could look like. As for transfers, Brighton's Carlos Baleba continues to be linked after United's failed attempt to sign him this past summer.",
      "We will have all the latest on that, top transfer headlines and injury news as the Reds' return to action with a clash against Liverpool this weekend edges closer...",
      "He tells me all the time, sometimes with a message after the games but you know, I know and Jim knows that football is not like that. The most important thing is the next game. You cannot control the next day in football so I know that but it is really good to hear that also because of the noise. Omar and Jason tell me that all the time.",
      "Not long now until we hear from Ruben Amorim for the first time since the international break.",
      "The United boss will provide the latest team news ahead of Liverpool, Noussair Mazraoui, Matheus Cunha and the latest takeover news.",
      "Click here to join Jack Flintham from Carrington...",
      "With domestic football returning, transfer news still swirling and takeover rumours doing the rounds, it has been a very busy Friday for all things Manchester United....",

      "Manchester United are exploring ways to adjust the Old Trafford pitch after the issue was raised during a recent fans' forum.",
      "The Old Trafford pitch last underwent major improvements in the 1990s, and was elevated and bordered by a ditch. However, this has contributed to injuries over the years.",
      "According to The Sun, the club will look at changing the 'perimeter' of the pitch, to reduce the risk of injuries. During a United fans' forum held last week, a supporter highlighted that many injuries across the Premier League have been caused by players striking advertising hoardings at speed.",
      "During the meeting, a question was raised about whether the club would 'invest in transparent and soft materials to cover them,' to which a United spokesperson responded: \"The health and welfare of all players is of paramount importance.",
      "\"We will look into this risk and take appropriate action.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney has provided a prediction for Manchester United's Premier League clash against Liverpool, when speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "Just with Liverpool losing three games, I think that pride kicks in and the fans will know, the fans are not stupid, they know and will get behind the team and push them.",
      "So for United, I think going there, if United come away with a point, I think that would be huge.",
      "I think the pressure for this game, I think purely because I don’t think United fans will be expecting three points in this game, where in other games they are.",
      "I think they’ll go in a say, if we can get a point we’ll be happy with that, where I think for Liverpool, if Liverpool lose four games in a row and they lose to Man United at Anfield, I think the pressure is definitely on Liverpool for this game.",
      "I think when you bring so many new players in, they’ve all probably got a bit of an ego in their own way, all wanting to do well and find that chemistry with each other.",
      "I think that hasn’t quite hit off yet, even though they won the first five games, I think the last three games has shown everyone and exposed those first five games. I think it’s a good reset time for Liverpool with where they are at the minute.",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot has delivered injury updates on X players before his side face Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday. The champions will be looking to put three consecutive defeats before the international break firmly in the rear-view mirror against their bitter rivals at Anfield.",
      "Missing key players will not help their chances with injury concerns over Ibrahima Konate, Ryan Gravenberch and Alisson. Speaking at the AXA Training Centre on Friday morning, he said: \"Ryan is compleyely fit, still has to train but fit, we are in a good place with the Dutch side.",
      "\"Ibou has come to back to us and is expected to train today. Alisson is not training so he is out. How long out? Difficult to say as the end phase of rehab always gives you positives and negatives but not the weekend or next week.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is reportedly working to convince international team-mate Carlos Baleba to also sign for Manchester United.",
      "Interest in acquiring his services from Brighton was made clear and though a deal did not materialise, links have remained with a potential advantage now being used.",
      "According to the Sun, the United forward is trying to persuade the midfielder to join him at Old Trafford.",
      "Both players have been on international duty with Cameroon over the past two weeks, providing Mbeumo with the perfect opportunity to speak with Baleba. The report claims that the United man has become like a 'big brother' to the 21-year-old.",
      "Ruben Amorim will not be discussing a potential Manchester United takeover, but he will be able to provide injury updates and general verdicts today.",
      "United return to Premier League action against Liverpool on Sunday with Amorim's pre-match press conference set to get underway at 12:45pm later this afternoon.",
      "Lisandro Martinez looks to be the only confirmed absentee, though Amorim could confirm some fresh blows, but it will more than likely be just positive updates which includes the former.",
      "While Sheikh Jassim may not be interested in Manchester United, taking over a different Premier League club cannot be entirely ruled out.",
      "There have been plenty of links to Tottenham Hotspur with the surprise exit of Daniel Levy fuelling rumours the Lewis family wanted out. However, the message from their new leadership team which involves Vinai Venkatesham and Peter Charrington is that the club is not for sale.",
      "The former has further reinforced that stance when giving a verdict after Fabio Paratici's return to the club was officially confirmed.",
      "“It’s quite simple - the ambition of the Lewis Family is really, really clear,\" he said in an interview.",
      "“They want us to be focused on driving success on the pitch, they want more nights like the night we had in Bilbao.",
      "“We think that putting this structure in place gives us the best chance, over the long-term, to deliver that success.”",
      "Sheikh Jassim has been a name constantly associated with a potential takeover of Manchester United.",
      "He and Sir Jim Ratcliffe were the main investors competing for a minority stake before the latter secured his shares last February. Amid rumours of a UAE-based consortium considering a bid to buy the club, a move from Jassim would have been the expectation.",
      "However, that is certainly not the case with it made clear by Jacobs that he is categorically not back at the table.",
      "Manchester United takeover talk has been sparked into life again following a huge update that involves Eric Cantona.",
      "As revealed by Ben Jacobs, via United Stand, the United icon has held direct talks over being an ambassador that would see him back a prospective consortium in a bid for United.",
      "It had already been noted that other former players have also been contacted, but it would not be with a view to invest. Cantona is the first name of interest to officially be revealed.",
      "Hello and welcome back to MEN Sport's Manchester United live blog covering all the latest news, rumours and updates from Old Trafford.",
      "A potential takeover at United has become the dominant trend over the last few weeks with new updates emerging on Eric Cantona potentially getting involved while Sheikh Jassim's stance has also been made clear.",

      "Ruben Amorim did not enjoy his first visit to Anfield in 2010. Amorim started for Benfica against Liverpool in a Europa League semi-final and his side crashed out of the competition after a 4-1 thumping.",
      "Amorim feared another shellacking when he made his first trip to Anfield as manager of Manchester United in January, as United had just been defeated by Newcastle at home.",
      "That defeat meant Amorim had lost six of his 11 games since replacing Erik ten Hag. United were languishing in 14th place and Liverpool were five points clear at the summit, but the game did not unfold as everyone predicted: United delivered arguably the best performance of Amorim's tenure at that time.",
      "Lisandro Martinez gave United the lead before Liverpool came from behind to lead 2-1, but Amad's late strike handed United a point. \"I think we could have won,\" said a bullish Amorim during his press conference.",
      "Arne Slot's side sauntered to the Premier League title a few months later while United recorded a 15th-placed finish.",
      "The gap between Liverpool and United is just five points this season, and Amorim is hoping to become the first United manager since Louis van Gaal to oversee a victory at Anfield.",
      "Although the bookmakers have made Liverpool heavy favourites to win in their own backyard, they are licking their wounds after defeats to Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "There was also a sense that Liverpool had been fortunate in securing late wins against Bournemouth, Newcastle and Burnley. They hadn't performed well and were bailed out by late goals.",
      "This weekend's game should be closer than the odds suggest. United have made a poor start to the season, but they got back on track against Sunderland and Amorim should have learned plenty.",
      "Senne Lammens made his debut against the Black Cats and instilled a calmness throughout the team that Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have struggled to provide. Lammens was supremely confident, he commanded his area aggressively and made an important save in the final minutes to seal a 2-0 win.",
      "Speaking before Sunderland, Amorim explained Lammens was starting due to \"rotation\", but it would be a huge mistake to revert to Bayindir against Liverpool after his strong debut.",
      "United have a clear opportunity to upset the odds at Anfield, however, Amorim must get his selection right to make it impossible. The chances of securing a win will decrease if Lammens is named on the bench.",
      "There are other big calls to be made when selecting the best starting XI for the game, including who starts at wing-back and whether Mason Mount should retain his starting role.",
      "Amad started at right wing-back against Sunderland, with Diogo Dalot on the opposite side, but does it make sense to start Amad in that position when Liverpool could target his defensive vulnerabilities? Amorim may feel that starting Dalot and Patrick Dorgu in those roles is a better choice.",
      "Mount was excellent against Sunderland, opening the scoring brilliantly within eight minutes, and his work rate out of possession will likely be enough to sway Amorim into starting him again.",
      "Matheus Cunha hasn't done a lot wrong since joining from Wolves and it shouldn't be a big deal if he's on the bench - it would merely be a decision from Amorim to pick the team with the best chance of winning.",
      "The approach itself - the tactics the players will try to execute - will also be crucial on Sunday afternoon, with the Sunderland victory offering a blueprint for success against Liverpool.",
      "United were direct against Sunderland and Lammens was instructed to send his goal-kicks long to Benjamin Sesko practically every time, while Dalot's long-throw-ins were also effective.",
      "It's not the prettiest style of football, but it worked and Amorim should use the exact same approach against Liverpool, who do not like it when opponents refuse to play into their hands.",
      "\"I'm not too sure if I saw a football match. It was set-piece after set-piece, long throws,\" said Slot after facing Newcastle, the Liverpool manager clearly not a fan of his side being dragged into a battle.",
      "Amorim has regularly discussed the need for his players to be \"aggressive\" this season. The team selection and direct approach will be the key to securing a shock result at Anfield.",

Despite their poor recent record at Anfield, United have enjoyed better displays there since the 7-0 debacle which plagued Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.",

And according to former United star Danny Simpson, history could repeat itself at the club if the striker doesn't receive the right support.",
      "Speaking exclusively to the MEN via MightyTips about United's business this summer, Simpson said: \"I think, right, if we are going to play 3-4-3, which we're doing, and not 4-3-3, which now would suit [Bryan] Mbeumo, Bruno [Fernandes] and [Matheus] Cunha and Sesko - to be honest with you, I think it would - why didn't we buy a centre-mid?",
      "\"You know, let's not pick one of the two, Mbeumo and Cunha. But did we need them both? And you could have had Bruno and one of them and a centre-mid, so Bruno's not playing deep.",
      "\"So, yes, in terms of that, were they trying to get a centre-mid? Maybe they did and he didn't get it over the line - the lad from Brighton [Carlos Baleba], but it was a lot of money. Listen, they brought great players in, but in terms of what we actually need, it's not working right now.",
      "\"Obviously, we prefer Bruno higher. Sesko, I think he will come good, but I just think he also...It would help him to have an experienced striker with him, similar to what's happened with [Rasmus] Hojlund.",
      "“We don't want that to happen again, where it just becomes a point where it's like, so young, it's such a burden, that shirt up front on your own, you've got no help, and before you know it, it's too much.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived at Old Trafford in a £72m move from Atalanta in 2023, but failed to live up to his price tag in the years that followed. The 22-year-old managed just four Premier League goals last term from 32 games last season, as the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko were brought in this summer to give United an attacking edge.",
      "As a result of inconsistency in the north west, Hojlund joined Napoli on a season-long loan this summer, with the Serie A giants holding a £38m obligation to buy the player next year, based on certain requirements being met.",
      "While he is thriving with his new club - with two goals from four games to his name - some fans believe that the issue with his time at United was not having the support of a senior striker to show him the ropes as he continued to develop.",
      "Meanwhile, over in Naples, Hojlund has the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Lorenzo Lucca to impart their wisdom on him both on and off the pitch. It comes as Amorim will hope for more consistency from Sesko when the club return to Premier League action this weekend.",
      "The Reds are currently gearing up to face Arne Slot's Liverpool on Sunday, October 19 at Anfield in the first Northwest derby of the season.",
      "While United won their last top flight clash ahead of the international break with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland, Liverpool are currently suffering a three-game losing streak thanks to losses at the hands of Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United icon Eric Cantona has already revealed his honest thoughts on the Glazer family and their management of the football club.",
      "The Old Trafford favourite has been linked with a potential takeover at United amid fresh investment talk from the Middle East.",
      "During the international break, takeover rumours sparked when Saudi sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for the club.",
      "After clarifying that he was not the potential investor, it has since been reported that a UAE-based consortium has contacted several United legends about being part of a possible takeover. Cantona has been mentioned as one of the individuals included, potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him support a prospective consortium.",
      "The Frenchman has been critical of both the Glazers and minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe in recent weeks. Back in April, Cantona made a drastic move that spoke volumes about his stance on the current state of affairs at United.",
      "Alongside members of his family, Cantona became the latest co-owner of FC United of Manchester.",
      "The manifesto on the club's website states that they hope to \"create a football club which addresses the concerns which many Manchester United fans have had over the 17 years or more with how the club and football have developed, culminating in the club's takeover by Malcolm Glazer\".",
      "The Northern Premier League club was established in 2005 and is fully owned by its supporters on a \"one member, one vote\" basis, with members voting on all major decisions, such as ticket prices and the design of playing shirts.",
      "\"We're delighted to welcome Eric and his family as our latest co-owners, joining over 2,000 other FC United fans who believe there's a better way for football - where clubs are runs with the interests of supporters and local communities at the heart of everything they do,\" a club spokesman said.",
      "\"Eric said he joined us because we're a club that does things differently - driven by fairness, inclusivity, and a commitment to putting people before profit. While our history is short, it's something we're already incredibly proud of - built by fans, for fans.\"",

      "According to The Sun, the club will look at changing the 'perimeter' of the pitch, to reduce the risk of injuries. During a United fans' forum held last week, a supporter highlighted that many injuries across the Premier League have been caused by players striking advertising hoardings at speed.",

      "The 33-year-old, who hung up his boots last year, has set his sights on securing a top position in the future but acknowledges he must still prove himself worthy.",
      "Jones is presently pursuing his UEFA Pro Licence and has been involved with United's academy players at Carrington during recent campaigns as he transitions from an injury-riddled playing career.",
      "The former Blackburn talent recognises there's considerable groundwork ahead before landing his inaugural managerial role.",
      "\"I don't think there's a right or wrong way,\" Jones told BetMGM. \"People say to me go and take an Under 18s, some say go and be an assistant somewhere.",
      "\"Do I think I'm ready to become a manager? No. I'm not naive and daft enough to think I'm just going to walk into a job. It doesn't work like that. I have to earn the right with steps and progression.",
      "\"But do I think I could add value into a team now? Yeah. I played under a lot of good managers and with good players, I've taken a lot of things from various parts of the game on and off the pitch. That's the goal. That's where I want to be. Let's see.\"",
      "Jones has been content to develop his skills within United's youth system and didn't wish to rush into securing a senior position elsewhere before he felt prepared. And he reckons he has gained from that approach.",
      "\"I didn't want to just come out of the game and say, 'I'll take that manager's job',\" he said. \"I wanted to go about it the right way. Just because I played at United for 13 years, you can't expect to get the biggest jobs.",
      "\"I was on the grass with the kids coaching, and you come away from a session thinking, 'How can I adapt, how can I change it, how can I make it better?'",
      "\"You start thinking about the game more. I don't just watch a game of football now, you're engrossed in patterns of play and systems and how they set up tactically in and out of possession.\"",
      "Looking back on his former club's management situation, Jones is encouraged by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's support of Ruben Amorim. Nevertheless, the coach reckons it will mean nothing if the Portuguese manager fails to deliver results.",
      "Jones reckons Sunday's clash with Liverpool could prove pivotal in determining the direction of United's campaign. The former Old Trafford favourite would be delighted to see Amorim claim silverware.",
      "\"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job? No, especially with the route I want go down now,\" he said. \"You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it's a results business. If you don't get results, I don't care what length of contract you're on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",
      "\"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I've seen from United this season in every department. But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don't win there, you've got Brighton coming up and that's not an easy game the way they're playing at the minute.",
      "\"If you get a draw against Liverpool and then go and beat Brighton at home, you've gathered a bit of momentum and can they really kick on and use it as a catalyst to do something? How many times have we said that over the last six years? Would I like to see Amorim succeed, do really well in the back end of this season and maybe win a trophy? Of course. I'd love nothing more.\"",

      "The Red Devils appointed Amorim as Erik ten Hag's replacement last November, but as he approaches his first year in charge, he's secured victory in fewer than a third of his Premier League matches and oversaw United's poorest-ever campaign last season.",
      "This term, despite over £200million being invested in their attacking options, familiar problems remain, and the side find themselves in mid-table having suffered defeats in three of their seven fixtures so far. Amorim's appropriateness for the position has come under scrutiny, particularly given his determination to maintain his philosophy and display minimal flexibility.",
      "However, he continues to enjoy support from the boardroom and Ratcliffe appeared on The Times' Business podcast to emphasise that any hasty decision-making is unlikely to yield superior outcomes. The Ineos chief declared: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "But ex-United shot-stopper Foster questioned whether the absence of meaningful progress is being properly considered. He said: \"If I was a Man United fan, I'd be a little bit worried about that because, a club like Manchester United, it's always about progression.",
      "\"You've got to be seen to be progressing and as it stands at the minute they are not progressing. 10th in the league at the minute. It's just the lack of consistency.",
      "\"Obviously, they've won the game against Sunderland now before the international break, but they've got some tough games coming up. Liverpool on Sunday. It's that consistency that they need to find. If they can start to do the three, four, five games winning in a row, then they can really shoot up the table. But as it stands at the minute, it's so hit and miss.\"",
      "Amorim has yet to secure back-to-back victories in the Premier League since arriving in Manchester. United claimed a crucial three points against Sunderland prior to the international break, but now travel to Anfield this weekend, facing an uphill battle.",
      "Victory for Liverpool could intensify scrutiny on the United manager, though Ratcliffe has dismissed speculation surrounding his position following each defeat.",
      "\"The press, sometimes I don't understand,\" he said last week. \"They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "Some fans have joked Mount is the teacher's pet at Manchester United, but he wasn't picked to start in a must-win game against Sunderland because he gets along with Amorim.",
      "Mount started because of the quality, pressing and energy he brings to the team, and he admitted during his post-match chat that he considers himself the \"catalyst\" for the press.",
      "The 26-year-old vindicated his selection just eight minutes into the game when he finished brilliantly at the Stretford End and he might have done enough to retain his starting role against Liverpool.",
      "Mount started against Sunderland at the expense of Matheus Cunha, who might have to settle for a role off the bench again at Anfield when United make the trip to Merseyside on Sunday.",
      "Cunha hasn't put a foot wrong since joining from Wolves in the summer. The Brazilian is yet to score or assist, but his all-round performances have been strong down the left flank.",
      "He was unfortunate not to get off the mark against Fulham at Craven Cottage (Cunha hit the post and was also denied at point-blank range) and it feels like only a matter of time before he breaks his duck.",
      "However, it feels like Amorim will start Mount on the left side in the No.10 role against Liverpool because his work ethic will be hugely beneficial against the Premier League champions in their own backyard.",
      "Cunha has improved that aspect of his game - Wolves' coaches challenged him to improve when not in possession - but he isn't known for working tirelessly backwards and forwards.",
      "That's not to say Cunha doesn't work hard. He has demonstrated his willingness to work his socks off since signing for United, but Mount may be seen as the better option for Anfield.",
      "United is such a big club that rotating a player for tactical reasons can feel like a story - especially if that player is a relatively new signing and was signed for a multi-million-pound fee.",
      "The truth is Manchester City and Liverpool have dominated the Premier League due to their strength in depth. They regularly rotate players and there is no hysterical reaction when a player is benched.",
      "It won't be a big deal if Cunha is named on the bench again this weekend, it would merely be a selection decision made by Amorim to give United the best chance of leaving Anfield with a positive result.",
      "Liverpool are likely to dominate the ball on Sunday afternoon. United will have to work meticulously out of possession, press efficiently and players will have to win their individual battles.",
      "United last won at Anfield in 2016 when Louis van Gaal was in charge and the bookmakers have made Liverpool heavy favourites to win the fixture, but the contest should be closer than the odds suggest.",

      "Manchester United were on the brink of signing England Under-21s star Liam Delap before a last-minute change of heart saw him join Chelsea instead, it has been claimed. It's been suggested that the prospect of playing Champions League football was a key factor in his decision to join the Blues after suffering relegation with former club Ipswich.",
      "United were tantalisingly close to securing their own Champions League spot, only to lose out in the Europa League final against Tottenham in Bilbao. Despite this setback, they've managed to attract top attacking talent to Old Trafford, but Delap may well be the first big name they've missed out on due to their European disappointment.",
      "The Mail reports that United's deal for Delap was '90% done'. A £30million release clause was triggered when Ipswich were relegated, and Ruben Amorim's side looked set to sign him until Chelsea stepped in.",
      "The same source also claims that Matheus Cunha - another player with a release clause which removed the need for haggling over price - was United's primary target. They secured that deal early on, also bringing Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko into the fold, although missing out on Delap could have had wider implications for the club's transfer strategy.",
      "Delap wasted no time in making his mark at Chelsea, scoring in a Club World Cup group stage win over Esperance. However, an injury has since hampered his Premier League progress, and he hasn't featured since suffering a hamstring injury against Fulham in August.",
      "United's new frontman Sesko has been gradually introduced, despite a shortage of alternative choices. It took until the Slovenian's sixth outing for him to find the net in the Premier League, though three of those appearances came from the bench.",
      "Sesko built upon his close-range strike at Brentford with a second United goal in the triumph over Sunderland in the final match before he and a number of United colleagues went away on international duty. That success propelled Amorim's squad back into the upper half of the table, though the heat remains on before Sunday's journey to Liverpool.",
      "\"Of course, he was anxious for his first goal,\" Amorim said of Sesko between the Brentford and Sunderland clashes. \"The thing I like most in Ben is, even when things are hard for him with the ball, he is working hard in every minute of the game. That is the most important thing in the moment.\"",
      "While United's fixture away to Liverpool will present a significant examination, Chelsea appear to have what seems on paper a more welcoming encounter when they return from the international pause. Enzo Maresca's side are heading to the City Ground to meet Nottingham Forest, who remain a point adrift of the drop zone and haven't secured victory since the campaign's opening weekend.",
      "The match is anticipated to arrive too early for Delap to, however. The forward could return in November following his injury setback, but there's still a chance Chelsea don't risk him until the following month.",

      "Sport Central Audience Writer",
      "Peter Schmeichel has claimed that Manchester United made the wrong decision by signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig and, in turn, offloading Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli during the summer transfer window.",
      "Sesko, 23, made the £66.26million plus £7.36m in add-ons switch to Old Trafford in August. After a difficult start to life at United, the Slovenia international has found the net in each of his last two appearances.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund, 22, joined Napoli on a season-long loan deal back in September. Antonio Conte's side have an obligation to buy the forward should they qualify for the Champions League. Since his move to Naples, Hojlund has scored four times in his first six games, forming a dangerous partnership with Kevin De Bruyne in the process.",
      "Allowing Hojlund to leave and bringing in Sesko, though, is a decision that doesn't make sense to Schmeichel, who has criticised United for making such a move and hit out at the club's creative players for Hojlund's woes.",
      "\"The signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have had Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years,\" Schmeichel told BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "\"You only have to see what he's doing at Napoli with Kevin De Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with - he's scoring goals. I've consistently said this for two-and-a-half years - Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goal-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "Schmeichel added that there were more pressing concerns at United that needed to be addressed first, such as sorting out their goalkeeper position and defensive midfield area.",
      "\"We let him [Hojlund] go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service. You have spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don't have the No.6 we should have, and there's the goalkeeping position as well.",
      "\"This season alone we've conceded nine goals from goalkeeping errors,\" he added. \"When I played, when Edwin van der Sar played, when David de Gea played, the brief was win 10 points a season, you don't give points away.",
      "\"Why did we bring someone in that we didn't need? Because the head of recruitment comes from RB Leipzig [also Sesko's former club] and he's got to make a mark.\"",
      "For me, Schmeichel is bang on in the fact that United had more pressing issues to sort out first and should have signed a new goalkeeper and a central defensive midfielder before addressing the striker position.",
      "It's clear that United had to fix the goalkeeper department and sign a new elite No.1 with Andre Onana struggling and Altay Bayindir failing to impress. Although the Reds managed to bring in Senne Lammens late in the transfer window, it would have been preferred if a more experienced campaigner was signed earlier in the summer months.",
      "The same applies for a new midfielder, though United didn't even manage to bring a new one in and have opted to stick with Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo as their four options in that position. That is something that could prove to be a major mistake for United, who lack real strength and steel there.",
      "While I agree with Schmeichel in that sense, I do think that he is wrong in the opinion that United should have kept Hojlund and not signed Sesko.",
      "At one point last season, Hojlund went through a 21-game goal drought which lasted more than 22 hours. However you dress that up, it's nowhere near good enough for someone that is playing for United.",
      "Across his United career, Hojlund scored just 26 times in 95 appearances. His Premier League return was particularly poor, hitting 14 goals in 62 outings - averaging almost one every five matches.",
      "Schmeichel has put the blame on United's creative players for Hojlund's shortcomings in a Reds shirt, but I think the finger should be pointed at both parties, including the forward who, at times, looked lost.",
      "There is no surprise that Amorim decided to pick Joshua Zirkzee ahead of Hojlund, before the former Bologna man suffered a season-ending hamstring injury. Zirkzee seemed to suit Amorim's system much better.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo may have helped Hojlund to score more, but neither have the creative ability of De Bruyne, who has been able to conjure up several high quality chances for the Dane at Napoli.",
      "Sometimes you need the striker to create opportunities for himself and that is what Sesko has the potential to do and more so, at least, than Hojlund who it felt like needed top class service instead.",
      "I have no doubt that Hojlund is going to score a hatful of goals for Napoli in Serie A, but sometimes the fit isn't right for the player and that is what I think it was for him at United. Therefore, the right decision was made for him to be offloaded out loan and the Reds brought in another centre forward in the shape of Sesko.",

      "Manchester United are confident that a deal can now be struck to secure land around Old Trafford which would, subsequently, pave the way for their proposed new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "United's plans for the new state-of-the-art venue - which is initially expected to cost around £2billion - have been complicated by an ongoing problem with Freightliner, who own an important bit of land behind the Stretford End.",
      "According to reports from The Daily Mail, United have offered around £50million to buy the land while Freightliner are seeking a more ambitious sum of £400million - a fee the Reds feel as 'unrealistic'. United feel that a compulsory purchase order could eventually be made, in which case the government would intervene to set a fair price.",
      "However, the report added that the club have held 'constructive' discussions with Freightliner - and are optimistic about striking a deal 'within the coming months'.",
      "Should a deal be struck up, it would mean that United can press ahead with plans, which were drawn up by Lord Norman Foster, for a new stadium complex to be built.",
      "Even though that would be another positive step, United still need to find funding for their huge project which is anticipated to cost £2bn-plus. Despite this, the club hope the new venue, dubbed 'Wembley of the North', can be finished in time for the start of the 2030/2031 season.",
      "In July, it was revealed that United are considering introducing 'Personal Seat Licences' - a method that would see supporters charged up to £4,000 for the right to buy a season ticket at the new stadium.",
      "Fans are being asked for their feedback on a variety of areas including facilities and cost.",
      "Once the new stadium is constructed and opened, United's existing home is, in turn, set to be demolished. United would likely continue to be playing at Old Trafford until they move into their new stadium, however.",
      "Architects at Foster and Partners said the new stadium would feature an umbrella design and a new public plaza that is 'twice the size of Trafalgar Square'. The design will feature three masts described as \"the trident\", which the architects say will be 200m high and visible from the Peak District.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "In response to concerns raised over Mohamed Salah’s form and whether he could be dropped on the back of suggestions he’s now costing Liverpool points rather than winning them, Arne Slot gave no indication of a change of tack in his press conference, offer Manchester United – and one player in particular – hope of making hay while the sun shines at Anfield on Sunday.",
      "After Liverpool’s 2-1 defeat to Chelsea, Blues full-back Marc Cucurella revealed Enzo Maresca’s pre-game directive to target Liverpool’s right flank as a point of weakness.",
      "Cucurella said: “We know that Salah is always ready for the counter-attack so we practiced that and the manager said that the space might be there [on the right side of Liverpool].",
      "“We saw that it was the last minute but we kept attacking. I tried to give my last effort and Enzo gave me the ball and I crossed for Estevao.”",
      "It was a public avowal of an awareness of a chink on the Reds’ armour that we’re guessing most Premier League managers already recognised, but have previously been mindful of looking to exploit to any great extent owing to the dangers Salah posed in the other direction.",
      "Former Liverpool full-back Steve Nicol hit out at Salah for “walking around in a daze” and claimed the forward must be ignoring Slot’s instructions to track opposition full-backs.",
      "“99% of players, when things aren’t going well for them, we understand that it’s fine as long as they work hard,” Nicol told ESPN. “But he seems to be walking around in a daze. Those breaks with Cucurella, Salah is not even thinking about him and why is that?",
      "“It surely cannot be that he doesn’t get it or understand it, and there is certainly no way Arne Slot isn’t telling him to keep an eye on Cucurella as he liked to get forward.",
      "“I’m going to be kind to Mo Salah and we can call it low confidence, but right now his head is scrambled and he is not seeing the clear picture.”",
      "But in his press conference on Friday, Slot pointed out that threat Salah still provided against Chelsea, and in no way suggested he expects more from the forward defensively, despite admitting that a better “balance” needs to be found.",
      "“I saw Cucurella’s comments on Salah but I show you five or six moments where Mo could have made the difference, so that would be a different conversation,” Slot said.",
      "“Always the balance between winger and full-back that is quite… I want ours to attack as well we have to find the right balance. We concede too many crosses, I am aware of that and we have to do better.”",
      "Slot instead said that both Florian Wirtz and Dominik Szoboszlai “are expected to defend” despite being attack-minded midfielders, putting the responsibility on them to cover for Salah rather than putting the defensive burden on the guy he knows is Liverpool’s game-changer.",
      "There’s nothing quite like a game against United to break Salah out of a funk – he’s got 16 goals and six assists in 17 games against the Red Devils – and two goals to send Egypt to the World Cup while becoming the all-time leading goalscorer in African World Cup qualifying won’t have done his confidence any harm.",
      "But Slot’s apparent refusal to alter the defensive expectations of his star man offers United and Amorim an opportunity to prey on the same weakness which saw Alejandro Garnacho and Cucurella get so much joy at Stamford Bridge last time out.",
      "Amorim could plump for either Matheus Cunha or Mason Mount as his inverted winger on that side, but the key man for the Red Devils could be Patrick Dorgu, who has shown some promise this season as a raiding left wing-back and could get some real joy against whichever right-back Slot and Salah hang out to dry.",

      "Al-Sheikh wrote on X: ‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",
      "But Al-Sheikh had to clarify his comments after speculation that he or another Saudi was involved in the potential takeover in some way.",

      "It has been revealed that the drag-along rights included in the INEOS minority takeover means Sir Jim Ratcliffe could be forced to sell his shares if a new bidder for the club emerges.",
      "Football finance expert Maguire has cast doubt on the takeover rumours, he told United In Focus: “I think if the Glazers had wanted to sell at $32 per share for the whole club, then they would have done so.",

      "“We’re still at $16, $17, and even that includes a speculative element to it.",
      "“So the comments from Turki Al-Sheikh are intriguing, but the club has responded with a fairly heavy ‘no’, and given that it’s listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it’s got to be cautious about what it says publicly.",
      "“So I think it’s a bit of a false flag that we’re seeing. If somebody wanted to get involved in a bid then Twitter’s not the best place to put out that information.",

      "Journalist Ben Jacobs gave a comprehensive update on the potential takeover earlier this week, insisting that the Glazers have yet to receive an offer from any party.",
      "Jacobs said on The United Stand: “So the latest is as follows: number one, the Glazers have not had an offer from anybody.",
      "“Could they be holding talks behind other people at the club’s back? Absolutely. Are they advanced? No. And then where does the money come from? Well, Turki Al-Sheikh confirms something that we broke on this show, that it’s not Saudi Arabia.",
      "“I don’t want to disappoint the chat, but Sheikh Jassim is not coming back to the table. There is no possibility, I am told. And in addition to that, the number the Glazers want is in excess of 5 billion pounds. And if you go back through the SEC filing to look at the different bids from shape, none of the offers were anywhere close to that number.",
      "“And what makes the number higher is if, whilst this drag on clause is valid, the Glazers do sell. So Jim Ratcliffe is guaranteed $33 a share, which takes the overall valuation of the club to something around 4.7 billion.",
      "“So again, not far off that 5 billion pound number. And all of this means, if someone’s to buy the club now, they’re going to have to pay a premium, and then Sir Jim Ratcliffe would have to go buy a wanted 100% so there’s a few variables here.”",
      "Jacobs added: “The last thing, and the most interesting thing that I can add, and I think this counts as a bit of a United Stand exclusive, is that within the UAE, one company in particular is involved in these talks.",
      "“It’s unclear whether they will front the consortium, but international holding company or IHC, which has been around for about three decades, have been part of talks to put together a perspective of a UAE-based Consortium.",
      "“We don’t know whether anything is going to materialise. And as we said on talkSPORT a few weeks ago, some ex-Manchester United legends have also been sounded out not to invest, but just to be ambassadors.",
      "“And quite interestingly, some, I think they’ll be excited to others, I think they will almost feel the optics of this are not quite right because of the kind of personality he is. One ex-Manchester United legend in particular has held direct talks about maybe coming on board.”",
      "Jacobs continued: “I would just stress one thing really, clearly, it is nowhere near as advanced as Turki implied, nor have the Glazers had any kind of direct contact.",
      "“Yet there’s no guarantee this even develops into anything. But Eric Cantona is one of the names that has been approached.”",
      "A takeover of Man Utd could be ‘advanced’ but not in terms of the UAE-based consortium making a bid for the club, according to journalist Ben Jacobs.",
      "Some Man Utd legends have been ‘approached’ by a UAE-based consortium looking to buy the club from the Glazers, according to reports.",

      "As former Manchester United players continue to ‘hit back’, ‘dismiss’ and ‘baulk’ at suggestions from Marcus Rashford that his boyhood club was the problem and not what they perceive to be a lack of effort on his part, we wonder just how brilliant the England international will have to be for club and country for the not-so-merry band of Red Devils pundits to side with him over the club they’re ordinarily willing to concede has become a laughing stock since their playing days.",
      "Rashford impressed for Aston Villa on loan in the second half of last season and has three goals and five assists for Barcelona so far this term. After some all too predictable knee-jerk media nonsense claiming the La Liga giants were considering sending him back to United after his first couple of appearances, a narrative about-turn now sees Rashford’s displays as proof of the rotten core of the football club he departed in the summer.",
      "That’s a far more difficult concept for your Roy Keanes, Gary Nevilles and Wayne Rooneys to accept though.",
      "Upon upping sticks for Barcelona in the summer, Rashford claimed United were in “no man’s land” and that “the transition hasn’t started”, which riled Neville.",
      "“Let’s ignore that,” Neville said. “Because I don’t want to go into Marcus Rashford comments tonight. He was there at the club for 10 years and had his opportunity to impact the club. Ruben Amorim, this year, I think will do a good job. Marcus should concentrate on Barcelona.”",
      "Keane then questioned whether Rashford had the “intelligence” to succeed at Barcelona, asking: “Do you reckon he’s got enough football intelligence to go over there and adapt to a different league, different football, different lifestyle? Has he got that intelligence on and off the pitch to make it work?”",
      "The evidence so far suggests that Rashford does indeed have the required football nous to thrive at Barcelona, and while we may feel the need to caveat that as a result of a career beset with false dawns and inconsistency, all of that instability coming while playing for Manchester United allows for an easy hypothesis, as drawn by the man himself in response to Thomas Tuchel’s claim that the only think preventing Rashford from being seen as a world class talent is his lack of consistency.",
      "“For sure, consistency is a massive part of it,” Rashford said. “I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time, so it is even more difficult to be consistent.",
      "“When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything, not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life and the way you train. We have just had so many changes so far in my career.”",

      "Neither Keane nor Wayne Rooney, both captains of Manchester United, who led by example through their work ethic as well as their quality at Old Trafford, can conceive of a situation where the environment at their football club has turned so sour as to cause a player like Rashford to not be putting in the maximum amount of effort week in, week out.",
      "“Towards the end of his time at United, there was obviously issues. He was part of the problem with the environment, especially one of the most experienced players at United,” Keane said in response to Rashford’s comments.",
      "“He should have been setting the standards and showing new people at he club what it’s like to be a United player. But that’s been well documented. What we have to look at is he’s got this chance now with England and he deserved it.",
      "“No doubt about his talent, he’s obviously fantastic. But the bit that would have frustrated fans is his body language, not running back or not pressing properly. That’s the things he needs to tidy up and if he does there’s no reason he can’t become a world class player.”",
      "Rooney agreed with Keane, claiming Rashford should look at himself in the mirror rather than blaming United.",
      "Speaking on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, he said: “I think the environment hasn’t been right but that is down to yourself.",
      "“If you are not playing well or you get left out of the team then I think it is easier to blame the environment and whether that is right or wrong. I think that comes from how you apply yourself.",
      "“In games we have seen with him where we know he can do more, we know he can run more – that is nothing to do with an environment.",
      "“I might be wrong here, I really like Marcus as a lad and as a person but I think that is an easy one to throw at people.”",
      "But none of these United legends, who won countless major trophies in an atmosphere where they all drove each other to excel and improve, experienced anything like the lethargy, mockery and bleakness that Rashford had to endure at the club. His Manchester United was their Manchester United in name only.",
      "And they’re perfectly willing to accept that when discussing results, performances, problems with the manager, the directors and the general ethos of the club. But weirdly can’t then see how all of that upheaval might result in a footballer struggling for consistency.",
      "It makes us wonder a) how consistent they might have been in the last decade at United rather than the two before, and b) whether any level of brilliance from Rashford at Barcelona will be enough for them to admit that United was the problem and not him.",

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Since we’re nearly back to the real football, just been reading some reviews of how players did at U21 level, because while Sir Rat doesn’t think the academy is producing the goods, there’s actually a good number of very exciting talents, particularly Fletcher, Lacey and Biancheri.",
      "The latter two are particularly interesting, being that one is a winger and the other a small agile finisher in the mould of Aguero.",

Y’know, in the context that we don’t now use wingers (maybe Lacey can be adapted to the 10 but there’s 6 ahead of him) and there’s a general preference for tall and strong strikers.",
      "I’m afraid it goes back to the issue of a system requiring and using only certain types of player, without ability to accomodate or adapt to the talents available. Where would Scholes, Giggs or Beckham have fitted into this set up if they were breaking through now? Neville as a CB?",
      "Anyhoo, answers on a postcard or BTL very welcome.",
      "If the answer is “they just have to wait until this guy is sacked” that’s fine, but Lacey is 19 and needs to get a path to senior football soon. Which has vibes of “ones that got away” when we sell him to probably Newcastle or Everton on the cheap.\nBadwolf",

Oddly he’s leaning intelligently on Newcastle’s team while Sven was stuck with Manchester United’s Ferguson dripping poison in the ear of his boys for the England squad. Howe is nurturing a good set of hard working players in his squad that compliment what Tuchel needs. Gordon running up the left wing is a pleasure to finally see happen.

      "There have been an interesting range of comments in recent mailboxes on Harry Kane, some focussing on his goalscoring prowess whilst others felt his barnet required closer evaluation (…“he’s a nifty, 50’s binman !” (© Shooting Stars..)).",
      "So I thought I would jot down a few thoughts from an older England fan’s perspective.",
      "There can be no doubting of the man’s goal-scoring prowess – that is undeniable and he remains one of the most clinical finishers around, as he has been for a number of years.",
      "However, I start to feel slightly more uncomfortable with certain messaging that I hear from parts of the media when they eulogise about his build up play, with it almost being painted that he should be allowed to do that because … because he’s Harry Kane ! .. record England goal-scorer … he can do what he wants !",
      "The guy can clearly play some great, incisive passes (an aspect of his game that has come more to the fore in the last few years), but that doesn’t mean he should be given full licence to drop into those positions away from the forward line for England to attempt that. What was clearly evident at the last Euro’s (where there were lots of calls for him to be dropped from the starting 11 during the tournament, me being one) was that he stodged up our build up play by dropping deep.",
      "I also think we need to recognise that one of the areas where England have a high talent pool relative to the world stage is at the number 10 / attacking midfield position – Rogers has had the shirt in the last couple of games, with the likes of Palmer, Bellingham and Eze patiently waiting (Palmer is the pick for me – such an intelligent footballer in terms of his ability to find pockets of space and defining attacking patterns of play). It would be disappointing to me if all 4 of those names don’t make the plane to the US.",
      "So, back to the job demarcation point. For me, Tuchel should be telling Harry that he wants him to play as a number 9 that predominantly plays within the width of the penalty area and in the attacking line. That should be his job, to finish the chances created by others – think of it like a Gerd Muller role who was one of the best there has been in terms of finding the onion bag, but who had a very talented German team behind him to give him those opportunities.",
      "If Kane could adopt that narrower role for England, I think it will improve our overall chances of success.\nSparky, LFC (liking what Tuchel is doing .. refreshing to see the manner he has selected squads / teams in recent times .. regardless of reputation, everyone needs to earn their place ..

So, as much as I held back, here’s my tuppence worth.",
      "Now, Neville has every right to say what he said. Also people have the right to disagree with him. What’s amusing is that Neville in his dramatic video appears to be using ‘mirror politics  i e. having a go at ‘angry middle aged white men’ causing division when that’s exactly what he is.and what he’s doing (especially in Salford). Can’t he just express his views rationally father than impersonate Richard Ashcroft with his remix of ‘Bitter Sweet Symphony? I think Jaap Stam sums him up in his autobiography by calling both the Nevilles ‘busy c**ts’ implying they are both angry people who complain about this, that and everything!

I was touched and turned and saluted it.\nChris, Croydon",

      "After whinging in this mailbox that Johnny Nic should advocate for a salary cap and now seeing the PL is about to vote on (a soft version of) one, I think I need to whinge more about the changes I want to see in football. Presumably someone in here has influence and takes mailbox ideas straight to shareholder meetings. So here goes:",
      "1. Remove heading from the game. We know it’s terrible for kids’ brains, it’s probably not great for adults’ brains. It adds so little. In fact, only ~15% of premier league goals are headers. I think taking away defenders’ option to head the ball clear would increase the number of goals, at least initially.",
      "2. Remove penalties from the game. Foul in the box is just like a foul anywhere else. If an obvious goal is stopped a la Suarez v Ghana, just award a goal.",
      "3. Stop the clock when the ball is out of play. Everyone whinges about time-wasting. I read article after article about the ball only being in play for ~54% of time blah blah blah. Just make the game 60 mins and stop the clock. Add a “restart play” of 15s for throw ins, 30s for corners/free kicks in the attacking half.",
      "4. Ditch automatic VAR. Give the manager “challenges” like tennis or NFL, but you lose a sub if you get it wrong. Let them challenge ANYTHING; absolutely believe that throw in was the wrong call? Bet a sub on it. No subs left but you’ve just conceded a final minute winner that you think is bullshit? Too bad, you should have managed your challenges/subs better.",
      "Anyway, that’s more than my 2 cents worth. Would love to hear why I’m an idiot or what other changes should be implemented.\nZiggy (really need the international break to be over)",

      "The Premier League is back! Well done, everyone, another international break survived. And now very nearly a month to luxuriate in delicious Barclays before the next one comes along. Lucky us.",
      "The football gods have seen fit to grant us a special treat this weekend as Liverpool and Manchester United bring their current very real if very different crisis experiences to an Anfield showdown that can only end with at least one team in the very deepest despair, while there’s plenty of other good stuff to be found around the country and indeed continent.",
      "And look at that, Ange Postecoglou is still here, just about. Who’d have thought it? Not us.",
      "Big Weekends always feel that bit bigger after a whole fortnight away, but this one would be worthy at any time of the year.",
      "",
      "We don’t know much about the fixture computer. We like to think it is in fact a kind of giant piece of factory machinery. In our heads, it is basically Bertha. In reality, it’s probably just a laptop, isn’t it?",
      "That’s very boring. We prefer to think of Bertha spitting out the fixtures, thank you very much. What we do know, of course, is that the fixtures computer is a mischievous scamp with a keen sense of humour.",
      "And we wonder whether it has some kind of ‘post-interlull’ setting. Because, god bless it, the fixture computer always seems to deliver a proper big bastard of a Super Sunday primetime game as a little treat to us all for surviving the barren fortnight.",
      "It was the Manchester derby in September. Next month, it’s the North London Derby. And now, we get the really big one. El Crisico. Mini-crisis v maxi-crisis. Liverpool v Manchester United.",
      "Bertha, you are spoiling us.",
      "It really has come at an ideal time for absolutely everybody apart from Liverpool and Manchester United. Whoever loses, we all win.",
      "Either Liverpool’s mini-crisis gets upgraded, or Manchester United once again miss the chance to find that elusive second successive Premier League win in a row under a manager who has openly admitted the inability to do something as basic as win two Premier League games in a row is now living in their head. Not rent-free, Sir Jim would never allow that. But it’s there nonetheless.",
      "Or, and this feels most likely given Liverpool are suddenly quite unsure of themselves and Manchester United aren’t very good, neither of them get the perspective-altering win they need and it’ll be a draw like it has been in each of the last two seasons. And that’s no good for either of them, really.",
      "It is, in short, the perfect game to headline the first weekend back after the international break.",
      "",
      "Back-to-back home Premier League wins over Fulham and Burnley to go with a couple of welcome early successes in the Europa League have significantly lifted a previously gloomy mood at Villa Park.",
      "With Villa and Forest – about whom more later in the most obvious possible way – we’ve seen almost sarcastically perfect evidence of how the Europa League can work for good or ill for a struggling team.",
      "You can be Aston Villa, and see the Europa League help you get that winning feeling back, restore some confidence and watch that flow through rejuvenated players who suddenly see that Thursday-Sunday schedule as more opportunity than chore. Or you can be Forest, and have European competition simply represent the opportunity to be humiliated and embarrassed twice a week instead of just the once, exacerbating and further highlighting all the obvious and, let’s be fair, largely self-inflicted problems you currently face.",
      "It is definitely better to be Villa. Having thus been able to enjoy the interlull, as much as any of us can, on the back of a far more encouraging set of results than had previously been the case, now comes crunch time.",
      "Have Villa actually turned a serious corner, escaping from the funk that had enveloped them since such a costly missing out on Champions League football at the end of last season? Or have they just had a couple of winnable Europa games chucked in with a couple of quite gentle home Premier League games?",
      "Villa’s trip to Spurs on Sunday afternoon should tell us a fair bit about both sides. A pre-collapse Tottenham spangled Villa 4-1 at WHL 2.0 last November, but since that result they have a truly astonishing home record in the league. And not in a good way.",
      "They have won only three of 17 Premier League games at their own stadium in the 11 months since handing Villa that beating, with only teams as thoroughly outmatched as Southampton and Burnley or as thoroughly ridiculous as Manchester United failing to leave with anything at all.",
      "Even this season, one in which Spurs appear far less silly than in recent years, they have managed only four points from home games against Burnley, Bournemouth and Wolves while taking 10 points from their four away games.",
      "This is a big chance for Villa. There is perhaps no better fixture around at the moment for sitting right in the sweetspot of one where a positive result would feel like compelling evidence that things have decisively changed for the better while also being a game where such a result is relatively straightforward to obtain.",
      "",
      "It’s him until it isn’t. Still doesn’t have a win, still somehow does have a job, probably won’t if he can’t cobble together some kind of a result against Chelsea. Probably won’t cobble together some kind of a result against Chelsea.",
      "Watching Nottingham Forest this season has already reached that uncomfortable stage where you feel quite bad about even looking, like you’re intruding on something deeply personal.",
      "Maybe we really should all just… not watch. Let them work through whatever this is they’re going through in some kind of peace.",
      "Instead, we’re making Ange Postecoglou our manager to watch, again, because it is just so horribly fascinating to see, in real time, something go horribly wrong that everyone knew would go horribly wrong in the exact way – on, if anything, an accelerated timeline – it is going horribly wrong.",
      "",
      "There’s something about Gyokeres that is just unbeatably Modern Football. Not him as a player, but as a concept. In Gyokeres we have the clearest example yet of a player who had been judged, weighed and measured before he arrived at Arsenal. Battle lines were drawn, a culture war declared, and nobody will budge.",
      "He is either the final piece in the puzzle or a massive flop. No other outcome will be considered or tolerated, and most importantly nothing he actually does or doesn’t do on the pitch will shift anyone from the opinion that they formed and hardened and crystallised before he’d even worn the shirt.",
      "Goals he does score are either given far greater significance than they truly merit, or are ignored altogether, depending on your position.",
      "One criticism we’ve heard a bit already, and expect to hear more of, is that he scores the Wrong Goals. It’s entirely possible he’ll become the first Premier League flop to score 20 goals in his debut season.",
      "It’s a clever ruse, because initially it sounds quite reasonable when a Troy Deeney or some other such loud radio opinion-haver says he needs to score in a ‘big game’ or that Arsenal didn’t sign him to score late gloss-adders in 5-0 wins over Leeds.",
      "But it’s just guff, isn’t it? Sure, at some point it would be good to see him score in a ‘big game’ against ‘top opposition’. But the idea that Arsenal signed him specifically to do that and only that is, when given even a second’s actual thought, bumwash. Obvious bumwash at that.",
      "And this weekend’s trip to Fulham is in fact a textbook example of precisely the kind of fixture they also really need him to make a difference.",
      "Arsenal haven’t failed to win any of the last three league titles (only) because of not winning all the games against the best teams. It’s (also) because of points dropped at places like Fulham.",
      "Arsenal haven’t won here in either of the last two seasons, and Fulham haven’t lost here this season. Something to bear in mind there after Gyokeres’ winning goal this weekend is airily dismissed a fortnight down the line as the wrong kind of goal by those who’ve already made up their minds.",
      "",
      "The fact the three teams promoted into last season’s Premier League and then instantly sent packing back to the Championship were so very wretched was disastrous for last season’s top-flight relegation battle, but is already proving a significant boon for this season’s Championship promotion fight.",
      "Relegated teams should, very obviously, have a huge advantage when stepping back down in class. Off the field with your parachute payments and such, and on the field where even decimated squads will still contain the occasional gleam of Premier League sparkle.",
      "But none of the three teams who went down last season are in any kind of position to now set about dominating the Championship, with the result that an already unpredictable division is now more wide open than usual.",
      "Coventry and Middlesbrough are a pleasingly early Carling pair of potential Premier League returnees currently setting the pace, but there is only two points separating Leicester, who sit third despite themselves, and Bristol City down in tenth.",
      "Between them sit a whole bunch of clubs trying to get back to the top flight after absences of various degrees and those hoping to enjoy a delicious foaming pint of Barclays for the very first time since football was invented all the way back in 1992.",
      "The pick of Saturday’s lunchtime crop pits one from each camp against each other in a London derby as QPR host Millwall. Two places but a single point separate them going into the weekend, and for both sides there exists a tantalising chance to take first-mover’s advantage and jump through this currently tightly-packed bunch in and around the play-off spots.",
      "",
      "Der Klassiker is always a key moment in any Bundesliga season, but this one already carries significant weight. It’s very early but still feels very correct to say this is a game that will tell us whether or not there is any prospect of an actual title fight in Germany this year, or simply a Bayern Munich procession.",
      "Bayern have made a ludicrous start to the season, winning 10 straight games in all competitions and scoring a truly absurd amount of goals in the process. Luis Diaz has scored five goals in his first six Bundesliga games for the club, and that’s as many as anyone from any other club in the division has managed this season. It’s still not half as many as Harry Kane has plundered.",
      "Only three of the other 17 Bundesliga clubs have managed more than the 11 goals Kane has to his name, and Dortmund with 12 just about join that collective.",
      "More significantly, or at least Dortmund must hope, they have conceded only four goals in their six games. It’s not quite the unstoppable force meeting an immovable object, but it does represent a stiffer domestic challenge than a Bayern attack that has scored at least three times in each of its six straight league wins this season has thus far encountered.",
      "A win for Dortmund closes the gap at the top of the table to a single point and makes things interesting. The far more likely outcome, another goal-laden Bayern victory featuring a Kane penalty or three, will see the champions move seven points clear of Dortmund, at least six clear of anyone else, and disappearing once again over the horizon.",

      "Big Ange is on very thin ice as reports reveal the details on the ‘decisive’ game, the players’ ‘mood’ at Forest and who Marinakis ‘favours’.",
      "The Premier League is back, and with it a whole bunch of beleaguered managers who could really do with a win to silence the haters.",

      "With another international window out of the way, the Premier League is back this weekend giving us plenty of narratives to sink our teeth into.",
      "The pick of the fixtures this weekend is Manchester United’s trip to Anfield at prime time on Sunday, while we have our first relegation six-pointer.",
      "Here are five questions we want answers to this weekend:",
      "For the cricket fans out there, we are getting to the time pre-Ashes series where members on both sides of the Poms/Aussies divide gravitate towards a microphone to produce some quotes that may or may not have sounded funnier in their heads.",
      "Ange Postecoglou has never had to seek out the microphone, with his straight-talking ‘mate’ style making him the delight of some sections of the media, but by the time the first ball is bowled in Perth, Ange may be back on that beach he apparently hates.",
      "It’s not been an ideal start to life in Nottingham. Seven games with zero wins and five losses seems par for the course for a manager who finished 17th last year, but Mr. Marinakis wanted the Europa League-winning version of his fellow Greek.",
      "If Ange is not entirely to blame considering he was given a squad set up to play almost entirely the opposite of the way he wants to, it’s getting to the point where questions are asked of how long this can go on for.",
      "Forest are hovering dangerously close to the drop zone, just one point away from it, and with 18th-place Burnley playing Leeds this weekend, there is a good chance that come Saturday evening, Forest are in the bottom three.",
      "To prevent that, Postecoglou’s Forest will likely have to get some kind of result against Chelsea in Saturday’s lunchtime kick off. That’s the Chelsea that beat Liverpool last time out and the club Postecoglou has lost to all four times he has tried.",
      "Marinakis reportedly has options waiting in the wings, and if Postecoglou’s win rate remains at zero, he may well be back out of a job.",
      "The hot seats of management will feel extra warm at Anfield on Sunday afternoon when Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United arrive to face Arne Slot’s Liverpool.",
      "A month ago, this would have seemed like the easiest of home wins for a Liverpool side that has not lost against United at Anfield for a decade, but three defeats in a row have given Slot his first crisis since moving to England.",
      "Peeling away from the numbers, Liverpool may be one point off top, but they have looked unconvincing in the majority of their matches, with the form of Mo Salah a particular concern.",
      "Slot says teams have begun to play differently against his side, but that is the challenge of being a top-level manager. A title in your first season means you are safe from the sack for the foreseeable future, but another disappointing result on Sunday and there will be questions of whether the Dutchman has been found out.",
      "As for the other dugout, there are no such guarantees surrounding Amorim. This is the exact kind of match that you could see United somehow winning, but you can just as easily see them being hit — if they depart Liverpool off the back of a 5-0 thumping, Amorim’s position may well not be tenable.",

      "It’s not often that a manager on zero points is rewarded with a new deal but Wolves did just that when Vitor Pereira signed a new three-year contract after losing their opening four league matches.",
      "Things have picked up since then but only in the form of two points and Wolves are in real danger of being the first non-promoted side to be relegated since 2023.",
      "Those around Wolves also have reasons to be positive: West Ham have a new manager; Burnley’s fixtures have seen them already play Liverpool, City and Spurs with a couple of favourable fixtures on the horizon; the Forest implosion will come to an end at some point.",
      "This weekend Wolves travel to Sunderland in a game that feels like an early six-pointer. The problem for Wolves is that the Black Cats have not got the memo about promoted sides going straight back down and are currently ninth in the table.",
      "Wolves’ first match against a promoted side saw them get thumped 3-1 at home by Leeds but we are getting to the stage of the season where you can start to be left behind.",
      "Anything less than a win will keep Wolves bottom with  more than one eye on the drop.",
      "The first Champions League win of the season coupled with a 2-0 home win against Forest left Newcastle with a lot of good vibes heading into the international break and yet, in one of the more unbelievable facts of the season so far, they are still somehow behind Manchester United in the table.",
      "A ‘disastrous’ summer transfer window that was actually quite good may have contributed to their slow start but with five points separating them and the top four, it is time for Newcastle to put a run together.",
      "They have a favourable run of fixtures coming up with Brighton, Fulham, West Ham and Brentford next while Nick Woltemade is not looking like an ‘idiotic’ signing.",
      "With Yoane Wissa still out, the giant German is Newcastle’s main goal threat but Eddie Howe has at his disposal one of the best midfields in the league and a solid defensive line behind them.",
      "Brighton have proven to be a bit of a bogey team for top four contenders so far this season, beating City and Chelsea while drawing to Spurs, so a win away would boost Newcastle’s Champions League credentials.",
      "Manchester City are about as confusing as they have ever been under Pep Guardiola.",
      "Up until about 12 months ago, you would have bet everything you owned on them being a title contender but a Rodri-inspired collapse has resulted in a lot more trepidation around them when heading into this campaign.",
      "That doubt proved fair when they lost two of their opening three games but since then, City have quietly been the form team in the league.",
      "Three wins out of four has been helped by having a Norwegian scoring machine up front with Erling Haaland finding the net in his last 10 games. City’s style has also clearly changed to get the best out of him. Whereas in the past, Haaland would have been fed in after a series of short, intricate passes, now they are not against pumping it long to the big man.",
      "Haaland’s ability was never in question so now it is a test of whether this new-look City side can pose a serious title charge. Bookies still have them as third favourites and they are fifth, three points off leaders Arsenal.",
      "City have a favourable few games ahead in the form of Everton at home and Aston Villa away which they should be winning comfortably if they want to set their stall out as genuine contenders.",

For all the problems at United right now, I think Baleba would have benefited from that step up. He really is going to be the next top player. I’ve watched him a few times, and I hope he has good people around to advise him.",
      "“He can play with both feet, and at his young age, what he needs to focus on is his decision-making. What we need to see is that he has the awareness and maturity to make the right decisions consistently. If he keeps up with that, he’ll be a very good player.",

      "Therefore, Man Utd have a decent opportunity of causing an upset if they turn up at Anfield, so supporters would have had a feeling of dread upon hearing that Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo and Casemiro ‘missed full training’ on Thursday.",
      "Certain scaremongering outlets have made it seem that these players have injuries and could miss Sunday’s match, but this is not the case at all.",

      "According to reports, there has been an “approach” to a Manchester United legend, who is in “direct talks” over his involvement in a potential takeover.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s minority takeover of Man Utd was initially met with huge positivity, though he has become an incredibly unpopular figure.",
      "The INEOS chief owns a stake in the region of 29% and has taken control of football operations at Old Trafford, while the Glazer family remain in the background.",
      "Ratcliffe has become unpopular by sanctioning a major cost-cutting programme to balance the books at Man Utd, but has brutally made staff cuts, reduced payments to club legends and hiked ticket prices.",
      "Therefore, a large portion of United’s fanbase got excited when Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh claimed that a new takeover is ‘advanced’.",
      "There have since been conflicting reports on a potential deal, but journalist Ben Jacobs has moved to clear up a few key details.",
      "Jacobs has confirmed that talks are not “advanced”, though a group from the UAE is interested, while a “few variables” set the full takeover price.",
      "“So the latest is as follows: number one, the Glazers have not had an offer from anybody,” Jacobs said on The United Stand.",
      "READ: Man City would face 23-point deduction as Man Utd, Chelsea also in breach of £546m PL ‘salary cap’",
      "“Could they be holding talks behind other people at the club’s back? Absolutely. Are they advanced? No. And then where does the money come from? Well, Turki Al-Sheikh confirms something that we broke on this show, that it’s not Saudi Arabia.",
      "“I don’t want to disappoint the chat, but Sheikh Jassim is not coming back to the table. There is no possibility, I am told. And in addition to that, the number the Glazers want is in excess of 5 billion pounds. And if you go back through the SEC filing to look at the different bids from shape, none of the offers were anywhere close to that number.",
      "“And what makes the number higher is if, whilst this drag on clause is valid, the Glazers do sell. So Jim Ratcliffe is guaranteed $33 a share, which takes the overall valuation of the club to something around 4.7 billion.",
      "“So again, not far off that 5 billion pound number. And all of this means, if someone’s to buy the club now, they’re going to have to pay a premium, and then Sir Jim Ratcliffe would have to go buy a wanted 100% so there’s a few variables here.”",
      "The “most interesting thing” revealed by Jacobs is that United legend Eric Cantona has held “direct talks” with the group and has been “approached” about “coming on board”.",
      "“The last thing, and the most interesting thing that I can add, and I think this counts as a bit of a United Stand exclusive, is that within the UAE, one company in particular is involved in these talks,” Jacobs added.",
      "“It’s unclear whether they will front the consortium, but international holding company or IHC, which has been around for about three decades, have been part of talks to put together a perspective of a UAE-based Consortium.",
      "“We don’t know whether anything is going to materialise. And as we said on talkSPORT a few weeks ago, some ex-Manchester United legends have also been sounded out not to invest, but just to be ambassadors.",
      "“And quite interestingly, some, I think they’ll be excited to others, I think they will almost feel the optics of this are not quite right because of the kind of personality he is. One ex-Manchester United legend in particular has held direct talks about maybe coming on board.”",
      "He added: “I would just stress one thing really, clearly, it is nowhere near as advanced as Turki implied, nor have the Glazers had any kind of direct contact.",
      "“Yet there’s no guarantee this even develops into anything. But Eric Cantona is one of the names that has been approached.”"

      "With nothing on the pitch to capture the imagination beyond England’s perfunctory inevitable World Cup qualification, we’ve had to endure not one but two press-manufactured sh*tstorms about Jude Bellingham and, most absurdly, furious England fans and their TUCHEL BACKLASH.",
      "So thank the Barclays gods then that this weekend finally, after what feels like several decades, sees the return of Our League and the chance for us all to return to the far more dignified and serious endeavour of trying to get some managers sacked. That’s right, it’s some more words about Ange Postecoglou. We have never been more back.",
      "Here are just five managers who could really, really do with a win this weekend, ranked by how likely failure to do so might see them sacked in the morning, or at the very least facing all manner of unhelpful headlines and cracked-badge imagery and relentless use of the word ‘beleaguered’.",
      "",
      "You do feel a bit for Burnley. They’ve had a couple of paddlings, sure, and those are par for the promoted course. Nobody expects any promoted side to entirely avoid paddlings.",
      "Parker himself took that a bit too far, of course, when at Bournemouth he considered 9-0 defeats to be inevitable, but the general principle is sound. Sometimes as a promoted side you will get battered.",
      "But Burnley have been desperately close to some truly eye-catching results in other games, with heartbreaking late penalties costing them points at home to Liverpool and in a relegation six-pointer at Old Trafford.",
      "The encouraging nature of so many Burnley performances, combined with the laser focus of manager-crisis-based coverage to more conspicuous catastrophes elsewhere, has meant Parker has not found himself in the spotlight at all.",
      "But Burnley do have only four points from seven games and haven’t yet beaten anyone who was in the Premier League last season. At some point they really are going to have to beat somebody who was in the Premier League last season.",
      "That can wait until next weekend’s trip to Wolves, though, because it’s another six-pointer for Burnley before that at home to Leeds. Far too early to talk about must-win games, but you do feel the Clarets need at least one win from these two games. Because after that it’s Arsenal and suddenly Burnley could be looking distinctly adrift and Parker therefore in inevitable job-security bother.",
      "",
      "Liverpool have been forced to spend the international break in mini-crisis purgatory after a disastrous run of disastrous form saw them disastrously tumble all the way down to second in the league table a whopping one point behind runaway leaders and champions-elect Arsenal, who are infamously simply unstoppable once they get their noses in front in October.",
      "But that mini-crisis will surely escalate to full-blown regular-sized crisis if he makes another bollocks of another game, especially with the game in question being at home against giant-crisis Manchester United.",
      "Of course all the crisis talk at Liverpool is quite daft, but if they do fail to beat what has become in recent years, with all due respect to Spurs, the Premier League’s most reliable banter club then we will tick past a full month since Liverpool last won a league game. And even with an interlull in the middle of that run it would still be quite bad, wouldn’t it?",
      "That would still be a very long time to go without winning a league game, for a team that is trying to win the league.",
      "The other problem for Liverpool, beyond their own tribulations, is that in the last couple of seasons a trip to Anfield has proved one of those occasions where the old 1990s muscle memory kicks in and United produce an actual performance. They’ve escaped Anfield with a point in each of the last two seasons since losing so horrifically 4-0 and 7-0 in 21/22 and 22/23.",
      "A win for Liverpool and the mini-crisis is over. That’s the beauty of a mini-crisis – it’s quite easily escaped. But anything less and there is significant danger of escalation of the threat level. And then it gets harder to reach escape velocity. We estimate it might really be as little as a week before Slot is declared a bald fraud if things go badly. Vigilance is key.",
      "",
      "Sunderland away has developed an uncomfortably six-pointerish feel for Pereira and a Wolves side that remains the only team in the Premier League yet to record a victory this season. When you consider that the Premier League includes West Ham, you start to realise just how bad that is.",
      "Not even a visit to Dr Tottenham could fully cure Wolves of their long-standing slow-starting ills, but a pair of 1-1 draws before the international break was something at least.",
      "Really does feel like it’s very much time to actually get a win now, though. It’s getting silly, and while Manchester United and Nottingham Forest continue to provide absurd level of cover for Pereira and indeed every other manager in the league, there really is only so long that can continue.",
      "",
      "Victory at Anfield would surely silence the haters and the doubters for good, leaving Sir Jim’s previously insane insistence that Amorim be given three years at United come what may looking like just a good and sensible idea.",
      "For if Amorim can mastermind a victory at crisis-addled Liverpool he will achieve the stunning and unprecedented feat of winning two Premier League matches in a row.",
      "It’s a staggering achievement, one that belies the talk of United being in some kind of crisis, and one that would instantly elevate Amorim into the pantheon of truly great Premier League managers to have achieved something so staggering as not one but two victories in a row, placing him alongside such Barclays managerial luminaries as David Wagner, Velimir Zajec, Paul Ince and Ricky Sbragia.",
      "",
      "He always wins something in his second month, mate. Postecoglou has survived the international break, which was by no means certain when it began, so that’s something. It might even end up being the win.",
      "But it wasn’t exactly a comfortable fortnight, and one that featured altogether too much use of the words ‘Sean’ and ‘Dyche’, which suggests if nothing else that Forest’s top brass have at least stopped sniffing their own farts for just long enough to realise that one quite good season did not in fact elevate them directly to the protected elite and that actually they very much could still get relegated if they continue to insist on f*cking around to find out.",
      "With no wins in his first seven games, a run that has included defeats to Swansea, Sunderland and Midtjylland, Postecoglou is under the most severe of pressure already and with the entire footballing world lining up to scream ‘We told you so’ at Forest if and when they do give in and pull the plug.",
      "And it really might be after this game if Forest don’t show something. Turning a game against Chelsea into a must-win caper for a manager so early into a reign does still feel impossibly harsh, but it’s also hard to overstate just how quickly and thoroughly Postecoglou has burned through any goodwill and wriggle room across some gentler games.",
      "This was a manager who arrived at Forest with absolutely no recent Premier League form to point to in his defence and who never looked the right fit for the squad he would inherit. Forest have speedrun the entire Angeball experience, and really could be in the final throes already. Alas, without the inexplicable European trophy to show for it.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been working on a ‘secret’ Manchester United mission for ages but it’s public knowledge now, while Liverpool are always transfer geniuses.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe clearly doesn’t rate the Manchester United academy and Ruben Amorim has an inflexible system, so there is concern over three young stars.",
      "The Premier League is back with a bang on a weekend headlined by Liverpool v Manchester United in a fixture literally everybody is calling El Crisico.",
      "A former Manchester United player has explained why he thinks head coach Ruben Amorim has a “personal” problem with one of his players.",
      "Phil Jones would like nothing more than to see Ruben Amorim thrive at Man Utd, but is far from convinced.",
      "Big Ange is on very thin ice as reports reveal the details on the ‘decisive’ game, the players’ ‘mood’ at Forest and who Marinakis ‘favours’."

      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has given his backing to under fire manager Ruben Amorim but admitted that “it’s not working” and change may have to come if they lose to Liverpool this weekend.",
      "Almost a year on from his arrival at Old Trafford, the future of Amorim at United looks increasingly uncertain with a 15th-place finish last season followed by an unremarkable start to the new campaign.",
      "Minority owner Jim Ratcliffe has given his backing to the Portuguese coach but his tactical inflexibility has become increasingly frustrating for the home crowd.",
      "While plenty of former United players have had their say as to who should succeed Amorim, one still backing him is Pallister who suggested the 40-year-old still deserved time.",
      "“I don’t think it’s over,” Pallister exclusively told F365. “He’s under immense pressure.",
      "“But we can’t just carry on sacking managers, we need some kind of stability there. But ultimately, he knows if results keep going the way they have been, then the pressure is going to mount. That’s just the nature of football. You can’t hide away from that, and I’m sure he’s aware of that. I think he said it himself.”",

      "Pallister did though address Amorim’s reluctance to deviate from his preferred 3-4-3 formation, saying that while it is good to have a system, a manager needs to be able to change it during a game.",
      "“He’s not for changing with his system, which is what everybody seems to be talking about,” four-time Premier League winner Pallister said. “I would like to see him being a little bit more adaptable because if it doesn’t work like that, change it within the game.",
      "“That, I believe, is what’s not working. Maybe change it, otherwise you’re just making the same mistakes time and time again.",
      "“And we talk about managers not having a plan B – at the moment, that doesn’t look like a plan B. We’re sticking to it, and that’s all fair and well starting with that but if it’s not working, why can’t you change it within the game?”",
      "Next for Amorim is a trip to Anfield, a stadium United have not won at in over a decade, and Pallister conceded if United are “humiliated”, the pressure will build on Amorim’s job.",
      "“Massive game coming up against Liverpool on Sunday,” he said. “The victories so far have been against 10-man Chelsea and Burnley and Sunderland, who came up from the Championship last year, and both at home.",
      "“So you’re looking at that and saying ‘okay, this is another big test’ and this is a massive test. If we go there and get humiliated then the pressure is going to build. So, fingers crossed.”",

      "As the Premier League clubs prepare to vote on a new ‘salary cap’ rule known as ‘anchoring’ we’ve crunched some already-crunched numbers to work out exactly why Chelsea and the Manchester clubs are in a state of panic.",
      "Under the proposed system, clubs would be limited to spending no more than five times the broadcast and prize revenue earned by the team finishing last in the Premier League on their ‘football squad costs’, which include wages, amortisation (transfer fees spread over duration of contract) and agents’ fees.",
      "Based on the 2024/2025 prize money table, that would mean a spending limit of £546m for Premier League clubs.",
      "Anchoring would work on top of the squad-cost ratio rules (SCR), which could replace the existing profit and sustainability rules which permit losses of £105m over three years. SCR limits spending to 85% of revenue.",
      "To be approved, the proposal would require support from at least 14 of the 20 clubs, and unsurprisingly, Manchester United chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe is dead set against the idea.",
      "“[Anchoring] would inhibit the top clubs in the Premier League,” Ratcliffe said. “And the last thing you want is for the top clubs in the Premier League not to be able to compete with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, PSG – that’s absurd. And if it does, it then ceases to be the finest league in the world.”",
      "Is that “the last thing you want”? Answers on a postcard. It’s undoubtedly the last thing United want, along with Manchester City and Chelsea, who would now be in breach if the rules were in place this season.",
      "Well, we don’t quite know. The wages and amortisation figures we’ve used from the brilliant Swiss Ramble are from the 2023/2024 season, along with the agent and intermediary payments from 2024/2025, but it gives us a decent idea, so we’ve ranked Premier League teams (excluding the relegated/promoted trios) from lowest season expenditure to highest.",
      "The proposal is for a second breach to be dealt with by a six-point deduction, with an additional point for every £6.5m spent over the £546m mark, so we’ve also worked out just how many points the three offenders would have been docked.",

      "Peter Schmeichel has hit out at Manchester United over five mistakes in the transfer market, including one summer signing brought in purely because one “powerful” Red Devils chief just had to “make a mark” at the club.",
      "Ruben Amorim remains under significant pressure at United – he’s second in the sack race – having picked up just 37 points in his 34 Premier League games in charge and faces the daunting task of Liverpool at Anfield as they return to action after the international break on Sunday.",
      "And Schmeichel is baffled by his former club’s moves in the transfer market; in particular their £66m signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig to replace Rasmus Hojlund, who moved to Napoli.",
      "While Sesko has two goals in eight appearances for United this term, Hojlund has hit the ground running in Naples, scoring four in six, having been given the service that Schmeichel believes he would have received at Old Trafford had he remained at the club.",
      "“At United you’ve got a head coach [Ruben Amorim], then you had a director of football [Dan Ashworth], a technical director or whatever Jason Wilcox’s title is, and you’ve got a head of recruitment [Christopher Vivell], who is very powerful,” he told BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning.",
      "“You’ve got a lot of people deciding on who is coming in.",
      "“For instance, the signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years.",
      "“You only have to see what he’s doing at Napoli with Kevin de Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with – he’s scoring goals.",
      "“I’ve consistently said this for two and a half years – Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goals-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service.",
      "“We let him go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service.”",
      "On top of signing Sesko and getting rid of Hojlund, Schmiechel is also struggling to understand United’s failure to sign a new No.6 and not bringing in an experienced goalkeeper, claiming Vivell has a “different agenda” to Amorim.",
      "He added: “You spend £70m-plus on Sesko, when we don’t have the number six we should have, and there’s the goalkeeping position as well.",
      "“This season alone we’ve conceded nine goals from goalkeeping errors. When I played, when Edwin van der Sar played, when David de Gea played, the brief was win 10 points a season, you don’t give points away.",
      "“Why did we bring someone in that we didn’t need? Because the head of recruitment comes from Leipzig [also Sesko’s former club] and he’s got to make a mark.",
      "“When I played, the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson] was in charge. He said ‘him in and him out’. Now it’s different people with different agendas that decide. How can you create a stable environment to have a football team that can go out and win every game?”",

      "Finally, Schmeichel claimed United made a big mistake in selling Scott McTominay, who drove Napoli to the Scudetto last season despite being “so Manchester United”.",
      "“What’s he doing at Napoli?” said Schmeichel. “He is so Manchester United.",
      "“The problem was his versatility, because you have players who can only play in one position. Managers didn’t trust him to build the team around. They want the neat players. He was the victim of that time and again.",
      "“Phil Neville was a little bit the same. He never really got a starting XI spot, but he played an awful lot of games because he could play different roles.",
      "“I don’t get why those two are at Napoli. You will get no-one with more enthusiasm for Manchester United than Rasmus Hojlund. He was writing about playing for the club when he was 10 years old. He’s a massive fan.",
      "“And the fans love him because he was working so hard for the team and he never complained.”",

      "The Chelsea chiefs will see the Golden Boy shortlist as justification for their project to hoover up as much young talent as possible.",
      "The Golden Boy is an award established by Tuttosport that is given by sports journalists to a young male footballer playing in Europe perceived to have been the most impressive during a calendar year. All nominees must be under the age of 21 and play in the top tier of a European nation.",
      "Previous winners include Lionel Messi (2005), Kylian Mbappe (2017) and Jude Bellingham (2023), while the 2024 award went to Spain international Lamine Yamal, who’s not on the 2025 shortlist as no player can win it twice.",
      "Of the 25 players included on the shortlist, 20 have ‘qualified’ automatically via their ranking on the Football Benchmark Index, which takes performances on the pitch, playing time and the strength of the teams each player plays for into account. Another five ‘wildcard’ picks – chosen by the Tuttosport editorial staff – have been included to complete the 25-player shortlist.",
      "Ten of the nominees hail from the Premier League and Chelsea have the joint-most players in contention, along with Real Madrid and PSG.",
      "Brazilian wonderkid Estevao surely has the best chance of any of the Blues (maybe any Premier League player) to actually claim the gong, but Jorrel Hato and Mamadou Sarr, who’s on loan at sister club Strasbourg, are also in contention. Add Geovany Quenda – who will join the club from Sporting at the end of the season – and the Blues have Real Madrid beat.",

      "Another classic international break is in the books, and who could forget the thrills and spills of England’s rollercoaster ride to an easy 3-0 win over Wales and an easy 5-0 win over Latvia?",
      "Truly, the history books will have to be rewritten. Everything else is a footnote. England are going to the World Cup. We thought they might.",
      "We all know there’s a conspicuous elephant in the England selection room right now and we’re sure you’re eager to see just how far Jude Bellingham has fallen here. Some of you may even have skipped ahead. Naughty, but we’ll forgive you.",
      "Personally we’re more interested in just how far Djed Spence has climbed, but we fully appreciate that might just be us.",
      "As ever, the number-one and most important rule to keep in mind with the Ladder is this: this is not our top 50, but our best guess at what we think Thomas Tuchel’s top 50 is. And, just to set ourselves thoroughly up for November’s disastrous fall, we do think we’re starting to get a handle on how he’s approaching the job now. And who that is good/bad news for.",
      "Last month’s England Ladder is here for your perusal, with the brackets below indicating each player’s ranking within it.",
      "",
      "And just like we always do and just like we knew we would again, after bumping Kane down a spot just to feel alive we pop him straight back to the top. Has perhaps never been under less threat for his starting spot in this team, and does seem like a fever dream now to consider he was struggling so much during the Euros last summer that actual cheers greeted him being replaced by Ollie Watkins.",
      "The lack of competition for his place might be of more concern if he wasn’t just so unbelievably brilliant. We will still fight anyone who says he’s playing better than ever; he’s just doing all the same incredible things he did for years and years and years except instead of doing them for a silly team in a truly elite league he’s doing them for a truly elite team in a silly league.",
      "But the key thing here is the incredibleness and brilliance. Even those of us who believe his real goal tally to be zero must accept that Kane is now quite likely to reach 100 goals for a country where for over a century the 50-goal mark appeared to represent an unbreakable ceiling.",
      "Ronaldo-like longevity cannot be ruled out for a player who looks after himself impeccably, making it highly conceivable that when his England career does finally end he will have twice as many goals as any other England player in history.",
      "And people will still argue he isn’t an all-time great. Maybe he just needs a haircut.",
      "",
      "Just a brilliant player whose role and its importance grows with every game for both club and country. A perfect example of how stepping up in class as he did when leaving West Ham for Arsenal can help mould an excellent player into a truly world-class one.",
      "Very little more you could want from a midfielder than what Rice now delivers on a regular basis, and his set-piece prowess in particular absolutely screams tight-tournament-game difference-maker.",
      "As we say in every Ladder these days, the numbers next to his and Harry Kane’s names are largely meaningless because both are absolute nailed-on certainties.",
      "",
      "Has played every competitive game since Thomas Tuchel took over and has conceded not one goal. Quality of opposition a factor, for sure, but it’s still a remarkable degree of faultlessness for a player who absolutely loves playing for England and has become exceptionally good at it.",
      "",
      "Brilliant against Wales, quieter against Latvia, still we’re pretty certain when push comes to tournament shove a definite starter on the right in a full-strength England team, no matter how persuasive and admirable and extremely-useful-to-have-around-just-in-case the charms of Noni Madueke may be.",
      "As it is for England, so it is for Arsenal. It’s a very good situation for both, and there’s no real need to complicate it beyond that, we don’t think.",
      "",
      "Lovely to have him back in an England shirt for the first time in a year, and it just looked and felt right to have him there. There really is a lovely experienced and reassuringly reliable spine to that England team with Stones back in position ahead of Pickford and behind Rice and Kane.",
      "",
      "Continues to look utterly suited to and entirely unflustered by international football, and that partnership with Rice already looks like one that manages the neat yet deceptively difficult trick for a midfield duo of highlighting and accentuating each man’s strengths rather than each man’s flaws.",
      "It’s a trick that has quite famously proved beyond some of England’s very best central midfielders ever.",
      "One of the biggest and most significant problems to which Tuchel had to find a swift answer on this short sprint to attempted World Cup glory was ‘Who partners Declan Rice in midfield?’",
      "It is no longer a big or significant problem.",
      "",
      "His absence against Latvia was reportedly nothing more than ‘managing minutes’ so for now we’re still assuming he’s ahead of Ezri Konsa in the centre-back pecking order but there’s no real doubt now that both are in the top three of said centre-back pecking order.",
      "We very much enjoyed his ‘centre-back playmaker’ role against Wales. You just don’t see that often.",
      "",
      "Injured Reece James is injured. So, so utterly frustrating, but it does at least appear on this occasion that his latest absence from England duty was precautionary rather than strictly necessary and represented just some sensible club-country joint dialogue and decision-making towards a mutually beneficial final outcome.",
      "We’re very sure that a fully fit James is Tuchel’s first-choice right-back, given their history and James’ quality, but above all that because of the fact that in his absence during this break Tuchel didn’t actually even take the chance to look at a different right-back.",
      "Centre-back Ezri Konsa did the job for most of the Wales game, with left-back Djed Spence finishing that job and then staying there for the Latvia game.",
      "A left-back doing a passable fill-in job at right-back was at least a fun little Tuchel reversal of one of Gareth Southgate’s favourite tropes.",
      "",
      "We find ourselves in agreement with Tuchel but not, perhaps, with a majority of England fans that Gordon is the first-choice starter on the left-wing now.",
      "As with Morgan Rogers, the evidence Tuchel is showing us tells us that’s how he sees it, Gordon having started each of the last three games.",
      "We didn’t really understand much of the criticism of Gordon’s performance against Wales. The frustration that the end product wasn’t quite there is fine, but it seemed to be overplayed in regard to what was there, which was further evidence of how Gordon’s direct running on the left offers a counterpoint and contrast to England’s more methodical and patient approach elsewhere, giving them the ability to alter the pace and direction of their attacks in a pleasingly defence-disorienting manner.",
      "He also struck up an instant rapport with Djed Spence that possibly answers another of England’s thornier pre-World Cup posers.",
      "But even if the criticisms after Wales were valid, the Latvia performance silenced them. Created a big early chance for Harry Kane – and if you create a big chance for Harry Kane at this moment in time and don’t end up with an assist to show for it you can count yourself particularly unfortunate – before grabbing his chance to score a brilliant counter-attack goal the one moment Latvia’s back nine were briefly otherwise engaged on a rare and foolhardy attack .",
      "Your mileage may vary, but for us for now – and, far more importantly, for Tuchel – he’s won the battle with Marcus Rashford.",
      "",
      "A better showing against Latvia really would have been even more persuasive but when you combine the fact Rogers has started four of England’s last five qualifiers, including each of the last three in the No. 10 position, with everything Tuchel has side about backing and continuing to select the men in possession who are doing the business for him it becomes impossible to conclude anything other than that at this moment of time Rogers is England’s first choice in that position.",
      "And, as ever, while we may call it ‘our’ F365 England Ladder it is always nothing more nor less than our best guess at figuring out the current England manager’s Ladder.",
      "Sweep away all the narrative and the discourse and the noise, and when viewed like that it’s pretty clear how the land currently lies.",
      "",
      "Resurrected his Tottenham career in spectacular style last season, culminating in Europa League glory and a long-awaited chance for another trophy-and-cigars photo op, and now spending this season making a momentous climb in the England standings.",
      "In the summer, we had him down at 47 among the ‘might be in with a shot if injuries strike, we suppose’ afterthought slots, far too close to Phil Neville for comfort. By last month he’d jumped into a tentative ‘could make the final squad, actually’ position. And now we think he’s Tuchel’s first-choice left-back. Fight us.",
      "He’s the best pure defender England have available among their vast array of full-back options, probably on either flank, and our argument would be this: if you’re starting him, as Tuchel did in both games here, in friendlies and straightforward easily-won qualifiers, then you are surely definitely going to start him in your actual tournament games where defending might actually matter.",
      "Despite starting his career the other way round, Spence is now definitely a left-back who can do a job at right-back, and for England that really is probably the more useful way round to be. Is clearly working on becoming a more effective contributor to the attacking side of the game, and, while Wales were startlingly and surprisingly flimsy opposition at Wembley, there were plenty of encouraging signs in the way he and Gordon linked up on the left flank that night.",
      "He just looks the right fit at the right time, and a potentially huge beneficiary of Tuchel walking the walk with his ‘backing the players who deliver for me’ approach to selection.",
      "READ: Roy Keane guilty of lazy stereotypes with Djed Spence ‘defensive side’ worries",
      "",
      "The elephant in the room and the press have basically already told us this is going to be the only talking point for the now-moribund November international break. With England qualifying in record time and flawless fashion (six games, six wins, no goals conceded remember) something has to be bad and terrible and that something is going to be the Bellingham Situation. It already is the Bellingham Situation, but next month’s Bellingham Week will plumb fresh depths.",
      "And there’s no way out of it for any of us now. It’s going to be all the media want to talk about, which they will combine with sad shaking of their heads as if they are not responsible for any of it. And this happens especially if Tuchel picks him in November, but especially if he doesn’t.",
      "Which brings us to the big question for our purposes. Will Tuchel in fact pick him? It does seem to have been almost entirely overlooked and/or forgotten that this is a player who’s played about 120 minutes of football this season and for whom a fortnight spent building up fitness and sharpness really might prove just more useful in the long term than playing in two really very low-key and low-pressure internationals for England.",
      "But we must also consider that Tuchel is not keeping secrets or playing games. He’s very, very clear: he will back the players who deliver for him, and across the last two Bellingham-less international breaks, England’s non-Bellinghams have delivered for him. Tuchel even suggested Bukayo Saka only got back in this time because Noni Madueke, in Tuchel’s eyes the man in possession, was injured.",
      "This one really does feel like it’s more about Bellingham now than Tuchel. The England manager has no vendetta against Bellingham and nothing he’s said suggests he has any problem at all with picking him again in the future. But Tuchel is evidently now very comfortable with not picking Bellingham, and England’s results mean only Bellingham can change that. He has to a) play and b) play well for Real Madrid.",
      "If he does that, we’re pretty sure Tuchel will pick him. But it still feels pretty wild to be having any of this kind of uncertainty about a player who has for several Ladders in a row now formed part of the straightforward default top five. A group including Kane, Rice, Saka and Pickford, where, sure, there might be some internal shuffling of the order amongst them but you were still always dealing with the core five inked-in certain starters. At the very, very least, Bellingham is no longer part of that little group.",
      "",
      "An international break that did absolutely no harm to Konsa’s rock-solid squad-member status. Did a perfectly passable job as right-back in the first game before slotting seamlessly into his more customary centre-back role for the second.",
      "Neither game was among the more arduous of Konsa’s career, but there was one excellent tracking run and last-gasp chance-snuffing tackle for the highlight reel in Riga.",
      "He’s still one player where we will deviate slightly from the general rule that Tuchel’s most recent starters are his starters, because there are explanations as to why Konsa started both games.",
      "We don’t think he starts when everyone is available, given the explanations at hand for why Konsa started these games – and did so in different positions.",
      "What he definitely hasn’t done is fall many rungs from his previous ‘just outside the starting XI’ position.",
      "",
      "Seems very unlikely Henderson could play his way into a first-choice starting role in England’s dynamic new midfield, but also feels even less likely he could now play his way out of his current squad role as canny senior pro and standards-setter.",
      "Again, we don’t need to overcomplicate this one. Tuchel has picked him in his squad at every opportunity, but started him in a game only once, with five further caps coming as a relatively late substitute.",
      "You don’t necessarily have to agree with it or like it, but you can’t argue with the role clarity on display here.",
      "",
      "A very lively cameo from the bench in Riga adds another layer of intrigue to the No. 10 battle, while Eze also obviously offers another tantalising option in the wide areas.",
      "Has made four appearances for England during this qualifying campaign, with three of those as substitute for the last 30-odd minutes.",
      "We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: we’re still getting to know Tuchel and his ways and, while we do think we’re getting the hang of him now, when he shows us how he sees a player with this level of clarity we will cheerfully go along with it.",
      "Eze is a valued and valuable member of the squad, a dynamic game-changing option from the bench, but not yet a regular starter. All of that is absolutely fine.",
      "",
      "Got himself a goal in a decent enough performance against Wales, and we have absolutely no problem at all with Watkins filling that all-important Harry Kane’s Back-up role that exists in any England squad.",
      "What we do have a problem with is the fact Watkins now appears to be pretty much as unchallenged for that particular role as Kane is for his.",
      "",
      "Deeply unfortunate injury timing given how well he was playing for both club and country, but when he returns we fully expect him to be a thoroughly capable and entirely trusted Saka back-up for both club and country.",
      "",
      "Came on for Gordon in both games this month. A slight curiosity of that is that this therefore represents a break where his place within the squad has become more assured even as he has slipped slightly further away from a starting berth.",
      "Does just feel like Tuchel prefers what Gordon offers on that left-hand side, but Rashford has done himself no harm with his form for Barcelona or work during this camp, and offers a nice level of international and big-tournament know-how in a squad that is still a bit of a mix of a handful of extremely experienced veterans and a whole bunch of excellent but quite inexperienced players, yet not all that many in the 40-80 cap sweet spot.",
      "",
      "Current reports suggest an eight-week lay-off for Livramento after that nasty looking injury against Arsenal. Could have been better, could also have been much worse. But it does mean that he’s also set to miss the November international break and hand Djed Spence further opportunity to bed himself in as England’s first-choice left-back, a position that had looked there for Livramento’s taking.",
      "",
      "Assorted injury hassles have restricted him to barely an hour of football for England during Thomas Tuchel’s reign to date, meaning he is one player it is still desperately hard to place. Is he a Gordon, or is he a Foden? We just don’t yet quite know exactly how Tuchel sees him.",
      "This is where we were with just about every player a few windows ago; it’s a relief at least that Palmer is now something of an outlier in that regard.",
      "",
      "Still the only other goalkeeper Tuchel has used besides Pickford during his eight games in charge, sitting on the bench in the No. 13 shirt for each of the other seven.",
      "Ergo: he’s the second-choice keeper until we see some kind of evidence that he isn’t.",
      "",
      "An obviously excellent footballer but perhaps the least starry of England’s many, many attacking options across both flanks.",
      "Yet we must again defer to the evidence Tuchel is presenting us. Bowen has been involved in all but one of the international breaks for which Tuchel has been in charge, and has made an appearance in five of the six games for which he’s been in the squad.",
      "And if you’re a fringe player who was going to miss out on one international break so far under Tuchel, you would definitely want it to be that grisly one in the summer where England scraped a wholly unconvincing 1-0 qualifying win over Andorra before losing a friendly to Senegal.",
      "Shrewd work from Bowen; the only other Tuchel game in which he’s played no part at all was the other game against Andorra, in which England were scruffy 2-0 winners.",
      "Causation and correlation be damned; the facts are that Bowen has played some part in Tuchel’s five most convincing matches as manager of England, and no part in the three least convincing. If nothing else, it’s a handy knack.",
      "",
      "A key rule of Thomas Tuchel England squads does appear to be that once you’re in them, it is up to someone else to force you out. And after seven years in the international wilderness, Loftus-Cheek is now very much in Tuchel’s England squads.",
      "",
      "In the squad again, and came off the bench against Latvia to perform a role that mainly amounted to being a very, very large target for England’s flurry of free-kicks and corners in the closing minutes of a long-settled contest.",
      "What it does do is tell us that he’s still one of Tuchel’s four centre-back picks at this stage, albeit clearly the least secure with Stones, Guehi and Konsa all looking like World Cup certainties.",
      "",
      "Look, third-choice keeper is rarely a position to worry yourself about unduly. If you reach a point in a tournament where you’re using your third-choice keeper, you’re probably already mired in deep and inescapable sh*t anyway.",
      "And the fact Trafford has sat on the bench as third-choice keeper for every single one of Tuchel’s games to date remains the most compelling data point available to us.",
      "But there’s an obvious cloud on the horizon here with Trafford having lost the No. 1 spot at Man City to Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Pretty hard to argue at this time that if England did find themselves having to actually use a third-choice keeper that you’d be more reassured to see Trafford out there than, say, Nick Pope.",
      "",
      "If you’re a promising young midfielder and Pep Guardiola says he wants to turn you into a full-back, let him. Earned his first senior call-up this month after Reece James’ withdrawal, and while he didn’t get his chance in the end against either Wales or Latvia nor did any other right-back.",
      "Which means under the rules of Tuchelism, O’Reilly is in until he isn’t. Because there has to be another full-back in there; you cannot possibly pick Reece James as your only specialist right-back and then rely on Spence or a shuffled-along centre-back as your only cover.",
      "Whether that ends up being O’Reilly or someone less rogue, time will tell. But again. Tuchel’s rules, not ours. Nothing we can do about that, apart from the times when we decide we’re simply going to break them.",
      "",
      "Did get some minutes against Wales, but did little with them really. He’s a damn fine player and one of our favourites, but very clearly now sits behind Morgan Rogers and probably Eberechi Eze and, when it comes down to it, almost certainly also Jude Bellingham among England’s really very good No. 10 options. And we’ve not even mentioned Cole Palmer or Phil Foden, until just now, when we did mention them.",
      "With Anderson’s emergence reducing the likelihood of any Bellingham return being alongside rather than in front of Rice in England’s midfield, it does all rather leave Gibbs-White looking like your classic ‘one of six players cut from the provisional squad’ next summer. The James Ward-Prowse role, if you will.",
      "",
      "You felt for him during the Latvia game. Just isn’t playing enough football for Arsenal, and short of a Riccardo Calafiori injury we’re really not sure that’s going to change. It was entirely understandable that he looked so far off it when handed a chance to impress in Riga, but the problem for Lewis-Skelly is that there isn’t really a huge amount he can do about it apart from just knuckle down and hope.",
      "Currently hard to shift the notion that with all things being equal and if nothing materially changes between now and next summer he will find himself behind both Djed Spence and a fit-again Tino Livramento in the pecking order.",
      "And third-choice left-back isn’t usually a great position to be in when tournament squads are being finalised and whittled down.",
      "",
      "Might be a slight case of heart ruling head here because we really do love Wharton and feel like England might have missed a trick with him. Elliot Anderson appears to have locked down a starting spot alongside Rice and that’s all good. We have no issue there; Anderson is a fine player and definitely seems to be one of those who just looks right at home in the international game.",
      "But it would be a massive shame if Tuchel can’t find at least a squad role for someone of Wharton’s supreme talent and ability to offer a fresh approach from an unusual angle. He’s your classic ‘footballer in an era of athletes’ kind of player, one who just sees the game slightly differently, capable of spotting and most importantly delivering the kind of passes others simply cannot.",
      "The concerns around his ability to cover the requisite ground for Tuchelball are valid if dreary, but we do love the idea of Wharton as a bench option for times when a particularly stubborn low block requires unlocking.",
      "And luckily we can bump him up the list slightly here without breaking any of our own rules, because Tuchel himself admitted Wharton was unlucky to be overlooked this time around given his Crystal Palace form.",
      "‘He deserves to be with us,’ Tuchel said after naming his latest squad. Yes, Thomas. Yes he does. If only there were someone who could make that happen.",
      "",
      "Has spent pretty much his entire England career being just about the hardest player to place in the Ladder and the one most likely to make us look very clever and then very stupid on a month-by-month rota basis.",
      "We still don’t have much idea what to do with him and precious little Tuchel-era data to go by. The positive spin on it might be that while Reece James does appear to be Tuchel’s first choice the manager didn’t take the chance to look at any other actual right-backs during James’ absence this month, which would indicate a door that remains there to be opened.",
      "Does, though, still feel like the question at the moment with TAA and the World Cup is not so much ‘Is he in the squad?’ but ‘How far away from the squad is he?’",
      "",
      "Could a great big grown-up year like 2026 really feature a good old-fashioned, full-throated Jack Grealish Clamour? It absolutely f*cking could, you know. We are so back.",
      "",
      "Remember when Tuchel started him over Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back that time? That was a good bit. And people say Germans have no sense of humour.",
      "",
      "The only way is down until something changes. And that change is going to have to be increasingly drastic while looking increasingly unlikely. Foden is currently destined for an absolute puzzle of an England career.",
      "",
      "Has impressed for Bayer Leverkusen after a summer move Liverpool might live to regret to a fairly hefty degree, and was on the bench for the Wales game before being forced out of the squad to face Latvia by injury. Stones, Guehi and Konsa appear absolute certainties for the final squad, but there does look like being at least one centre-back spot – currently held by Dan Burn – for which competition at least still exists.",
      "",
      "Playing Premier League and Champions League football – and playing them very well indeed apart from that costly 30-second wobble against Arsenal – while England’s third-choice goalkeeper rides the bench at Man City. Has to give him some chance, doesn’t it? And at the very least positions him as a non-panic-inducing option should some misfortune or other befall any of the three keepers currently ahead of him.",
      "",
      "That Senegal game really did hurt a lot of chances for a lot of players.",
      "",
      "You do occasionally just get those players where, for no apparent rhyme or reason, international football just passes them by. With each passing international break the fear grows that Branthwaite really could find himself alongside Steve Bruce on Sporcle quizzes 15 years from now.",
      "",
      "Permanently injured, which really doesn’t help your chances of an international recall. Yet a glance around the Premier League reveals just how little Solanke might have to do for Spurs if/when he does recover from injury to find his way back into the England frame should Ollie Watkins or, heaven help us all, Harry Kane get injured.",
      "",
      "Almost ever-present for Man United this year, but might actually be higher up this Ladder if he’d just simply been injured again. As it is, his very apparent availability and continued absence from Thomas Tuchel’s squad tells a pretty clear story for a man whose final England appearance now looks increasingly likely to be the Euro 2024 final.",
      "The fact he plays as the left of three centre-backs for United also doesn’t help his dwindling international recall hopes given his way in to a Tuchel squad would surely be at left-back.",
      "However, he cannot yet be entirely discounted purely due to doubts around other options. Newcastle pair Tino Livramento and Lewis Hall are both currently injured, and Lewis-Skelly is desperately short of minutes for Arsenal.",
      "It really might not take many more misfortunes to befall England’s left-backs before Shaw finds himself back in the fold.",
      "",
      "Still technically the most recent striker called up by Tuchel that isn’t Kane or Watkins, so technically we guess still third choice there? We should probably put him a place or two higher, really, given the rules. But just can’t quite bring ourselves to do so.",

Ineos are backing United and know the sort of finances need to compete at the top.”",
      "Brighton chairman Tony Bloom insisted that Man Utd’s pursuit of Baleba was not a saga as the Red Devils very quickly “went away” after learning the midfielder wasn’t available for sale.",
      "Bloom said: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga.There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn’t available this summer and they went away.",

      "🔴 Amorim's system could trouble Liverpool💪 Merino showing his value to Arsenal🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Ruben Amorim's system continues to dominate the discourse around Manchester United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw but it might just work in his side's favour when they face Liverpool on Super Sunday.",
      "Arne Slot's side, on an uncharacteristic run of three consecutive defeats, tend to find playing against back threes more difficult.",
      "The issue has been most apparent against Crystal Palace, one of few other Premier League sides who habitually deploy a back three. Liverpool are winless in three games against them if you throw in the penalty-shootout defeat in the Community Shield in August.",
      "Even the five Premier League games Liverpool have won against back threes since the start of last season, away at Crystal Palace, Southampton and Burnley and at home against Wolves and West Ham, have been nervy affairs settled by one-goal margins.",
      "Manchester United have of course caused problems for Slot's side too, securing a 2-2 draw on their last visit to Anfield in January, when they used their wing-backs to create overloads in wide areas in a performance described by Gary Neville as their best under Amorim.",
      "They will return to Anfield as underdogs on Sunday. Amazingly, Manchester United are yet to win back-to-back Premier League games under Amorim. But their last visit offers a blueprint to follow and they typically fare better in these kinds of assignments.",
      "In fact, in Premier League games in which they have had less possession than their opponent under Amorim, Manchester United's win rate is nearly twice as high as when they have had more, while their loss rate drops from 64 per cent to 25 per cent.",
      "The numbers are of course influenced to some extent by game-state. A team holding a lead is more likely to relinquish possession, just as a team trailing is more likely to have more of it as they try to open their opponent up and find a way back into the game.",
      "But the trend is not unique to Manchester United.",
      "Since the start of last season, Premier League sides using back threes have had less possession, on average, in games they have won and drawn compared to the games they have lost.",
      "It supports the argument that a back three is a reactive system, and at its most effective, at least in most cases, when used as a means to absorb pressure and spring forward quickly using transitions.",
      "Whether it is the right approach for a club of Manchester United's stature in the long-term is debateable. On Sunday against Liverpool, though, it probably offers their best hope of getting a result.",
      "The 29-year-old made it six goals in four appearances for Spain with his double against Bulgaria on Tuesday. Only Erling Haaland and Memphis Depay have scored more times in European World Cup qualifying. Merino's tally is equal to Harry Kane's.",
      "His eye for goal is not new. Merino has scored 16 times in 35 games for club and country since his late double in Arsenal's 2-0 win over Leicester in February, when he was pressed into the role of striker for the first time following an injury to Kai Havertz.",
      "The positional change proved transformative for Merino, who had never previously played up front. But his goals for Spain have come from midfield and so did his latest for Arsenal, the headed equaliser in the late victory over Newcastle at St James' Park.",
      "Merino excels at timing his runs into the box. \"He can smell danger,\" said Mikel Arteta in February. But his extraordinary aerial threat, showcased again with his headed double against Bulgaria, is not his only weapon when it comes to finishing scoring chances.",
      "Spain's Luis de la Fuente uses the same term. \"He is so complete, we are lucky to have him,\" he said. Merino's value to Arteta is similarly clear. But it is fair to say perceptions externally are not universally positive. He continues to be mischaracterised as a defensive player, his selection seen by some as a symbol of conservatism.",
      "Merino is not a fleet-footed creator in the mould of Eberechi Eze or Martin Odegaard, that is true. But he would not be starting every game for Spain if he lacked technical ability and his off-the-ball qualities are invaluable in pressing opponents high up the pitch.",
      "Goals are of course the most important currency of all and, in Merino's case, it is worth noting context as well as volume.",
      "He counts Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle, Real Madrid, France and Netherlands among the teams he has scored against over the last eight months. His eight Premier League goals have won Arsenal twice as many points as any other player's.",
      "It all adds up to make him vitally important to both club and country, despite fierce competition for places on both fronts. It would be no surprise to see him show his value again at Craven Cottage.",
      "Donyell Malen was Aston Villa's match-winner as his double clinched a 2-1 victory over Burnley in their last game and he added another goal for Netherlands during the international break.",
      "He has had to be patient since arriving at Villa from Borussia Dortmund in January but looks ready to belatedly make his mark in the Premier League with Spurs next up on Sunday.",
      "Last week's column examined Mohamed Salah's dip for Liverpool and why he's missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. There was also a look at Arsenal's formidable defensive numbers this season and Graham Potter's unceremonious end at West Ham.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and sees value in backing Man Utd at Liverpool.",
      "Ange Postecoglou's arrival at Nottingham Forest came with big promises of high tempo, pressing and attacking football but so far what we've seen is a defence creaking under the pressure of playing Postecoglou's style. Forest are leaking goals at a rate of 2.1 per 90 minutes since the Aussie took charge.",
      "So my eyes are drawn to the anytime goalscorer market for Chelsea. Enter Alejandro Garnacho at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Chelsea under Enzo Maresca are looking to use wide players more than Garnacho was utilised at Manchester United - here, he can stretch defences and find more one-vs-one opportunities. Garnacho has already shown glimpses in his early appearances that he could be the next player to flourish away from the Old Trafford spotlight.",
      "Given the defensive issues at Forest and Garnacho's knack for getting in the right place at the right time, he looks great value to score with Sky Bet in a game that should sail past the over 2.5 goals line.",
      "Being ahead of a curve is the name of the game when trying to consistently beat the market. And betting against Brighton before it becomes trendy to do so is very much a tactic on my radar.",
      "Yes, they are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are. Brighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.5 expected goals per game over the last 14 Premier League matches - that's the worst per-90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.",
      "Their pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 19 Premier League games, too.",
      "The fact we can get a team as reliable and dangerous as Newcastle at 10/11 on the draw no bet makes this best-bet-of-the-weekend material.",
      "Every so often in the Premier League, a fixture becomes more than just three points. There's six points on offer here.",
      "Both clubs know a win shifts momentum, belief and in many cases season trajectories. And these 'six-pointers' very often produce open, high-intensity, attacking football - something which isn't portrayed by the market.",
      "The last 33 'six pointers' in the Premier League - a subjective definition of the fixture - has seen an average of 2.8 goals scored. When assessing the odds, the 6/5 being dangled by Sky Bet on over 2.5 goals being scored is hard to resist.",
      "Both sides have quietly made a habit of turning this fixture into a cure for insomnia. The last nine meetings between the two have all landed for under 2.5 goals backers with just a measly total of 10 goals scored in those nine meetings.",
      "And Palace are fast becoming a friend of the under-goals backer with Oliver Glasner building such a watertight defensive unit. Across their last 17 games in all competitions the average match goals sits at just 1.85 per 90.",
      "The market hasn't quite caught up with just how consistently dull this fixture has been. Under 2.5 goals should be shorter than it is at 10/11 with Sky Bet and represents the best angle into what looks set to be a tight, cagey contest.",
      "Jake O'Brien vs Jeremy Doku is shaping up to be a mismatch and one punters should be looking to profit from.",
      "If O'Brien emerges from this duel with clean shorts, his shoes on the right feet and a clean sheet, I'll tip my betting cap to him. But I'd rather side with reality and back him to get carded at 7/2 with Sky Bet, a price that screams value.",
      "Doku isn't just a livewire, he's a walking yellow card generator. The Belgian winger has been fouled 2.43 times per 90 in the Premier League this season and he is the reason why opposition right-backs and right centre-backs have picked up a card in six of City's seven games he's featured in.",
      "The numbers and the eye test both agree: Wolves are far better than their results suggest.",
      "There's a case to be made that Vitor Pereria's team have far more in the tank than the league table currently shows.",
      "Wolves have taken just two points from seven games but the expected points, based on their underlying metrics provided by Opta, show they should have seven points in the bag.",
      "That type of gulf usually evens itself out across a season and it is something to profit from.",
      "The chances are being created in attack and restricted to a good level in defence, so it's just the finishing touch of the Wolves strikers and very efficient finishing of opposition strikers that has been costing them in what is a fine-margin sport. When a little bit of regression to the mean kicks in, results will follow.",
      "Starting here, where they are 21/10 with Sky Bet for the away win.",
      "Arsenal have only conceded three goals in 10 games in all competitions - they are shipping the fewest goals per game of any team in Europe's major leagues. We shouldn't be surprised though as Mikel Arteta has been overseeing what has been one of the best defensive teams we've ever seen in the Premier League for three seasons now.",
      "That's why backing them to win matches along with the under 3.5 goals angle thrown into the mix at a juicier price is the smart way to boost Arsenal's outright win price here from 1/2 to 6/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "They dominate territory, limit chaos and once they get their noses in front, they manage games like a team with title-winning maturity. Across their last 18 wins in all competitions, 16 have landed for punters who have added the under 3.5 goal line into the equation. It should land again.",
      "The international break can be a problem for some managers - not Unai Emery.",
      "Aston Villa are unbeaten in the last 10 Premier League games after an international break, winning eight. Whatever Emery does in this fiddly time for managers is working wonders.",
      "Meanwhile, Spurs' encouraging start to life under Thomas Frank has been somewhat undermined by a pair of disappointing results in their last two Premier League home games after being battered by Bournemouth and only drawing with Wolves courtesy of a last-minute equaliser. It means Spurs have won just three of their 17 Premier League home games since November last year.",
      "Villa are an obvious play on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "The markets haven't quite woken up to just how sharp Amad Diallo has looked recently, nor how well he's linking up with Bryan Mbeumo, who's become his perfect foil in United's new-look attack.",
      "There's a real chemistry brewing here.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo might not have been the attacking duo many expected to define this United side, but their movement and understanding has been electric and could just be the catalyst for Ruben Amorim.",
      "At 9/2 to score with Sky Bet, the value's there on Amad.",
      "And against a Liverpool side that's been anything but watertight down their left flank, this looks the perfect storm for the United hotshot to make a big statement.",
      "Liverpool will, as always, dominate territory and possession but that only increases the space Amad can exploit on the counter. Pair that with his on-field connection with Mbeumo and United have the tools to create more problems for Liverpool, who do look short at 4/7 with Sky Bet for maximum points.",
      "West Ham are in 'season-defining' territory already.",
      "The Hammers are winless in eight home Premier League games, a run that played a huge part in Graham Potter losing his job. It's their longest winless run since moving to the London Stadium and, in its current miserable guise, the place feels a world away from Upton Park.",
      "When you're knee-deep in a relegation scrap, you don't need talk of 'underlying numbers' - you need street-fighting survival football. Nuno Espirito Santo brings exactly that.",
      "Call it what you want - reactive, pragmatic and at times boring - but it's effective when backs are against the wall. West Ham need points and Nuno will bag them plenty based on his body of work. The home win looks the call here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo is on track to reach an unprecedented scoring milestone but when he could hit his 1,000th goal? Between the Lines returns for a bonus edition to break down the numbers.",
      "Ronaldo set yet another scoring record when he became the outright top scorer in World Cup qualifying history with his double in Portugal's 2-2 draw against Hungary on Tuesday night.",
      "The goals put him on 41 from 51 World Cup qualifying games, moving him clear of the previous record-holder, former Guatemala striker Carlos Ruiz on 39, with Lionel Messi third in the list on 36.",
      "Ronaldo has now scored a record 143 goals in 225 games for his country in addition to 805 in 1,068 games at club level, putting him on a staggering combined total of 948 career goals.",
      "Ronaldo turned 40 in February but he continues to rack up impressive numbers at club level as well as internationally, albeit against weaker opposition in Saudi Arabia, where he has scored 104 goals in 117 appearances across four seasons with Al-Nassr.",
      "With 32 goals already for club and country in 2025, he is maintaining a remarkably consistent level of productivity in front of goal. Ronaldo has averaged more than 50 goals per calendar year since 2010.",
      "His highest scoring year came in 2013, when he smashed 69 goals and won the Ballon d'Or. Amazingly, his total has only dipped below 39 goals once in a calendar year in the last decade and a half.",
      "It seems there's a lot more to come from him too.",
      "With Portugal set to qualify for next summer's World Cup, and with two years to go on his Al-Nassr contract, Ronaldo is projected to become the first player in recorded history to reach the 1,000-goal mark in October 2026 based on his current scoring rate.",
      "Ronaldo's opening goal against Hungary was his 181st with his weaker left foot. His second was his 608th with his right.",
      "His double demonstrated his all-round threat attacking threat and Ronaldo is of course similarly dangerous aerially, with 157 of his goals, roughly 17 per cent, having come with his head.",
      "His goals have been split relatively evenly between home and away and neutral venues. His tally includes 178 penalties but he has also scored 135 times from outside the box, including 64 direct free-kicks.",
      "By competition, the biggest share of his goals has come in LaLiga, where he scored 311 times across nine seasons with Real Madrid.",
      "He remains the top scorer in Champions League history with 140 goals and also found the net 103 times across two spells in the Premier League with Manchester United.",
      "His favourite opponents, in terms of which sides he has scored the most goals against, are all based in Spain, with Sevilla, in particular, grateful to have seen the back of him.",
      "Ronaldo smashed 27 goals in just 18 appearances against the Andalucian side, with Real Madrid's bitter rivals Atletico and Barcelona also featuring high up in the list.",
      "Tottenham rank as his favourite English opponent, with Ronaldo having scored 14 times in 20 games against them, while Luxembourg are his favourite opponent internationally.",
      "On 948 and counting, Ronaldo's quest for 1,000 goals continues.",
      "On the subject of goalscoring, Monday's Between the Lines looked at England's reliance on Harry Kane and the worrying lack of other options. Where are all the English No 9s?",

      "Wednesday 15 October 2025 12:56, UK",
      "Which top performers are flying under the radar in the Premier League so far this season? We pick an Unsung Heroes XI...",
      "Henderson has been an integral part of Crystal Palace's recent club-record unbeaten run. The 28-year-old shot stopper started 18 of Palace's 19 unbeaten games between April and October and this season has kept six clean sheets in 11 appearances - no other Premier League goalkeeper has kept more clean sheets in all competitions this season.",
      "Henderson also boasts the best figures so far in the Premier League this season for xG prevented - he has conceded five Premier League goals this season despite being expected to have conceded almost eight goals.",
      "Signed permanently from Fiorentina this summer for £14m, Kayode has been one of Brentford's best attacking outlets this season. The 21-year-old Italian has started all of the Bees' seven Premier League games - either at right-back or right wing-back - and currently tops the charts for most successful dribbles of all Premier League defenders this season.",
      "He also ranks third of all defenders in the top flight this season for most passes played into the box (38) and fifth for most sprints (131).",
      "Senesi has been one of Bournemouth's key performers this season. He has been part of a well-marshalled defence which has helped steer his side to a club-record start to the season, with the Cherries winning 14 points from their opening seven Premier League games. The 28-year-old Argentine has started all of these games.",
      "His tenacity this season brings up a statistic that no other player in the division has made more clearances and interceptions combined than Senesi.",
      "Tarkowski has been very much Mr Reliable at the back in recent seasons for Everton. The 32-year-old has been ever-present for the Toffees in the Premier League this term and has helped them up into eighth position in the table - this time last season they were lying 16th.",
      "Tarkowski's strength is winning the ball for his team - of all Premier League defenders this season, only Patrick Dorgu has won more duels than the Englishman and only Virgil van Dijk has won more aerial duels.",
      "Mitchell has been another one of Palace's reliable constants in recent seasons with the 26-year-old having started 66 of Palace's last 67 Premier League games. It could be argued that he has been unlucky not to have added to his two England caps - the last of which came in 2022 - especially when you see that no player has won more tackles than him in the Premier League this season.",
      "He has also been productive offensively, whipping in seven successful open play crosses, the only defender with more this season is Wolves' Hugo Bueno.",
      "It seems the £29m paid by Everton for Dewsbury-Hall could be a shrewd piece of business. The 27-year-old started Everton's opening six Premier League games this season which was his best run of top-flight starts for two-and-a-half years. He started only two Premier League games for Chelsea in all of last season.",
      "When comparing his time so far at Everton to his previous four Premier League seasons for Leicester and Chelsea, we can see his passing accuracy has improved and he is creating more chances. His four chances created in the 2-0 win vs Brighton in August was the most he had made in a Premier League match since a game for Leicester in February 2023.",
      "Stach arrived from Hoffenheim for £17.4m this summer and the 26-year-old German hasn't looked back since. The 6ft 4in midfielder has started all seven of Leeds' Premier League games so far and has already recorded a goal and an assist - both coming in the 3-1 win at Wolves last month.",
      "His all-action game is backed up by the fact that only Elliot Anderson has covered more ground in the Premier League than Stach this season and only Bruno Fernandes and Jack Grealish have created more chances than the German.",
      "Ndiaye has been another one of Everton's bright sparks this season, the 25-year-old is the club's top scorer this season with three Premier League goals and, going further back, has nine goals in his last 18 league starts since January.",
      "The Senegalese attacker boasts a 50 per cent shot conversion rate this season, scoring from half of his six shots taken. No Everton player has shown more desire to win the ball back or to take a player on as the stats suggest.",
      "Minteh has arguably been Brighton's best player this season, the 21-year-old Gambian - signed from Newcastle for £30m in the summer of 2024 - has been an ever-present in the league and has recorded either a goal or an assist in three of Brighton's last four Premier League games.",
      "He currently ranks in the top two of all Premier League players this season for sprints (only Adrien Truffert more), touches in the opposition box (currently top with Jack Grealish) and successful take-ons (only Mohammed Kudus more).",
      "Anthony has made a blistering start to the season, having been involved in five of Burnley's seven Premier League goals scored so far. With four goals and an assist, only Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo have scored more goals this term. He has, in fact, scored four goals in his last six Premier League appearances, having scored just three in his previous 34.",
      "The 25-year-old - signed for just £8m from Bournemouth this summer - has outperformed his xG by +1.8 this season which is the fourth best record in the Premier League. Another standout stat is that the only Englishman to have scored more league goals than Anthony in Europe's major Leagues this season is Harry Kane.",
      "Brentford's No 9 has made an impressive start to the season having scored five goals in his eight appearances, including four Premier League goals - his first in the competition. Last season his campaign was disrupted with two knee injuries which is why the 24-year-old Brazilian made only one Premier League start for the Bees last term.",
      "Two of his four Premier League goals came inside the first 20 minutes in the 3-1 win vs Man Utd in late September - only Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney have scored more goals across Brentford's first six games of a Premier League season.",
