      "Marcus Rashford is expected to curb nightlife proclivities after Hansi Flick demanded his Barcelona side keep their partying activities to a minimum. The 27-year-old officially joined the La Liga champions on loan from Manchester United on Wednesday in his first foray into football outside of the UK.",
      "Describing the move as a \"dream come true\", Rashford was handed the number 14 shirt, the same number Arsenal icon Thierry Henry wore during his trophy-laden spell in Catalonia over 15 years ago.",
      "While the Englishman will be keen to get his career back on track after a troublesome couple of years at his boyhood club, he'll have to do so while abiding by Flick's stringent rules that he's established at Barcelona.",
      "The Spanish giants enjoyed a hugely successful campaign last season, where they won the domestic treble consisting of the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup. It may not be a coincidence that the abundance of silverware came after Flick's implementation of 10 strict rules, according to Spanish publication AS.",
      "There's since been one more rule added to the German's manager's list and that's to limit the amount of parties his players attend, reports Sport. Given the controversy Lamine Yamal found himself in after it was claimed entertainers with dwarfism had attended his lavish 18th birthday celebration, Flick is keen to avoid the added spotlight on his squad.",
      "While it's reported Flick hasn't banned players altogether from enjoying nights out on the town, he's said to have requested his players to have more discretion when doing so while having a greater focus on their footballing responsibilities.",
      "Avoiding cameras and attention in the newspapers is of paramount importance for Flick who aims to mount a strong title defence as well as bringing the Champions League trophy back to Barcelona for the first time since 2015.",
      "During his announcement as Barca's latest signing, Rashford explained why he chose to move to Spain as he said: \"I'm very excited. It's a club where people's dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the clubs stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here, because it's a family club, people are comfortable here and it's a good place for players to showcase their skills. I want to say thank you for the warm welcome. It's a different environment for me but it feels like home.",
      "\"I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and help this club win. They won so much last year and I can see the ambition is to do better than last year and that is what you want to hear as a player.",
      "\"It keeps you improving year on year and that's what you need to be - the best version of yourself. So I'm very excited to be here, eager to get the games going and I'm enjoying every minute of it.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wrexham have made a sensational bid to try and sign Christian Eriksen following his exit from Manchester United. The Red Dragons, owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, are looking to make a statement in the transfer market after securing promotion to the Championship in April.",
      "Manager Phil Parkinson has already brought in six new players so far this summer, including Plymouth striker Ryan Hardie, former Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward and Empoli left-back Liberato Cacace.",
      "The Welsh side's transfer activity significantly gathered pace this week following the arrivals of Bolton captain George Thomason, ex-Sheffield Wednesday forward Josh Windass and Nottingham Forest midfielder Lewis O'Brien.",
      "It's now being reported that Wrexham have also made an approach for Eriksen, who left United this summer. The midfielder, who has also turned out for Ajax, Tottenham, Inter Milan and Brentford during his career, has an impressive CV.",
      "The Danish international has won league titles in the Netherlands and Italy, as well as English domestic cup wins with United. Eriksen joining Wrexham would therefore represent a major coup for the Championship new boys.",
      "However, despite being impressed by the club's offer, the 33-year-old has turned down the chance to move to North Wales. According to Eriksen's agent, Martin Schoot, Eriksen is keen to play at the highest level for as long as possible and has been approached by clubs from around the globe, including Saudi Arabia, the United States, Turkey and Brazil.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Mail, Schoot said: \"Wrexham are really upgrading everything both on and off the field, and it is a hugely impressive project, as you can see from the presence of people like Michael Williamson [chief executive] there.",
      "\"But Christian still wants to play in a first-tier competition and he absolutely wants to stay in Western Europe. There are some contacts going on but it has to suit both sides.\"",
      "Wrexham's chief executive previously worked at Inter Milan in several senior roles between 2014 and 2018. While Williamson had already left by the time Eriksen arrived in 2020, the American is understood to be making the most of his Italian contacts to aid the Red Dragons' recruitment.",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",
      "But does it have a dedicated, quality source of information piped through to your inbox each week, free of ads but packed with informed opinion, analysis and even a little bit of fun each week? That's where Wrexham is the Game steps in...",
      "Available every Wednesday, it provides all the insights you need to be a top red. And for a limited time, a subscription to 'Wrexham is the Game' will cost fans just £15 for the first year.",
      "Sign up for Wrexham is the Game here",
      "Eriksen is not the first big name star to be linked with Wrexham this summer, with Leicester legend Jamie Vardy and Fulham skipper Tom Cairney also said to have been targeted by the club. Eriksen has made 144 appearances for his country during his career, scoring 46 goals in the process.",
      "He was signed by United in 2022 after shining for Brentford in the Premier League. The Bees brought Eriksen in following his recovery from a cardiac arrest, which he suffered on the pitch at the Euro 2020 tournament.",
      "Eriksen made 107 appearances and scored eight goals during his three seasons at United, including a penalty against Aston Villa in his final outing in May. While Wrexham were unsuccessful in their bid to lure him to the Racecourse Ground, their transfer activity is expected to continue in the coming weeks as they prepare for life in the Championship, with Wales and Sheffield United striker Kieffer Moore claimed to be their latest target.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",

      "Alexander Isak's potential departure from Newcastle United could jeopardise Manchester United's pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. Despite securing the services of Matheus Cunha in early June and recently finalising the signing of Bryan Mbeumo, United are still on the hunt for attacking reinforcements.",
      "After Viktor Gyokeres rejected a reunion with Ruben Amorim to join Arsenal, the Red Devils' focus has reportedly shifted to Sesko. With the north Londoners close to sealing a deal for Gyokeres, United seemed to have had a clear path to the towering Slovenian forward.",
      "However, if Newcastle offload Isak, who has been linked with Liverpool and Saudi Arabian outfit Al Hilal after informing Eddie Howe's side that he would like to explore an exit from St James' Park, the Magpies will be expected to move for Sesko. This could spell trouble for United, who have already missed out on many striking targets this summer.",
      "According to The Athletic, Newcastle are considering a move for Sesko, who boasts a record of 27 goals and seven assists in 64 Bundesliga outings for Leipzig. The Daily Mail have also claimed that Newcastle have approached Leipzig about the possibility of signing Sesko, who could command a fee in the region of £60m to £70m.",
      "With Isak seemingly looking for an exit, Newcastle might decide to capitalise on what could potentially be a Premier League record transfer fee for a player. If this happens, they will likely speed up their chase for another prolific goal-scorer and Sesko seems to fit the bill.",
      "Given that the Magpies are competing in the Champions League this season, United may struggle to lure Sesko to Old Trafford. Furthermore, having already splashed out around £132.5m on Mbeumo and Cunha, United will probably need to offload players before they can make a serious offer, while Newcastle could have ample funds to spend if Isak's departure is accelerated.",
      "After netting only 44 goals in the Premier League last season, United are still in dire need of a lethal striker. Cunha and Mbeumo are both sharp finishers, with 35 goals and 14 assists between them for their respective clubs last year.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, neither are traditional centre forwards, which United have been searching for this summer. The Red Devils have already missed out on Delap, Gyokeres and, most recently, Hugo Ekitike, who secured a £79m move to Liverpool this week.",
      "United reportedly held discussions with the representatives of Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson, who is now thought to carry an £80m price tag. It's now understood a bid for the Senegal international from the Red Devils is unexpected.",
      "French outlet Foot Mercato also reported that Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani, who spent last season on loan at Juventus, is another potential target for United. However, Sesko could be the preferred choice for United.",
      "German media suggests he carries a price tag of around £60m - £12m less than what United shelled out to Atalanta for Rasmus Hojlund in 2023 - making the 22-year-old an attractive prospect.",
      "United still have Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee in their squad, but neither have proven they can lead the attack. The loan move of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona has freed up space and about £12m in wages, but United will still need to generate funds first before they can entertain bidding for another forward.",
      "Resolving the futures of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, who the club are openly willing to sale, will likely be top of Amorim's agenda, especially now Newcastle are putting pressure on them in the race for Sesko.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United’s hopes of selling Antony this summer have been boosted amid reported interest from Saudi Arabia. Antony is part of the so-called ‘bomb squad’ at United, having been frozen out of the first-team set-up by Ruben Amorim, who is desperate to offload him.",
      "United have signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer for a combined total of £133.5million and know they need to sell players in order to balance the books. Marcus Rashford has been sent on loan to Barcelona, who are covering his wages, but Antony remains on the books along with Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Amorim has jetted off to Chicago to start United’s pre-season tour without the exiled foursome, who have been told to look for new clubs. Antony spent the second half of last season on loan at Real Betis and had hoped to move to Seville permanently.",
      "The Brazilian winger got nine goals and five assists in 26 games for Betis last season, reviving his career and earning many new fans in the process. Betis are keen to re-sign him for the 2025/26 season, but want another loan, rather than a permanent deal.",
      "United have different ideas and are seeking a club who will sign Antony, who cost £85m from Ajax in 2022. They have received some interest from Atletico Madrid, but the Spanish side have not followed up on it yet.",
      "It is understood that Antony would prefer to stay in Europe’s top leagues, rather than move to the Middle East. Erik ten Hag – the man who oversaw his best form at Ajax and authorised his big-money move to United – is now in charge of Leverkusen, but he has distanced himself from a transfer.",
      "“He has great quality,” he told BILD recently. “I signed him twice. He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.”",
      "Antony has returned just 12 goals and five assists in 96 games for United and is a major drain on resources. He earns £200,000-a-week at Old Trafford, where he is under contract until June 2027.",
      "After a miserable time at United, he loved his stint at Betis, who he helped reached the Conference League final. “Yes, I'm very happy. I found myself,” he said at the time. “I needed to find myself and be happy. My family needed to be happy too. Every day that passes confirms it was the best decision and as you said, I'm enjoying the city and the club every day.”",

      "Manchester United icon Rio Ferdinand has advised the club to avoid RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko in their quest for a new striker. The Red Devils have already secured the services of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer to bolster their attack.",
      "Last season, Ruben Amorim's team lacked a reliable goalscorer, with Amad and Bruno Fernandes leading the scoring charts with a mere eight league goals each. United have been linked with a move for Sesko as the club attempt to improve their striking options.",
      "The 22-year-old, who has also been on Arsenal's radar, scored 21 goals across all competitions last term. Yet, Ferdinand has warned United that they need a more experienced forward than Sesko.",
      "\"I think you've got to look at the here and now at the moment with Man United. That's what I said about a number nine,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel. \"I'm not really doubting [Sesko] as a player. I'm saying Man United need experience at the top of the pitch.",
      "\"They've got Hojlund, they've got Zirkzee, they've got Chido. Young, inexperienced players. They need someone to look at and go, 'That's how you play as a number nine.' That's how you do it. When you're going to buy somebody who hasn't got as much experience as I'd like, I think that's another risk. Is it worth taking with inexperienced players at this level?\".",
      "Ferdinand has hinted that Ollie Watkins, who is on United's radar, could be the perfect fit due to the Aston Villa striker's Premier League pedigree. While Ferdinand has emphasised the need for a new striker, the former defender confessed he'd be willing for United to overlook a forward in favour of splashing out on Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "\"If I don't get a striker, I'd go midfield. There's only one name I'm thinking about, I've got to be honest, who I think fits the bill for what we need,\" Ferdinand explained. \"An Amorim-type player as well. Physically great, can drive with the ball, can take it in all areas, very good tactically, great energy, great legs, Premier League experience, centre midfield. Baleba.",
      "\"That's who I go and get. That's my man. That's the one I go and get. I go and break the bank. So if I got the money for the four players that are surplus to requirements now, would I get a number nine or would I get Baleba?",
      "\"Would I get a number nine I'm not sure about, who's a bit young, inexperienced, or would I get Baleba with Premier League experience and know what he can do here? I'm going Baleba, sorry.",
      "\"I'm going to go with Baleba. I think he'll have a huge impact on this squad, on this team. You free up a few people in that midfield area as well to have a little less responsibility defensively because I think he's all-action. He can do it all.\"",
      "Baleba was signed by Brighton from Lille for approximately £26million (€30m) in 2023. The young midfielder, aged 21, made 34 appearances in the league for the Seagulls last season.",
      "Meanwhile, United's current striking options, consisting of Rasmus Hojlund, Josha Zikzee and highly-rated prospect Chido Obi, managed to score a total of seven league goals last season. United are hoping to boost their transfer budget through the potential sales of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia, who have all been omitted from the club's US pre-season tour.",

      "Shaw, 30, appears ready to accept that his Red Devils career is coming to an end. The Southampton academy product is reported to be aware of 'serious' interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "The England international still has two years remaining on his contract and is in the United squad that travelled to the United States for their pre-season tour. Shaw will be in contention to face West Ham on Sunday and played against Leeds as Ruben Amorim's side returned to action for pre-season.",
      "Shaw will have to battle for his place in the team come the start of the season. While the full-back started in the Europa League final against Tottenham last term, he is set to face competition from the likes of Diogo Dalot, January arrival Patrick Dorgu and summer signing Diego Leon.",
      "Dorgu is perhaps favourite to be Amorim's first option at wingback for the new season. There are high hopes for £3.3million man Leon who joined from Cerro Porteno of Paraguay too.",
      "The 18-year-old played in the opening half of the draw with Leeds and was praised by head coach Amorim. “He did really well,\" said the Portuguese boss.",
      "\"He’s learning things, he’s powerful, he’s going to be a very good player.”",
      "Amorim is said to be in no rush to lose Shaw from his squad, despite the injury-plagued star carrying £150,000-a-week wages. But the versatile defender is keen to secure playing time having missed out on a number of opportunities due to his injury record.",
      "If Shaw decides to leave in the coming months, it appears unlikely that United would stand in his way. The defender has only made 27 appearances across the last two seasons.",

Last summer, it was rumoured that United were contemplating a £50million swoop for Ferguson, with Chelsea also reportedly showing interest.",
      "However, a move to Old Trafford never materialised and Ferguson's career hit a rough patch last season due to a lack of goals and persistent injuries. The 20-year-old spent the second half of the campaign at West Ham on loan after finding opportunities hard to come by at Brighton, but only managed to start one game for the Hammers.",

United are on the hunt for a new striker this summer but abandoned their pursuit of him at the turn of the year, which may well come back to bite them if his debut performance is anything to by.",

Following confirmation of his Roma loan switch, Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler explained: \"Evan had a challenging period across the past season and a half, and it has been one disrupted by niggling injury issues, which hasn't allowed him a run of games.",

      "Van der Gaag said he had positive memories from his time with United despite his turbulent spell working under Ten Hag, saying the team proved they could be a force in cup competitions.",
      "But he said he regretted their lack of impact in the Europa League after only reaching the quarter-finals in 2022-23, losing to eventual winners Sevilla 5-2 on aggregate.",
      "Speaking to Give Me Sport, he said: \"I look back on my time at Manchester United positively. I think it was two wonderful years. They were very positive and I learned a lot.",
      "\"The first year was very positive because we finished in third place, won the Carabao Cup and went to the FA Cup final. I think the only disappointment, in my opinion, was that we could have been better in the Europa League. But I think the first year was very positive, so everyone expected that we could improve in the second season.\"",
      "He reflected on a \"strange\" second campaign that saw the team suffer a terrible run of form that saw Ten Hag come close to the sack before winning the FA Cup, which bought him more time despite finishing eighth. Van der Gaag said he \"learnt a lot\" and enjoyed coaching with United even though it ended on a sour note.",
      "\"That was a very strange season [2023-24],\" he added. \"We were not good enough in the Premier League or Champions League. There were very strange results as well because there were games we were winning comfortably and then drawing or losing.",
      "\"But, in the end, we won the FA Cup. It puts everything in a positive way, so that was important. They were two years when I learned a lot, especially about the way the Premier League functions, the way football is played and the tactical variations. It was something that I really enjoyed.\"",
      "Ten Hag has since become the new manager of Bayer Leverkusen, but Van der Gaag decided not to join his backroom staff. Instead, he has taken up management himself by becoming the new manager of FC Zurich.",
      "It's set to be a tough start for Ten Hag's new team after selling two of their best players in Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool in a record £116.5m deal, while right-back Jeremie Frimpong also moved to Anfield.",
      "Meanwhile, defender Jonathan Tah joined their biggest rivals Bayern Munich on a free transfer and Granit Xhaka is in danger of moving to Sunderland.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "After weeks of negotiations, Viktor Gyokeres is finally on his way to Arsenal from Sporting Lisbon. The 27-year-old striker will undergo his medical with the Gunners on Saturday after a deal was struck for a £55.1m (€63.5m) guaranteed fee, plus £8.7m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Meanwhile, it's chaos at Newcastle after star striker Alexander Isak dropped the bombshell that he wants to leave on Thursday. Liverpool have enquired about a transfer for Isak and have the money for a blockbuster £125m deal.",
      "Elsewhere, Manchester United are chasing a striker, with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani possibilities.",
      "Mikel Arteta is still refusing to confirm whether Viktor Gyökeres is set to become Arsenal’s latest signing but admits early integration during pre-season is a key part of his transfer strategy.",
      "The Gunners boss was speaking after new defender Christhian Mosquera trained with the squad for the first time on their Asia tour in Singapore.",
      "Asked if a new striker signing would be treated the same way, Arteta said: “Yes for sure. Once we have finalised everything with a player we want to integrate him with the team as quickly as possible.”",
      "He added: “I think immediately is better so they can start to join the team, get to know each other and get the ideas we want to put in their minds.”",
      "Pressed on Gyökeres, Arteta said: “You know I cannot talk about a player who is not ours yet. Whatever happens in the next few hours I’m sure the club will make a statement about it.”",
      "On selecting forwards, he explained: “It is about impact and performance... Once someone is in the right moment and pushing the door full of confidence, for sure the manager is not going to stop them playing.”",
      "He also confirmed Gabriel has only a minor injury and that Jurrien Timber is close to returning.",
      "Arteta praised Gabriel Martinelli’s consistency and said he is “very happy” with the Brazilian’s contribution.",

      "The Colombian was the subject of a £58.5m bid from Bayern Munich earlier in the window, which the Reds rejected outright, but now the German giants have returned to the table to resume talks.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Liverpool will sanction the departure of Diaz, 28, who has two years left on his contract and won't be offered a new deal at Anfield. The Reds are seeking to raise funds for their move for the Newcastle forward Alexander Isak.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres will be stepping into the shoes of Thierry Henry when he completes his Arsenal transfer. After weeks of negotiations, Sporting Lisbon and Arsenal have finally agreed a deal over the striker, who will undergo a medical on Saturday.",
      "Gyokeres is joining the Gunners for £55million plus £8.7m in add-ons, having agreed a five-year deal with Mikel Arteta ’s side. He will become the centre-forward the team has craved during their three successive second-place finishes in the Premier League.",
      "It has been 12 days since the two clubs struck an agreement over the top line transfer figure, but talks have continued over the structure of the deal. Finally, everything is in place and Gyokeres has already picked his shirt number.",
      "The 27-year-old is used to talisman status, having worn the No.9 shirt and scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season as they won the domestic double. And he certainly doesn’t appear worried about the expectations on his shoulders in north London having selected the No.14 shirt at his new club.",
      "More here.",
      "Owen Beck has signed a new contract with Liverpool before joining Derby on loan for the season.",

      "United have signed Diego Leon this summer as competition at left-back, where Patrick Dorgu in the first-choice. Ruben Amorim has played Shaw at centre-back and is not pushing him out of the door.",
      "But Shaw has interest from Saudi Arabia and, despite having two years left on his £150,000-a-week deal, is considering leaving.",
      "The Athletic says that Manchester City are paying £27million to sign James Trafford from Burnley. They matched Newcastle's offer and the 22-year-old chose to return to City.",
      "Ederson has been courted by Galatasaray, but will stay put. Stefan Ortega, however, will be allowed to leave.",
      "The saga that looked like it would never end will, in fact, end soon.",
      "Paperwork was exchanged on Tuesday and the lawyers are working hard to get everything in order.",
      "Raheem Sterling has been offered two new escape routes as he looks to secure a move away from Chelsea this summer.",
      "Fulham and Serie A champions Napoli could now find themselves among the candidates for his signature amid previously reported interest from Juventus and Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Manchester City are poised to sign James Trafford, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Trafford left City in 2023 in pursuit of regular football at Burnley, who paid £19million for his services. He's now returning to City, who have agreed for deal for under his £40m buy-back clause.",
      "It comes as Ederson heads for Galatasaray, and amid rumours that Stefan Ortega could also depart.",
      "Xavi Simons' entourage have travelled to RB Leipzig's pre-season training camp as they look to push through the Dutchman's switch to Chelsea, writes Ryan Taylor.",
      "The Blues have identified the 22-year-old attacking midfielder as a primary target and are looking to exploit their strong relations with his agent Ali Barat to get the exciting acquisition over the line.",
      "Chelsea are mindful that both Bayern Munich and Arsenal have also shown interest in Simons, however, there is confidence they already have the approval of the player after presenting their project.",
      "Alexander Isak's team-mates are away in Singapore on a pre-season tour without their star striker, who has dropped a bombshell by saying he wants to leave.",
      "\"Everyone's entitled to their own opinion,\" defender Dan Burn told The Daily Mail. \"But I think we can just control what we can control. That's a question for Alex to answer. He's obviously a big player for us, but we do have a lot of quality in the squad as well. Bringing Anthony [Elanga] in as well, which I think was a great signing.\"",
      "Captain Bruno Guimaraes added: \"I’m really close to him. He’s a good guy. He’s been through some rough things at this moment. My focus is with the lads. Isak is something I cannot control. The club has control of it. I hope he’s going to be fit when we come back to Newcastle to prepare for the new season.",
      "\"They told us he was there in Newcastle because of his injury. Of course he’s a top player for us and he’s going to be a miss on this trip. We need him ready as soon as possible.\"",
      "Liverpool have signed seven players this summer, spending £265million, which could reach £300m with performance-related add-ons.",
      "So how can they possibly afford to sign Alexander Isak, for over £120m in the age of profit and sustainability rules?",
      "Cristhian Mosquera became the latest player to join Arsenal yesterday.",
      "The young defender completed his £13million move from Valencia and will wear the No.3 shirt for the Gunners after signing a five-year contract.",
      "“He is a young player with exciting talent and enormous potential, who will fit well into our squad as we continue to prepare for next season,\" Mikel Arteta said. \"Cristhian adds good quality to our squad, and we look forward to working with him and making him feel at home with us.\"",
      "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has hinted that the club aren't done spending this summer.",
      "“This season, we all start from scratch. I think everyone has tried to improve their teams – and we as well, I think we’ve done great additions to the team so far,\" he said. “Let’s see what happens for the rest of the transfer window.\"",
      "RB Leipzig have reduced their asking price for Benjamin Sesko in a boost for Manchester United.",
      "Earlier in the summer, Arsenal were put off by the German side demanding a fee between £68m and £85m. But now it has been suggested that €70m (£60m) would be enough to secure his services.",
      "United were beaten to the signing of Liam Delap by Chelsea, to Hugo Ekitike by Liverpool and to Viktor Gyokeres by Arsenal. But their head of scouting Christopher Vivell has been to watch Sesko personally and is pushing for a deal to happen.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is expected to fly into London today to tie up his protracted transfer from Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal.",
      "The deal has taken weeks and weeks of painstaking negotiations, but the Swedish striker should complete his medical today before flying out to join his new team-mates on their pre-season tour.",
      "Alexander Isak has had his head well and truly turned by Liverpool.",
      "Last week, the Reds contacted Newcastle and enquired about Isak's availability. They then signed Hugo Ekitike - a Newcastle target - but Isak has been unsettled.",
      "He missed their pre-season game against Celtic on Saturday, with Eddie Howe admitting that was partly down to speculation, as well as a thigh niggle.",
      "Yesterday came the news that he had been left out of the squad for Newcastle's pre-season tour - and then that he had told the club he wanted to explore his options in the transfer window.",
      "With a £125million price tag, there aren't too many options - especially when you discount Saudi Arabia. All roads lead to Liverpool? Well, they do have the money available, despite their £265m splurge this summer.",
      "Watch this space.",
      "And welcome to another day of transfer news - and it promises to be a busy Friday.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest."

      "Mason Mount says Manchester United's players have targeted an immediate return to Europe next season.",
      "United missed out on qualifying for the Champions League after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham in Bilbao back in May. Ruben Amorim's side were also responsible for United's worst league finish for 51 years, ending the season in 15 th place in the Premier League.",
      "With no European football at Old Trafford next season for only the second time in 35 years, attacking midfielder Mount said getting back there is the primary aim for next season. “We obviously want to be back in Europe,” said Mount. “That's a massive, massive thing for the club.",
      "“That's the focus. The Champions League would be amazing for us. As a group - and as players - we want to be playing in that competition. So that's the goal. We know how difficult that is now in the Premier League. There are so many teams that are investing and playing very good football at the moment.”",
      "Mount, 26, said Amorim and his coaching staff analysed in detail what went wrong last season in a bid to ensure United hit the ground running when the new campaign gets under way. “It's the small details here and there that really affect that at the top of the league,” said Mount. “It's small little details that the manager sees.",
      "“When we do analysis on games, like the first game we played or even in training, it's just seeing those moments and everyone understanding that that matters. That small little movement, the pass, appreciation, this all counts and these small wins in the game will help create chances and will help us be more dominant with the ball. So that's what we've been looking at.",
      "“From day one of pre-season, it's about standards and details within training, on and off the pitch, and really focusing on what we need to do to be better and to perform better. We haven't done loads of analysis of last season. We looked at a few areas that we can improve on, but this is a new season, it's like wiping the slate clean.",
      "\"Coming into this season with a different kind of attitude and a feeling about it and we're ready to go. The vibe around the group is very energetic. In training, it's been a few kicks here and there, because we want to win in games. That's what you want as a group. You kick your mate, but after training, it's all good.”",

      "United are now in Chicago on that tour and are still yet to address many of the issues in their squad. One of the most obvious is the lack of goals, after they managed just 44 in 38 Premier League games as they finished 15th last season.",

Mount's two seasons at United have been blighted by injury following his £60million move from Chelsea, but he said he is determined to prove himself under Ruben Amorim.",
      "“The whole season hurt,” said Mount. “But this is a new slate now. We're looking forward to performing. We want to perform as a group. We know last season wasn't good enough so now it's about kicking on.",
      "“Going away in the summer, you're always looking at what you can do better, how you can be better for your team-mates and perform as a group, how we can all perform better. Last season it wasn't good enough. We know that, but we're kicking on now. We're ready to put right that wrong.\"",
      "Mount was out for four months midway through last season but returned to the starting line-up towards the end of the campaign and is determined to make himself a regular under Amorim. Despite United spending £133.5m on attacking duo Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Mount has backed himself to compete with them for a starting place next season.",
      "“When you're at a club like Manchester United, there has to be that competition there to perform and as a group we want to win and we're all in that together,” said Mount. “The new lads who have come in have been brilliant in training so far and the first couple of weeks is never easy.",
      "\"It's about integrating them into the group and making them feel as comfortable as possible and I think we've all done that. They've been brilliant in training and we'll be working together to get to that goal. They know what's coming with the Premier League and the games and how difficult it is now. What they've done in the Premier League already, the amount of goals they've scored, the amount of assists they've created, that's exactly what we need in the team.",
      "“We're working together to try and improve that, because last season we didn't hit those goals or assists as much as we could have done.” Asked how long it took him to get over United's 1-0 defeat to Spurs in Bilbao, Mount said: \"Quite a long time. I've had quite a few losses in finals, so it's not easy. It never gets any easier, for sure.",
      "“But it's about looking at what we could have improved on. In finals, little things that happen in the game, it's like they have a bigger impact. It was tight. But it's about looking forward now and really using this pre-season to work on a lot of things that maybe we didn't get enough time to do last season.",

      "The Red Devils have already bought two forwards - Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - for a combined £133.5million, with a new emphasis on signing players who are proven in the Premier League. Of those who United view as realistic options, they don't come much more established than Watkins.",
      "Since joining Villa from Brentford in a £33m deal five years ago, Watkins has scored 75 goals and registered 34 assists in 184 league games. The England international was the subject of a £60m bid from Arsenal in January but Villa immediately rejected it.",
      "The Telegraph report that Villa have no plans to sell the 29-year-old and insist that he isn't for sale at any price. It's not the first conversation that United have had with Villa Park chiefs this summer.",
      "Earlier this month, the Red Devils made a surprise loan offer for goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez which Villa instantly turned down. Unlike with Watkins, they're willing to let Martinez go if a club meets their £40m asking price.",
      "It's been suggested that United could offer Alejandro Garnacho to Villa in a swap deal for Watkins. Garnacho is on the chopping block at Old Trafford but he wants to remain in the Premier League, with Villa reportedly among his admirers.",
      "The winger wouldn't be a like-for-like replacement, though, and Villa don't have a recognised backup striker in their ranks. They offloaded Jhon Duran to Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr in January for a cool £65m and Unai Emery was delighted to keep Watkins in Birmingham.",
      "\"But even when he's not doing both, he's working for the team. Defensively, the commitment was always high. He is in the press to the opponent. His commitment and behaviour is always a very good example for others. His power is his mind. His mentality is the best quality he has.\"",

      "Manchester United could sign Benjamin Sesko after RB Leipzig reportedly slashed their asking price for the striker. United have splashed £133.5million to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the summer transfer window, but still lack a centre-forward.",
      "United managed a pathetic total of 44 goals as they finished 15th in the Premier League last season, with Rasmus Hojlund netting just four times in the league. Ruben Amorim knows they need reinforcements this summer and has moved to land two of the league’s most exciting forwards in Cunha from Wolves and Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "And while there is interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson and Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani, there could also still be a glimmer of hope for United in the form of Sesko, who is available from Leipzig.",
      "Arsenal had initially preferred a move for Sesko over Gyokeres – in part due to the fact that he is five years younger – but they backed out of the transfer with Leipzig demanding a fee between £68m and £85m.",
      "However, BILD now reports that a fee of around €70million (£60m) could be enough to get a deal done for Sesko, who notched 13 goals in the Bundesliga last season. United’s head of scouting Christopher Vivell has been to watch him personally and is understood to be a big fan of the Slovenian forward.",
      "Sesko is under contract with Leipzig until June 2029 and scored 21 goals in 45 games across all competitions last season. The 22-year-old is not agitating for a move, as his agent explained earlier this summer.",
      "Asked about rumours that he had been lobbying Leipzig to lower their asking price, Elvis Basanovic said: “This is far from truth. We respect RB Leipzig and I am 100 per cent convinced RB Leipzig will also respect our decision for the next step when we decide to do it. Even if there may be – or will be – a strong desire of the player to move to a certain club, we will never force or blackmail RB Leipzig.",
      "“I believe this is not the right way, because the way you actually exit from the club shows your values. Values that you are bringing into a new club. I can understand in very big transfers, there are a lot of different interests but no matter what, I believe in football world should be more respect.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been slammed for seemingly \"letting Manchester United down\" after making the switch to Barcelona. The forward completed his season-long loan to the reigning La Liga title-holders after being presented to fans on Wednesday.",
      "The 27-year-old has at least temporarily departed Old Trafford once again following his four-month stint at Aston Villa last season. Rashford found himself sidelined at United by head coach Ruben Amorim after his arrival in November last year.",
      "A move to Barcelona was understood to be the England star's favoured destination after losing his place in the international squad, and he has now secured his dream, with his new club holding the option to buy him next summer for £26m.",
      "The deal will see Barcelona cover Rashford's sizeable wages for the duration of the loan after he agreed to a 25 per cent reduction from his £325,000-a-week pay. Despite the financial relief, former Liverpool and Villa striker Dean Saunders has now slammed Rashford after questioning his commitment and arguing he hasn't earned the right to represent Barcelona.",
      "The former Wolves and Wrexham boss also challenged the Catalan club's reasoning behind the signing. Saunders gave a savage eight word-verdict on Rashford's performances in recent campaigns, saying: \"In five years, he's had one good season.\"",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: \"I think a lot of people are baffled. Hansi Flick is the manager and Deco is his director of football. I don't know what's going through their heads. What have they been watching that we haven't?",
      "\"I thought Rashford was nearer to going down the same road as Dele Alli than he was of going to Barcelona. Whether he deserves that move? Well, basically, he doesn't.",
      "\"I don't think he can produce brilliance. I think a talent is turning up every week. That's the biggest talent you've got, having the mindset to turn up and perform every week.",
      "\"There's a lot of players at Man United who have let the club down. In my era, Man United were the biggest club. If you played for them, you had to be the best player in the world in your position, with the best attitude.\"",
      "Saunders added: \"He [Rashford] has had years of [people] getting behind him and he's let the club down. In five years, he's had one good season.\"",
      "Rashford's questionable work rate was previously highlighted by Amorim as justification for dropping him from the squad for the Manchester derby last December. During his exile from the team, the Portuguese boss delivered a damning verdict, insisting he'd rather field his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach than select a player who lacks dedication.",
      "\"If you do the maximum and do the right things, we can use every player,\" Amorim said. \"And you can see today on the bench, we missed a bit of pace to go, to change the game. I will put [Jorge] Vital [on the pitch] before I put a player that does not give the maximum. I will not change in that department.\"",
      "Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick gave the go-ahead for Rashford's signing after having discussions with the player. The Catalan giants have been on the hunt for a left-sided forward this summer, and Rashford was a top target, along with Liverpool's Luis Díaz and Athletic Club's Nico Williams.",
      "Díaz's hefty price tag proved to be a significant hurdle, while Williams recently pledged his future to his current club by signing a new long-term contract. As a result, Rashford emerged as the most feasible and achievable target.",
      "United are keen to offload players who are no longer in favour in order to finance a substantial squad revamp. The restructuring process has already begun, with Matheus Cunha joining for £62.5million and Bryan Mbeumo following suit in a £70m deal.",

      "Kolo Muani was allowed to remain with Juventus for the Club World Cup but has now returned to Paris, where he's been given the cold shoulder. French newspaper Le Parisien report that Enrique has ordered the former Eintracht Frankfurt star to train with PSG's under-21 squad alongside fellow unwanted players Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio, Carlos Soler, Nordi Mukiele and Renato Sanches.",
      "Having paid Frankfurt £76.4million to sign Kolo Muani two years ago and with a contract until 2028, PSG won't let him go on the cheap. It's explained that the Champions League winners will demand a total fee of £52m while Juventus would prefer another loan deal.",
      "United aren't the only Premier League club interested, too. The report adds that Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham all have Kolo Muani on the radar, although none of them have submitted bids.",
      "That's unlike Juve, who want the 26-year-old back. During the Club World Cup, Kolo Muani made it clear that his preference is to stay with the Serie A side, having been quizzed on links with Chelsea.",

      "Manchester United finally got the signing of Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday after pursuing the Brentford attacker all summer, but the arrival of the soon-to-be 26-year-old will create a problem for them later this season.",
      "Mbeumo was seen as a key target for Ruben Amorim as he continues to remould the United squad he took over last November, with hopes high that he can improve on last season's dismal 15th-place finish.",
      "Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals for Brentford last term, is seen as a perfect and versatile addition for United, and someone who can play in one of Amorim's wide No.10 roles and perhaps even at wing-back.",
      "But if he is to succeed at the club in the coming season then he is going to have to do so while missing a key period of the campaign.",
      "That's because as a Cameroon international Mbeumo will be off to the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco in December, and that tournament is likely to be looming large in Amorim's mind given the potential headache it could cause him.",
      "As well as Mbeumo, the Ivory Coast's Amad Diallo is also extremely likely to be called up, as is Noussair Mazraoui who plays for hosts Morocco. There is also a decent chance that goalkeeper Andre Onana is recalled to the Cameroon squad despite some high-profile spats which at one stage led to his international retirement. He did however return to the fold last year.",
      "All four could be missing for a crucial point in United's season then, with the latest AFCON being brought forward to December 21 this year and running through to January 18.",
      "The change sees the tournament move from its previous January to February slot to come more in line with most European countries' winter breaks, and also avoid the final two league phase matches of the Champions League in late January.",
      "United don't have European football to worry about in the coming campaign of course, but they do still have key games in the Premier League over the AFCON period.",
      "United face Bournemouth at home on the weekend of December 13, and that is likely to be the quartet's final game before they head off to Morocco if all are selected.",
      "Then comes a potential Carabao Cup quarter-final on the week of December 15, before Premier League games against Aston Villa (away, December 20), Newcastle (home, December 27), Wolves (home, December 30), Leeds (away, January 3) and Burnley (away, January 7).",

      "Of course not all four players will be involved all the way to the end of the tournament, with a decent chance that most if not all are back by the time of that City game, but nonetheless Amorim will have plenty to ponder going into the winter.",

      "The 27-year-old has not played for United since December, having fallen out with Ruben Amorim, and joins Barca following a loan spell at Aston Villa. He had been placed in the so-called ‘bomb squad’ at United by Amorim, with the club’s unwanted players forced to train by themselves at Carrington.",

I’m very grateful for the opportunity to play there. The summer came around very quickly, it was time to make another decision. My choice was easy. It’s a family club, something I’m used to from my past.",

      "Manchester United’s first session at the Chicago Fire’s training facility, the Endeavor Health Performance Center, ran to a lengthy two-and-a-half hours on Wednesday morning.",
      "It was around an hour shorter on Thursday and the team have not done any double sessions (yet). Players who do not play or only get a handful of minutes against West Ham United in New Jersey on Saturday are scheduled to go through an on-pitch post-match training session. A similar session took place in Stockholm after United’s drab draw with Leeds on Saturday.",
      "A section of United’s session on Friday will be visible to the public but will take place at Soldier Field, the Fire’s stadium, rather than at their training base. Ruben Amorim and Matheus Cunha will attend a pre-match press conference at the stadium afterwards.",
      "United sources say that early impressions of Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have been positive. The pair have been described as good characters who are fitting in well and have \"injected new energy\" into the squad.",
      "Some United staff members admitted there was a nervousness about whether the £71million deal for Mbeumo would be finalised in time for him to travel on the pre-season tour but Amorim is satisfied with the addition of two high-profile players.",
      "United's training sessions have been observed by director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada. “There has been plenty of chat on the sidelines,” an eyewitness confirmed.",
      "Amorim is content with how the squad is shaping up and nothing imminent is expected on the striker front. United's plans for that position were kiboshed when Liam Delap opted to join Chelsea in May.",
      "A mooted move for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez has also been given short shrift. United do not want to inflate their wage bill and Martinez signed a lucrative new contract with Villa last year worth upwards of £200,000-a-week.",
      "United are far from ruling out a move for a new goalscorer and will assess what is possible. The departure of Marcus Rashford on a season-long loan has given them more headroom to finance a move but outright sales are essential. United want to obtain fees for wingers Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Juventus are interested in Sancho but United have fielded more enquiries for Garnacho.",

      "Mason Mount has backed Manchester United signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to lift the team to \"another level\".",
      "United invested £133.5million to sign Cunha from Wolves and Mbeumo from Brentford and sharpen an attack that has recorded a minus goal difference in the past two seasons.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has repeatedly said he \"loves\" Mount, who is well versed at playing in a 3-4-2-1 formation, having lined up as one of the two playmakers in the 2021 Champions League and European Championship finals.",
      "Mount scored three goals in May after returning from a three-and-a-half-month lay-off with a groin problem but United have since brought in Cunha and Mbeumo, two prospective playmakers.",
      "\"Any time you do get that opportunity to be on the pitch, you want to do something,\" Mount stressed. \"You want to affect the game. That's always the way I've looked at it.",
      "\"Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself. I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that. Obviously with the new signings coming in, they (Cunha and Mbeumo)'re going to elevate us to another level and we all need to be at that level to really perform.",
      "\"He (Amorim)'s definitely given that confidence to me from the first day he came in, speaking to me, and I know what he wants, and I feel like I know how he wants the team to play. And, obviously, I've had some experience in that role as well.",
      "\"So that helps with the younger lads coming in and me helping them understand the positions of the formation and everything. So yeah, it's been brilliant and definitely having that confidence, the manager has that confidence in me to go out there and perform, it definitely helps as a player.\"",
      "Mount revealed United players are intensifying their pre-season training sessions by kicking each other more often. Amorim complained about a \"lack of aggression\" from the squad last season and Mount admitted there has been an edge to the pre-season sessions.",
      "The 26-year-old conceded he got \"far too many yellow cards for my liking\" when he came on in games after recovering from injury for the run-in last season but he is encouraged by the way his teammates are applying themselves.",
      "\"The vibe around the group is very energetic,\" Mount said. \"In training, it's been a few kicks here and there because we want to win in games. Little games here and there.",
      "\"That's what you want as a group. You kick your mate, but after training it's all good. He knows it was in the right mind frame.",
      "\"I think I've always had that (fouling) in me. It's just when you're at the end of last season, I was coming back. At the beginning I was obviously not starting games. I was watching games and when you have that opportunity to come into the game, you want to have an impact and you want to get straight into the action. You want to do something.",
      "\"Yeah, I got too many yellow cards and I had too many fouls. Sometimes they get you into the game and get you focused there and you're ready to receive the next ball. And then, yeah, don't get any more yellow cards after that. So, yeah, that's the way I look at it.\"",
      "\"It's been brilliant. We're all doing stuff together away from the training pitch, spending time with each other. That's massive for a long season where you're about to go in and fight against other teams. We're in a really good place and there's still time for us to work at things and everything like that. But we're good and we'll be ready for it.\"",
      "Mount started in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho, who complained about his demotion after the loss in Bilbao. The result marked the sixth time that Mount has been on the losing side in a final with Chelsea, United and England.",
      "He was unable to quickly move on from United's crushing disappointment against Spurs, which confirmed they would not play any European football this season for the second time in 35 years. \"I've had quite a few losses in finals, so it's not easy. It never gets any easier, for sure,\" he added. \"But as I said already, it's about looking at what we could have improved on.",
      "\"Any little thing that happens in the game, it's like a bigger impact, especially in a final. I think obviously it was tight. We looked at why these things could have happened, but as I said before and many times, it's about looking forward now and really using this pre-season to work on a lot of things that maybe we didn't get enough time to last season.",
      "\"With the schedule, with the games, and obviously with the gaffer coming in halfway through, this period is so vital for us to be as a group and work on things.",
      "\"So, yes, this is important. Finals are never easy to take when you lose. But when you're in that next one, you remember that feeling. It takes some time (to get over such a defeat), for sure. For sure. Because as a player, you're just thinking about little things in the game.",
      "\"I started the game, so it was like, what could I have done in that situation? Or could I have made that pass better? I think you don't look too much into it, because you would drive yourself crazy, looking into loads of detail.",
      "\"But it hurts and the whole season hurt. But this is, as I said before, a new slate now. We're looking forward to performing. And that first game of the season is a great opportunity for us to do that.\"",
      "Mount is targeting a return to a European competition, minimum. \"I'd say Europe. I think that's the focus. The Champions League would be amazing for us. And as a group, we want to, and as players, we want to be playing in that competition. And that's the goal.\"",
      "United bought Mount from Chelsea for £55m rising to £60m in 2023 to play in midfield alongside Casemiro. That experiment lasted two games and Mount has only played 47 times during two injury-plagued campaigns.",
      "\"We've looked at it and looked at why,\" Mount said of his persistent injury issues, \"and I feel we're in a really, really good place now going into this season.\"",

      "With just over five weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, Manchester United still have plenty of work to do.",
      "Ahead of facing West Ham United in their opening game of their pre-season tour of the United States this weekend, United have had a successful summer thus far, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "After scoring 35 Premier League goals between them last season, United have taken a huge stride towards solving their attacking problems. Cunha and Mbeumo were among the best players in the division last term and each bring a wealth of quality to M16.",
      "United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings this summer after finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference. However, they are yet to source the natural No.9 they desperately need.",
      "Having signed Cunha and Mbeumo for an overall package that could eventually be worth up to £133.5million, United need to rely on sales to fund further incomings. With that in mind, MEN Sport has had a close look at what United should still be striving to achieve ahead of the window closing.",
      "As already documented, United want to sign a striker before the window closes. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea from Ipswich Town last month, they are struggling to source an alternative.",
      "Set to miss out on the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, who is poised to join Arsenal, and Victor Osimhen, who is set to join Galatasaray on a permanent deal from Napoli, United are being forced to look elsewhere for a goal-getter. They are now being heavily linked with Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig.",
      "The elephant in the room is that United need to sell in order to be able to buy. Marcus Rashford's loan switch to Barcelona ensures United will save millions on his wages, but that package will not be enough to fund the addition of an elite-level goal-getter, meaning United need to raise more money via sales (more on that later).",
      "In addition to signing a striker, which has to be their top priority, United also remain keen on recruiting a midfielder and a goalkeeper. However, the Reds are unlikely to be able to swoop for a midfielder for as long as they are stuck with Casemiro.",
      "Despite signing Manuel Ugarte last year, United need an upgrade in midfield. It is understood head coach Ruben Amorim wants a midfielder who is equally comfortable on the ball and defensively.",
      "As far as United's interest in signing a goalkeeper is concerned, they want someone who can compete with and challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. They continue to be linked with Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens.",
      "Rashford became the first high profile departure of the window on Wednesday, but United need to oversee several more outgoings before September 1. It has been well-documented in recent weeks that Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony all want to move on.",
      "The quartet have been left out of the squad that has travelled to the US, highlighting they have no place in Amorim's long-term plans. It would in United's best interests if they could sell all four of them on permanent deals.",
      "Garnacho is the most valuable asset United are looking to sell this summer, and if they play their cards right, they should be attracting offers of at least £50m for him. He has enormous potential and United should try and secure every penny they possibly can for him.",
      "In addition to trying to offload their four wantaway stars, they should be looking to sell Altay Bayindir, but that will depend on if they can source a new goalkeeper first. As jittery as the Turkish international can be, United can ill-afford to leave themselves short.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Casemiro are two more players United should be striving to offload permanently. The former could find regular game time hard to come by after the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, while the latter is likely to suffer from a lack of European football this season.",
      "Casemiro saved his best performances last term for the Europa League and that is a luxury United will be without this term. The Brazilian has entered the last year of his contract, meaning this summer is the perfect time for him to be sold.",
      "He earns around £300,000-a-week and United need to sell him for £15m to avoid a loss and the profit and sustainability. He is currently competing with the likes of Toby Collyer, Kobbie Mainoo, Ugarte and Fernandes for a starting berth.",
      "Meanwhile, United need to try and get Ethan Wheatley out on loan once again after a disappointing time at Walsall in the second half of last season.",
      "Incomings: goalkeeper, midfielder & a striker.",
      "Outgoings: Altay Bayindir, Tyrell Malacia, Casemiro, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Joshua Zirkzee & Ethan Wheatley (loan).",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog from MEN Sport on Thursday, July 24.",
      "Now that Bryan Mbeumo is through the door, the priority at Old Trafford is now a striker. After missing out on Liam Delap, Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen, United are now considering alternatives.",
      "Ollie Watkins is one of the standout names linked with a move to Ruben Amorim's side. The Aston Villa striker boasts an impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League and has been linked with a move away from Villa Park in the past three windows.",
      "Meanwhile, United have been linked with Valencia's Javi Guerra. The midfielder has recently turned down a new contract at the Spanish club and reports have suggested that the Reds are working on a deal behind-closed-doors.",
      "For more signings to come in, players will have to be sold. Fortunately, United have already managed to get Marcus Rashford's wages off their books after he completed his season-long switch to Barcelona.",
      "The Spanish side have an option to sign the attacker permanently next summer and will cover all of his salary. The club will be hoping to secure similar deals for Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Keep up with all the latest United transfer news and rumours by following along with the MEN Sport blog below:",
      "Alejandro Garnacho's future looks to be away from Manchester United with the youngster being exiled from the club's preseason tour.",
      "He has also been told to train away from the squad. United look keen to move Garnacho out, with the club dropping the Argentinians' price tag from £70m to £40m as per ESPN.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Napoli and Bayern Munich have all been linked with an interest in Garnacho. No official offer has been presented as of yet.",
      "Jadon Sancho's future at Manchester United remains unclear with just over a month to go before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea from United, where he scored five goals across 41 appearances for the Stamford Bridge outfit. Sancho also scored in Chelsea's victory in the Conference League final, where fellow United loanee Antony was in action for their opponents, Real Betis.",
      "Chelsea had the option of making the move permanent to sign Sancho after United included an obligation to buy clause worth £25million. However, instead, the Londoners opted not to activate the clause and chose to pay a £5m penalty fee, which has seen Sancho return to Old Trafford...",
      "Wrexham have reportedly made an apporach to sign Christian Eriksen just months after the midfielder left Manchester United.",
      "Eriksen's representative Martin Schoots told the Mail: \"Wrexham are really upgrading everything both on and off the field.",
      "\"And it is a hugely impressive project, as you can see from the presence of people like Michael Williamson [Wrexham's experienced American CEO] there.",
      "\"But Christian still wants to play in a first-tier competition and he absolutely wants to stay in Western Europe.",
      "\"There are some contacts going on but it has to suit both sides.\"",
      "There is still over a month remaining in the transfer window, and Manchester United have already strengthened their forward line considerably.",
      "Matheus Cunha made the switch to Old Trafford from Wolves at the start of the summer, while a long-running transfer saga involving Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo concluded earlier this week, as the Cameroon international was finally unveiled as a United player.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s squad are currently out in the United States for their pre-season tour, but work continues behind the scenes, with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins the latest striker to be linked with a move. Here, MEN Sport takes a look at the latest developments surrounding the England international’s future...",

      "United are continuing to be linked with signing a new centre forward this summer, with Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins two of the latest names mentioned as potential targets.",
      "\"It [centre forward] definitely was the issue last year,\" Saha said in an interview with Betway.",
      "\"Defensively, we were stronger. We seemed to be more stable. We had a few mistakes from the goalkeeper, maybe a few from the defenders, but that’s obviously something that’s going to always happen in any season.",
      "\"With the lack of strength we had in midfield and the lack of ability to finish our opportunities, there are definitely a lot of weaknesses that need to be addressed, and having the striker gives you confidence because whenever you’re not playing well, he’s able to actually score his own goals. He’s able to score the goals that are important and can change the nature of the games.",
      "\"It is very important that the manager finds this with the striker, and that also gives the right platform for Hojlund or Zirkzee to perform as well, because there is not so much pressure only on their shoulders.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has given his take on rumours linking Manchester United with a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Slovenia international has been mentioned as a potential target for United, and now Ferdinand has had his say on the speculation.",
      "Sesko has also been linked with a move to Arsenal, Newcastle and the Saudi Pro League this summer.",
      "Manchester United still have several weeks remaining before the summer transfer window closes.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, but are being linked with several more potential new additions to their squad.",
      "United now have until September 1 to complete their transfer business for the summer, which still gives them time to sign a striker or any other new members for their squad should they wish to do so.",

      "Make sure you stay tuned!",
      "Man United have not directly contacted Aston Villa about the possible availability of striker Watkins.",
      "Villa remain insistent that Watkins is not for sale amid United's search for a new striker.",
      "Watkins, 29, is under contract at Villa until 2027 but United are seeking a goalscorer with Premier League experience to sharpen their attack.",
      "TBR Football claim that Tottenham have 'enquired' about Kobbie Mainoo this summer.",
      "The 20-year-old was also linked with a move during the January transfer window, with Chelsea among the clubs reportedly interested. Meanwhile, Paul Scholes has previously urged United to keep hold of their academy product.",
      "Scholes said: \"I think Mainoo needs a run in the team, I think now it’s time to give him a chance. This back-four need protecting. No one senses danger as much as this young lad. He looked the real deal. I don’t see anyone else being able to protect the back four like he can.\"",
      "Valencia have confirmed that one of their key players has left the club, which could go on to affect Man United.",
      "Javi Guerra has been heavily linked with a move to United this summer. There have been reports that the Spain Under-21 international is being offered a new deal by the La Liga club, which is yet to be agreed and has led to United expressing an interest in a deal.",
      "If Guerra was to leave Valencia it would be another high-profile exit for the Spanish outfit. It was confirmed on Thursday that defender Cristhian Mosquera has left the club to complete a permanent move to Arsenal. In a statement released on their club website, Valencia confirmed that Mosquera has joined the Gunners after informing the club of his desire to move to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "It remains to be seen what Valencia will have planned for Guerra, with reports indicating their desire to keep the talented midfielder at the Mestalla amid rumoured interest from United.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly held initial talks with Aston Villa over a potential move for Ollie Watkins, amid Villa's interest in Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, are interested in Garnacho, a player United are open to selling but are currently unable to meet the asking price for a permanent deal. Garnacho is keen to stay in the Premier League and play Champions League football, though no move has materialised yet despite reported interest from Chelsea.",
      "While any deals for Watkins and Garnacho would be handled separately, a significant player sale by Villa could help fund a move for the United winger.",
      "According to Marca, Man United are prepared to submit an offer for Valencia star Javi Guerra, who is currently in a contract standoff with the Spanish club.",
      "United have already agreed personal terms with the midfielder and are prepared to offer up to £21.6million.",
      "However, Valencia have set a price tag of £23.4m, as they aim to secure at least £17.3m from Guerra’s sale -after accounting for a 30 percent profit share owed to his former club, Villarreal.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Aston Villa have no intention of selling the 29-year-old and have made it clear he is not available at any price.",
      "This isn’t the first time Man United have held talks with the Villa Park hierarchy this summer. There has been speculation that Manchester United could offer Alejandro Garnacho to Aston Villa as part of a swap deal for Ollie Watkins.",
      "While Garnacho is free to leave Old Trafford, he is reportedly eager to remain in the Premier League, with Villa said to be among the clubs interested.",
      "One to watch.",
      "West Ham United have reportedly opened talks with Manchester United-linked Callum Wilson this summer.",
      "United are keen to sign a new attacker this summer following the underwhelming campaign from Rasmus Hojund and Joshua Zirkzee. Hojlund has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "But any hopes of signing Wilson will need to see United accelerate their efforts after BBC Sport reported on Thursday that the Hammers are interested in a deal. It is also claimed that the 33-year-old has attracted interest from Premier League clubs and also has options in Major League Soccer (MLS).",
      "Juventus have reportedly begun to consider other attacking options like Hojlund and Liverpool's Darwin Nunez.",
      "According to Mediaset, United could be open to sending the 22-year-old on loan to Juventus.",
      "Hojlund remains popular in Italy having performed well for Atalanta prior to joining United.",
      "According to French outlet L’Équipe, Man United have held talks over a potential move for young Metz striker Idrissa Gueye.",
      "The report states that United have held discussions over a potential move for the teenager, having scouted him in recent months.",
      "The 18-year-old, who joined Metz from the Generation Foot academy in January, made an immediate impact in his debut Ligue 2 season, scoring five goals and registering one assist in 17 appearances.",
      "Alexander Isak's name has been dominating the rumour mill today after news emerged that the striker could leave Newcastle United amid speculation of a potential £120million price tag.",
      "Away from the action on the pitch and the transfer speculation, Manchester United will also be looking ahead to the prospect of having a new stadium in the future.",
      "United unveiled plans earlier this year for a new 100,000-seater stadium, and now a fresh update has emerged about what the new home could mean for the club's supporters.",

      "With just over five weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, it remains to be seen who Manchester United will turn to in their pursuit of a centre-forward.",
      "United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings this summer and have already added Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to head coach Ruben Amorim's squad. However, they are still missing arguably the most important piece of the jigsaw.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap last month, United's striker search has been delayed. They have been linked with a crop of goal-getters, ranging from Viktor Gyokeres to Ollie Watkins, but they yet to have lodged an official bid for a new marksman.",
      "After news emerged on Thursday of Alexander Isak's desire to leave Newcastle United, some United supporters were brave enough to start believing they could swoop for the Swedish international.",
      "Isak, who scored 23 Premier League goals last season, is reputedly valued at £150million, meaning United will be priced out. They have already spent north of £120m on Cunha and Mbeumo and will be reliant on sales to fund further new arrivals.",
      "Signing a striker is a must for United this summer, but who they will end up turning to is anyone's guess right now. It would not be a complete surprise if they are still on the hunt for the No.9 as the window enters its final week.",
      "United accepted at the time of expressing a keen interest in Delap that attainable strikers are few and far between this summer. Those who went into this summer anticipating moves have either already been snapped up or are on the brink of moving.",
      "United have been linked with some of the usual suspects, such as RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, but they are yet to have made an official move. A lack of European football on offer for next season could prove to be problematic.",
      "The same could be said if United decide to rekindle their interest in Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani. United have expressed interest in the Frenchman twice in the past, most recently as January this year.",
      "After struggling to make his mark at PSG, whom he had joined from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2023, Kolo Muani enjoyed a fruitful loan spell in Turin, scoring a respectable ten goals in 22 appearances. He also contributed three assists.",
      "As a result, Juventus are continuing to be heavily linked with the prospect of re-signing him on a permanent basis. It has been claimed Kolo Muani wants to leave the French capital.",
      "With three years remaining on his contract, PSG will attempt to dig their heels in amid their ambition of securing the highest possible price for the 26-year-old, who must be keen to try and put down some roots elsewhere after failing to settle at the Parc des Princes.",
      "Interestingly, using DataMB's player similarity generator tool to bring up players with similar characteristics to Isak, Kolo Muani is one of the five similar players to the Newcastle striker.",
      "Despite scoring 15 goals fewer across all competitions than Isak last season, scoring 12 for PSG and Juventus combined, Kolo Muani scores similar levels to Isak in other areas of his game, according to the data provided.",
      "For example, in terms of non-penalty goals, 91 per cent of Isak's efforts were from open play and 86.7 per cent of Kolo Muani's were from open play. Additionally, Kolo Muani had a higher goal conversion rate (97.3 per cent) than Isak (85.5 per cent) last term.",
      "With Newcastle said to value Isak at £150m, Kolo Muani could be a good alternative for a fraction of the price. Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport recently said he could be available for as little as £39m.",

      "Another striker target bites the dust at Manchester United in the summer transfer window.",
      "Last month, Watkins emerged as a potential striker target at Old Trafford, but reports suggested Aston Villa will not sell him this summer, which always felt like the most likely outcome.",
      "Aston Villa were believed to have wanted £60million to even consider a sale. Watkins is proven in the Premier League and he demonstrated his quality with England last summer at Euro 2024. He is an experienced centre-forward and would guarantee goals, but the deal never made sense from an Aston Villa perspective.",
      "Villa are one of the top flight clubs that are struggling with Profitability and Sustainability (PSR), but they are set to sell their women's team to avoid a breach, which should give them wriggle room.",
      "The elephant in the room was who lead their attack if Watkins were sold? Rashford has joined Barcelona and John Duran was sold to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in the January window.",
      "It was unlikely Villa would sell two goalscoring strikers in successive transfer windows, especially when there are limited striker options to replace Watkins currently in the transfer market.",
      "Villa are also a direct rival to United due to the good work of Unai Emery. The Spaniard has established Villa as European challengers during his reign and would not want to strengthen a competitor.",
      "Watkins has scored 87 goals during his time in Birmingham and reliable goalscorers are difficult to find, so Villa would obviously be better off sticking and not twisting in this summer window.",
      "The Telegraph report Villa have now insisted Watkins is not for sale at any price. And when you look at the state of the striker market this summer, that stance does not come as a surprise.",
      "That poses the question: which striker do United target this summer? There are concerns United could start the new season without a new centre-forward, which would be criminal after a train wreck 2024/2025.",
      "Watkins is not for sale, Jonathan David has signed for Juventus on a free transfer, Viktor Gyökeres is set to sign for Arsenal (United weren't interested) and Hugo Ekitike has signed for Liverpool.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is an option, but Victor Osimhen is still available and he should have been the leading target for United since the first day of the summer transfer window.",
      "Napoli were entertaining bids in the region of £70million for Osimhen before talks collapsed with Chelsea last summer and he only turned 26 in December, so he should be coming into his prime. Yes, Osimhen is a big name and would demand large wages, which goes against Ineos' policy, but he is a prolific centre-forward.",
      "Osimhen scored 37 goals in 41 games for Galatasaray - an undeniably impressive record, even in a weaker division - and he would be the dream centre forward signing for many United fans.",
      "So why hasn't Osimhen found a new club yet? The answer is probably wage demands. They have appeared to be a stumbling block so far in this window in talks with other clubs and United will not break their wage structure.",
      "Having said that, United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season and Osimhen would be the perfect solution to Ruben Amorim's biggest problem, so perhaps a compromise could be found.",
      "United are running out of striker options and must act sooner rather than later.",

      "Newly-promoted Championship side Wrexham have reportedly made a surprise move for former Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen.",
      "The Dane is a free agent this summer following the expiry of his contract at Old Trafford. The 33-year-old joined United in 2022 on a free transfer after spells with Inter Milan and Brentford, having initially left Tottenham in January 2020.",
      "Eriksen made just over 100 appearances for United during his three years at the club, scoring eight goals and registering 19 assists. He also lifted the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in 2023 and 2024 respectively.",
      "Following the expiry of his contract earlier this month, Wrexham were reportedly plotting a shock move for the experienced midfielder. According to the Daily Mail, Eriksen was the subject of a surprise approach from the Welsh club, who will compete in the Championship next season after achieving three straight promotions.",
      "The article notes that while Eriksen was impressed by Wrexham’s proposal, he remains intent on continuing his career at top-flight level. Reportedly, there have also been approaches from clubs in Saudi Arabia, the United States, Turkey, and Brazil.",
      "Eriksen’s agent, Martin Schoots, told the Daily Mail that while Wrexham have a hugely impressive project, his client wants to play at the highest level, while also remaining in Western Europe. He added that talks with other clubs are ongoing, but any deal must suit both parties.",
      "Hollywood stars Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds took over Wrexham in 2021 while the club were still competing in the National League. Now, just a few years and three promotions later, they are preparing for their first season in the second tier of English football.",
      "The club shows no signs of slowing down, with the ultimate ambition clearly to reach the Premier League. Eriksen is not the only high-profile name they’ve been linked with this summer, with Jamie Vardy and Fulham’s Tom Cairney also reportedly on their radar, according to The Mail.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee had a fallow season, and United struggled to get the ball into the net. Adding Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer should go a long way towards solving that problem, but Amorim could also demand a new striker to make the most of this opportunity.",
      "Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko is widely admired across Europe, coming to prominence in Germany after a £20m move between Red Bull sister clubs Salzburg and RB Leipzig. He's had some good goalscoring seasons in the German Bundesliga, and has tallied up 16 Champions League goals over the course of two campaigns.",
      "At 22 years old, Sesko would fit the bill as a young star who can grow with the club as they rebuild. German media claims that a £60m bid would do the trick.",
      "For some fans, a striker like Sesko would complete the summer transfer window for United. Reader Itzmayor2406 says: \"The only striker that fits in the profile of potential world class strikers right now on the market is Sesko, he's only 22 and has his best days ahead of him, Newcastle signed Isak at 22, developed and now he's been priced at £120m.",
      "\"We are not looking at winning the league yet, but building a team to be able to do so in 3 years. A 15-20 goal striker, 22 years old, and potentially world class who will be 25 in 3 years on decent wages, is the way to go.\"",
      "Commenter Bestietom would like something like Sesko: \"We very much need a striker as all the top teams have acquired a top striker and we will again be left further behind. Sesko or even Vlahovic would be ideal for us. Both are available and we must get a striker to play with Cunha, and Mbeumo.\"",
      "Ep34109 writes: \"The media say we cannot afford to buy Sesko as he is too expensive (£60M plus I think) but now according to those same media outlets we are looking to bring Watkins to Old Trafford. Personally I would rather have Sesko (who is younger than Watkins). We have, in the past, bought older players for large amounts with no sell on value.\"",
      "Thetruthpersonified says: \"Has to be Sesko over Watkins. Much as I like Watkins he has peaked and will decline soon. What did Emery see that made him start Rashford ahead of Watkins! So for a similar transfer fee, surely it's Sesko. Personally, I find it hard to believe either will be viable until we get some inbound funds.\"",
      "TeesterX writes: \"Sesko is attracting interest from across Europe for a reason. I think now is the best time to buy. I think he'll be worth a lot more next summer.\"",
      "MrMo says: \"Really wanted Osimhen, but feel Sesko is the next best out there. Club should just go get him before we miss out AGAIN. Watkins' age is against him as Villa want to much and there would not be any sell on value in him. Jackson misses more than he scores and Chelsea want way more than he is worth. Out of the 3 that are available Sesko is a no brainer.\"",
      "Have your say! Should United go for Sesko if they can fit him in to their budget? Comment below, and join in on the conversation.",

      "Valencia have confirmed that one of their key players has left the club, which could go on to affect Manchester United.",
      "United have made two new signings so far this summer: Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Matheus Cunha from Wolves. With two new additions to Ruben Amorim's squad, United are already being linked with a third potential new signing.",
      "Valencia star Javi Guerra has been heavily linked with a move to United this summer. There have been reports that the Spain Under-21 international is being offered a new deal by the La Liga club, which is yet to be agreed and has led to United expressing an interest in a deal.",
      "If Guerra was to leave Valencia it would be another high-profile exit for the Spanish outfit. It was confirmed on Thursday that defender Cristhian Mosquera has left the club to complete a permanent move to Arsenal.",
      "In a statement released on their club website, Valencia confirmed that Mosquera has joined the Gunners after informing the club of his desire to move to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "\"Valencia CF and Arsenal FC have reached an agreement for the transfer of Cristhian Mosquera to the London club,\" the statement from Valencia read.",
      "\"This decision comes as a result of the clear and unequivocal desire expressed by the player, who has made it clear he did not wish to renew his contract with Valencia CF and expressed his intention to join Arsenal FC exclusively.",
      "\"Cristhian Mosquera joined the VCF Academy in 2016 and made his first-team debut in January 2022. Since then, he has played 90 official matches. Valencia CF wishes him the best of luck in the future.\"",
      "Mosquera is not the only player to leave Valencia this summer, with goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining Liverpool and defender Yarek Gasiorowski signing for PSV.",
      "It remains to be seen what Valencia will have planned for Guerra, with reports indicating their desire to keep the talented midfielder at the Mestalla amid rumoured interest from United. The Reds could be in the market for a new midfielder following Christian Eriksen's departure as a free agent.",

      "It has been widely reported that Isak is looking to pursue new opportunities, and the St James' Park club's hierarchy are aware of his wish to consider his options. The Magpies striker has not travelled with the rest of the Newcastle squad for their pre-season tour.",
      "Isak has three years left on his deal on Tyneside but has constantly been linked with a move away. Liverpool and Arsenal have been most heavily-linked with the Swede who has emerged as one of Europe's finest No.9's in recent seasons.",
      "And The iPaper claims that Man United-linked Benjamin Sesko is a possible replacement for Newcastle if Isak is allowed to leave. Newcastle are said to have been long-term suitors of the RB Leipzig striker.",
      "It has also been claimed by journalist Ben Jacobs on X that the Magpies are looking at a move for Leipzig’s Lois Openda. If Newcastle did complete a move for the Belgian forward - Sesko's departure would look increasingly less likely.",
      "United have so far been frustrated in their pursuit of a new striker this summer. The Reds missed out on a move for Liam Delap, who swapped Ipswich Town for Chelsea, and have been linked with Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen, who look set to join Arsenal and Galatasaray, respectively.",
      "The club will have to sell to buy after splashing out on new forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "It comes after Marcus Rashford was also left out before completing a season-long loan move to Barcelona on Sunday. It is understood that United will save around £12m in wages from Rashford's move to the Camp Nou.",

      "Van der Gaag joined United in May 2022, being installed as one of Erik ten Hag's assistants alongside Steve McClaren. The Dutchman had previously worked with Ten Hag at Ajax.",
      "The 53-year-old, who was installed as FC Zürich's head coach in May, left Old Trafford in July 2024 after United made the decision to shake up Ten Hag's coaching team. Former striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake were installed as Ten Hag's new assistants.",
      "Previously admitting he had ambitions of becoming a head coach himself when addressing his United exit, Van der Gaag has now opened up on his time at Old Trafford, describing his two years at the club as \"wonderful\".",
      "Despite that, he has admitted he was disappointed by the club's failure to make their mark in the Europa League. United exited the competition at the quarter-final stage in the 2022/23 season, losing 5-2 on aggregate to Sevilla",
      "\"I look back on my time at Manchester United positively,\" Van der Gaag told GiveMeSport. \"I think it was two wonderful years. They were very positive and I learned a lot.",
      "\"The first year was very positive because we finished in third place, won the Carabao Cup and went to the FA Cup final. I think the only disappointment, in my opinion, was that we could have been better in the Europa League. But I think the first year was very positive, so everyone expected that we could improve in the second season.",
      "\"That was a very strange season. We were not good enough in the Premier League or Champions League. There were very strange results as well because there were games we were winning comfortably and then drawing or losing.",
      "\"But, in the end, we won the FA Cup. It puts everything in a positive way, so that was important.",
      "\"They were two years when I learned a lot, especially about the way the Premier League functions, the way football is played and the tactical variations. It was something that I really enjoyed.\"",

      "Manchester United supporters could be charged up to £4,000 just to reserve their seat at their new stadium, according to a report by the Mail.",
      "United unveiled plans to build a new 100,000-seater stadium earlier this year. The club has aspirations of opening it in time for the start of the 2030/31 campaign.",
      "According to the report, United supporters may have to pay a huge sum of money to secure the right to buy a season ticket. It has been reported that a highly controversial introduction of a 'Personal Seat Licence' - a system frequently used in the USA - was 'one of a number of proposals' presented to fans by US-based consultants CSL International.",
      "Under the plans, it would see the introduction of a 'Personal Seat Licence' (PSL). It means United supporters would have to pay a one-off fee to secure a PSL before then having to pay separately for a season ticket.",
      "Under the system, which is often used in the US to part-fund new stadiums, fans who purchase a PSL would then have first refusal on their seat for the next 30 years. On the flip side, should they fail to buy a season ticket, they would automatically lose the licence.",
      "The initiative would give United supporters the guarantee of remaining in the same seats every year, but they would have to pay to secure that privilege. It is reported that cash raised from the purchases of PSL's could potentially go towards the cost of building the new stadium, which is set to be located next to Old Trafford.",
      "United have estimated the new arena will cost £2billion to build.",
      "It means ticket prices will increase for the most lucrative games of the season, such as the Manchester derby. United have confirmed the average cost of a general admission match ticket for this coming season will be £46.51.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee struggled to get onto the scoresheet last season, and the squad's overall output was a key part of a hugely disappointing campaign in the league. Top strikers like Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen may be out of reach for now, but there are \"Premier League-ready\" options that United could turn to if they want an immediate impact.",
      "Ollie Watkins has been impressive and energetic under Unai Emery at Aston Villa, but the inclusion of Marcus Rashford on loan dented his opportunities at times last season. United have reportedly made enquiries about the possibility of signing Watkins, who is valued at £60 million with three years left on his contract.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta is another option on the older side, having had a good couple of seasons at FA Cup winners Crystal Palace. RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko would come with a significant price tag, but has plenty of room to grow and brings Champions League experience.",
      "Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson may find himself out of favour after they signed former United target Liam Delap, and his situation is being monitored by top clubs.",
      "Fans are leaning towards one of these more realistic targets to add to their existing business. Reader Steady Irwin says: \"We are stronger, and have more goal potential in us, with less games, but we need a striker. I like Mateta because his strengths are Hojlund's weaknesses. Add him (or an alternative ) and someone with energy in the middle that can take a ball from the defenders and turn with it, and we've had a good window.\"",
      "Commenter Realredmanc writes: \"I like Ollie Watkins, but we should be careful about any contract offered.\"",
      "Toothpick says: \"For a club that isn't in any European football, we just need a striker who is a specialist. Either holds up the ball very well or knows when and how to position themselves in the box to score. We should avoid getting strikers whose abilities are unclear. We have too many strikers like Zirkzee and Hojlund who aren't excellent at any part of their game.\"",
      "Garth123 writes: \"With the profile of the striker Amorim is looking for. Ollie Watkins for me would be the best fit. If United can get him for under £50m, then we could get 3 or 4 good years out of him which will buy time for the development of Obi, who I think will inherit the No. 9 role in time.\"",
      "1968red says: \"Watkins in a swap with Garnacho would be better than a Mason Mount-type situation again with Chelsea, and monetarily better for us.\"",
      "Deanodo is dead against one option: \"No to Jackson, we don’t want any Chelsea rejects. If they're not good enough for Chelsea, why would we want them?\"",
      "Cdpc has different priorities: \"Personally I’d prioritize a dynamic box-to-box midfielder over a striker this year. I think for too long we’ve been overrun in midfield and had no interplay between the top 3. Everyone’s down on our current striker options, but if we’re fair, they’ve had terrible service over the past couple of years.\"",
      "IlSacristano writes: \"Ollie Watkins IMHO. A good striker who enjoys his game with a big smile. I think he's got a good few years in the tank.\"",
      "Have your say! Do United need a striker, or are they better off shoring up other parts of the pitch after the arrival of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo? Comment below, and join in on the conversation.",

      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with Manchester United unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "While no deal completed this summer can challenge the biggest overpays in Premier League history, plenty have already been made well in excess of a player’s reported market value.",
      "A few factors go into that assessment. Age, performance level and experience are inevitably taken into account but the number of interested teams, general market trends and the reputation and status of the leagues the selling and buying clubs belong to can also heavily dictate that that market value.",
      "And when it comes to those increasingly expensive intra-Premier League transfers there is basically a £10m surcharge applied before talks even commence.",
      "It is no coincidence that seven of the ten biggest supposed overpays – going by the numbers crunched by the fine folk at Transfermarkt – involve a pair of Premier League clubs both trying to orchestrate PSR-friendly deals.",
      "Nor that Real Madrid account for two of the others when they signed Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono, while Saudi side Al-Qadsiah apparently went overboard bringing in Mateo Retegui.",
      "But those eight Premier League overpays, made by five of the Big Six plus Newcastle, do beg the question as to who has been most royally screwed.",
      "",
      "Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool)",
      "Fee: £69m rising to £79m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £82.9m",
      "The Liverpool spin puts Ekitike firmly in the Haaland and Mbappe bracket in terms of potential at his age. And there is certainly an element of speculating to accumulate after committing such sums on a striker with 44 goals in 136 appearances",
      "It could all go quite Darwin Nunez, with an enticing European reputation, add-ons destined to remain unfulfilled and the hints of beautiful chaos not quite enough to sustain a career at a competent club ultimately driven by numbers.",
      "But it is notable that far less of the final value of the Ekitike signing is tied up in those performance-based clauses, while the guaranteed portion is higher too. Liverpool clearly feel he is the real thing who can be carefully nurtured, developed and moulded over time at Anfield.",
      "That does not make it a certainty that Ekitike will come good – no such thing exists in the world of transfers – but everyone is at least on the same page this time at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United)",
      "Fee: £65m rising to £71m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £47.7m",
      "It is little wonder an ‘angry’ Manchester United ‘slammed’ Brentford once the deal to sign Mbeumo was finally completed 44 days after their opening bid.",
      "That came in at around £45m plus £10m in add-ons, which the Bees were never going to accept but a testing of the waters was entirely necessary.",
      "Once a second offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons was rejected Ruben Amorim’s side had a choice to make: begrudgingly accept that various taxes from a Manchester United one to a general Premier League levy was going to be applied; or walk away from a deal for their priority target who they had already invested a large amount of the transfer window on pursuing.",
      "There was at one stage an insistence that Manchester United would not be held to ransom but they excel at few things more than baulking at a fee while paying it.",
      "This is their new transfer policy and it costs a pretty penny.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m rising to £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",

      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",

      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",

      "A multi-functional 26-year-old Brazilian international forward with 42 goal contributions in 82 Premier League appearances does, after all, come with a premium.",

      "Throw into the equation the fees Chelsea consistently pay for forwards in particular – and what is effectively the antithesis of a discount at their favourite shop as Brighton are still making them pay for the Moises Caicedo mess – and it could be suggested that the Blues paid over the odds.",

      "Marcus Rashford is said to be a “very lucky boy” to leave Manchester United for Barcelona as a move to the Championship club would be more “logical”.",
      "Rashford has fallen on his feet as he’s secured a move to La Liga champions Barcelona. He has joined the Spanish giants on loan with an option to buy for around £26m.",
      "The Man Utd outcast is fortunate to get this move as he has been heavily criticised for his poor form and attitude over the past couple of years.",
      "Ruben Amorim could not inspire the England international to return to form at Old Trafford as they butted heads before he joined Aston Villa on loan in January.",
      "Rashford boosted his reputation during his brief stint at Villa as he grabbed six goals and four assists in 17 appearances.",
      "READ: Manchester United make hilarious transfer ‘decision’ over Alexander Isak after ‘transfer request’",
      "His recent upturn sparked interest from elsewhere and Barcelona eventually decided to take a calculated punt on him after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams.",
      "Former Premier League forward Stan Collymore thinks Barcelona are “getting the best of the deal”, which is “poor” for Man Utd.",
      "“I think this Rashford deal is poor for Man United. For a player at the peak of his career that they’ve nurtured to possibly only get £25m for him if Barcelona buy him next summer, having paid an absolute arm and a leg in wages over the years, isn’t recompense at all,” Collymore told Caught Offside.",
      "“For the player, it’s quite unbelievable. He had a poor last season at Man United, goes to Aston Villa. Cameo appearances that were not particularly great, but by the way that Gary Lineker talks, you’d thought it was Lionel Messi playing for Villa last season.",
      "“For Barcelona, what do they get? They get a player on the cheap whose wages will be nowhere near the £300k mark if they were to buy him permanently next summer.",
      "“But they get the best of the deal, quite simply, because they’re going to get a player that’s motivated to play for them. All that was coming out through the season last season was, Marcus Rashford won’t sign for Aston Villa permanently because he’s waiting for Barcelona.”",
      "Collymore has also explained why a move to a Championship team would make more sense for Rashford at this stage.",
      "“I think the greatest story here is how players can effectively be so poor for a couple of seasons, basically, including the loan at Villa, and still dictate where they want to go to a club that’s playing in the Champions League and arguably among the four or five biggest clubs on the planet. And I find that remarkable,” Collymore continued.",
      "“I think that from a Barcelona perspective, it’s only because they’re still coming out of that negative financial situation that they were in, so that they were doing lots of wheeling and dealing in the last three or four years.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford, make no bones about it, he’s a very, very, very lucky boy, because if football had any logic, he would probably be getting a move to Blackburn, Norwich or another aspirational championship club – certainly not one of the top four or five clubs in the world.”",
      "Lamine Yamal reportedly feels he has been ‘deceived’ by Barcelona over the signing of Marcus Rashford, and is angry that he was not ‘involved’ in the transfer decision, like Lionel ...",
      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Man Utd.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford should’ve departed Manchester United a hero. Instead, his exit prompts barely a shrug as he gambles on Barca levers…",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",

      "Manchester United are ‘squeezing’ to sign a Barcelona star ‘ideal’ for Ruben Amorim’s system and ‘believe’ they can land him for £34.8m this summer.",
      "The Red Devils completed early deals for Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon this summer before a long-drawn-out negotiation with Brentford saw them finally land Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United chiefs are currently scouring the market for a new No.9, but Amorim also wants to add a new midfielder to his ranks, despite being ‘prohibited’ in that move by Casemiro remaining at the club.",
      "‘Well-placed sources say four intermediaries had a mandate to try and sell Casemiro, who has entered the last year of his United contract and earns around £300,000-a-week.",
      "‘United would require a fee of £15million to avoid a loss on Casemiro under the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules but an offer is unlikely to be forthcoming.’",
      "Despite that block, United are thought to be eyeing up Barcelona’s Marc Casado as a possible addition.",
      "Arsenal have been linked with a move for the midfielder, but a report earlier this month claimed United have  identified the La Masia graduate as a ‘key target’ with the Premier League side ‘preparing massive offer’ of €100m (£87m) for the midfielder.",
      "The report claimed Casado is ‘viewed as an ideal long-term alternative to Manuel Ugarte’, and while it was at that point thought that the only way to sign the Spaniard was to trigger his €100m release clause as Barcelona would ‘prefer to retain’ the defensive midfielder, the Red Devils are now of a different mind according to Spanish outlet Nacional.",

      "Manchester United face a ‘dilemma’ over the future of Kobbie Mainoo amid interest from Tottenham amid claims the midfielder’s agent is ‘not asking for too much money’.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with the Old Trafford exit for the last year, with Chelsea approaching the Red Devils last summer and again in January over a move for the England international.",
      "United initially insisted Mainoo was ‘untouchable’ and then slapped a £70m price tag on his head amid their PSR woes and the midfielder’s dip in form.",
      "TBR Football claimed on Thursday that Tottenham have made a ‘shock enquiry’ to sign Mainoo and ‘actually stand a chance of signing’ the England international.",
      "Spurs ‘have asked about signing’ Mainoo as the north Londoners ‘appreciate the 20-year-old and are keeping abreast of his contract situation, which still hasn’t been agreed’.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is ‘keen to add another’ midfielder this summer and Mainoo could fall down the pecking order at Old Trafford with the World Cup just around the corner.",
      "With that in mind, Mainoo ‘will be eager to be playing regular football’ and that ‘could open the door for Spurs and Chelsea’ as TBR Football ‘sources suggest he could still move this summer’.",
      "Talks over a contract extension have stalled after it was claimed Mainoo’s representatives were asking for £180,000 per week for him to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "Those reports were later refuted, but with Mainoo currently earning just £25,000 per week and with two years left on his deal, as Dean Saunders explains, United face a ‘dilemma’.",
      "Saunders told talkSPORT: “I know his agent, and he’s not asking for too much money in comparison to what the players are earning at Man United.",
      "“But it’s a dilemma for the football club, what do you do with Mainoo? How much money do you pay him?",
      "“Because he’s actually not done much in the game but gets in the England squad and now he’s in Man United’s team and there’s players earning three times more than him, four times more than him.",
      "“So to protect their asset, how much money have you got to give him to get him to sign a new contract?",
      "“Or, if he’s not going to sign it, they’re going to have to sell him, otherwise he walks out on a free. But I think he’d get in Spurs’ team.”",
      "Tottenham have made an approach to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo as his contract saga drags on, according to reports.",
      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Only three Premier League players are on offer…",
      "Mainoo is so much more than ‘pure profit’ and the very idea of selling him is an indictment of Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes."

      "Shaw made just 12 appearances for the Red Devils after missing the first three months of the campaign with a calf problem and his Old Trafford career in general has been continually blighted by injuries.",
      "United have worked to strengthen the left side of defence since Ruben Amorim’s arrival, with Patrick Dorgu joining from Lecce for £25m in January and Diego Leon added this summer in a £3.3m move from Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno.",
      "Leon played the first half of United’s 0-0 friendly draw with Leeds last weekend and Amorim was impressed with what he saw from the 18-year-old.",
      "“He did really well. He’s learning things, he’s powerful, he’s going to be a very good player,” Amorim said.",
      "Shaw is therefore facing the possibility of being fourth choice left wing-back in Amorim’s favoured 3-4-3 system, behind Leon, Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, who was a regular starter in that position last term, though Shaw has also operated as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "The Sun claim the 30-year-old ‘is aware of serious interest from Saudi clubs and is ready to listen to offers’ amid ‘fears his Red Devils career might be nearing an end’ despite having two years left on his contract, though Amorim is ‘in no hurry’ to get rid of him.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Shaw is seen as a popular and influential figure within the dressing room and Amorim is in no hurry to dump him or his £150,000-a-week wages. But the player himself is determined to make up for so much lost time and knows he faces a tough decision on his future over the coming months.",
      "‘Should he decide to leave it is unlikely United would be difficult to deal with in terms of a fee considering all those injuries and his lack of appearances – only 27 in the last two campaigns.’",
      "The Sun also claim that the Red Devils have ‘ruled out breaking the bank’ to sign a new No.9 as ‘the club is not in a position to go large unless there are significant exits’.",
      "This is a factor in Hojlund’s favour as ‘the decision not to push the boat out opens the door’ for him ‘to stake his claim during the three-match Premier League Summer Series tournament against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton’.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s verdict on the striker is another reason behind United’s sale decision. The report adds:",
      "‘United chief Ruben Amorim, though, looks set to give the Dane, 22, a final chance to show he can be the Old Trafford spearhead.",
      "‘Amorim believes the arrivals of Cunha and Mbeumo will give United a new attacking dynamism, allowing Hojlund to flourish in front of goal.’",
      "Tottenham were slightly better than a terrible Man Utd to win an actual trophy, but they’ve got four players in this list of ten who should be axed this summer.",
      "Mohamed Salah makes a rare appearance in the Premier League Worst XI and he is joined by two Liverpool teammates after their 3-1 defeat at Chelsea.",
      "A new report claims Manchester United’s decision to reward Luke Shaw with a new contract ‘didn’t align with the data’ at the time."

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Anthony Gordon – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt’s been pretty quiet around Gordon so far this summer, but it seems someone is trying to drum up the noise. We all know he would probably walk to Anfield to join Liverpool, so most likely the stirring is being done by the those close to the player. Who will be dismayed by Alexander Isak’s stance since the Reds will most likely throw their money at the Swede over the Scouser.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "19) 🆕 Luke Shaw – Manchester United to Saudi\nThis hasn’t reached the stage yet of a suitor being named but reports suggest Shaw has seen the writing on the wall for his United career and he’s willing to make the best of it by taking the Saudi coin. Sadly, Ruben Amorim will have taken the view that Shaw’s fitness cannot be relied upon, and he is now well-stocked for left wing-backs. There is no urgency here – it could be one for January.",
      "",
      "18) 🔼 Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nUnited are ready to get a deal done quickly, apparently, at around £20million for the Spain Under-21 midfielder who has just rejected Valencia’s latest offer of a contract renewal. Reports suggest Guerra is hoping for a better offer from Valencia so this could simply be a case of his representatives using United and the oldest trick in the agents’ book.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Emi Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited have been heavily linked with the Villa keeper, but their intent was limited to a pitiful loan offer which the Villans, understandably, laughed off. Reports in Argentina suggest that’s as far as United will go, and Martinez will instead consider cashing in over in Saudi.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Antony – Manchester United to Atletico Madrid \nUnited have hoped Real Betis would somehow find the funds to pay £30million to make Antony’s loan a permanent arrangement, but they appear to have been stringing United along all summer. According to reports in Spain, Atletico are ready to step into the breach. Though neither are they likely to be a simple answer to United’s problem here.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nNo sooner had we reports of renewed interest from United in Watkins did we have the rebuttal from Villa. The England striker is considered by the Villans as ‘not for sale’. Which is what anyone looking to sell for top dollar would say at first. Watkins is valued at £60million by Villa. United would doubtless seek to negotiate down from there but we’re struggling to see where the two clubs find common ground here if this was a deal done in isolation.",
      "",
      "14) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, reaffirming somewhat that the winger has a higher opinion of himself than most others do. Chelsea and Spurs have been linked but it has always been tentative. The noise has been building around Villa’s interest in Garnacho, but like United’s view on Watkins, they can’t pay the amount requested. With all the accounting sorcery prompted by PSR, we’re sure there’s a workaround here that leaves everyone happy.",
      "",
      "13) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko seemed to be going nowhere while Leipzig were demanding in excess of £75million but in news sure to grind Arsenal’s gears, reports in Germany suggest that demand could have fallen to £59million, which would make the Slovenian much more appealing to United.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nIt was thought Xhaka might be heading for the riches of Saudi but instead he fancies the splendour of Sunderland. Indeed, the ex-Arsenal midfielder has told Leverkusen he only wants to move to the Stadium of Light while urging the German club to do a deal quickly. Those pleas, though, appear to have fallen on deaf ears, with Erik ten Hag insisting Leverkusen have already lost too many key players this summer.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up right now with Gyokeres, but once that deal is done, we should expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "9) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and he is the first on their list should Isak get his wish.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "7) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Sancho’s agent has been in Turin this week to attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "6) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. Only problem now is they need to deal with Brentford. Wissa reportedly returned early from the Bees’ pre-season training camp for talks over his future – he is unlikely to have liked what he was told. Quite reasonably, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa – the suggestion was he was only ever viewed as back-up to Isak – then they are going to have to try a lot harder than £25million.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe didn’t think this done just because Newcastle had told Liverpool that Isak was not for sale. Their stance hasn’t changed – but everything else has after Isak agitated for a move. If only he had done it sooner, Liverpool might not have spent the money on Hugo Ekitike, who might have filled the Isak void at Newcastle. Instead, the expectation is the pair will team up at Anfield. It won’t happen quick – Newcastle are determined to dig in and their worst-case scenario has to involve a British transfer record fee – but it’ll probably happen.",
      "",
      "3) Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nThis one doesn’t seem to have moved in since Forest saw their arse over Spurs randomly plucking the same number out of the sky that appears on Gibbs-White contract under the buy-out clause. Forest threatened legal action and since then… nothing. The player missed the start of Forest’s pre-season trip to Portugal to stay behind with his heavily pregnant partner but joined up on Wednesday. What now? For this to go through, Spurs must suss that they are legally on solid ground and pursue the deal at the cost of their original offer; or they sweeten the deal for Forest to sell a player who wants to move.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThe Netherlands defender’s agent is quite open about talks that have taken place with Chelsea, who have also been in touch with Ajax. Hato has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Real Madrid, but he’s apparently already ‘said yes’ to Chelsea, who seem intent on getting to the teenager first. Hato was left out of the Ajax squad for Thursday night’s friendly against Celtic in Como.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nAfter bemoaning the abject lack of progress in the last week, it seems we finally have some. On Tuesday, Ornstein reported that Sporting and Arsenal are ‘on the verge of total agreement’. Which is where we thought they were but, apparently, a ‘conclusion is imminent’. Which is something we can all be thankful for. Gyokeres is said to be waiting, passport in hand, to join Arsenal in Asia."

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a final decision on whether to offload Rasmus Hojlund this summer amid two key factors.",
      "Hojlund joined Man Utd from Serie A outfit Atalanta during the 2023 summer transfer window in a deal worth around £64m plus add-ons.",
      "The Denmark international was in a difficult situation during his debut campaign in 2023/24 as he spent most of the season as United‘s only fit striker, but he earned plaudits as he scored 16 goals in all competitions.",
      "However, the 22-year-old regressed last season and was heavily criticised for his dire performances, as he struggled to perform the basics. He only scored four Premier League goals in 32 appearances as Joshua Zirkzee outshone him during the run-in.",
      "Hojlund’s disappointing decline has fuelled exit speculation as he has been heavily linked with a return to Serie A in recent months, with Inter Milan and Juventus mooted as possible destinations for the £40m-rated forward.",
      "READ: Premier League Bomb Squad XI includes Manchester United trio and Newcastle’s PSR pawn",
      "It has been suggested that Hojlund’s exit could fund a move for a new striker, as Man Utd do not currently have the financial means to buy before selling pricey assets.",
      "United are currently sixth in our ranking of this summer’s biggest spenders in Europe as they have invested around £130m to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "But they are struggling to recoup funds through player sales as Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan, while Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony remain contracted to Man Utd.",
      "After landing Mbeumo and Cunha, it has been reported that United’s next priority is to sign a striker. However, their limited budget is causing problems after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Now, The Sun reports that the Red Devils have ‘ruled out breaking the bank’ to sign a new No.9 as ‘the club is not in a position to go large unless there are significant exits’.",
      "This is a factor in Hojlund’s favour as ‘the decision not to push the boat out opens the door’ for him ‘to stake his claim during the three-match Premier League Summer Series tournament against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton’.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s verdict on the striker is another reason behind United’s sale decision. The report adds:",
      "‘United chief Ruben Amorim, though, looks set to give the Dane, 22, a final chance to show he can be the Old Trafford spearhead.",
      "‘Amorim believes the arrivals of Cunha and Mbeumo will give United a new attacking dynamism, allowing Hojlund to flourish in front of goal.’",
      "Rasmus Hojlund’s agent is pushing his client towards a return move to Serie A this summer as Man Utd set their price, according to reports.",
      "Lots of Premier League managers will start the 25/26 season under pretty hefty pressure. Here then are their potential successors.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made the ‘fastest move’ as they look to fend off competition from rivals to sign a £45m Premier League star.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘frustrated’ at how this summer transfer window is going for Manchester United after making two ‘priority demands’.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has set a clear ‘deadline’ for Manchester United to complete their third summer signing.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘weighing up’ a ‘reunion’ for one of Ruben Amorim’s former Sporting CP stars, as it’s felt they will ‘listen to offers’."

      "",
      "Arsenal: Add an elite left-sided attacker\nEasier said than done for Arsenal, who have spent the kind of money needed for Alexander Isak on Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres. The Newcastle striker’s transfer request came at the worst time for the Gunners, while Liverpool might already be feeling some buyer’s remorse after spending big on the versatile Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Madueke gives Mikel Arteta a new wide option, but he’s not a significant upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli on the left. He offers outstanding depth for Bukayo Saka and, considering Liverpool just won the title with Luis Diaz, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota as their left-wingers – after City dominated with Jeremy Doku, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez – it’s a smarter signing than most realise.",
      "Martinelli’s development has stalled, scoring just 14 goals across the last two seasons after netting 15 in 2022/23, and Leandro Trossard is more bench spark than starter. The next big-money addition for the Gunners after Madueke, Gyokeres and Martin Zubimendi should be a top-tier left-sided forward.",
      "Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze – naturally a midfielder – is a possible option, but the dream is Real Madrid winger Rodrygo. He’s available, and selling Martinelli to fund that move would be smart business.",

      "They made two smart January loan signings, Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio, who contributed to 29.3% of their goals from February onwards. Both have returned to their parent clubs, and that output now needs replacing. Only Fulham (£0) and Crystal Palace (£2m) have spent less this summer.",
      "Villa are in their best position in decades, but they risk falling behind as the teams around them strengthen. Clubs that finished above them are pulling away again and those below, like Manchester United, Spurs and Brighton, are closing the gap.",
      "Back in April, we said Emery needed a right-back. That still hasn’t happened. Once that’s sorted, they can get moving on the rest. They’ll need an attacker and a goalkeeper if Emiliano Martinez departs.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Defensive recruits\nIt’s rare to lose four of your back five in one summer, but that’s where Bournemouth find themselves. They’ve already lost 60%, and PSG target Illia Zabarnyi could soon make that 80%, joining Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and on-loan goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga out the door.",
      "They’ve signed a goalkeeper in Djordje Petrovic and a left-back in Adrien Truffert, but they’re yet to add a centre-back, when they might actually need two. And just like Villa, the one position that needed addressing most going into the window (right-back) still hasn’t been sorted.",
      "The priorities are obvious and Bournemouth need to get moving.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Replace Bryan Mbeumo\nChristian Norgaard has been replaced by Jordan Henderson. Caoimhin Kelleher is in for Mark Flekken. Attacking midfielder Antoni Milambo has joined. Now comes the hard part: replacing their best player.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 league goals last season before joining Manchester United for an initial £65million. That’s a massive hole to fill, but Brentford have the money and are one of the savviest recruitment teams in the league. Their most impressive work came in the Championship, but they’ve earned trust.",

      "Players Chelsea wouldn’t be blamed for moving on: Marc Guiu, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Joao Felix, David Datro Fofana, Raheem Sterling, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Carney Chukwuemeka, Alfie Gilchrist, Ben Chilwell, Aaron Anselmino, Axel Disasi, Benoit Badiashile, Gabriel Slonina, and Kendry Paez on loan.",

      "With Isak now pushing to leave Newcastle, Liverpool are back in the mix. That could mean Luis Diaz joins Bayern and Darwin Nunez is finally moved on.",

      "",
      "West Ham: Sort the stiffness\nIt’s tough to explain, but this West Ham squad just feels…stiff. Without Mohammed Kudus, there’s a worrying lack of athleticism. Lucas Paqueta’s form has dipped since the betting scandal. Beyond Crysencio Summerville and Jarrod Bowen, there’s not much flair.",

      "Manchester United are ‘prohibited’ from signing a top target this summer thanks to one current Red Devils star after ‘four intermediaries’ failed in their ‘mandate’.",

      "Manager Ruben Amorim now wants to add a new No.9 and a central midfielder to his ranks, with the focus primarily on a striker.",

      "The Athletic‘s Ornstein has confirmed that United have held ‘talks’ over a move for Sesko, along with Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson.",
      "Ornstein said: “Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "After claiming Sesko is “the one to watch”, Ben Jacobs revealed ‘fresh talks’ over a move for Watkins.",
      "Jacobs wrote on X: Manchester United have held fresh talks over Ollie Watkins. Villa’s £60m valuation currently deemed as too high, but #MUFC prepared to advance things if price drops. Villa have no plans to alter their position unless a replacement is found. Nicolas Jackson one player appreciated’.",
      "United are also interested in Valencia’s Javi Guerra and were handed a huge boost in their bid to land the midfielder on Wednesday, with Spanish newspaper Marca claiming that Spain Under-21 international Guerra ‘has decided to reject the renewal offer’ from Valencia.",
      "The player’s representatives expect ‘something better’ and Man Utd ‘continues to work behind the scenes to bring him to the Premier League’.",

      "Journalist Sebastien Vidal later revealed that Guerra has given United the ‘green light’ to seal a transfer.",
      "Vidal wrote on X: ‘Man Utd are ready to finalise the £21.5m signing of Javi Guerra. The Valencia midfielder has given a verbal green light to join Old Trafford despite interest from elsewhere. The Red Devils want to wrap up the deal quickly.’",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Well-placed sources say four intermediaries had a mandate to try and sell Casemiro, who has entered the last year of his United contract and earns around £300,000-a-week.",
      "‘United would require a fee of £15million to avoid a loss on Casemiro under the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules but an offer is unlikely to be forthcoming.’",

      "Manchester United have quickly been told that a striker from a Premier League rival is ‘not for sale’, though there’s still a chance they land his team-mate.",
      "United have spent a lot of the summer with eyes on a few talented strikers. They have eyed Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Nicolas Jackson, and Ollie Watkins, among others.",
      "The former is heading to Arsenal, United have reportedly left the race for Sesko, though there is still seemingly active interest in the latter pair.",
      "On Thursday, it was reported that the Red Devils had held fresh talks over Watkins, but deemed his £60million price tag too high.",
      "It was said they would be ‘prepared to advance’ if the price dropped, but Villa were not willing to shift their demands unless a replacement was found.",
      "However, a fresh report has suggested that Villa have responded with a different stance.",
      "Indeed, The Telegraph states the Villans have told United that Watkins is ‘not for sale’. There is no mention of £60million being enough to land him, with no price at all reported.",
      "Indeed, Villa have ‘no plans’ to part with Watkins and ‘insist he is not for sale at any price’. There seems more chance of United landing Watkins’ Villa team-mate Emi Martinez, though.",
      "The Villa goalkeeper has been on United’s radar since the end of last season, and with his future uncertain, he will be allowed to leave if a club meets their £40million asking price.",
      "United have still seemed to be in the mix for him, but had their last offer, for a loan, turned away.",
      "It seems Villa were somewhat offended by the offer of taking Martinez on a short-term basis, as it was reported it was ‘met with incredulity and and rebuffed immediately‘.",
      "But there have since been reports that United don’t want to pay Villa’s asking price for the Argentine, and therefore have ‘cooled’ their interest.",
      "Beyond that, it’s been suggested that the possibility of the goalkeeper leaving the Premier League for Saudi Arabia has been floated.",
      "Martinez was linked with Saudi sides at the end of last season, but reports since then have suggested he’d rather go to United. If he can’t make that move, though, a Saudi switch might be the best course of action.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has told Manchester United to “break the bank” to sign a “Ruben Amorim-type player” in the Premier League over an “inexperienced” striker.",
      "Man Utd are “not actively pursuing” Sesko as he didn’t “tear it up” for RB Leipzig last season and have been told a second striker target is ‘not for sale’.",
      "Man Utd have ‘cooled’ their interest in signing Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez this summer, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are signing Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool have signed Hugo Ekitike, but Alexander Isak has become the best striker available this summer.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Juventus – £91.84m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "8) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £136.7m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Arsenal are signing Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool have signed Hugo Ekitike. The latter are still in for Alexander Isak, while the former are surely full of regret after discovering the Newcastle United striker’s shock transfer stance. He rams through the opposition to take top spot in our ranking of the best centre-forwards available this summer.",
      "We also have the best available attacking midfielders, centre-backs, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African striker’s move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers can’t be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football could do a lot worse, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",

      "9) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Naturally, Manchester United are a solid option for Kolo Muani, while Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldn’t be ruled out either, having sent Marcus Rashford back to Old Trafford and returned Marco Asensio to PSG.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping £80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but he’s only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. He’s been a colossal flop but there’s still hope for Kolo Muani.",

      "",
      "8) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, while the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford don’t want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning £65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting £27m for David Raya and £40m for Ivan Toney. Somehow though, Craig Hope reckons the Bees will accept ‘a fee in the region of £30m’.",
      "If that’s true, we should see Wissa holding up a Newcastle United top in no time.",
      "",
      "7) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nOn a list containing two Leipzig players, here is a former Leipzig player. During his time in Germany, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino’s team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. There is talk of Newcastle targeting him after missing out on Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If he’s available for under £40m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors.",
      "",
      "6) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nThe Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him. But who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli were very interested but showed no intention of paying £60m and signed Lorenzo Lucca instead, so the Reds are now anxiously hoping a Saudi Arabian club offers big bucks for Darwin to help fund the signing of Alexander Isak.",
      "Darwin is only 26, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leave a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",

      "",
      "5) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him – it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "4) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface could be part of a summer exodus at Bayer Leverkusen, but head coach Erik ten Hag has said there have already been too many sales since his arrival. That spells bad news for Sunderland target Granit Xhaka.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "3) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentford’s Wissa. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Probably from Manchester United.",
      "",
      "2) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nPredicting Benjamin Sesko’s future is essentially pointless at this stage.",
      "There is a lot of hype surrounding the young Slovenian and a move to Arsenal looked likely before they prioritised Viktor Gyokeres. Now, it’s anyone’s guess where he’ll be playing next season. Manchester United have been linked but need sales before even considering bidding for him, while Saudi Arabian champions Al Hilal have tried and failed already this summer.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite forward, but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could become the best striker in the world.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nWell, well, well. Isak has reportedly told Newcastle he wishes to explore his options this summer, just days after Arsenal received a Viktor Gyokeres ‘Here we go’, and Liverpool confirmed the signing of Hugo Ekitike. It’s very telling that the Reds have been briefing that Ekitike can play wide, with Fabrizio Romano reporting they’re still interested in Isak.",
      "That’s despite having already spent over £100m on Florian Wirtz, £70m combined on full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and now an initial £69m on Ekitike. My oh my, they mean serious business.",
      "Isak is one of the best strikers in world football, and his transfer stance has shocked many and rightly upset Newcastle fans, who are now dreading the loss of their talisman. The Swedish international has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances for the Magpies and is valued at around £130m.",
      "",
      "According to reports, an ‘ideal’ replacement for Alexander Isak has decided his ‘stance’ on a potential £70m move to Newcastle United.",
      "Liverpool have been told what they will have to pay to sign Isak this summer by ‘people close to the situation’ as his Newcastle teammates now expect him to leave.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United star Alexander Isak has ‘set a condition’ for him to ‘accept an offer’ amid interest from Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United have chosen not to sign Alexander Isak and that is their call, but one player has dropped a ‘bombshell’ with their decision to ‘QUIT’.",
      "According to reports, PIF have ‘intervened’ to impact Liverpool’s hopes of signing Alexander Isak from Premier League rivals Newcastle United.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has told Manchester United to “break the bank” to sign a “Ruben Amorim-type player” in the Premier League over an “inexperienced” striker."

      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "Bild journalist Christian Falk revealed on Wednesday that Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting, could be ‘key’ to Sesko’s transfer having previously worked at RB Leipzig, and was seen watching the striker in action for Leipzig in April.",
      "It was claimed earlier in the window that the Bundesliga club were looking for a fee of at least £70m for their prized asset amid strong interest from Arsenal, but Bild now believe Leipzig will settle for a more ‘realistic price’ of £59m for Sesko.",
      "But journalist Ben Jacobs claims that United are once again considering a move for Watkins, though Villa are staying firm in their £60m valuation of the England international.",
      "Jacobs wrote on X: Manchester United have held fresh talks over Ollie Watkins. Villa’s £60m valuation currently deemed as too high, but #MUFC prepared to advance things if price drops.

      "Jacobs told Inside Devils: “There are a few names that leap out as United discuss internally about their targets.",

      "“So he’s a longstanding target for Man United and now you’ve got Chris Vivell who is the director of recruitment – effectively the No.2 to Jason Wilcox – and he knows Sesko from his own time at the Red Bull group.",
      "“So at the right price that’s a deal Manchester United would like to do, but Arsenal struggled to drive his release clause down, which is over €80million (£69m) and that’s why if Sesko to Manchester United is to develop there may be some patience required.",
      "“There’s a lot of talk about Nicolas Jackson and my understanding there is that at the moment Manchester United have no plans to bid, and that’s partially because Chelsea’s asking price is quite high.",
      "“If that was to change I think Chelsea might have to escalate their own pursuit of Garnacho and then maybe there’s some mutual business to be done, but all signs as of now are that Man United don’t think Jackson is feasible.",

Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "16) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "14=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "A big overseas move can’t be entirely ruled out, but we’re still very much in rank outsider territory here.",
      "",
      "12=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s little chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five. And for some reason the bookies agree that he is nowhere near safe.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "9) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "7=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "7=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "5=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which is possible after the exits of Anthony Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "2=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "2=) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford if they sell Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "1) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success.",
      "The idea that Mikel Arteta must either win the Premier League title this season or be sacked by Arsenal next summer is flawed for a number of reasons.",
      "Mikel Arteta’s ‘cheating’ is tipped to push Arsenal down to fourth as the Gunners are defended over Thomas Partey and Liverpool fears are allayed.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal are in ‘do or die’ seasons for very different reasons as Mikel Arteta faces becoming ‘the new Brendan Rodgers’…",
      "Mikel Arteta is pushing Arsenal to complete a deal for Viktor Gyokeres today after the Sporting star entered a seventh day of ‘unexcused absence’.",
      "Mikel Arteta loves an excuse and can blame his sacking at the end of another trophyless season on Andrea Berta, Liverpool and fans of The Arsenal."

      "Man Utd's Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan; the deal gives Barca the option to buy the England international,  27, at the end of the season; the forward's Man Utd career has appeared over since a public fallout with manager Ruben Amorim last winter",
      "Thursday 24 July 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as \"a club where dreams come true\".",
      "Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford said at his unveiling. \"It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here.",
      "\"It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.\"",
      "A Barcelona statement said: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until 30 June 2026. The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.",
      "\"The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta; the director of the Football Area, and other Board members.\"",
      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",
      "The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.",
      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",
      "It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.",
      "The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.",
      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.",
      "\"This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",
      "Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.",
      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",
      "\"I've nothing bad to say,\" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.",
      "The only slight hiccup Rashford made all day was timekeeping. He arrived 15 minutes late for the contract signing ceremony, but no one seemed to mind.",
      "The first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker posed near an old English telephone box as part of his official club video.",
      "Apt.",
      "Because at his media unveiling, Marcus Rashford rang the right tone and kept everyone engaged. He may well have found his calling.",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",

      "Marcus Rashford has completed his season-long loan move to Barcelona, which, SSN understands, includes an option to buy for £26m; Rashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa; now Spain switch presents a big opportunity",
      "Thursday 24 July 2025 11:34, UK",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Already linked with Manchester United and West Ham, Parma's Zion Suzuki is one of the great young goalkeeping talents. Adam Bate speaks to those who have worked with the Japan international to find out why clubs are so excited about his potential...",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:19, UK",
      "It seems inevitable that Zion Suzuki will move to the Premier League one day. Already courted by Manchester United and West Ham, it is just a matter of when. The hype is justified. This 22-year-old Japan international is seen as a new breed of goalkeeper.",
      "It is by design. Japan have been throwing resources at football with a specific target in mind. Project 2050. The aim is to win a World Cup by then. Frans Hoek, the legendary goalkeeping coach, has been tasked with identifying the traits of the goalkeeper of the future.",
      "In Suzuki, back when he was sat among the substitutes for Urawa Red Diamonds, Hoek spotted all the ingredients required to do it all. \"I saw him in a camp and said, 'This guy has to go to Europe as soon as possible. It does not matter what league it is. He has to play.'\"",
      "And so, Suzuki embarked on the adventure that has taken him to Belgium with Sint-Truiden, onto Italy with Parma and now linked with some of the richest clubs in Europe. Still only 22, the only question is when to make the leap. Those who know him do not doubt his talent.",
      "\"He is a really quiet guy, a really calm character. That is him off the pitch.\" On the pitch, Suzuki becomes something else entirely. He dominates. \"He is really aggressive because he has massive physical strength.\" He is 6'3\" but looks bigger. \"He is so powerful, so dynamic.\"",
      "That physicality clearly underpins his potential. \"It is like his body is just made of muscles. And I have never seen in my life a goalkeeper who can jump higher. His physical tests were off the charts.\" But it is what this physicality enables him to do that is particularly intriguing.",
      "Rudel enjoys telling the story of one of his first sessions with Suzuki. As the goalkeeper coach, he was setting up a drill. \"I said to him, 'Okay, now show me how far you can throw.' I looked away and then saw this ball flying 20 metres over the halfway line,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I turned around and said to him, 'I told you to throw it not kick it.' He just smiled back at me and replied, 'But I did throw it.' I told him to show me again because I could not believe that someone had that much power in their body that they could throw the ball that far.\"",
      "Rudel rates Suzuki as \"above average\" with his feet but as has been seen with Ederson at Manchester City, the tactical significance of being able to pass short and long has increased. Suzuki ranked third for long passes in Serie A last season and second for throws.",
      "In Belgium, Rudel remembers some stunning saves away to Club Brugge, with one stop in particular becoming his trademark. \"It is those low saves because he is so dynamic and so quick to get down. He has unbelievable reflexes. For me, that is his biggest strength.\"",
      "There have been many examples of that for Parma. One down to his left to keep out Tijjani Reijnders' shot for AC Milan in the San Siro stands out, while the save away to Empoli against Ismael Konate was similar. Denying Como's Marc Kempf a headed goal was even better.",
      "The pick of the lot came against Roma in February when he produced an outrageous double save that defied belief. After keeping out Matias Soule's shot, he somehow scrambled to claw away Anass Salah-Eddine's follow-up. It was the save of the season.",
      "\"With those low power saves, his arms are so strong,\" says Rudel in reference to the technique behind it. \"Sometimes when goalkeepers go down fast and get their fingers to the ball, it still goes backwards. That never happens to him. He has crazy power in his hands.\"",
      "What makes Suzuki so fascinating is that he combines these reflex stops with a commanding presence. Think of the great goalkeepers and they tend to favour one or the other. But Suzuki does more than get down low to make saves, he gets high to snuff out the danger.",
      "He caught 55 crosses for Parma last season, 21 more than his nearest rival in Serie A. Across Europe's five major leagues, only Joan Garcia, snapped up by Barcelona this summer, claimed more crosses. Outside the area, Suzuki ranked second in Serie A for sweeping up.",
      "There are still things to work on, as one might expect of a goalkeeper who is still only 22 years old. He also dropped nine catches - a Serie A high - reflecting the fact that this desire to be proactive comes with risk. But he continues to progress, a theme of his short career.",
      "\"That is another of his strengths and why I am convinced that he can perform in the Premier League,\" says Rudel. \"He went from Japan to Belgium and then Belgium to Italy. Those are big adaptations but he did it really quickly. That is what separates the really good ones.\"",
      "Asked if Suzuki will go to the very top, Rudel has no doubts. \"One hundred per cent.\" The only question is how best to manage the journey. Some advise him to wait and play one more season with Parma. But sooner or later, Zion Suzuki will make a very big move.",

      "AC Milan are also keen on Jackson, but talks via intermediaries have highlighted a gap in valuation. Milan also have United's Rasmus Hojlund on their list, as well as Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta.",
      "Chelsea are not actively trying to sell any of their players. There continues to be interest in Jackson from multiple clubs, especially as strikers are in demand and short supply this summer. At the moment, Jackson is staying at Stamford Bridge, but that is not guaranteed to be the case by the time the window closes.",
      "Watkins' future at Aston Villa has been the subject of further speculation this summer after Arsenal made an approach for him in January.",
      "Although he is 29 and not expected to demand the same fee as a Sesko or Gyokeres, the England international's quality means he is on the list of a lot of top clubs this summer.",
      "United have a long-standing interest in Watkins, though there has been no official club-to-club contact yet.",
      "There is no doubt Watkins could provide a quality addition to any team, but Villa will not let him go easily - he has and continues to be an incredibly important player for them.",
      "United made inquiries about Kolo Muani in January, along with Tottenham, before he joined Juventus on loan for the rest of the season.",

      "The Nigeria international was on loan at the Turkish club from Napoli last season, and the two parties have reached an agreement for Osimhen.",
      "Galatasaray are paying £64.9m (€75m) in three instalments in a deal which includes a 10 per cent sell-on clause for Napoli.",
      "They have also negotiated a clause that means Galatasaray would have to pay a penalty to Napoli if Osimhen is sold to another Italian club over the next two years.",
