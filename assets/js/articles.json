      "Michael Carrick is set to be in charge until the end of the season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Sam Allardyce has told Manchester United to think very carefully before handing Michael Carrick the reins full term. The former midfielder was appointed as Red Devils’ boss earlier this month as a replacement for Ruben Amorim.",
      "He was only put in charge until the end of the season but has impressed with three wins in a row in the Premier League. That has seen some suggest that Carrick should be retained beyond the end of the campaign.",
      "But Allardyce has suggested that club chiefs need to bide their time before being rushed into a decision. Speaking on the Footy Accumulators No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, he said: “Everybody wants him [Carrick] to be appointed.",
      "“But is it the right decision? The board are under so much pressure now, once again, given the job that they're doing. Is it the right thing to do? So they've got to be calculated, cruel, if you like.",
      "“You've got to make sure that your next choice is not built on heart. It's not from the heart, it's from the mind. Because [Ruben] Amorim couldn't handle Man United for me.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“It's a special sort of internal desire as a player and as the manager to survive at Man United and then become successful. So you need to learn to live with it and flourish from it, not shrivel and end up getting sold on or losing your job as the manager.",
      "“The respect and praise he’s got from the players so far, that's management, isn't it? That's not coaching. That's managing.”",
      "Former United star Roy Keane has also given his verdict on Carrick being given the permanent job and suggested that should the Red Devils continue their current form, he would be a shoo-in.",
      "He said: \"I hope they give it to him, I hope they give it to him in the summer. I don’t think it’s the right decision, good luck with it. I’m sticking to my guns, I’ve said my piece.",
      "Michael Carrick has won each of his three games at the helm(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“I think he’s got the job and if he gets it in the summer, you go ‘listen, good luck to him’. But as a caretaker manager, it’s a different animal to being a manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years whatever it might be.",
      "\"I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely, but I think he’s doing a good job. Perfect timing for him and even if he doesn’t get the United job, these results are a bit like Ruud (van Nistelrooy) and he can get another job. He’ll probably get a Premiership manager (job).",
      "\"But just because you’re doing well at United, doesn’t mean he’ll do well at another club. He’s got the players back, it’s all been sliding doors moments. Great for him and he’s taken advantage of it.\"",
      "United will be aiming to extend their brilliant form this weekend as they take on Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Casemiro scored from the resulting free-kick after Manchester United were denied a penalty(Image: Martin Rickett/PA Wire)",
      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has offered his verdict on the controversial incident surrounding Manchester United's opening goal against Fulham. Whites manager Marco Silva criticised what he believed was an extraordinary VAR ruling to grant United a free-kick that led to their first goal during his team's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Referee John Brooks originally pointed to the penalty spot after Matheus Cunha went to ground following Jorge Cuenca's challenge. Replays revealed Cuenca had won the ball cleanly, but rather than completely reversing the decision, VAR suggested United should receive a free-kick on the touchline.",
      "The reason was that Brooks had awarded the penalty for a tug that occurred outside the area. Casemiro nodded home from the subsequent free-kick to break the deadlock.",
      "Silva believed the video assistant had effectively re-officiated the match, but Gallagher said: \"Straight away, I knew it wasn't a penalty.",
      "“The trajectory of the ball told me everything. There's no doubt he lets go of the shirt before they enter the penalty area. It's factually outside, so they gave a free-kick.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"They decide it's not a penalty, so then it should be a drop ball for Fulham, but they go back to try and get themselves out of jail.",
      "\"The referee makes the decision on the tackle, not the shirt pull. The problem they've got is they go back and give the shirt pull, which is outside the area and then they score from the free-kick.\"",
      "Marco Silva was furious with the officials after Fulham's defeat to Manchester United(Image: AFP/Getty Images)",
      "Speaking after the match at Old Trafford, Silva said: “The penalty was given – it was a bad, bad, bad decision from John Brooks.",
      "“The penalty was given for the tackle of Cuenca, that was clear. Then after they found the pull three, four seconds before.",
      "“The ball went for a corner. The feedback we got on the touchline was that after the review John Brooks was going to go to the screen because in VAR’s opinion it was not a penalty and that after that comes a completely different decision, they give a free-kick for a pull.",
      "“It’s the first time this season that a penalty has been given for one incident and then a VAR decision comes from a completely different incident and gave a free-kick. It’s the first time we have seen that this season, last season, but maybe it comes more in the future.”",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo didn't play for Al Nassr on Monday(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo's stint in the Saudi Pro League looks to be drawing to a close, and if the bookmakers are to be believed, his next move has already been mapped out. The Manchester United icon is rumoured to be departing Al-Nassr, with whispers even suggesting the Portuguese superstar has gone on strike.",
      "The drama is thought to be linked to former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema's switch from Al-Ittihad to Al-Hilal, with Ronaldo reportedly furious at Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), according to sources. The 40 year old is said to be unhappy with how PIF - which holds stakes in both Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal - facilitated such a transfer, and was notably absent from his side's victory over Al-Riyadh yesterday.",
      "Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes commented: \"It seems the end of the road is nearing for Ronaldo's Saudi adventure. The betting suggests a switch to the MLS is on the cards, but we are seeing interesting money on the Portuguese icon hanging up his boots.\"",
      "Other options include a move from Al-Nassr to another league rival at 7/4, but the odds suggest a slim chance of Ronaldo retiring at 3/1. However, with just over 50 goals left to reach 1000 career goals, it seems unlikely that CR7 will bid farewell to the game anytime soon.",

      "The defender had signed a one-year contract, with an option for a second, but that has now been terminated. Williams was included in just six matchday squads and struggled with fitness before Hull agreed to end his stay to facilitate an easier exit, according to Hull Live.",
      "The club stated: \"Hull City can confirm that full-back Brandon Williams has left the club by mutual agreement.",
      "\"The 25-year-old's only first-team appearance after joining the Tigers last August came as a substitute in the Sky Bet Championship home defeat to Blackburn Rovers later that month.",

      "The former United academy graduate made 51 appearances for the club, with all bar one coming under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's management. Back in 2019, the Norwegian boss hailed Williams as being 'as brave as a lion' after an impressive man-of-the-match display against Partizan Belgrade.",
      "\"Brandon has an absolutely great attitude,\" he added. \"The boy is going to be a top, top player.\"",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a fan of Brandon Williams(Image: 2019 Manchester United FC)",
      "\"He's never let us down,\" Solskjaer remarked at another press conference. \"He's a top young kid, he's got great attitude and confidence.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson also singled him out for praise the same year following his first-team breakthrough.",

      "The defender was determined to revive his career after joining Hull, but must now reassess his options. Williams stressed he was prepared to make amends for past errors when he penned his deal with the Championship outfit.",
      "He said: \"It was just a learning process. Things did happen, but like I said, I've learned from them now. I'm growing up now, I'm not a young player no more.",
      "Williams, 25, is now a free agent(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",

There are a lot of people in the world who would wish that for their child or something like that. It was upsetting that I've let a lot of people down; it's for me to get things right now.",
      "\"Like, I've always said as well, I don't want any sympathy from anyone. It was my actions; I took responsibility for them. I've apologised, and all I can do now is just focus on my football and get things right on the pitch, and I'm sure that people will appreciate that.\"",

      "Gabriel has 14 goals in 19 games for the Under-18s in the league this campaign and has taken part in a handful of first-team training sessions already. Ruben Amorim previously called on the teenager before he was sacked.",
      "According to The Sun, Gabriel was included in United's first-team training session this week after impressing Carrick. The report states that senior academy players were unavailable due to them playing on Monday night against West Brom - which the Under-21s won 5-1.",
      "United players had Monday off before Tuesday was used as a recovery day for the players who started the 3-2 win over Fulham. Gabriel cannot play in the Premier League as he is 15, meaning his professional debut will have to wait until the start of next season.",

      "\"He works hard. First thing I'd say is he loves football. He loves training, he loves playing, he loves having the ball, he loves expressing himself. He makes fantastic decisions.",
      "\"He's got an enthusiasm for the game that's just amazing. 15-year-old, a bright future ahead of him. I'm super excited by his talent, but the most important thing is that he keeps developing, and he's in the U18s team, and he's doing fantastically well, but he's still got lots to learn.",

      "\"But I couldn't speak highly enough of JJ. He's got an amazing family and amazing support around him and he's somebody we're delighted to have at the club.",
      "\"And we just hope he keeps improving, learning every day and just keep being the boy that he is really and enjoying love and playing football and going and expressing themselves and scoring lots of goals so the Manchester United under 18s win every game. And then I'll be a happy man.\"",

      "Manchester United have been presented with an intriguing transfer opportunity(Image: Getty Images)",
      "A huge and unexpected transfer opportunity has emerged for Manchester United following a dramatic end to the January transfer window. Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta watched his deadline day switch to AC Milan fall apart at the final hurdle after he failed a medical, reportedly because of a knee problem he'd been nursing.",
      "Consequently, Mateta had no option but to return to Selhurst Park - although his position there has since grown increasingly uncertain. Palace had already secured a replacement, finalising a £48million move for Wolves attacker Jorgen Strand Larsen late on Monday, leaving Mateta's long-term role at the club in doubt.",
      "This dramatic twist could create an opening for United, who have long been linked with the 28-year-old. With Palace now well supplied in forward areas, a potential summer switch to Old Trafford could suddenly become realistic - particularly in light of United's recent penchant for Premier League-proven players - including Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both of whom have made promising starts since joining the club in Manchester last year.",
      "Mateta's deal in south London is set to expire in 2027 and, with talks over a new contract seemingly stalling, the Red Devils could look to secure his services at a cut price, especially if Palace are keen to avoid losing him on a free in just 17 months.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Even so, breaking into United's starting line-up would be far from straightforward. The club splashed over £200m on attacking reinforcements last summer, including the arrival of Benjamin Sesko as their new marquee No. 9.",
      "The Slovenia international has largely struggled to justify his £73m fee, but three goals across his last three outings suggest he may finally be hitting his stride. Should that upturn continue, Mateta could find opportunities limited - similar to the situation faced by Joshua Zirkzee, United's current second-choice centre-forward, over the past couple of seasons.",
      "Mateta was notably absent from Palace's 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest on Sunday, with head coach Oliver Glasner revealing the striker was \"not at his best\" amid the uncertainty surrounding his future. It marked just the second Premier League fixture he has missed for the club since November 2023.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta is stuck between a rock and a hard place after his move to AC Milan fell through(Image: PA)",
      "Not only is Mateta Palace’s leading scorer this term, having netted 10 times in 34 appearances, he has also topped their scoring charts in each of the last three seasons. That leaves Glasner facing a tough decision to make over who should spearhead the attack for the rest of the season - a decision United will undoubtedly be monitoring with interest.",
      "After already pouring significant resources into strengthening their defence last season and revamping their forward line this year, United are widely expected to shift their focus toward midfield upgrades in the upcoming window.",
      "Mateta's Crystal Palace team-mate Adam Wharton is one of several midfielders linked with a summer move to Old Trafford, alongside Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "This area is likely to command the bulk of United's transfer attention, but should the chance arise to secure a proven Premier League striker at a knock-down price, they may find it difficult to resist.",

      "Another Premier League star could be poised to take after Scott McTominay by ditching his international allegiances(Image: NurPhoto, NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United star Scott McTominay could provide the blueprint for Harvey Barnes to follow him to Scotland. McTominay made his decision after receiving some wise counsel from Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho, who both advised him to snub England.",
      "The Telegraph revealed Scotland boss Steve Clarke and the Scottish FA are working hard to tempt Barnes north of the border. The Newcastle winger is eligible to represent Scotland through his grandparents and is free to change his international allegiance, having earned just one Three Lions cap back in October 2020.",
      "It's believed Scotland are keen to have Barnes on board ahead of the World Cup 2026 later this summer. And if McTominay serves as any indication of how things might pan out at Hampden Park, the switch could prove worthwhile for his career.",
      "Barnes, 28, has netted 12 goals in 36 outings across all competitions this season but still remains ignored by Thomas Tuchel. McTominay required far less persuasion, considering he was just 21 when he made his international bow, though the dilemma was comparable, as it too involved turning his back on his country of birth.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Speaking to The National in 2018, McTominay's grandfather, Frank, lauded [then-Scotland manager] Alex McLeish, Mourinho and United legend Ferguson for the way they guided his grandson through the predicament. And the latter's contribution proved especially crucial after Ferguson had been involved in the player's youth progression at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Alex McLeish handled the situation quite well,\" he said. \"It's been rumbling on for two or three months now in the papers. But he didn't go shouting and bawling. He just said that he would speak to Scott, and he did. He conducted himself quite well.",
      "\"But Sir Alex Ferguson was keen for Scott to play for Scotland as well. He was up front about it. I know that for a fact. I can say that without fear of getting contradicted. That has been kept under wraps. He and Jose Mourinho were both quite keen on it over the last month or two.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson has been very good with Scott over the years. He gave him his first contract with Manchester United when he was 16, before he retired, and then made sure it was extended when he was 18. He seems to get on well with him. I have seen them talking.\"",
      "Harvey Barnes is reportedly open to adopting Scotland as his new national team after being shunned by England(Image: Richard Lee/Shutterstock)",
      "Scottish supporters will also owe a debt of gratitude to Mourinho, who was outspoken in his view that McTominay should play for Scotland if England weren't interested. 'The Special One', who handed McTominay his United debut, completed some of his coaching qualifications in Largs, near Glasgow, and was eager to see Scotland secure the talent.",
      "Speaking to MUTV in early 2018, he made a phone gesture with his hand as he said: \"Because it looks like England is missing him, if I was Alex McLeish, the first thing I would do would be to come to me.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson recommended McTominay represent Scotland instead of his birth country(Image: Reach Plc)",
      "\"I think Scott deserves more than what he is getting,\" the Portuguese manager said after a 2-0 victory that secured his side's place in the quarter-finals. Maybe it's because he's this kind of kid profile: a normal haircut, no tattoos, no big cars, no big watches, humble kid, arrive in the club when he was nine or 10.\"",
      "One could suggest Barnes is in a comparable situation, undervalued and with limited prospects for success if he continues waiting for England. Scotland are reportedly seeking a decision from the winger before the March international break, at which point he and McTominay could feature in the same squad charting a course for North America later this year.",

      "Antoine Semenyo was the most expensive signing of the window(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "And there we have it. Thirty three days and £404.1million later, the January transfer window is closed.",
      "All 20 Premier League teams did business, some much more than others. Manchester City spent the most by signing Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo for a combined £94m - edging out Crystal Palace by £11m - while only Manchester United and Newcastle failed to make a single signing.",
      "We weren't short of sagas, though, whether it was the speculation over Mo Salah's future or Kobbie Mainoo going from outcast to undroppable. As ever, there was deadline-day drama involving the likes of Dwight McNeil, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Sandro Tonali.",
      "The transfer window produced one big winner and one obvious loser. Manchester City did outstanding business by signing Marc Guehi in a deal worth up to £30m, and to get Antoine Semenyo for £64m was amazing.",
      "To sign a brilliant defender - England's best central defender right now - for a bargain fee and then to get a proven Premier League winger for that fee gives Pep Guardiola a huge boost. Two top players who could win them major trophies this season but are also in for the long haul, all for less than £100m is brilliant business.",
      "But the biggest loser has to be Crystal Palace. They lost their captain when they sold Guehi to City.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta then made it clear that he wanted to leave and would have gone to AC Milan but for medical checks which now throw up doubts about his availability. Yes, they brought in Jorgen Strand Larsen but the damage this month has done - with Oliver Glasner also announcing he is leaving in the summer - has been catastrophic.",
      "Who are your winners and losers from the transfer window? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "Manchester City won the race for Marc Guehi(Image: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)",
      "To be brutally honest, the January transfer window was so lacking in notable moves that there is a compelling case for it to be scrapped. But as the only club that did really serious business, you would have to say Manchester City had the best window in that they signed Marc Guehi, a true international-class defender.",
      "They also signed Antoine Semenyo but I'm not as convinced as most people seem to be that he will turn out to be a success at City. But Guehi can only be a good asset going forward, even if it might take him some time to get used to Pep Guardiola's way of thinking.",
      "Crystal Palace have had the worst window, by some distance. Not only have they lost Guehi, their main striker, Jean-Philippe Mateta, does not want to play for them but they have not been able to sell him because of a physical issue. And the striker they have signed, Jorgen Strand Larsen, is massively overpriced at an initial £43m and has not been able to get into the worst team in the Premier League.",
      "Crystal Palace paid £43million plus £5m in add-ons for Jorgen Strand Larsen(Image: @CPFC/X)",
      "It might not have helped them close the gap on leaders Arsenal, but Manchester City's show of financial strength in the last transfer window made them the big winners when it came to new signings. The arrivals of Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo add youth and huge talent to Pep Guardiola's squad.",
      "Guehi, in particular, will not cost more than £30m and must be one of the bargains of recent times. Guehi's move to Manchester made a huge contribution to former club Crystal Palace having a shocking month.",
      "Aside from the furore surrounding manager Oliver Glasner, to lose a your captain and most influential member of the team for peanuts is damning on the Palace business model. Throw in the fact Jean-Philippe Mateta made it clear he wanted to leave, and would have gone to AC Milan but for failing a medical, and Palace, who have also overspent on Jorgen Strand Larsen, will be glad to see the window slam shut.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta failed his medical with AC Milan on deadline day(Image: MB Media/Getty Images)",
      "It has been a strange window which ended with more questionable decisions than the usual excitement. Manchester City had the best month on paper with the signings of Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi - probably the two best Premier League players not already at a Champions League club.",
      "But Sunday's draw at Tottenham showed the pair have not solved all Pep Guardiola's problems. The biggest spenders of the window were Crystal Palace - the FA Cup holders splashed £83m after not investing enough in the summer - but have come out weaker.",
      "The result only increases the chances of Oliver Glasner leaving before the end of the season. Losing Marc Guehi was a huge blow - and they have not signed a new defender. Breaking their club record for the first time to sign Brennan Johnson seemed to set out the South London club's early intent in the window.",
      "Then still bringing in Jorgen Strand Larsen for £48m in a seller's market even though the Jean-Philippe Mateta deal to AC Milan had collapsed makes neither footballing or financial sense.",
      "Brennan Johnson cost Crystal Palace £35million(Image:  Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "I'm not sure winning a transfer window is a great flex, but there's always a club who does the best business. The irony is if you'd asked the majority who had won the summer transfer window it could almost certainly have been Liverpool.",
      "Their recruitment drive though has seen them go from champions to a team now in a battle to make the Champions League spots. Kind of underlining the fact you win nothing by winning a transfer window. But if any club has this January then it would be City, purely because they landed Semenyo and Guehi. The window was lacking in major deals but Pep Guardiola did add one of the league's best wingers and one of England's elite defenders. The irony of course being its taken them no closer to the title, they're probably as far off as they were when January kicked off. That said, the two signings are proper players and will certainly aid the team for years to come. So good business nevertheless.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo didn't play for Al Nassr on Monday(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo is used to getting what he wants.",
      "He persuaded Sir Alex Ferguson to sell him to Real Madrid. He engineered a lucrative move back to Manchester United when he'd had enough of being at Juventus, with Fergie sealing the deal, after ringing him to encourage the return of the 'prodigal son'.",
      "Ronaldo got United to terminate his contract when he decided he couldn't be part of a squad managed by Erik ten Hag. And he then got the mind-boggling contract he wanted in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr, which went on to make him football's first billionaire.",
      "Where has it all gone wrong for Ronaldo, eh? Well, in a break from the status quo, Ronaldo has not got something he wants.",
      "And the end result is for him to throw his toys out of the pram. He has gone on strike. He refused to play in Al-Nassr's game at Al-Riyadh on Monday night, because he's furious with his club's lack of spending on transfers.",
      "What tipped him over the edge was seeing Karim Benzema join Al-Hilal from Al-Ittihad.",
      "All three clubs are owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). Ronaldo's beef is that Al-Hilal have been allowed to make such a significant signing, when leading the Pro-League by a single point over Ronaldo's Al-Nassr. It's been reported Ronaldo is seething Al-Hilal have been allowed to spend £180m more than his club since the start of 2022.",
      "Ronaldo has still to win a league title in Saudi since arriving there. So in normal circumstances, he might have a point.",
      "But considering Al-Nassr are spending an astonishing £488,000-a-day on having Ronaldo in the team, these are not normal circumstances. The Portuguese's lack of self-awareness is almost as staggering as his wage packet.",

      "Raheem Sterling is one of many high-profile free agents(Image: Getty)",
      "The January transfer window is now closed for all Premier League and EFL sides. But a host of quality free agents remain without a club after the deadline.",
      "A relatively quiet window is now in the rear-view mirror after deadline day, with the Premier League spending a combined total of just over £400million. Few big names made moves last month, the most notable transfer arguably being Antoine Semenyo's £65m switch from Bournemouth to Manchester City.",
      "Deadline day itself was similarly tepid, with the biggest move of the day financially being Jorgen Strand Larsen's transfer from Wolves to Crystal Palace for a club-record £48m. Liverpool also secured Rennes starlet Jeremy Jacquet for £60m in principle, though that move will take place in the summer.",
      "A few days before the deadline, Raheem Sterling and Chelsea agreed on a deal that terminated his contract by mutual consent. The former Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal winger is now without a club.",
      "It will likely not be long before the four-time Premier League winner makes his return and the 31-year-old presents a smart proposition for any team as a homegrown talent who is no longer bound by extortionate wages. Premier League clubs do have to register their squad for the remainder of the season by February 5, however.",
      "Sterling left Chelsea last month(Image: Getty)",
      "Former Chelsea and West Ham defender Kurt Zouma only joined Romanian side CFR Cluj last September. But in January, his contract was terminated and he is now a free agent.",
      "At 31, he could still provide decent defensive cover at the highest level and it was only three years ago that he was named captain by The Hammers before easing out of first-team contention.",
      "Ex-England man Jesse Lingard has been out of the spotlight after a dismal spell at Nottingham Forest. He played out nearly two years in South Korea for FC Seoul having joined in 2024, but left emotionally last December for a new challenge.",
      "Throughout the transfer window, rumours swirled about a return to the Premier League for the 33-year-old. But the former Manchester United and West Ham star remains on the market.",
      "Lingard left FC Seoul last year(Image: Getty)",
      "Liverpool academy star Ryan Kent made a name for himself at Rangers after never quite cutting it at Anfield. But the 29-year-old winger is now without a club.",
      "He last played for Seattle Sounders in the MLS after a short spell with Fenerbahce in Turkey. The speedy wide player still has a point to prove in his career and was linked with a return to Scotland throughout the window.",
      "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been without a club since August 2025 when he left Besiktas but has been keeping himself busy. The former Arsenal man had been training with the Gunners to maintain match fitness and some reports even linked him with an unlikely return.",
      "But more concrete reports brought Celtic into the picture, with suggestions on deadline day being that the Scottish side could look to recruit the 32-year-old. There is still time though for other clubs to play their hands.",
      "Oxlade-Chamberlain has been training with Arsenal(Image: Getty)",
      "A star who is on the hunt for playing time ahead of crunch international fixtures is Aaron Ramsey. The Arsenal hero last played for Mexican side Pumas, where he only lasted a few months due to fitness issues and a personal crisis.",
      "Wales have a World Cup play-off semi-final coming up and Ramsey could hope to make Craig Bellamy's squad for it. He is still on the market at 35 and his last stint in the UK saw him return to Cardiff City and even serve as interim manager for a brief period.",
      "Everton pulled off an almighty coup when James Rodriguez arrived at Goodison Park in 2020 and the former Real Madrid and Bayern Munich man is currently unemployed. Since his last spell in England, Rodriguez has played in Qatar, Greece, Brazil, Spain and Mexico.",
      "At 34, his prime is behind him, but with a World Cup approaching the Colombian is seeking minutes. It must be said reports suggest the international icon will likely sign with a North or South American club.",
      "Rodriguez once played for Everton(Image: Getty)",
      "An ex-Spurs star who has also become a free agent is defender Serge Aurier. The 33-year-old spent over four years in north London and also played for Nottingham Forest.",
      "He spent over a year without a club from February 2024 until the summer of 2025 after leaving Galatasaray and ended up signing for Persian Gulf Pro League side Persepolis. However, he left Tehran in January and if he is match fit, could provide an option in defence for several English clubs.",
      "The enigmatic Dele Alli is without a club after leaving Italian side Como 1907 last September. Since then, the former Tottenham star has been training individually ahead of an assumed return.",
      "At 29, he still has plenty of years of playing ahead of him if he steers away from an early retirement and like many other capable free agents, he is a homegrown talent. Reports from January linked him with a move to Spain, whilst rumours of Championship interest have also fluttered.",
      "The former Spurs star is without a club(Image: Getty)",
      "Liverpool's Champions League-winning cult hero Divock Origi is another name who clubs could snap up after becoming a free agent. Since leaving the Reds permanently in 2022 he has played for AC Milan and Nottingham Forest on loan.",
      "Origi's contract in Italy was mutually terminated back in December and he has since been unemployed. Although he may not be up to match fitness and his wage demands would likely be high, a player of the 30-year-old's quality could be worth a mid-season gamble.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Toni Kroos very nearly became a Man Utd player(Image: Getty)",
      "Toni Kroos came incredibly close to joining Manchester United, only for a change in management to completely scupper the deal. The legendary German, who enjoyed hugely successful periods with Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, is celebrated as one of the greatest midfield orchestrators of his era - and he very nearly ended up at Old Trafford.",
      "Back in 2014, Kroos had made the decision to leave Bayern and had agreed to move to United. He even sat down with then-boss David Moyes to talk through how he would fit into the side and was poised to sign the contract.",
      "However, circumstances shifted dramatically just weeks later. \"Before I signed with Real Madrid, I had already agreed terms with Manchester United. That would have been a move from Bayern to United,\" Kroos later revealed.",
      "\"David Moyes had come to see me and the contract had basically been done but then Moyes was fired and Louis van Gaal came in, which complicated matters. Louis wanted time to build his own project.",
      "\"I didn't hear anything from United for a while and started having doubts. Then the World Cup started and [Real Madrid manager] Carlo Ancelotti called. And that was it.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "What would have added an extra layer of intrigue to Kroos joining United in 2014 was the fact that he had also rejected Liverpool around the same time. Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez both personally contacted him, sending text messages in an attempt to lure him to Anfield - but their efforts proved unsuccessful.",
      "\"It wasn't a straight chat-up line but they offered to tell me more about the club and so on. The funny thing was, Suarez was about to leave to Barcelona anyway,\" Kroos told The Athletic.",
      "Once the Kroos transfer fell through, United redirected their attention towards Barcelona playmaker Cesc Fabregas, but the Spaniard opted to sign for Chelsea instead. Next on their shortlist was Thiago Alcantara, though Bayern refused to sanction his departure. Ultimately, United ended up bringing in Ander Herrera and Daley Blind as their principal midfield additions of the window.",
      "David Moyes' sacking in 2014 scuppered Man Utd's plans to sign Toni Kroos(Image: Getty)",
      "That summer, Kroos was instrumental in driving Germany to World Cup triumph in Brazil before embarking on a remarkable spell at the Bernabeu, where he also formed a legendary midfield duo alongside Luka Modric.",
      "Although it took a couple of campaigns before the major honours began to accumulate, once they started arriving, they did so in waves. With Kroos serving as the calm, metronomic core of the team, Los Blancos captured four La Liga titles, the Copa del Rey and five Champions League trophies - including a historic three-peat between 2016 and 2018 under Zinedine Zidane.",
      "For United supporters, Kroos represents one of the club's greatest missed opportunities - part of a lengthy catalogue of world-class players who narrowly slipped through their fingers, alongside figures such as Ronaldinho, Paul Gascoigne and Alan Shearer, among others.",
      "And when considering United's turbulent path over the last decade - and the extraordinary level of success Kroos ultimately achieved in Madrid - it stands as one of the most striking sliding-doors moments in the Old Trafford history.",

      "The winter transfer window is over, at least when it comes to Premier League clubs making new signings. There is still a chance for players to be offloaded to certain leagues such as the Dutch Eredivisie, Turkish Super Lig and Major League Soccer in the United States but the lion's share of the business has been done.",
      "It was a relatively quiet deadline day, too - not that the winter window has been hugely busy in recent years. Premier League clubs confirmed seven deals on Monday night, as well as one notable signing which will go through in the summer.",
      "All in all, just shy of £400million has been spent by Premier League sides in January. More than £70million of that total was spent on deadline day itself, when we also saw a handful of last-minute loan deals.",
      "This never looked like being an especially busy window for Arsenal but they'll be wary of how thin the squad was left by injuries around this time last year. This time, the only notable bits of business saw Oleksandr Zinchenko leave for Ajax after already having been out on loan and Ethan Nwaneri agree a temporary switch to Marseille.",
      "A deadline day swoop for Sandro Tonali never looked especially realistic, while Mikel Merino's foot injury is unfortunate, but the Gunners will hope they're well covered. Essentially it's as you were for the Gunners, which makes sense for a team whose summer recruits have helped them climb to the summit.",
      "January was huge for Villa last season, with Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio in particular almost helping drag Unai Emery's team to a top-four finish. This winter has been busy as well, albeit with movement in both directions.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Tammy Abraham and Douglas Luiz can have as big an impact as in previous Villa Park spells, while new winger Alysson may well be more for the future than for the present. Donyell Malen's goals will need replacing, while Leon Bailey's return counter-balances Evann Guessand's departure, while the big question mark concerns an apparent failure to resolve the Harvey Elliott conundrum.",
      "Even before the window started, the big one for Bournemouth appeared to be how they'd replace Antoine Semenyo rather than whether they'd be able to keep the Ghanaian. They appear to have chosen the method of trying to improve in a few areas, something which has served them well in the past.",
      "Rayan, Alex Toth and Christos Mandas will have varying roles to play in the coming months and the former in particular arrives with high hopes. Making up for Semenyo's exit won't be easy but Andoni Iraola's side have already earned some impressive results without him.",
      "Teenage forward Kaye Furo is the kind of pick-up we've become accustomed to from Brentford of late. A highly-rated youngster who the Bees will hope one day can attract comments about how they managed to beat more illustrious clubs to his signature.",
      "That's about it for Keith Andrews' side, though. A few exits, be they loans or permanent deals, point to a broad satisfaction with what they have,",
      "For those disappointed to see Matt O'Riley leave on loan towards the end of the summer, the good news is the Danish international is back. Fans of homecomings may be even more delighted to see Pascal Gross back on the south coast, with the German midfielder the only permanent arrival in the winter.",
      "Pascal Gross has returned to Brighton(Image: Offside via Getty Images)",
      "We've also seen some loan wheelings and dealings at the Amex Stadium, including a return for Igor and a handful of exits. After picking up just one win in their last 11 games, though, Fabian Hurzeler will hope recent form was a blip rather than anything more worrying.",
      "Even before Monday's defeat at Sunderland, Burnley's survival hopes were looking slim. A quiet window, headlined by a loan move for James Ward-Prowse, is unlikely to change that.",
      "Scott Parker's side may well pick up some more decent results in the second half of the season but the quiet window points to a recognition that the gap might be too big. They're winless since October but they may take some encouragement from recent draws with Liverpool, Manchester United and Spurs.",
      "It might feel longer ago than that to some but Chelsea's managerial change came during the winter window. Results have been impressive under Liam Rosenior but transfer business has been kept to a minumum.",
      "Facundo Buonanotte is now at Leeds after achieving little during his loan spell at Stamford Bridge. The positives have largely come in the form of offloading players with little hope of first-team minutes, with Raheem Sterling agreeing to a mutual termination of his contract and both Tyrique George and Axel Disasi leaving on loan on deadline day.",
      "Palace's window could have been a lot worse, but could have been a great deal better. The negatives are obvious, with Marc Guehi leaving for Manchester City and manager Oliver Glasner confirming he will leave in the summer.",
      "There was a moment where Glasner looked like he could leave sooner, though, while Jean-Philippe Mateta is still a Palace player - albeit one who looks set to miss an extended period through injury. The Eagles will have to hope Welsh forward Brennan Johnson, loanee Evann Guessand and new record signing Jorgen Strand Larsen can replace Mateta's goals between now and May.",
      "Everton's biggest blow in January wasn't transfer-related. Jack Grealish's promising start has been derailed by injury and the England international's season could well be over.",
      "Jack Harrison has joined Fiorentina on loan(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Loan addition Tyrique George will hopefully offer something for David Moyes' side, while Harrison Armstrong is back at Hill Dickinson Stadium after impressing on loan at Preston. Beyond that, there isn't a great deal to report besides the collapse of a last-minute exit for Dwight McNeil.",
      "One of the biggest tests for Fulham was coming through the Africa Cup of Nations with points on the board. Not only did they manage that, but they've now also made one of January's biggest signings.",
      "They'll hope Oscar Bobb's arrival can bring the best out of summer arrival Kevin, who scored a stunning goal at Old Trafford on Sunday. There was also an exit for out-of-favour Adama Traore, along with the boost of Harry Wilson sticking around - at least until the summer.",
      "The bulk of Leeds' important business was done in the summer and that has ensured they're in good shape to stay up. They're not over the line yet, though, and time will tell whether they'll be left ruing a quiet January.",
      "It's been a tale of two loans, with Facundo Buonanotte in and Jack Harrison out. That suggests continuity is the order of the day at Elland Road.",
      "It's hard to know how to rule on a signing that won't go through until the summer. However, Jeremy Jacquet looks like an important pick-up for Liverpool regardless of what happens with Ibrahima Konate's future..",
      "Away from the young French defender, it's mostly been about loans for the Reds. A change of scenery for Lewis Koumas has already borne fruit, with the Welsh forward scoring Hull's winner at Blackburn on his debut for the Championship high-flyers.",
      "Antoine Semenyo has made a fast start at Manchester City(Image: Getty Images)",
      "City will surely consider themselves to be the winners of the window. They have signed two players with proven Premier League quality and haven't needed to spend nearly as much as this time last year.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side have a net spend of less than £60m for the window, balancing the books by selling Oscar Bobb after signing both Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi. It might not be enough for the title, but it gives them a real shot.",
      "We know by now that Sir Jim Ratcliffe isn't a fan of spending big in January - or, in this instance, spending at all. There has been an important change at Old Trafford, though, with Ruben Amorim making way as manager.",
      "It's hard not to be results-oriented after Michael Carrick's fast start. However, it's also worth recognising the lack of business for a squad which doesn't quite have the right balance and which will lose in-form Casemiro in the summer.",
      "Newcastle have ended the window some seven points outside the top four and with no guarantee that fifth place will be good enough for Champions League football this time around. With that in mind, some fans will look at the lack of incomings and wonder why more wasn't done.",
      "There's an argument that Yoane Wissa will - as the old cliche goes - feel like a new signing after only making his debut in December. The positive comes from Sandro Tonali staying, though it's hard to determine whether there was ever any realistic chance of the Italian moving on.",
      "Forest's most important act of January was winning at fellow strugglers West Ham, but there's also something to be said for their transfer dealings. They'll hope Lorenzo Lucca can provide goals, while Luca Netz and Stefan Ortega also joined late in the window.",
      "Lorenzo Lucca at his Nottingham Forest unveiling(Image: Nottingham Forest FC via Getty I)",
      "They also appear to have cut their losses on Arnaud Kalimuendo, with Eintracht Frankfurt holding an option to sign the forward permanently if he succeeds on loan. They look to be in healthy enough shape to survive, though, so now it's all about making sure.",
      "Like fellow new boys Leeds, Sunderland went big in the summer and have been reaping the rewards. Regis Le Bris' side didn't feel they needed to do much in January (and early February), but they haven't been silent.",
      "Nilson Angulo has been the big new signing, costing around £17.5m from Anderlecht, while fringe players have been sold and loaned out. One of those exits was left until the last minute, with summer signing Simon Adingra loaned to Monaco after falling down the pecking order.",
      "Thomas Frank and Spurs knew they needed to spend in January. The question is whether the investment came in the right areas.",
      "Conor Gallagher has slotted straight in at Spurs(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Beating Arsenal to Scottish youngster James Wilson will no doubt please plenty, while Conor Gallagher has gone straight into the first team, and a decent fee was recouped for Brennan Johnson. Returns from injuries could prove more important than any signings, though, with Dominic Solanke thriving over the weekend and a real hope Dejan Kulusevski can find form when he eventually comes back from a serious knee injury.",
      "West Ham's £47m striker pairing of Taty Castellanos and Pablo Felipe have yet to score in the league, but their arrival appears to have helped with an uptick in form. Nuno's side secured back-to-back wins for just the second time all season in January, but still have work to do if they want to stay up.",
      "It was one in and one out at the back, with Axel Disasi arriving and Igor returning to Brighton. The big question concerns how badly they'll miss Lucas Paqueta, but getting £36.5m from the Brazilian league can't be sniffed at.",
      "It's difficult to judge a window for a team in Wolves' position, with relegation all but confirmed long before the turn of the year. However, Rob Edwards' side look to have set themselves up reasonably well for both now and next season.",
      "Bringing in £48m for Jorgen Strand Larsen has to be considered a good move given his return of just one league goal all season. Adam Armstrong arrives with calibre in the second tier - perhaps signed with a hope he can lead a promotion charge next term if there's no miracle between now and May - while Angel Gomes' arrival on loan looks intriguing at the very least.",

Theres definitely a pathway at United, it is known for bringing through academy players and this is a good stepping stone for myself.\"",

He has impressed in a number of positions including central defence, right-back and in central midfield in a United side have spent the majority of the season at the top of the Premier League 2 table.",

      "Manchester United could've had a much more productive transfer window(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United opted against strengthening their squad during the January transfer window following heavy spending last summer. The club have seen a considerable turnaround under Michael Carrick's leadership, securing victories in all three matches against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's dramatic late winner on Sunday clinched all three points and lifted the team back into fourth place in the Premier League standings. With only 14 fixtures remaining in the league campaign, the club's decision-makers will now hold off until the summer before naming a permanent boss and backing him with fresh signings.",
      "However, the situation might have looked vastly different had Carrick been granted control of transfers throughout January.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Marcus Rashford has been on loan at Barcelona since the start of the campaign and has rediscovered his best form in Spain. The England international has made a significant impact for his temporary club with 20 goal contributions, particularly in Europe.",
      "Barcelona currently possess a £26million option to make the forward's move permanent in the summer. Given how well the 28-year-old has settled, supporters anticipate this clause will be activated when the summer window opens.",
      "Rashford departed United on a temporary basis during Ruben Amorim's time at the helm, with tensions between the forward and his manager playing a significant part. At one stage, Amorim suggested he'd rather field his goalkeeping coach than a player not putting in full effort during training sessions.",
      "Soon afterwards, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan and is now playing his football in Spain. However, with Amorim no longer at the club and former team-mate Carrick potentially taking charge permanently, there's speculation the academy product could be persuaded to make a comeback to Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford could've come back to Manchester(Image: Angel Martinez/Getty Images)",
      "According to The Telegraph, if Carrick remains beyond the summer, he would be eager to bring Rashford back to Manchester. While it might have required some persuasion, reuniting with the club he's been part of since childhood under Carrick's management could have proved a significant advantage for United in the winter transfer window.",
      "United's midfielders have been delivering outstanding performances since Carrick took control. Skipper Bruno Fernandes and outgoing star Casemiro have contributed to four goals across three matches, with the Portuguese maestro reaching his 200th goal contribution against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo hasn't been particularly prolific in finding the net, but his cool head in the middle of the park has earned him considerable praise since his return to the squad.",
      "However, maintaining this level of performance is challenging, and Carrick may have been enticed to invest heavily in reinforcements during January.",
      "Adam Wharton could've become a United player(Image: George Wood/Getty Images)",
      "Adam Wharton emerged as a top target for United, with Liverpool, City and Newcastle also circling. Crystal Palace have slapped a hefty price tag on the 21-year-old, especially given his contract doesn't expire until 2029.",
      "Initial reports suggest a starting figure of around £65m, though this could balloon to over £80m given the fierce competition for the midfielder's signature. United are well aware of rival interest and may have considered lodging a substantial bid to frighten off other potential buyers.",
      "With Oliver Glasner departing in the summer and Palace favourite Marc Guehi already making the switch to City, the club's decision-makers might have tested the Eagles' determination with an £80m offer that would have put them ahead of the pack.",
      "As noted earlier, Mainoo has become the heartbeat of Carrick's midfield. He's featured from the start in all three matches under the former United captain, a stark contrast to his minimal playing time under Amorim.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo may have left United if he hadn't begun starting for the club(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "However, the arrival of another midfielder could have thrown his future into serious question. Mainoo had already been drawing attention during the transfer window and was said to be considering a temporary switch to guarantee regular first-team football.",
      "The 2026 World Cup was also a key consideration for the 20-year-old's move as he battles to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel's England squad this summer. Had he remained as an infrequently used substitute under the former Middlesbrough boss, Mainoo would likely have pushed for a move away from United.",
      "With genuine interest from Napoli, Chelsea, and Barcelona earlier in the window, the prospect of United losing another academy graduate wasn't beyond the realms of possibility.",

      "United's priority during the transfer window was, of course, their managerial situation. After sacking Ruben Amorim on January 5, the club appointed Darren Fletcher on an interim basis.",
      "Fletcher took charge of two games before Michael Carrick was given the job until the end of the season. Carrick has started like a house on fire; winning his first three games against Manchester City, Arsenal and most recently, Fulham.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "On January 17, United announced that Sam Mather had signed for top-flight Turkish side Kayserispor. Mather, 21, had been at the club since the age of seven and won the FA Youth Cup in 2022.",
      "The forward also had loan spells with Rochdale and Tranmere Rovers, and has now joined Kayserispor on a permanent basis. Although United didn't earn a fee, they'll receive 20 per cent of any future sale.",
      "Next to leave was Joe Hugill. Also a member of United's Youth Cup-winning squad, the striker has signed for Scottish Premiership club Kilmarnock for an undisclosed fee.",
      "Hugill joined United from Sunderland in 2020. The 22-year-old had loan spells with Burton Albion, Wigan Athletic, Carlisle United and Barnet.",
      "Joe Hugill has left Manchester United to join Kilmarnock(Image: Mark Leech/Offside/Offside via Getty Images)",
      "Finally, Rhys Bennett was sold to Fleetwood Town for an undisclosed fee. Bennett, 22, spent the 2024-25 season on loan at Fleetwood and made 35 first-team appearances.",
      "Having joined United at under-10 level, the centre-back lifted the Youth Cup as captain. Bennett, whose dad tragically committed suicide last year, had also spent time on loan with Stockport County.",
      "As for loan deals, Harry Amass joined Norwich City for the rest of the season before suffering a 'serious' injury in training. Left-back Amass was previously on loan at fellow Championship outfit Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "Toby Collyer also changed clubs in the second tier. Following an injury, midfielder Collyer returned from his spell with West Bromwich Albion to join Hull City for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "Ethan Wheatley, meanwhile, joined Bradford City on a six-month loan. Wheatley, a striker, was previously on loan at Northampton Town, who also play in League One.",
      "Tyrell Malacia was blocked from signing for Besiktas on loan(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "And one minute before the deadline, it was confirmed that James Scanlon has joined Swindon Town on loan. Midfielder Scanlon will get his first taste of senior football in League Two.",
      "Later on Monday, Jacob Devaney departed. St Mirren have signed the midfielder, with Devaney also embarking on his first loan.",
      "There was almost a sixth loan in the form of Tyrell Malacia. The Dutch defender was about to board a plane to Turkey ahead of signing for Besiktas, but United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, stepped in to block his departure following injuries to fellow left-backs Patrick Dorgu and Amass.",
      "SOLD: Sam Mather (Kayserispor, free), Joe Hugill (Kilmarnock, undisclosed), Rhys Bennett (Fleetwood Town, undisclosed)",
      "LOANED: Harry Amass (Norwich City), Toby Collyer (Hull City), Ethan Wheatley (Bradford City), James Scanlon (Swindon)",

      "Replacing Casemiro will be Manchester United's biggest challenge this summer",
      "With one transfer window out of the way, all eyes now turn to the next one. It was a quiet January at Manchester United, but it is expected to be anything but a quiet summer.",
      "There are just over four months until the Premier League window opens, and United's priority is already clear. They went into January aware that midfield was a potential area of weakness, but only tried to sign a winger.",
      "That failed move for Antoine Semenyo in December was true to United's approach this month of only going for long-term targets. With Michael Carrick lifting the gloom, Kobbie Mainoo back in favour and key players returning from injury, there was no need to panic.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "With no European football this season, United are treading a tighter line on financial fair play controls, and their quiet January should help boost the coffers for the summer. If Carrick can secure Champions League football, then that will help as well.",
      "United spent more than £215million in the summer and a similar outlay could be expected in 2026. Midfield will be the main focus. Casemiro's departure will save more than £18million a season if United are back in the Champions League, but replacing him will be difficult.",
      "The 33-year-old has rolled back the years recently and is such an all-rounder that finding someone to do everything he can might be impossible. He is a world-class defensive midfielder with a stunning range of passing and an aerial threat in both boxes. Good luck to the player trying to inherit that position.",
      "United admire Elliott Anderson of Nottingham Forest, although they will face competition from Manchester City for the England international. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba of Brighton are also on the shortlist and it is likely they will make a move for one of them, but they will target two new midfielders as part of an overhaul in that area of the pitch.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Manuel Ugarte was the subject of interest from European clubs this winter, and although United wanted to keep the squad together to enhance their Champions League push, the Uruguayan is likely to leave in the summer, so he will need to be replaced.",
      "Attacking reinforcements could also be on the agenda. Roma wanted to sign Joshua Zirkzee on loan in January and although he has also stayed at the club, an exit in the summer could be on the cards. There is also a shortage of left-wingers, with Jadon Sancho set to leave when his contract expires, and Marcus Rashford also set to depart.",
      "Semenyo would have filled that position and Carrick's return to a 4-2-3-1 shape has created a vacancy for a left-winger. Patrick Dorgu has impressed in that role and Matheus Cunha played there against Fulham, but it's a position United could return to.",
      "There could also be changes at the back. A centre-back will be targeted if Harry Maguire leaves when his contract expires and his experience and leadership would create a void that needs filling.",
      "Senne Lammens has nailed down the No. 1 spot in goal, but with Altay Bayindir likely to pursue a move to play first-team football, a backup goalkeeper might be required as well.",
      "Plans for that window will be led by director of football Jason Wilcox, with Carrick having some input on ideas even though his contract only currently runs until the end of the season. The 44-year-old knows what it takes to play in midfield for United, and getting those deals are going to be absolutely key in what is going to be a big window.",

      "Lammens is enjoying an underrated first season.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "Senne Lammens was pictured alongside his partner leaving The Ivy in Spinningfields after beating Fulham. The understated Lammens almost looked embarrassed to be photographed by the paparazzi.",
      "Lammens is having an underrated debut season in Manchester. The goalkeeper has brought calm and stability, transmitting confidence when his predecessors had made Old Trafford uneasy.",
      "The 23-year-old made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland in October, and fans celebrated Lammens claiming a cross into the box like a goal. That reaction was a statement from matchgoers, who had become exhausted watching Andre Onana, and then Altay Bayindir.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The bar was low for Lammens to make a strong impression, but the ease with which he's adapted to the Premier League, having come from the Belgian top-flight, has been impressive. There have been times when Lammens should have done better. Danny Welbeck's free-kick for Brighton in October and Kieran Dewsbury's goal for Everton in November were both saveable, but that is nitpicking. There have been no major errors, no blunders that have cost United a game.",
      "Lammens consistently delivers 7/10 performances, with the odd excellent display chucked in for good measure. The Belgian's demeanour has helped him remain unfazed in one of the most scrutinised No.1 roles in the world. He was happy to speak in the mixed zone after the win over Liverpool at Anfield, and he spoke again after the victory at Arsenal. On both occasions, he took the initiative to speak to reporters.",
      "Some players ignore requests for a chat as they leave grounds on matchdays, which is their prerogative, but Lammens has thought 'why not' after two big wins. He seems like a good egg, someone impossible not to get along with.",
      "\"I try to keep my best friends and family close. The rest is a bit like outside noise. It's all praise, I know, and I'm realistic, if it does not go so well, it will be all bad commentary,\" he reflected at Anfield.",
      "The ability to remain level-headed after wins and defeats is a common trait shared by the most successful professionals. Lammens celebrated the Liverpool win by spending the evening with a close friend.",
      "It's been a breath of fresh air to have a reliable goalkeeper between the sticks. Lammens was a data-driven signing, and the data boffins in Michael Sansoni's department will be delighted with his start at United.",
      "Gyoekeres takes a shot against Lammens.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "But United have another goalkeeper on the books who is ready to challenge Lammens. Radek Vitek is enjoying a wonderful season on loan in the Championship, where United send young players who they believe have potential to feature for the first-team.",
      "Vitek is thriving with Bristol City and he made a save of the season contender against Ipswich Town last month, instinctively stretching a hand to tip the ball over the crossbar when he was on the ground.",
      "Vitek's highlights reel will be worth a watch at the end of the campaign. He's produced a handful of top saves, but he's not just stopping shots for the cameras - he's delivering consistently.",
      "United are delighted with how Vitek's loan spell at Ashton Gate is unfolding. He has made 25 starts in the Championship - he missed five games due to a small knee injury - and looks destined for bigger things.",
      "In November, Vitek said: \"It would be a dream to play for Manchester United, but I will take it game by game, and I know there's a big challenge in front of me, but I want to improve every week.\"",
      "Vitek delivered a man-of-the-match performance in United's opening pre-season friendly against Rosenborg in 2024, but he didn't join last summer's tour of the United States because he was due to leave on loan.",
      "It would be a surprise if Vitek isn't assessed in pre-season this summer. Lammens has made a superb impact, but Vitek has earned the opportunity to be considered to challenge for the No.1 role.",
      "Vitek is ready for another step up.(Image: 2025 CameraSport)",
      "How United's goalkeeper situation will develop remains to be seen. Vitek would be a superb second choice and great competition for Lammens, but would a talented 22-year-old settle for a No.2 role? It seems unlikely. Vitek will be hungry to play every week after such a successful loan spell.",
      "He's had previous loan spells with Accrington Stanley and FC Blau-Weiß Linz, so it would be a shock for him to be happy to play in cup competitions for United, with a view to challenging Lammens.",
      "The Czech knows what it's like to fight for points each week and won't be short of interest from Europe in the summer. He will feel he can succeed elsewhere if he's seen a No.2 in Manchester.",
      "\"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them,\" Vitek said a few months ago.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day, but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Vitek's challenge for the No.1 role may be short-lived, but United are in a strong position with their goalkeeper choice this summer. That couldn't be said at the start of last summer with Onana and Bayindir.",

      "United had a quiet transfer window.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“Never say never,\" Michael Carrick said when asked if Manchester United could complete any deals on transfer deadline day. January is usually a quiet month at Old Trafford - and not much has gone on again.",
      "United have not made a signing and there have been no departures from the first-team squad. The most exciting United-related transfer story, interest in Antoine Semenyo, was effectively put to bed before the window opened.",
      "The £62.5million needed to release Semenyo from his Bournemouth contract was bound to be met and Manchester City won the race for his signature. Semenyo ticked a lot of boxes at United and would have been a great addition, but the club did not react by turning to alternatives that weren't quite right.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The message from United sources after missing out on Semenyo was consistent: United were unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets were not expected to be available in the winter window. That's not what fans have wanted to hear, though.",
      "Semenyo has scored four goals in five games for City. He is one of the most in-form forwards in the Premier League and would have provided a huge boost in the pursuit of Champions League football.",
      "Carrick has made a dream start to his interim role, winning three games on the bounce, a run that has seen United climb to fourth. The Reds are just 12 points adrift of Arsenal, despite the possibility of being dragged into the bottom half being touted in the final weeks of Ruben Amorim's tenure.",
      "Amorim's sacking did not change much regarding transfers in the window. United had a plan and they have stuck by it. They have not acted because long-term targets were not available.",
      "Semenyo was on the losing side at Old Trafford two weeks ago.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "Carrick revealed at a press conference that he would be consulted on summer plans, though. When asked whether his opinion would be sought on a new midfield signing to replace Casemiro, Carrick said: \"I'm certainly in this position to do that. And as I said, I think, making decisions for the club moving forward, whatever that may be, I'm fully committed to that.",
      "\"Naturally, as a midfielder, then there's a big tendency towards that anyway, but taking that away from it and now being where I am in the position I am, certainly would be part of those conversations and moving forward because it's important when we get the next steps right in terms of moving forward as a team and there's a squad and putting the right things in place. So yeah, I'll be part of that in the right way.\"",
      "Casemiro announcing that he would leave at the end of the season has been one of the biggest headlines. The Brazilian wanted to avoid speculation about his future during the remainder of the season, and his representatives can engage with potential suitors now that confirmation is out.",
      "The announcement was classy, befitting of a player who has enjoyed a magnificent career, and Casemiro will try to bow out by steering the club back into the Champions League.",
      "United splashed £215million in the summer window and were not in a position to sign a Casemiro replacement, who could cost in the region of £100million, in the winter window.",
      "Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are all admired by United, but they will not be prised away cheaply from their respective clubs. It will be fascinating to see how the summer window unfolds.",
      "Although Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee were marked down for possible loan exits, they will continue to contribute at United for the remainder of the season. Mainoo's situation has improved since Carrick's appointment. The youngster was hopeful of leaving on loan before Amorim was sacked.",
      "Roma were interested in signing Zirkzee, but United did not seriously entertain their enquiry. \"United said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago, and they have not changed their minds,\" said Roma's football director.",
      "Tyrell Malacia was ready to travel to Turkey on deadline day, but the plug was pulled on his move to the Super Lig by Jason Wilcox, who decided Malacia was needed at United after Patrick Dorgu's injury.",
      "Wilcox told Malacia on Monday morning that he would be needed as part of the first-team squad for the rest of the season. The Dutchman will be frustrated at missing out on a move away again.",
      "Casemiro scored against Fulham on Sunday.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "The MEN were the first to report Rhys Bennett's move to Fleetwood Town, while Joe Hugill is the only other academy export to have left the club on a permanent transfer in the window.",
      "United have banked nominal fees for Mather, Bennett and Hugill, but the club have started to insist on inserting sell-on clauses to benefit from future success. The challenge for Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is to start obtaining higher transfer fees for youngsters when they leave.",
      "Torpey has overseen the club's loan deals since Jonny Evans stepped back from his role as head of loans and pathways in December. Sources with knowledge of the situation indicated the pace of the role was too slow for Evans.",
      "There were loan departures confirmed on deadline day. Ethan Wheatley's move to Bradford City was formally announced, while James Scanlon and Jacob Devaney joined Swindon Town and St. Mirren respectively for their first taste of senior football.",
      "There is no rush to confirm Sekou Kone's move to Lausanne-Sport because the Swiss transfer window shuts on February 15 - the expectation is that Kone will stay with Lausanne-Sport for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Academy transfer activity was as exciting as it got in the final hours of the window.",

      "\"He's a young lad with a massive sort of hype, you know there's a lot of noise around him and deservedly so because he's a real talented kid. He works hard. First thing I'd say is he loves football. He loves training, he loves playing, he loves having the ball, he loves expressing himself.",
      "\"He makes fantastic decisions. He's just got an enthusiasm for the game that's just amazing. 15-year-old, a bright future ahead of him. I'm super excited by his talent, but the most important thing is that he keeps developing, and he's in the U18 team, and he's doing fantastically well, but he's still got lots to learn.",
      "\"The world is his oyster and he just needs to go on his journey and his time will come in due course. But for just now, it's [first-team debut] a little bit early I think, and I think a lot of people would agree with me.\"",
      "Gabriel became the youngest player to represent United in the FA Youth Cup in December. He started against Peterborough and scored the match-winner in a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "He started aged 15 years, two months and three days, breaking the record previously held by United academy graduate Omari Forson (15 years and four months). The online records tracking United's Youth Cup appearance makers began from the 2006/2007 season.",

      "Maguire embraces Casemiro.(Image: 2026 Visionhaus)",
      "The winter window has closed, so what next? Manchester United already had an eye on the summer, but they have an obvious decision to make before the end of the campaign.",
      "Harry Maguire is out of contract in June and deserves a new deal. Negotiations have been ongoing, and United should make an effort to sort out Maguire's future now that the window has passed.",
      "Maguire has played a crucial role in Michael Carrick's success since his appointment as interim head coach, starting in each of the wins against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham. The 32-year-old was particularly impressive against City and Arsenal. Mikel Arteta's side are known for their threat from set-pieces, and Maguire's aerial ability was key to securing victory at the Emirates.",
      "Maguire's quality in the air alone is almost enough to warrant a new deal. There has been a shift in the Premier League over the last few seasons, with an already physical league becoming even more so, and Maguire's ability to deal with balls in the air makes him a valuable option.",
      "The England international's partnership with Lisandro Martinez has also been important. In the Manchester derby, Maguire and Martinez started together in a back four for the first time since September 2024, but you wouldn't have known. They played as if they had been starting games together regularly.",
      "Asked about the timing of Maguire's resurgence in a World Cup year, Carrick said: \"Yeah, I haven't given the World Cup much thought yet to be honest. We have got some really good centre-backs at the club and obviously a couple of young ones on the bench that have got big, big futures at this club hopefully.",
      "Maguire and Martinez have been superb.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "\"We just felt at the time we come in, the experience was important. The other two (Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven) will have a lot of games and a lot of performances in their career here, because they have got bright futures. Harry has come in after not playing a lot of football and done ever so well.",
      "\"He is what he is. A big presence, been there, seen there, done it as well. I think that helps within the group when we have got so many young players who are learning.",
      "\"I think he has had a big influence with that, and just that composure to understand the moments and not be fazed by it. He has been a big presence with him and Licha. At the back, they have given us the foundation to build on.\"",
      "Heaven performed well in the final weeks of Ruben Amorim's tenure, but Maguire has made a noticeable difference since being brought back into the team by Carrick. Maguire will celebrate his 33rd birthday next month and a two-year contract would be a logical compromise. United would have to invest millions in the transfer market to find a replacement of similar quality. And what Maguire contributes goes beyond the pitch, he is a leader and an example.",
      "Some believe Maguire has become a better leader at Carrington since he was stripped of the armband. He showed remarkable mental resilience to emerge from a difficult period in his career.",
      "Maguire's recent performances will certainly not damage his bargaining power in negotiations, and there is an argument that he is still United's best defender.",
      "The only negative about Maguire's last two years in Manchester has been a handful of muscle injuries. Still, the pros of offering him a new contract heavily outweigh the cons.",
      "Maguire's form deserves a recall to the England squad in the March international break. He has been a stalwart for England, and Thomas Tuchel would regret not taking him to the World Cup in the summer.",
      "United chiefs would also regret not keeping Maguire beyond this season.",

      "Marcus Rashford wants to stay at Barcelona beyond his loan spell from Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Marcus Rashford has no intentions of returning to Manchester United after his loan spell at Barcelona, it is reported. The 28-year-old joined the Catalan club in the summer after falling out of favour at Old Trafford.",
      "Hansi Flick's men signed Rashford on a season-long loan, with a view to making the move permanent with a €30million (£26m) fee agreed. The England international has contributed to 22 goals in 32 games, with his displays impressing his new team.",
      "It had previously been claimed that Barcelona were unwilling to pay the agreed fee to sign Rashford, instead offering United slightly less or another loan proposal with an obligation to buy at the end of the 2026/27 season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "A recent report from Spanish newspaper Marca seemed to quash those rumours, stating that the club is now willing to activate the clause and sign him permanently for £26m. Fortunately for all parties, Rashford is also keen on the move.",
      "According to The Mirror, the forward has no desire to return to Old Trafford at the end of the season. The report states that Rashford wants his long-term future resolved and in order before England head to North America for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The Three Lions' first fixture in the tournament is on June 17 against Croatia, two weeks after Barcelona's current season ends. Despite suggestions that Michael Carrick would attempt to persuade him to return to United if he got the job permanently, Rashford's heart is set on Spain.",
      "Marcus Rashford has settled into life at Barcelona this season on loan from Man United(Image: UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Even if his stay at Nou Camp falls through, Rashford is understood to prefer a move to another club, rather than resuming his career at United. Should all things fall into place, United's first summer transfer should be Rashford.",
      "His permanent exit is set to be one of many deals completed at the end of the season. United have already confirmed that Casemiro will depart when his contract expires, and there is interest in a number of current stars.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo were all linked with January exits, though Ruben Amorim's exit significantly strengthened the latter's position in the United team. The England midfielder has played all three of Carrick's games since his return to the club and calls for him to be named in the Three Lions squad have gathered pace.",
      "United are currently battling for a place in the Champions League, and a top-five finish would increase the budget available in the summer. Over £200m was spent in bolstering the squad last summer, despite the club having no European football to contend with.",
      "Rashford's exit and possible departures for Ugarte and Zirkzee will only add more wriggle room for movement in the window. United's recruitment team are expected to prioritise a central midfielder, a centre-forward, and a left winger ahead of the 2026/27 season.",

      "Michael Carrick has had to settle for what he has got following the January transfer window(Image: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Offside via Getty Images)",
      "It may have been easy to say Ruben Amorim's exit and Michael Carrick's appointment as interim head coach blocked Manchester United delving into the January transfer window. However, the plan was already set out in stone for the Reds to be quiet in the market, even if Amorim had stayed.",
      "United were committed to only signing players if they fit the long-term needs of the club. That is why the £65m needed to sign Antoine Semenyo was available for a brief period before being put back into the safe when Manchester City won the race for the former AFC Bournemouth man.",
      "With Semenyo out of the picture, United chose to settle for what they have got in the first-team. Instead, the Reds' business was solely focused on completing loan deals for youngsters. Harry Amass, Toby Collyer and Ethan Wheatley were the notable academy players moved out to the EFL while Joe Hugill exited permanently for Kilmarnock.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN CITY FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester City Facebook page",
      "So with this in mind, MEN Sport has asked its United writers to provide their verdict on the January transfer window.",
      "How do you rate a window in which United made no signings? It's pretty difficult, but United were happy not to be active because their long-term targets were not available.",
      "The most exciting United-related story was interest in Semenyo, which was put to bed before the window opened, with City winning the race for his signature from Bournemouth. United were prepared to deviate from their plan because Semenyo ticked a lot of boxes. Fans were ultimately disappointed not to see a new signing, but the club's patience reflects the revised strategy.",
      "It wasn't an exciting transfer window by any means, however, it's better to keep your powder dry than to spend on a signing who may not be quite right. United will focus their resources on the summer transfer window and invest heavily to strengthen the midfield, which is set to be overhauled.",
      "United are well placed to secure Champions League football thanks to Carrick's impact in three matches. The 44-year-old has an almost fully fit squad, which meant it was not necessary to dive into the market.",
      "In terms of outgoings, United agreed a few permanent sales, arranging moves for Sam Mather, Rhys Bennett and Jordan Hugill to kick on in their professional careers, and organised several decent-looking loans.",
      "United and City might be neighbours and separated by a few miles. But when it comes to their respective business in the January transfer window, the two clubs might as well have been on different planets.",
      "Interim boss Carrick saw the club's chequebook remain under lock and key. Carrick won't be sorry to see the January window close, and might have felt like throwing himself out of it before it did, given the fact he wasn't allowed to strengthen a squad now pushing hard for Champions League qualification.",
      "There were numerous outgoings though, involving youth players who were either sold or sent on loan. While Tyrell Malacia was about to board a flight to Turkey to go and join Besiktas, but the move was pulled at the last minute and he remains with United.",
      "United have limited funds to spend, but whoever becomes permanent manager in the summer, will be hoping this changes. Selling Marcus Rashford and getting Jadon Sancho off the wage bill will help.",
      "Carrick is getting a tune out of this current United squad but that does not necessarily mean he would have chosen not to purchase anyone, given the option. The Reds were happy to stick to the long-term plan and not sign anyone this January and that is exactly what played out.",
      "If United were to raid their bank account, they would have been best signing a striker to add depth to the attack. Joshua Zirkzee staying at Old Trafford means that is less of a priority but had Semenyo chosen Old Trafford, he would have provided Carrick with a brilliant option for the remainder of the campaign and beyond.",
      "United's loans for their young players do not suggest those academy stars are being prepared for an immediate return to the senior team when they come back. However, Amad is proof of a good loan doing wonders for a United player's career.",
      "As things stand, Carrick is doing well with what he has got. But, whether he is appointed permanently or it is someone else, there will be pressure on Ineos to get the midfield overhaul right.",

      "The transfer window has slammed shut with Manchester United unable to finalise any further deals, barring free agents. The Reds had a quiet month, failing to secure a single first-team player.",
      "However, speculation continues to swirl around Cole Palmer, with rumours over a potential move from Chelsea to Old Trafford. Perhaps the most notable first-team development was the cancellation of Tyrell Malacia's departure, who is now expected to fulfil his contract.",
      "On the departures side, United bid farewell to several players on loan. Toby Collyer, who spent the first half of the season at West Brom, moved to Hull City, while Harry Amass joined Norwich City following a successful loan stint at Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "Rhys Bennett returned to Fleetwood Town, and Ethan Wheatley, recalled from his Northampton Town loan last month, signed with Bradford City.",

      "United have held talks with Wolves over Mateus Mane, according to Sports Boom.",
      "Liverpool are also said to have done likewise, but both clubs were reportedly put off by a £45-50million asking price this winter. The 18-year-old forward has scored twice this season, both in back-to-back matches earlier this month.",

      "Simpson told the Metro:",
      "I think it would be very silly to let him go. We know what he's been through, the way he's come back and shown his resilience. He's had some big moments and big winners as well in recent times. We need him in the box, defending and attacking. I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get a new deal.",
      "I think he deserves a new deal for his performances. It's not just on the pitch, I know what he's like off the pitch. He's a leader. So for me it'd be silly to let Harry go. And I'm sure he wants to play every game, but when he's not, he still supports the lads. He'll be on the bench, and when he's needed, he'll come and perform. So hopefully they sort that contract out soon.",
      "United officials are focusing solely on rebuilding the team's midfield rather than also remaining open to signing another centre-forward, according to The i Paper.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's conduct around Carrington is said to have changed their stance, meaning their sights are firmly set on the middle of the pitch. More than one midfielder is reportedly likely.",
      "Danny Simpson believes Sandro Tonali could slot into the United midfield this summer.",
      "Simpson told the Metro:",
      "I think Tonali would work really well in that United midfield. I think he would complement Kobbie Mainoo really nicely, because he gets about the pitch so well.",
      "Obviously, he's been a top player for Newcastle. He's good on the ball, he's strong, he's physical, he'd be a brilliant player in there in many regards.",
      "Also, he's the type of player that I think could wear a Man Utd shirt. It's not easy, that, and I feel like he could wear it with the pressure and deal with it. He could definitely slot in there.",

      "Garnacho left United for Stamford Bridge in the summer in a deal worth around £40million. He has scored six goals for the Blues, assisting a further three, in 26 games after becoming United's fourth-biggest departure.",
      "The 21-year-old left United after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim. The relationship between the pair became irreversible at the end of the season when Garnacho questioned the Portuguese's call to bench him in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "After being placed in the 'bomb squad' by Amorim and eventually sold to Chelsea, Garnacho has shown glimpses of quality at times in London. And on Tuesday, he will hope to help overturn a 3-2 deficit at the Emirates Stadium against Arsenal.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking ahead of the game, Garnacho discussed the challenge of winning in north London and took aim at United after their 3-2 win over a week ago. \"Everyone knows how hard it is to play there,\" he said in the Chelsea programme notes.",
      "\"When we lost the first game, I saw a lot of people saying, 'Yeah, but no one won yet at the Emirates'. But now I think the view is a little bit different. If, for example, Manchester United can beat them there, we can do it perfectly.\"",
      "Garnacho's comments come after Gary Neville criticised the winger's display in their win over West Ham over the weekend. Chelsea found themselves 2-0 down at half-time to the Hammers, and Garnacho was one of three players replaced at half-time before they overturned the deficit to win.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho left United for Chelsea in the summer(Image: Mike Hewitt, Getty Images)",
      "\"In the first half, I have to say that West Ham were absolutely fantastic,\" Neville said. \"They dominated the game, even though they didn’t dominate possession; they dominated the game.",
      "\"They had the best chances, they were more physical, and that left side of Chelsea was obliterated. Alejandro Garnacho is a player that divides opinion, I think, at times.",
      "\"A lot of people are questioning, is he top-class or where is he? Where is he in the pecking order?",
      "\"What was difficult to watch last night was a young player like that, who’s gone to Chelsea and he looked shot to pieces in terms of his confidence on that left-hand side.",
      "\"I’m not just talking about when [Aaron] Wan-Bissaka kept going off him running forward, but actually when he got the ball, his first touch was back and then he just kept going back and giving it away.",
      "\"It was an awkward, very horrible experience for both Hato and Garnacho on that left side, and Badiashiele. But once he changed it, the complete and utter transformation of the game occurred.\"",

The drama at Old Trafford came in the dugout, with Ruben Amorim sacked at the start of the month and initially replaced by Darren Fletcher for a two-game spell, before Michael Carrick was named head coach until the end of the season.",

      "The 25-year-old made just a single appearance after joining the club in the summer. Williams earned his move after going on trial with the side to bring an end to a 12-month stint as a free agent following his Old Trafford exit.",
      "The defender had signed a one-year contract, with an option for a second, but that has now been ripped up. Williams featured in just six matchday squads and struggled for fitness before Hull agreed to end his stay to facilitate an easier departure, according to Hull Live.",
      "The club said: \"Hull City can confirm that full-back Brandon Williams has left the club by mutual agreement.",
      "\"The 25-year-old’s only first-team appearance after joining the Tigers last August came as a substitute in the Sky Bet Championship home defeat to Blackburn Rovers later that month.",

      "The ex-United youngster played 51 times for the club, with all but one outing coming under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. In 2019, the Norwegian described Williams as being 'as brave as a lion' following a man-of-the-match outing against Partizan Belgrade.",

But an afternoon to forget for VAR had led to nine added minutes, and for United at their best, that is always more than enough time. To rehash a phrash we've heard a lot of recently, this is in their DNA.

      "Silva's rant on Brooks and the officiating ended when he was quizzed on whether he had spoken to Brooks. \"I don't want get more cards because I want to be on the touchline,\" he finished. \"I don't want to speak more.\"",
      "Benjamin Sesko ended up proving to be the match-winner for United after Fulham had come from 2-0 down to pull it back to 2-2 in stoppage-time. But United snatched it in the 94th minute with Sesko firing home from inside the box after Bruno Fernandes had pulled the ball into his path.",

      "Benjamin Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee celebrate after Manchester United's win against Fulham(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Joshua Zirkzee showed his true colours as he was the first Manchester United player to run over to Benjamin Sesko after his winning goal against Fulham.",
      "Sesko, 22, has endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since his £74million move from RB Leipzig last summer, but he stepped up to the plate with a match-winning moment, scoring in the 94th minute to secure United a dramatic 3-2 victory on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The Slovenia international, who had found the net just five times in 20 matches going into the visit of Fulham, was introduced as a 74th minute substitute for Matheus Cunha and he had to wait until stoppage-time for his time to shine. Indeed, just moments after Fulham had made it 2-2 through Kevin, Bruno Fernandes set up Sesko to hammer the ball into the top corner and snatch all three points.",
      "And as Sesko wheeled away to celebrate in the South-West corner, Zirkzee, who had been warming up, was the first United player to run across to the forward to celebrate with him, grabbing him and showing how delighted he was. That came as a surprise to some United fans as Sesko and Zirkzee have been battling for first-team minutes throughout most of the season.",
      "But in that moment, Zirkzee displayed his class and character by congratulating Sesko and grabbing his shoulder before the rest of his United teammates made their way to him. Even after the full-time whistle was blown, Sesko and Zirkzee had another moment together and were both locked side-by-side.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Sesko and Zirkzee were both named on the bench to face Fulham as interim head coach Michael Carrick opted to pick Bryan Mbeumo as the central striker with Matheus Cunha and Amad Diallo either side.",
      "With Carrick making a change up front, Cunha was brought off and Sesko was chosen as the man to come on instead of Zirkzee, who remained as an unused substitute.",
      "Zirkzee has been linked with a move away from United this month and he has failed to play a single minute since Carrick became the club's new manager last month.",
      "He wasn't included in the matchday squad to face Manchester City and Arsenal, and only got the call up to the bench for Fulham due to Patrick Dorgu's injury setback.",
      "The Netherlands international's last appearance for the Reds came in the FA Cup defeat to Brighton in Darren Fletcher's final game in caretaker charge.",
      "As for Sesko, he now has six goals for United and Carrick was full of praise for him post-match. \"A huge moment,\" Carrick said. \"I'm so, so pleased. Everyone in the changing room, players, staff, delighted for him, absolutely delighted for him. And the reception he got when he came back in the changing room, told us everything. He’s even confident, to be honest.",
      "\"We've worked with him a lot in different ways over the last couple of weeks. He's bright in training. He's looked dangerous, he's done extra.",
      "\"The coaches have done a lot of bits on the side and Travis [Binnion], particularly, he's done a lot of work one on one with him.\"",

      "The Premier League have explained why VAR made the decision to rule a Fulham goal out against Manchester United on Sunday. Marco Silva's side thought they had pulled one back in the 65th minute when Jorge Cuenca tapped home from close range after Samuel Chukwueze's shot was blocked.",
      "The ball had fallen to Chukwueze inside the box after Raul Jimenez's free-kick hit the wall, and the former's snapshot was blocked by Lisandro Martinez before Cuenca was there to prod into the back of the net. However, following a long check, VAR decided to rule out the goal as it was viewed that Chukwueze was offside in the build-up.",
      "Replays showed that Chukwueze's shoulder strayed beyond the last man - Amad Diallo - and therefore VAR stepped in and ruled the goal out, despite a delay of around four minutes.",
      "Shortly after referee John Brooks informed the Old Trafford crowd that the goal wasn't going to stand, the Premier League released a statement to explain the decision.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Alongside a video showing Chukwueze's shoulder in an offside position, the Premier League's Match Centre account said on X: \"#MUNFUL – 65’ VAR OVERTURN VAR checked the referee’s call of goal – and established that Chukwueze was in an offside position and recommended that the goal was disallowed.\"",
      "With United leading 2-0 thanks to goals either side of half-time from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha, Fulham did eventually pull one back in the 85th minute and it came from the penalty spot. After Harry Maguire fouled Jimenez inside the area, the Mexican pulled himself back up to score from 12 yards.",
      "Fulham then had the momentum and the Whites thought they had nicked an unlikely point in stoppage-time as Kevin made it 2-2 with a terrific strike from the edge of the box.",
      "But United fought back and won it in the 94th minute as Bruno Fernandes' cross found Benjamin Sesko, who took a touch before swivelling and hitting a precise shot into the top corner.",
      "It sparked wild scenes inside Old Trafford as Michael Carrick's side ended up holding out for a 3-2 win and a third success in a row after beating Manchester City and Arsenal last month.",
      "United have moved back into fourth and sit just five points behind third-place Aston Villa, who suffered a second straight home Premier League defeat by losing 1-0 to Brentford on Sunday.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "This absurd concept of recruiting really good players and depth across every position to compete on multiple trophy-shaped fronts will never catch on, even if it does require them to keep signing Chelsea cast-offs.",
      "That does leave them with significantly less room for improvement than their peers. The goalkeeper and defence is not shifting. The midfield – even with a mild sense of supporter frustration at the stylings of Martin Odegaard – will likely not change either. But the attack is slightly different.",

The Viktor Gyokeres experiment will not be abandoned after a single season in which he is currently the club’s top scorer anyway. Gabriel Martinelli feels a little less secure, with Eberechi Eze, Leandro Trossard and Noni Madueke failing to provide ample evidence that they can be more than cover and rotational options on the left.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney thinks his former club and Arsenal made a mistake by not targeting Liverpool standout Hugo Ekitike in the summer.",
      "In last summer’s transfer window, most of the Big Six clubs were focused on signing new No.9s, and some shared the same targets.",
      "This includes Man Utd and Arsenal, who had their eye on Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko in the summer.",
      "In the end, Arsenal decided to prioritise Gyokeres, and this left the door open for Man Utd to sign Sesko ahead of Newcastle United.",
      "However, Gyokeres and Sesko have had their issues this season and have certainly been outshone by Liverpool star Ekitike, who joined them for around £79m from Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Ekitike has 15 goals and four assists in his 32 appearances for Liverpool this season and has also shone with his general play, so Rooney thinks Man Utd and Arsenal would have been better off with him than Gyokeres and Sesko.",
      "“We saw what Gyokeres did at Sporting, I know it was obviously a different country but he was scoring more goals than anyone and was absolutely on fire,” Rooney said on The Wayne Rooney show.",

      "“I’ve backed Gyokeres this season and people have given me a bit of stick but I still think he’s making a different to Arsenal, I really do.",
      "“He’s occupying defenders and that’s helping the team. I know he’s not got the goals or assists you’d want from your centre forward but I still think he’s having an impact.”",
      "Despite this, Rooney also insisted that he has been more impressed with Liverpool’s summer signing Ekitike.",
      "When asked whether he would take the Arsenal striker over Ekitike, Rooney replied: “No.",
      "“Ekitike and [Granit] Xhaka at Sunderland have probably been the two best signings in the Premier League. I really enjoy watching Ekitike play.",
      "“His second goal [against Newcastle] in particular was brilliant, it reminds me of Romario. A little toe-poke goal but it’s instinctive.",
      "“He is the type of player I like to watch. He’s not a number nine, he’s not a number 10. He drifts out wide, he gets on the ball, brings players into the game and he can score goals.",
      "“So he’s got a bit of everything really.”",
      "Rooney has also explained why he gives the edge to Ekitike over Man Utd forward Sesko.",
      "“I really enjoy watching those type of players [like Ekitike]. He’s got that arrogance and confidence,” Rooney added.",
      "“If you look at Sesko for instance, he looks like he needs a bit of guidance and a bit of help when he’s on the pitch.",
      "“I know he scored the winner today thankfully but he looks like he needs a bit of guidance whereas Hugo Ekitike it looks like you can just put him on the pitch.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may yet follow that path. If/when that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "But a couple of wins have eased the pressure on Nuno – a couple of wins really is all it takes to transform this market currently – and  even a grim point at Burnley is enough to save Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there, despite an absurd and very Spurs draw against Man City.",
      "And it now looks like Arne Slot rather than Frank or Nuno will be the latest ‘winner’ here as Liverpool’s fraudulent unbeaten run finally came to an end at Bournemouth, who like West Ham, have been rejuvenated by Frank and Dr Tottenham.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 15 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "A sticky run has brought that talk to an end. There’s obviously no shame in not managing to stick around as unlikely title challengers for longer, but some frustration at the manner in which their charge has been halted. Home defeats to Everton and Brentford, given the fortress Villa Park had become, is a bit of a limp end to a game old fight.",
      "But they’re still very much on course for another crack at the Champions League and they’ve also qualified unfussily for the last 16 of a very winnable Europa League. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season and Villa now sorted out home, away and in the Carabao, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "That Brentford now sit cosily in Europe-adjacent upper mid-table, seven points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures, is quite something.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Seven wins and two draws in 13 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between about seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool and victory at Wolves.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation a distant memory after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin; getting slapped silly a second time by Arsenal suggests maybe not.",
      "February is a huge month for Leeds and Farke in the league; a proper blood-and-thunder six-pointer against Nottingham Forest and then three of the current top five.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa had Howe once again under fire before a tame surrender at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford has given Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy.",

      "It was quite a 2025 for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, for neither the first nor last time, Tottenham have come to the rescue. The momentum from a job-saving win at Spurs was parlayed into an even more impressive win over Sunderland and, despite the horrific late gut-punch, there was enough about the defeat at Chelsea to suggest the Hammers can at least drag some of the other stupid teams into the equation.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other Big Six team pulls the trigger.",

      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down. Palace are currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They are without a win in 11 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",

      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth, although an impressive win over Newcastle has been enough to knock Slot off top spot.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It is West Ham’s (admittedly Spurs-assisted) resurgence and with it the very real danger of relegation that might finally get the Spurs board to see what has been alarmingly obvious to the fans for many weeks now.",
      "The fact a draw at Burnley appears to be enough to keep him in place for another week is damning. And if that got him a week, it seems only fair that another draw against Man City gets him the rest of the season.",

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",

      "Man Utd won't U-turn on the decision to allow Casemiro to leave when his contract expires in June despite improved Premier League form under Michael Carrick; the club are forward planning and expected to chase a number of midfield targets in the summer, with Elliot Anderson top of list",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is in his richest vein of form since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth £70m in 2022. So why would the club let him go now?",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday, heading in the opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a sublime no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro has started all three games under Carrick, but made his impending departure official last month while Ruben Amorim was still in charge. United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",
      "\"Manchester United are determined not to have a short-term approach to signings and managers. That's what has got them into trouble in the past. It's left a lot of big-name players on big wages who are not part of the plans.",
      "\"Casemiro is flying right now. Player of the match against Fulham. I can understand why a lot of fans are saying: 'we're trying to find a midfielder but willing to let Casemiro go?'",
      "\"He turns 34 later this month, he's one of the biggest earners at the club, £325k a week, and Man Utd know that can't go on forever. He's playing out of his skin right now but they have to have a longer-term plan.",
      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "Tuesday 3 February 2026 08:47, UK",
      "Going into the window, the feeling was Arsenal were going to be quiet. And so it proved.",
      "They did their business in the summer - and were only likely to dip into the market if a long-term target or unique market opportunity presented itself.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta maintained they would be alive and alert.",
      "However, he also called for the numbers in a matchday squad to be increased in line with Europe. He is begging for 23 in total - and 20 outfield players. The reason? He is having to disappoint two or three players every game.",
      "With that in mind, the chance of a new signing was always going to be slim.",
      "A serious injury to Mikel Merino gave Arsenal food for thought - and they tentatively explored a potential deal. However, that's as far as it got and Arsenal will continue their fight on all four fronts with the squad they have.",
      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",

      "After impressively beating Arsenal and Manchester City, Carrick's United passed another test that had its fair share of refereeing controversy.",
      "The first incident came in the build-up to Man Utd's opener as they were initially awarded a penalty after Matheus Cunha was judged to have been brought down by Jorge Cuenca. However, after a VAR check, the decision was overturned, with Cuenca clearly winning the ball, although the hosts were given a free-kick for a shirt pull instead - much to Marco Silva's fury.",
      "Manchester United were awarded a penalty for a trip by Jorge Cuenca on Matheus Cunha. However, a VAR review showed Cuenca won the ball - but a free-kick was given for the defender pulling Cunha's shirt outside the box.",
      "In that case, the VAR could intervene by declaring the decision a factual error and award a free-kick instead.",

      "Cunha, who made a return to the starting line-up in the only change to the side in place of the injured Patrick Dorgu, thundered in to double Man Utd's advantage in the second half.",
      "Fulham thought they had pulled one back when Cuenca tapped in a deflected Samuel Chukwueze shot that fell kindly into his path. However, after a VAR check that lasted around four minutes, the goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.",
      "But after being brought down by Harry Maguire in the area, Jimenez scored from the spot, before Kevin's stunning equaliser looked like it had rescued a point for Marco Silva's side.",
      "But Sesko, set up by Fernandes, had different ideas, thumping in his fifth goal of the season. A resurgent Man Utd are now five points off third place in the Premier League. Fulham drop to eighth.",

      "\"The first one is much more difficult to accept because of the feedback we got. All of the people in the stadium felt the penalty was given because of the tackle.\"",

      "It was easy street for Man City in the first half. They didn't need to get out of first gear at Spurs. The problem was they stayed there for the rest of the game.",
      "There's been a common theme regarding Pep Guardiola's teams and that is slow second halves after being 2-0 up.",
      "Against Wolves, Joao Gomes and Jorgen Strand Larsen should have pulled a goal back for the league's bottom side but missed chances. Victor Osimhen should have scored once or twice for Galatasaray in midweek. This dip at Spurs was one too many - and it felt similar to the two second-half goals conceded in the Manchester derby",
      "Guardiola said his City team suffered emotionally after the injustice of Dominic Solanke's first goal standing due to the Marc Guehi collision. Duels were missed, particularly out wide with the full-backs, he said - and it was seen in the equaliser as Nico O'Reilly and Nico Gonzalez got mixed up.",
      "And then the excuses from Guardiola start to come. Blaming the Guehi-Solanke incident follows similar complaints about not getting a penalty against Wolves and Diogo Dalot staying on the pitch in the Manchester derby. The reality is City have been struggling in the most important parts of matches.",
      "Is it a physical issue, with injuries catching up on them? Is it too many new players over the last 12 months? It all acts as a reminder that this is not a Manchester City of years gone by. How many times in the past would a Guardiola team kill a game off early and sit on a lead, maybe push for more?",

      "The Dutchman was the biggest beneficiary of the 3-4-3 system that was forced to turn to due to the injuries that have plagued the squad. With the wide wing-backs pushing up, it gave Simons ample space inside to operate in areas he is dangerous in.",
      "More often than not, he was the go-to for Spurs as they transitioned from defence into attack. His neat footwork was at times a joy and his weight of pass was more often than not, exemplary.",
      "Having said that, the most impressive thing was his tenacity. He never gave up a fight for possession. He showed the grit needed in tough and physical Premier League games, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "This was somewhat of a coming our performance for Simons, whose quality was never questioned, but was a case of if it was suited to English football.",

      "His best work came in possession in the first half as he demonstrated his technical ability and passing range, sending Forest forward on the attack repeatedly.",
      "He continued to show his on-ball value even after Neco Williams' sending-off. No Forest player had more touches or made more passes over the course of the 90 minutes. Anderson even completed all five of his attempted dribbles.",
      "But he was just as influential defensively after the break. Anderson snapped into challenges and played a crucial role in frustrating Palace, working tirelessly, cajoling and instructing team-mates.",
      "In total, he won possession 10 times, the highest total by any player on either side. He was also successful in 12 of his 14 duels. An outstanding all-round performance from a player getting better all the time.Nick Wright",
      "The draw against Nottingham Forest extended Crystal Palace's winless run to nine in the Premier League and 12 in all competitions. Shelbourne were the last team they beat, all the way back on December 11.",
      "But while that is miserable, arguably more concerning is their struggles in front of goal.",
      "Across those last 12, they have scored nine, with three scored from the penalty spot. That equates to a goal from open play every other game.",
      "Even with the absence of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was left out of the squad owing to the speculation around his future - Palace should probably have put more than an Ismaila Sarr penalty past Matz Sels - and half-time replacement Angus Gunn. Their hosts were reduced to 10 after a mindless handball from Neco Williams.",
      "But despite having 74 per cent of the possession after the break, they just couldn't. In fact, in the second half, they recorded only 0.22 xG and did not even muster a single shot on target.",
      "Right now, Mateta's future remains up in the air ahead of Deadline Day, but Palace have had a bid for Jorgen Strand Larsen totalling £48m accepted by Wolves. Providing that deal goes through without a hitch, they will need him to be firing from the off.Dan Long",
      "Aston Villa welcomed Douglas Luiz and Tammy Abraham back to the club this week and the duo went straight into the starting line-up against Brentford.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."

      "Michael Carrick will go for a third consecutive win as Man Utd head coach against Fulham on Super Sunday and goalkeeper Senne Lammens has a big role to play; The Radar column also reveals the passing stats that set Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa apart",
      "Sunday 1 February 2026 07:04, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Lammens brings calm to Man Utd💪 Konsa's passing under pressure🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United beat Arsenal last Sunday with the help of two moments of brilliance from Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu. But their goalkeeper played his part too, albeit in typically understated style. Senne Lammens continues to impress.",
      "The 23-year-old, an £18m signing from Royal Antwerp, has looked good value ever since his debut in October, when he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford, instantly bringing a level of calm Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana lacked.",
      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",
