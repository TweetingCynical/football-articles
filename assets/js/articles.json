      "Manchester United have been informed why the correct call was made to send off Casemiro during their weekend triumph over Chelsea.",
      "The Red Devils secured a 2-1 win against the west London side in their Premier League encounter at Old Trafford on Saturday night. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro found the back of the net for United in a match that saw both sides finish with ten players.",
      "Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was shown a straight red inside the opening five minutes following a challenge on Bryan Mbeumo just outside the box. Casemiro was shown a red card in first-half stoppage times after collecting two yellows for challenges on Enzo Fernandez and Andrey Santos.",
      "The decision to give Casemiro his second caution has sparked discussion after referee Peter Bankes gave the United midfielder his marching orders. Now, ex-Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has revealed why he thinks the right call was made",
      "\"The second one - people will say to me, 'Is it enough for a second yellow card?' I am forever saying not every tackle after a yellow card is a second yellow card, but the difference here is he has deliberately gone to pull him back.",
      "\"We see every week, we are saying 'Everybody who is pulled back gets a second yellow card'. People say, 'He [Casemiro] got the ball', he gets the ball because he pulls him [Santos] back. I think second yellow card, red card.\"",
      "However, former Premier League striker Jay Bothroyd disagreed, arguing that Casemiro should not have been dismissed for his challenge on Santos. \"I think that was harsh,\" Bothroyd stated.",
      "\"On the pitch, players know exactly what is going on. The player [Santos] has actually run across Casemiro, he can't get out of the way because he is running as well at speed.",
      "\"There is nothing you can do apart from maybe put your arms up and try and get out of the way. I think that is what he is trying to do there. I think that is really harsh to give him a second yellow there to send him off.",
      "\"I think that is really harsh because he is trying to get out of the way, there is nothing he can do there at all.\"",
      "As a result of receiving two yellow cards, Casemiro will now serve a one-match ban, ruling him out of the Premier League match against Brentford this weekend. The Brazilian will be eligible to play again in United's home game against Sunderland on October 4.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will pursue a 'major goalkeeper' in next summer's transfer window after Ruben Amorim confirmed that neither Altay Bayindir or the club's most recent signing, Senne Lammens, are locked in as the team's No 1.",
      "United responded by sealing an £18.2million deal for Lammens on the final day of the summer transfer window. However, the 23-year-old Belgian is viewed as a quality prospect for the future and is not guaranteed to play ahead of Bayindir, who looked more assured in Saturday evening's 2-1 win over Chelsea.",
      "But despite spending a significant sum on Lammens just weeks ago, The Sun claim that United plan to bolster their goalkeeping options again next summer, with an elite shot-stopper on the club's wishlist with Onana moving to Turkey.",
      "It remains to be seen who the Red Devils will target, though. They also weighed up a move for Emi Martinez before pressing ahead with a deadline day swoop for Lammens after seeing an audacious loan bid for the Aston Villa goalkeeper rejected earlier in the transfer window. It's understood he would have cost significantly more than Lammens, who is viewed as Belgium's next No 1 keeper.",
      "Onana was signed for a fee in excess of £47m back in the summer of 2023 as the club decided to part ways with their long-term No 1, David de Gea. However, Onana has looked a shadow of the goalkeeper who starred for Inter Milan, making a string of errors during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Bayindir has also struggled to convince when deputising for Onana. He was at fault for the only goal of the game in United's 1-0 loss against Arsenal on the opening weekend of the new Premier League season but has been picked for all five league games so far this term.",
      "\"No, nobody has a place that is his place,\" Amorim said recently when he was asked if Bayindir was now United's first-choice keeper. \"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has openly responded to speculation linking him with a switch to Portugal to manage Sporting CP's fierce rivals Benfica following questions over his Manchester United future. The Portuguese boss had reportedly been earmarked as a possible replacement after Bruno Lage's sacking, with his own position at Old Trafford looking shaky in recent weeks.",
      "Portuguese media claimed that Joao Noronha Lopes, standing in next month's Benfica presidential race, held Amorim in particularly high regard. The 40-year-old manager was allegedly included on his shortlist of prospective coaching targets.",
      "When addressing the speculation, Noronha Lopes said: \"Ruben Amorim? He's a great coach, he has a contract with Manchester United. I won't comment on that. Of course I like him. He's a great coach and a Benfica fan. I don't have a contract for Ruben to sign.\"",
      "The rumour mill was silenced when Jose Mourinho's appointment was confirmed by Benfica last Friday.",
      "Amorim was subsequently questioned about the 'Special One's' new job during a post-match interview following the 2-1 triumph over Chelsea. The United head coach served an apprenticeship under Mourinho at United during his early coaching days, and he spoke glowingly of his fellow countryman. \"He's the best Portuguese manager, and that won't change,\" Amorim told Portuguese channel DAZN.",
      "\"He's always been a very special person in our football, but also in the world, and he opened all the doors for us. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Jose Mourinho. I think it's going to be a lot of fun for you all in Portugal, and we're going to enjoy it.\"",
      "Regarding his own future, Amorim confirmed he had no plans to leave or seek a move elsewhere, addressing the speculation by saying: \"It's what it is and we'll see what happens. But [I'm] focussed only on Manchester and that will be my only club.\"",

      "Barcelona are hoping to make Marcus Rashford's loan switch a permanent one at a bargain price of £26m. That fee is lower than the £35m that Manchester United believe the 27-year-old is worth.",
      "Rashford has been loaned to the Catalan giants for the season following a fallout with United management. The forward spent the latter half of the previous season on loan at Aston Villa before moving to the Nou Camp. He's had a cracking start with the Spanish side, contributing to their undefeated beginning to the new season.",
      "Rashford has already made six appearances and netted his first goals with a spectacular double in last week's Champions League victory over Newcastle. There's no recall clause in the loan agreement between United and Barca, meaning his parent club can't bring Rashford back this season.",
      "Barca have the option to make the move permanent next summer, but they're keen to negotiate a lower price with United, reports the Daily Star. Rashford is settling well in Barcelona and, if things continue to go smoothly, he'll be keen to stay. That's despite being benched for Sunday's match against Getafe after reportedly infuriating manager Hansi Flick by turning up late for a team meeting before training.",
      "However, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe won't be willing to let Rashford go cheaply. He knows that the better Rashford performs in Barcelona, the higher his value will rise.",
      "There's also the tantalising prospect of the striker having a successful run with England in next summer's World Cup, assuming he makes it into Thomas Tuchel's squad. Since his move to Barca, Rashford has found himself back in Tuchel's long-term plans.",
      "Rashford is tied down to United on a whopping £300,000-a-week contract until 2028. It's believed he has no plans to ever return to his boyhood club, having made the tough choice to take his career in a different direction.",
      "Even if Barca and United can't agree on a permanent fee for him next summer, Rashford would still be looking for a new club other than United.",

      "Social media clips have emerged showing Maguire breaching multi-ball regulations after being hauled off in the second half by Ruben Amorim. Rather than trudging across the pitch when substituted for Leny Yoro, referee Peter Bankes directed him to exit via the nearest route.",
      "Two spare balls sit atop cones positioned behind each goal line, aligned with the penalty area. Players must collect them from these designated spots to resume play, with multi-ball designed to cut down match disruptions when the ball leaves the field.",
      "The Premier League confirms the system, launched in the 2022/23 campaign, \"intends to maintain the flow of matches and reduce delays\". Officials stress that \"adherence to the relevant rules and guidance is of vital importance to maintain consistency and, crucially, to ensure that home clubs do not gain a competitive advantage through their misuse of the system.\"",
      "Outfield players must either fetch the match ball personally or grab a replacement from the cones instead of accepting them from ball assistants. Ball assistants positioned behind each goal are permitted to provide footballs exclusively to goalkeepers preparing to take goal kicks.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has previously criticised the Ballon d'Or voting system, claiming that both he and Vinicius Junior have been overlooked for the prestigious award. In 2024, Manchester City's Rodri was awarded the honour, beating Vini Jr in the process.",
      "The Real Madrid star had a successful campaign, winning the Champions League, La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup. In contrast, Rodri claimed the Premier League, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup.",
      "He also outshone the Brazilian on the international stage, securing the European Championship with Spain. Numerous arguments were made for Vini Jr. to win the Ballon d'Or, including from ex-Manchester United legend and Madrid star Ronaldo, who believes he and the winger share the same feelings of being unjustly treated in the voting.",
      "Speaking to La Sexta at the time, the five-time winner said: \"There is no credibility, Vinicius should be the Ballon d'Or winner. I have felt it many times and I felt angry. Over time I understood it, these are battles that you cannot win.\"",
      "Ronaldo was likely referring to Lionel Messi, who holds the record for the most Ballon d'Or trophies with eight, three more than Ronaldo. The iconic duo have competed for the award for two decades, with Messi winning an unprecedented four in a row from 2009 to 2012.",
      "The Portuguese forward pipped Messi to his first Ballon d'Or, claiming it in 2008 whilst still in Manchester working under Sir Alex Ferguson. The Argentinian then secured four consecutive awards, before Ronaldo claimed the prize in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017.",
      "Messi secured another four Ballon d'Ors in 2015, 2019, 2021 and 2023 - following his legendary World Cup triumph - establishing himself as the most decorated player in the award's history over the past two decades.",
      "Ronaldo has previously expressed his frustration with the award's selection process, even revealing to Piers Morgan that he believes he should conclude his career with more Ballon d'Ors than Messi.",
      "Speaking in 2019, he said: \"Messi's in the history of football. But I think I have to have six or seven or eight to be above him.\"",
      "Discussing his bond with the Argentine, the now-40-year-old added: \"My relationship with him is, we are not friends, but we have shared this stage for 15 years. I know that he has pushed me to be a better player and I have pushed him to be a better player as well.\"",
      "Cut to 2025, and both Ronaldo and Messi are not in the running for this year's Ballon d'Or. Paris Saint-Germain's Ousmane Dembele and Barcelona's Lamine Yamal are regarded as the frontrunners for the 2025 men's accolade, and it appears that Messi and Ronaldo's decades of supremacy in the award seem to be drawing to a close.",

      "Last week, as Ruben Amorim’s side were preparing to face Chelsea in a crucial Premier League match, Manchester United released their financial results for the 2024/25 season. The campaign may have been a nightmare on the pitch, but there was good news off it.",
      "The club announced record financial revenue of £666.5million, record commercial revenue of £333.3m and record matchday revenue of £160.3m. Thanks to Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos’ brutal cost-cutting exercises, which have included 400 redundancies, United’s overall loss of £113.2m was slashed to £33m.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season – their worst placing since 1973/74. They then compounded things by losing the Europa League final against Tottenham to miss out on a trophy and a place in this season’s Champions League.",
      "This was undeniably a miserable end to a dreadful season. And yet, from a financial perspective, there was a silver lining for the club’s accountants, who did not have to pay out a 25 per cent bonus to the players, which would have been payable if they had reached the Champions League. Wages were therefore cut by a whopping £51.5m to £313.2m – their lowest level since 2019/20.",
      "Even while Amorim’s side are struggling, winning just 18 of their 48 matches in all competitions under the Portuguese boss, brand United keeps powering on, seemingly unaffected by the quality of the product itself.",
      "Woodward, United’s former executive vice-chairman, is not a popular figure among fans. But he was right – and Ratcliffe and the Glazer family are continuing on that path, with commercial deals with Adidas and Snapdragon helping get the club out of a period of stagnation.",
      "United are such a money-making machine that the club can afford to keep increasing debt. It now stands at just under £1.2bn, which is made up of £742m in financial debt and £447m in fees associated with transfers.",
      "One of the biggest gripes with supporters in terms of the Glazer family, who have owned the club since 2003, is the sky-high debt. That figure is now at an all-time high and has increased significantly since Ratcliffe and Ineos took over running the sporting side of the club in February 2024.",
      "“Manchester United generate enough money through ticket sales, commercial deals, merchandise and being popular with broadcasters to manage the debt easily,” Maguire explains. “It’s not a concern, but it is symbolic. Spurs have borrowed a lot, but they have a fantastic new stadium; United have borrowed a lot and they have the Glazers and clearly that’s an issue.",
      "“They’ve spent a lot of money on players – there’s no denying that, and it’s far more than they’ve generated from player sales and as a result the borrowings have gone up substantially. Despite Jim Ratcliffe putting money into the club through a share issue, they’ve had to borrow £130m in terms of increases to the overdraft net. They’ve also borrowed money since the end of the season and that’s very inconsistent with Ratcliffe’s claim that they would’ve gone bust by Christmas.”",
      "United may not have European football this season, but they are looking abroad for more money-making opportunities. A much-criticised post-season tour happened for the first time this summer before a pre-season tour of the Far East. And now they are reportedly considering mid-season friendlies in the Middle East.",
      "Maguire has a theory about the direction of travel at United, who are planning a new stadium in a regenerated Old Trafford area. “The fans are now paying for it in a sense. Yes, it’s record revenues, partly due to the fact that match day revenues are up significantly, which is due to higher prices, so fans are generating this,” he says.",
      "“I think what they’re trying to do is turn Old Trafford from a football stadium into more of an experience. We’re seeing traditional fans, who have sat with their mates for the last 30 years, being turfed out. Their seats behind the dugout can be sold as a ‘manager experience’.",
      "“What you will see from Ineos is a marginalisation of Manchester United’s traditional, local fanbase to try and replace them with more wealthy fans who want something memorable because they only get the opportunity to come once or twice a year and they’re prepared to pay for the privilege.”",
      "Essentially, United are continuing to trade off their glory years under Sir Alex Ferguson, who helped turn the club into a colossus both on and off the pitch. While the performances have disappeared, the other side of things remains.",
      "“They owe a huge debt to Sir Alex Ferguson, because he built the brand, with their success in that era coinciding with the growth of satellite television when they were the dominant club in the dominant league, which brought them global attention,” Maguire adds. “Now they can do pre-season and post-season tours. United fans will come and watch them regardless of their league position.",
      "“Football isn’t like many other products. If I go to a restaurant and have a few bad meals, I’ll find an alternative restaurant. But if my football team are bobbins for a few years, I’ll still turn up even if I moan a bit more. You have that lifelong brand loyalty with a football club that Manchester United are in a great position to exploit.”",

Sanchez was given his marching orders for denying a goalscoring opportunity when he fouled Bryan Mbeumo outside the penalty box.",
      "\"You see a goalkeeper come out, whatever reason he comes out for, it takes out Mbeumo. I don't think anybody would argue it's a red card. A big decision four minutes in, and he (referee Peter Bankes) rose to it.\"",
      "Football pundit Jay Bothroyd also agreed with the decision, remarking: \"It was reckless, wasn't it? I have got a bit of sympathy here though for Sanchez, obviously, the weather, as you can see, it's really wet.",
      "\"The ball bounces differently; it skidded forward. There's no doubt about it, it's a red card, it's just so early in the game I think he got his starting position wrong.",
      "\"Ultimately, either way, (he's) stopping a goalscoring opportunity and that tackle was high anyway.\"",
      "United capitalised on their numerical advantage in the opening period, with strikes from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro establishing a 2-0 lead. However, Casemiro was shown a second yellow card moments before the interval to level the playing field.",
      "Chelsea rallied in the second period, with Trevoh Chalobah netting in the 80th minute. But, they were unable to locate the crucial equaliser.",
      "They did have appeals for a spot-kick, though, when Joao Pedro tumbled in the area following a challenge from Noussair Mazraoui. Chelsea's appeals were dismissed by Bankes, and Gallagher has stated it was the correct decision.",
      "\"Referees do things by instinct,\" he said. \"Watch the ball change direction, the ball changed direction because he gets it.",
      "\"If you see the referee's position, that is what he sees. The referee actually sees the ball change direction, turns and waves it away.\"",

      "The Manchester United supporter famous for his hair-growing pledge has been assaulted by a fellow fan in a shocking incident captured on video. Frank Ilett, dubbed the United Strand, has become an internet sensation with his follicular challenge.",
      "The Red Devils devotee has vowed not to trim his locks until Ruben Amorim's squad achieves five consecutive competitive victories - resulting in his increasingly wild mane. He was present at United's 2-1 Premier League triumph over Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Having journeyed from his Spanish residence for the fixture, Frank was filmed being targeted in the stadium's concourse by someone questioning his allegiance to United.",
      "Footage shared on social media depicted Ilett engaging with supporters in good spirits and grinning at an elderly, hairless fan.",
      "However, the fellow supporter then began grabbing his hair, initially appearing playful, but subsequently seeming unwilling to release his grip.",
      "It quickly became obvious that the fan was yanking his hair and can be observed in the clip trying to force Ilett to the floor, reports the Daily Star.",
      "Other supporters recognised the situation and dragged Ilett to safety, who appeared shocked by the experience, whilst the irate fan was restrained and made crude gestures in his direction.",
      "The incensed supporter had apparently targeted Ilett's viral stunt and insisted he wasn't a genuine United fan.",
      "He was heard declaring: \"F*** off, f*** off, I'll do what I f***ing want. Listen, he's not a United f***ing fan, so f*** off, f*** off.\"",
      "Despite the altercation, Ilett didn't let the incident dampen his spirits as he shared a snap of himself celebrating United's crucial victory from the stands on social media.",
      "He penned: \"What a place. Wet hair, but still a smile on my face! A big win today! What a crazy game it was in the end! 1 down, 4 to go. COME ON UNITED!\"",
      "Ilett embarked on the challenge nearly a year ago on 5 October 2024, and regularly shares updates about his eccentric hairstyle that has drawn comparisons to a King's Guard hat, Marge Simpson, and a beehive.",
      "When he initiated the challenge, Ilett admitted that his original goal of securing three consecutive wins seemed too straightforward, yet United have struggled to achieve even back-to-back victories during this period.",

      "Barcelona are covering his entire salary and holding a £26million purchase option for the Old Trafford academy product. The 27-year-old has displayed encouraging form in recent outings, providing an assist in the clash with Valencia before finding the net twice against Newcastle United in Champions League action.",

The 27-year-old marked his return to England with two stunning goals after moving to Spain in the summer.",
      "Yet, on Sunday, manager Hansi Flick relegated Rashford to the bench for the home game against Getafe. According to The Athletic, Rashford's demotion was due to him turning up late for training on the day of the match.",
      "The German boss has a strict policy of not selecting players to start matches if they are late to training or a meeting. Rashford now joins Raphinha, Jules Kounde, and Inaki Pena, who have all received similar treatment.",
      "Rashford was brought off the bench at half time at the Estadi Johan Cruyff with Barca comfortably leading 2-0 thanks to a Ferran Torres double. Replacing Raphinha, Rashford reacted positively to his demotion by setting up Dani Olmo for a goal just 17 minutes later.",
      "It isn't the first time Rashford has faced disciplinary issues. Back in January 2024, he was dropped from the Manchester United squad by Erik ten Hag after a night out in Belfast resulted in him missing training.",

The striker was brilliant for Barcelona last week, netting a brace against Newcastle - including a spectacular long-range effort that proved to be the matchwinner - as the Catalan giants kicked off their European adventure with victory.",

Rashford entered as a substitute and set up a goal in Barca's commanding 3-0 triumph, but his exclusion from the starting XI demonstrated manager Flick's no-nonsense approach, which has been evident on numerous previous occasions.",
      "Flick had already served laid out the precedent that Rashford and his team-mates had to follow.",
      "Defender Jules Kounde faced similar treatment multiple times last campaign after failing to arrive punctually for training sessions. The German tactician addressed this punctuality issue during a press conference at the time, cautioning his remaining players that attending training promptly demonstrates respect for their colleagues.",
      "He said: \"It's not that difficult to show up and do your job. It's not just about me, but about respect for the players and everyone else.\"",
      "This warning from last season served as Rashford's heads-up before his loan switch to Barca. Flick ensured it was crystal clear that he wouldn't stand for any nonsense within his squad, with sanctions being dished out whenever necessary.",
      "Raphinha also found himself on the bench for Barcelona during a recent clash against Valencia, a decision that underlines manager Hansi Flick's ethos of equality within the team, regardless of the Brazilian's significant impact.",
      "Marcus Rashford bounced back from being sidelined by Flick, setting up Dani Olmo for Barca's third goal. This marks Rashford's second consecutive La Liga match with an assist, complementing his two goals since returning to England last week.",
      "Flick praised the United forward, particularly noting Rashford's preference for a central role. This could be seen as a nudge to England manager Thomas Tuchel ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Speaking after the game, the Barcelona coach said: \"We decided to bring Marcus in. He can also play on the right, but I think he prefers to play as a number 11 or as a number 9.\"",

      "Weeks after losing at home to Arsenal in the Premier League, Manchester United have suffered another blow at the Gunners' hands. That's after it was confirmed Mikel Arteta's side have successfully poached a member of the Red Devils' coaching staff.",
      "And there could be further departures from Old Trafford next year if all goes to plan. Marcus Rashford is perhaps expected to be one of them after a solid start to life on loan in Barcelona, but the chances of that permanent transfer going ahead appear to have suffered a blow.",
      "One name already through the Old Trafford departures lounge is David Horseman, who only joined United three months ago as assistant manager for the under-21s. Having arrived at the club in the summer, he's now left to take over as elite player development coach at Arsenal.",
      "A Gunners press statement read: \"We are delighted to announce that David Horseman has been appointed as our Professional Development Phase - elite player development coach.",
      "\"Under the guidance of our Head of Academy Coaching Luke Hobbs and Academy Manager Per Mertesacker, David will be working closely with our academy coaches, including PDP Lead Ken Gillard and under-21s head coach Max Porter to manage our under-19s in the UEFA Youth League and the EFL Trophy, where we are soon to compete against League One teams Cardiff City and Exeter City, as well as League Two side Newport County.\"",
      "Horseman, 41, briefly served as caretaker coach at Bristol Rovers in December 2024 and moved to Old Trafford after they were relegated to League Two. However, his early work alongside United's youth clearly got the right sort of attention after Arsenal jumped to clinch his signature.",
      "The loan life has been good to Rashford thus far, following up a successful six-month stint with Aston Villa by impressing early on at Barca. The England forward celebrated an electric return to British shores on Thursday by bagging a match-winning brace for Barcelona in their Champions League trip to Newcastle, but it may not be enough to earn a permanent move.",
      "Not through any fault of the player, it should be noted, but more so due to the latest restructure of La Liga's wage restraints. Barcelona have had to deal with numerous complications in registering players and complying with wage restrictions in recent years, with the likes of Rashford, Dani Olmo and Joan Garcia among the recent examples to be affected.",
      "And things look like they'll only become more complicated in future after La Liga tightened its squad cost cap once more. The Daily Mail reported Barca's salary limit for the 2025/26 campaign has been reduced to £306million from £404m.",
      "It's understood the dispute relates to auditors refusing to include around £87m of revenue claimed by the club. That figure accounts for 25 years worth of future sales on 475 executive boxes, but the club have been told they won't be able to count that as revenue.",
      "Rashford could join Barca permanently for a fee of around £26m should the Catalans choose to trigger the clause in his deal next year. However, the 27-year-old will have to continue proving himself before the Blaugrana decide to take such a punt given the new constraints.",
      "In terms of new arrivals at the Theatre of Dreams, there are few faces many would like to see arrive more next year than Carlos Baleba. United were linked with a move for the Brighton midfielder late on in the transfer window but pulled out after baulking at his £100m price tag.",
      "And now Seagulls manager Fabian Hurzeler has commented on the player's response to those rumours after a lacklustre start to the season. Once an undroppable member of the Brighton XI last term, Baleba has now become something of a bit-part player and is yet to play a full 90 minutes for his club this season.",
      "\"Everyone has to understand with Carlos, he's a very young player,\" said Brighton boss Hurzeler after Saturday's 2-2 draw against Spurs. \"He needs help from us. He tried everything today. He only had 45 minutes in his body, and it's something that we have to accept.\"",
      "When pressed for his opinion on whether the summer's brief transfer saga has impacted his player at all, the German replied: \"It's all a lot of theory. We can only guess. For sure, when a young boy reads that there's interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep.",
      "\"Even if he's not saying, 'It affects me,' maybe deep inside of him, there is something that affects him. It's even part of the development, to understand when you play well and a big club comes, to keep pushing, and to stay humble, to stay at Brighton and make the next step as a team.",
      "\"And that's something we have to keep on working with him, and so, therefore, I can't give you a clear answer if it's really affected him or not.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho's return to Manchester United was marked by an awkward touchline confrontation with defender Leny Yoro. Garnacho left United this summer after criticising manager Ruben Amorim for his lack of playing time in the Europa League final loss to Tottenham.",
      "In the aftermath of that controversy, Amorim told Garnacho he could leave United in the next transfer window. Garnacho made it clear that he would be willing to move away from Old Trafford and was made a part of Amorim's 'Bomb Squad'.",
      "Determined to stay in the Premier League, he secured a move to Chelsea, much to the disappointment of United fans. Little more than a fortnight after the deal was sealed, Garnacho returned to Old Trafford in the Premier League.",
      "He was met with boos from home fans as soon as he stepped off the Chelsea team bus and jeers greeted him during the pre-match warm-up. Garnacho didn't get on the pitch as Chelsea's substitutions were impacted by Robert Sanchez's early red card, but still faced hostility from the home crowd who expressed their displeasure with chants aimed towards him throughout the match.",
      "The animosity towards the Argentine didn't seem to stop in the stands. A video originating from the Stretford End, shared on X, seems to show a heated exchange between Garnacho and his ex-teammate Yoro.",
      "As the Chelsea player ran down the touchline, he was met by the centre-back. Initially, it looked like Garnacho tries to greet Yoro, but when that was ignored, he barged into the defender before heading over to Kobbie Mainoo, who did acknowledge him.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee also shook Garnacho's hand, but the uncomfortable reunion with Yoro clearly indicates tension between the United squad and the winger. It was ultimately United who had the last laugh as they celebrated a 2-1 victory over Chelsea to ease the pressure on Amorim.",
      "Unless they face each other in the FA Cup next year, the Red Devils won't encounter Garnacho again until mid-April when the return match takes place at Stamford Bridge. Amorim said on Friday: \"Garnacho is not our player. I’m really happy with Mason and (Matheus) Cunha returning. The rest you have to talk with the Chelsea manager.\"",
      "Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca explained why Garnacho didn't make it onto the pitch. He said: \"Garnacho was ready to go.",

      "Manchester United winger Amad has deleted all of his Instagram posts after receiving a furious backlash to one of his photos. Amad was a part of the United side which beat Chelsea 2-1 on Saturday, but the enjoyment of the win was tempered by a social media furore.",
      "United benefited from an early red card for Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez as they picked up just their second win of the season. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro put the home side 2-0 up and a late goal from Trevoh Chalobah wasn’t enough for 10-man Chelsea.",
      "The game meant a swift return to Old Trafford for Alejandro Garnacho, who was an unused substitute for Chelsea. The Argentina international left United under a cloud over the summer, having been placed in the so-called ‘bomb squad’ by Ruben Amorim following a falling out at the end of last season.",
      "Garnacho is therefore not a popular presence at United, despite the club earning £40million for his transfer. So Amad’s decision to post a photo of himself posing with Garnacho’s Chelsea shirt alongside his former team-mate doing the same with his United shirt didn’t go down well.",
      "His post, to his 2.4 million followers, was flooded with a torrent of comments of United fans questioning his decision. \"Can you read the room Amad?” was one of the replies. Another added: \"Not a good look Amad.” There were also plenty of swear word-filled responses.",
      "The fact that Amad and Garnacho are friends and are both represented by the same agency, Lead3rS, clearly wasn’t an acceptable reason for supporters. And Amad took the nuclear option in response, not just deleting the one post, but all of his on Instagram, as well as all but one of his posts on X.",
      "Despite not getting onto the pitch and his new team losing, Garnacho was targeted by some abusive chants on Saturday. The early dismissal of Sanchez put paid to any chance of Garnacho getting on against his old side.",

      "Manchester United star Bruno Fernandes has praised new signing Bryan Mbeumo following the Reds' thrilling 2-1 victory vs Chelsea at Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim, carrying the burden of expectation after a loss to Manchester City in their previous match, was given an early boost when Robert Sanchez of the visiting team was shown a red card for fouling Mbeumo outside his box.",
      "United quickly capitalised on their numerical advantage with Fernandes finding the back of the net, courtesy of Patrick Dorgu's headed assist. When Casemiro doubled the lead shortly before half-time, it seemed like the only question left was how many goals United would score.",
      "However, the tide turned when their Brazil midfielder was dismissed for a second yellow card offence right before the break. As expected, the game became more balanced with both teams down to ten men, but United managed to keep Chelsea at bay until Trevoh Chalobah found the net, setting up a nail-biting finale.",
      "Despite some tense moments during stoppage time, United clung on to secure the win, easing some pressure off their head coach. Mbeumo, who was given a standing ovation when he was substituted, after another impressive performance, took to Instagram to celebrate the victory after the full-time whistle.",
      "The Cameroonian star shared a snap of himself, Casemiro and Fernandes poised over a free kick, captioning it: \"Big mentality and big win today! Thanks for the fans again.\"",
      "United's long-serving captain responded to the post with a succinct three-word appraisal of Mbeumo. \"What a player,\" Fernandes commented, as the positive vibes returned to United's dressing room.",
      "Next on the agenda for Amorim's squad is a journey to Brentford, Mbeumo's former home ground, before they head back to Old Trafford a week later to face Sunderland in their last match prior to the October international break. Ahead of Sunday's contest, United found themselves in 10th place, just two points shy of the Champions League positions.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho made a frosty return to Old Trafford on Saturday evening, his first since leaving Manchester United for Chelsea in a £40 million deal last summer. The winger, who had been with United's youth teams since 2020 after transferring from Atletico Madrid, had racked up 144 appearances and netted 26 goals for United before his departure.",
      "His exit was reportedly due to a fallout with manager Ruben Amorim, and upon his return, he was met with boos from the home crowd as he disembarked the team coach and during the pre-match warm-up. Despite being named on the bench for Chelsea, Garnacho's chances of stepping back onto the Old Trafford pitch were reduced when the Blues were reduced to 10 men just five minutes into the game, following the dismissal of goalkeeper Robert Sanchez.",
      "This prompted Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca to make two early changes in an attempt to stabilise his side. However, United capitalised on their numerical advantage. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro put United 2-0 ahead after 37 minutes, though Casemiro's second yellow card meant that both teams had 10 men for the second half.",
      "Chelsea managed to pull one back through Trevoh Chalobah with just 10 minutes remaining, but United held firm to secure all three points. Garnacho remained an unused substitute throughout.",
      "While supporters didn't exactly roll out the red carpet for the former United star, it appears Garnacho received a warmer welcome from some of his old teammates.",
      "A since-deleted Instagram snap emerged showing Garnacho with United winger Amad in the Old Trafford tunnel after they'd exchanged shirts. The image was tagged by the lead3rs agency, which looks after both players.",
      "Amad featured for the entire 90 minutes, playing his part in United's crucial triumph. Following the final whistle, Chelsea manager Maresca explained why Garnacho remained on the bench throughout the encounter.",

      "Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Fabian Hurzeler has urged Carlos Baleba to remain grounded following Manchester United's summer interest in the midfielder. No transfer materialised during the window after United postponed any potential deal until next year, as Brighton priced Baleba at approximately £100million.",
      "The player was eager to make the move, but ultimately stayed on the south coast. A sluggish start to the campaign has ensued, with Hurzeler either bringing the midfielder on or taking him off in all six of their fixtures.",
      "Baleba did not even feature from the start against Bournemouth in their opening match following September's international break.",
      "A half-time substitution, which also occurred when Brighton faced Everton last month, followed during their 2-2 stalemate with Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Baleba notably picked up a knee injury in mid-July, which ruled him out for the remainder of their pre-season preparations. Hurzeler now admits that Baleba remains short of full fitness.",
      "\"Everyone has to understand with Carlos, he's a very young player,\" the Brighton head coach said. \"He needs help from us.",
      "\"He tried everything today. He only had 45 minutes in his body, and it's something that we have to accept.\"",
      "Hurzeler also responded to whether transfer speculation has affected the Cameroon international. \"It's all a lot of theory,\" he said. \"We can only guess.",
      "\"For sure, when a young boy reads that there's interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep.",
      "\"Even if he's not saying, 'It affects me,' maybe deep inside of him, there is something that affects him.",
      "\"It's even part of the development, to understand when you play well and a big club comes, to keep pushing, and to stay humble, to stay at Brighton and make the next step as a team.",
      "\"And that's something we have to keep on working with him, and so, therefore, I can't give you a clear answer if it's really affected him or not.\"",
      "United are expected to reignite their interest in Baleba going into 2026, having not given up on landing the midfielder.",

      "Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy has criticised Enzo Maresca's decision to substitute Pedro Neto during the first half of Chelsea's defeat at Manchester United, suggesting he should have kept him on if he planned to take off Cole Palmer.",
      "Chelsea arrived at Old Trafford hoping to secure their first victory there in 12 years, but their task was made significantly harder when Robert Sanchez was shown a red card in the fifth minute. Sanchez was sent off after bringing down Bryan Mbeumo, who was charging towards goal, and referee Peter Bankes didn't hesitate to show him the red card.",
      "Reacting to Sanchez's dismissal, Maresca made a double substitution, replacing both his wingers. Indeed, Estevao and Pedro Neto were substituted for backup goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen and Tosin Adarabioyo.",
      "After Bruno Fernandes put United ahead with a close-range finish, Maresca made another defensive change, replacing an apparently injured Cole Palmer with Andrey Santos.",
      "However, this change didn't pay off, as Casemiro doubled United's lead in the 37th minute before receiving a red card himself for a second bookable offence.",
      "This left both teams with 10 players for the entire second half, but Maresca's decision to substitute three of his four attackers within the first 21 minutes made Chelsea's task of overturning a 2-0 deficit virtually impossible.",
      "Despite a late goal from Trevoh Chalobah, it was too little too late for Chelsea as they suffered their first Premier League defeat of the season, losing 2-1 and extending their miserable run in Manchester.",
      "On Match of the Day, Murphy gave his analysis of Chelsea's performance and offered some advice to Maresca on how he could have better handled the situation.",
      "Murphy commented: \"I think bringing an extra defender on was understandable, taking off an attacker, but then a few minutes later and Palmer is off once they're 1-0 down.",
      "\"We felt that Neto and Cole Palmer coming off was a really negative move.",
      "\"Ok we trust his word that he's struggling with a bit of an injury, but then maybe bring him off at the beginning and leave Neto on for his pace because even when they got level men in the second-half they didn't have that much of a threat, only Joao Pedro had that forward thinking mentality.\"",
      "Maresca explained his decision to substitute Neto and Estevao early in the game during his post-match press conference: \"The reason why we changed Pedro [Neto] and Estevao [Willian] was because they attack with the five players always, and we defend with the four, and we can defend with the four when we are 11 vs 11.",
      "\"But 11 against them, I think we need to defend on the width, so we decided to go with the back five, this is the reason why.\"",

      "The time has come for Ruben Amorim to put his faith in Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "United are five games into the new Premier League season and Mainoo has yet to start any of them, the midfielder having played just 76 minutes coming off the bench.",
      "An unused substitute in the first two league games, Mainoo's only start was in United's humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Even when Amorim deviated from his preferred central midfield pairing of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes for the 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, dropping the former, Mainoo was overlooked, with Manuel Ugarte getting the nod ahead of him.",
      "The irony of that decision is that when Mainoo eventually did come on at the Etihad Stadium, just after the hour mark, he brought more energy and mobility to United's midfield, underlining the folly of Amorim's decision to start the hapless Ugarte over him.",
      "Now, with Casemiro suspended for Saturday's lunchtime trip to Brentford following his sending off in Saturday's chaotic 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford, Amorim has a major selection dilemma in midfield - whether to start Mainoo or Ugarte.",
      "Given Amorim has insisted he will continue to deploy skipper Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, despite it not playing to his attacking strengths, it seems a straight choice between Mainoo and Ugarte as to who partners him in the middle.",
      "Given Mainoo is not a holding midfielder and defensive duties are not second nature to him, it seems inevitable that Amorim will go with Ugarte for the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium, to give United greater security and a ball-winning mentality in the middle.",
      "Another option would be to play both Mainoo and Ugarte in central midfield, but given Amorim's reluctance to play Fernandes further forward and therefore displace one of his first-choice front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – all big-money summer signings – that scenario seems unlikely.",
      "Mainoo's desire to go out on loan before transfer deadline day, because of a lack of playing time, was entirely understandable, even if it gave the impression of a player with a questionable mentality, unwilling to prove himself and meet the challenge to fight for his place.",
      "At 19, Mainoo started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain but was not even included in Thomas Tuchel's latest Three Lions squad because of his outcast status at United. In a World Cup year, Mainoo's fear that he will miss out on next summer's tournament in the US is entirely justified, if Amorim continues to overlook him.",
      "The Brentford game, therefore, is the perfect platform for Amorim to show he means it when he says he “believes in” Mainoo as a player, even though he has pointed out the young prodigy still has to improve in many areas, not least in his defensive mindset, tracking back and positional discipline.",
      "But on Saturday, with Casemiro unavailable and Mainoo relishing the chance to start a first league game of the season, Amorim has the opportunity to change the dynamic of United's team. Given Amorim's pragmatism and unwillingness to change from his formation and personnel, Mainoo is primed for more disappointment, but starting him may be the bold step that can finally kickstart United's season.",

      "Twenty-four years ago, almost to the day, I started covering Manchester United.",
      "The 2001-02 season was to be the last of Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious reign, having announced his intention to retire at the end of that campaign.",
      "A new manager would be installed and a new era would begin, for both United and myself. That was until Fergie's retirement U-turn at Christmas 2001, which saw him stay in charge for another 11 years, and with it for me came numerous run-ins with and bans from the man recognised as arguably the greatest manager of all time.",
      "Since Fergie retired in 2013, another five permanent managers – David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag – have tried and failed to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim is the sixth permanent boss to try to restore United to the status of champions, a task that seems more onerous than ever following last season's 15th-placed finish, the club's lowest for 51 years.",
      "But one thing I have learned, over nearly a quarter of a century of covering United, following them all over the world – Europe, America, Asia and South Africa – is that their global appeal is as strong as ever, even if they have failed to win the Premier League or Champions League for more than a decade.",
      "The old adage from United fans – 'Hated, adored, never ignored' – has never been more pertinent. In times of success, in times of crisis, no other team in the world comes close to matching United's enduring worldwide appeal, even in lean times such as now, as evidenced by the 75,000 fans who continue to fill Old Trafford every time they play.",
      "Covering a club of United's stature for so long has been a privilege, watching them play week in, week out, getting close up to and on first-name terms with some of the greatest managers and players of the modern era, not always seeing eye-to-eye with them, as is the nature of the business.",
      "I was in the tiny press conference room at United's training ground when Fergie flew into a rage over questions about Juan Sebastian Veron, cutting short his press conference and storming out, but not before delivering the infamous line: “Veron's a f****** great player, youse are f****** idiots!”",
      "Fergie may have been known for his legendary 'hairdryer' treatment, but there was a lighter side to him, such as the time the Mirror carried a front page story about the team's training sessions being filmed by a spy plane flying overhead.",
      "When I asked Fergie about the plane at the next press conference, he burst into laughter. “I saw you flying it,” joked Fergie, putting his hands upside down to impersonate a pair of flying goggles. “I could see you up there in your Biggles hat and goggles. Biggles McDonnell, Biggles of the Mirror!”",
      "Fergie's successor, Moyes, banned me from press conferences because I refused to stop leaking his starting line-ups, sometimes five or six hours before games, until he was dismissed before the end of his first season in charge of United.",
      "On the pitch, including Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, friendlies and pre-season matches, I reckon I have racked up more than 1,000 games covering United, and been privileged to be at some momentous occasions, including the 2008 Champions League final penalty shootout win over Chelsea in Moscow, where the relentless rain made it feel like home for the travelling United fans.",
      "Other highlights include United's epic derby duels with local rivals City, notably the 4-3 win for Fergie's side in 2009, which came courtesy of a dramatic 90th minute winner from Michael Owen, and not forgetting Wayne Rooney's stunning bicycle kick to beat the Blues 2-1 at the Theatre of Dreams two years later.",
      "I was also privileged to report on Rooney's United debut, back in 2004, when the then raw 18-year-old forward, who had taken Euro 2004 by storm, announced himself as a Red with a sublime hat-trick in a 6-2 win over Fenerbahce at Old Trafford, the first goals that would lead to him becoming the club's all-time leading scorer.",
      "As well as covering the highs for United over the past 24 years, there have also been some major lows, not least their 6-1 home defeat to City in 2011, the season in which the Blues went on to win the title from Fergie's men on goal difference on the final day.",
      "There were two Champions League final defeats to Pep Guardiola's peerless Barcelona and, more recently, with United mired in an ongoing identity crisis, many crushing losses, such as the 7-0 defeat to arch rivals Liverpool at Anfield two years ago under Ten Hag.",
      "But there is a reason United remain one of the biggest draws in world football, even when they have been unable to compete for major trophies in the past decade, and that is because of their rich history, stretching back to the Munich tragedy and the rebirth of the team under Sir Matt Busby, to the unprecedented era of success overseen by Ferguson.",
      "I hope to do the same as I begin this new chapter.",

      "Despite Casemiro being sent off in the fifth minute of first-half stoppage time, United managed to hold on, even though Trevoh Chalobah reduced the deficit with 10 minutes remaining.",
      "This win alleviates some of the pressure that had been mounting on Amorim following their loss to Manchester City in the derby. They now look ahead to away and home matches against Brentford and Sunderland respectively, before their next significant challenge - a trip to Anfield to face Premier League leaders Liverpool after the October international break.",
      "As September draws to a close, the winter transfer window looms ever closer, despite the summer market having closed just four weeks ago.

      "Manchester United youngster Chido Obi has sent a clear reminder of his quality to Ruben Amorim as he continued his rich vein of form in front of goal for the Under-21s.",

      "The teenager has played in all four of United’s Premier League 2 games. Having started the previous two games and scored in both, Obi was again in the starting lineup for the game against Liverpool U21s on Sunday.",
      "With United 1-0 down heading towards half time, Obi got himself on the scoresheet before the interval. That goal started the comeback which was completed by full-back Jaydan Kamason in the 81st minute as United came out as 2-1 winners.",

      "Speaking to Stadium Astro, Jones said: \"Kobbie is a player that I really admire. I loved watching him come into the team, and I remember his performance at Everton away, his first start. He absolutely bossed the game. He was terrific that night. It was a mature performance, and he carried on that season.",
      "\"It just looks like at the minute he’s out of favour. The manager’s already come out and stated that he’s not going to be playing with Bruno. You’re not going to dislodge Bruno in the form that he’s in.",
      "\"He’s going to find it difficult for games. I think by Christmas and January time, if he’s not had the game time that he’ll like, then I’m sure he’ll be trying to force a loan move.\"",

The Red Devils' head coach had overseen the club's lowest Premier League finish on record last term (15th) and has been questioned over the failings of his system.",
      "Doubts only increased after United were well-beaten at rivals Manchester City on September 14, which came not long after their humiliating League Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town.

      "It's been a busy day of Manchester United news and transfer gossip!",
      "Not to mention, there has been plenty of reaction to United's win over Chelsea in the Premier League yesterday.",
      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba has been sent a message by his manager, Fabian Hurzeler, amid reported interest from Manchester United.",
      "United were heavily linked with signing Baleba during the summer transfer window, but a move never materialised amid rumours that Brighton were demanding a fee in excess of £100million.",

      "Speaking to MUTV, the Turkish goalkeeper explained:",
      "[In the] first 45 minutes, I can say more. For me it was more difficult because when you don't have any position, you are getting cold, in this weather. It's raining and you have to keep your mind focused for every second because in the game, anything can happen. I [am happy I] did this and we are happy because we won. We are working every day for every position, but sometimes you can be unlucky in the game. Sometimes, players [are] doing blocks and it's a foul. It doesn't matter how strong you are, you cannot go to the ball. If someone will be here, you cannot move, it's difficult and in all of the [Premier] League, referees are not saying it is a foul for the disposition, so we have to improve ourselves for everything, for every situation. That's what we are doing every day in the training and today was good.",

      "\"It just looks like at the minute he’s out of favour. The manager’s already come out and stated that he’s not going to be playing with Bruno. It’s going to be him or the other and you’re not going to dislodge Bruno in the form that he’s in and the way that he carries the team at times with his assists and goals.",
      "\"So, he’s going to find it difficult for games and United aren’t in any European competitions this season. So, there’s not another competition that he might have got some game time in.",

      "Football Insider are the latest outlet to claim finances are playing a role in Ruben Amorim remaining in charge at United. They are reportedly reluctant to sack their head coach because it would cost them an eight-figure fee, and paying out his two-and-a-half-year contract is not part of their plans."

The former Sporting boss has endured a difficult first year in England, and he's recorded just two wins in United's opening five Premier League matches this term.",
      "Reports in Portugal suggested that Joao Noronha Lopes, a candidate in next month's Benfica presidential election, admires Amorim. The 40-year-old head coach was said to feature on his list of potential managerial candidates.",

      "Keane scolded Shaw after United's 3-0 defeat to City last week, claiming he \"gave up\" for Phil Foden's opening goal before suggesting the defender \"has been getting away with murder for years\" at the club.",
      "Shaw, 30, is into his 12th year at United and has started in all five of their Premier League games this term as the left-sided centre back in Ruben Amorim's back three.",
      "Amorim billed Shaw as \"world-class\" during pre-season but the England international has endured an injury-plagued career at United since he joined the club from Southampton for £31million in 2014. Shaw started a meagre 27 games across the 2023-24 and 2024-25 campaigns.",
      "Keane, who spent just over 12 years at United and won seven Premier League titles, has been vocal in his criticism as a pundit but was particularly scathing of Shaw at the Etihad.",
      "\"I think people have opinions,\" Shaw said. \"Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin. He’s got a lot of experience, he was one of the best captains ever for Manchester United and, of course, it hurts. But for me criticism is part of being a football player. I listen to it but I think he was right.",
      "\"Last week, I wasn’t at my level at all and I don’t need Roy Keane to tell me. After the game, I knew that. But of course it hurts. The most important thing is knowing how good I can be and I think the manager knows that and the managers who I played under in the past know that.",
      "\"I’m always in the team, I’m always playing, so there must be something the managers [see and] must believe in me. I’m not getting any younger and I need to be consistent, I’ve had lots of ups and downs and it’s about keeping that consistently high level because I know I can do that.",

      "United seemed set for a comfortable win until Casemiro was dismissed in added time of the first half and Trevoh Chalobah threatened a Chelsea comeback with an 80th-minute header.",
      "Although the victory could have been more emphatic, Shaw was just relieved that United held on for three points. \"Yeah, I think relief. I think it just shows how much in the second half we were just thinking about surviving and not losing the game and trying to do everything we can to win the game.",
      "\"And I think that’s where we sat off more. We weren’t proactive, weren’t aggressive, but I think that’s where we're at at the moment. We knew how important it was to win the game today, extremely important, and that’s where our mentality is at right now.",
      "\"We just thought about defending for our lives and making sure we won this game. There are things we can improve on but we have to be happy with the three points, that’s the most important thing.\"",
      "Although United were reduced to defending their lead, they were dominant in an electric first half that Shaw insists has to be the benchmark for the rest of the season.",
      "\"I think it has to be the level,\" he agreed. \"I think it was really important to start well today, start fast, bring the crowd with us, especially after a disappointing result last week.",
      "\"It was vital to start quick today and we did that and we forced them into the mistake and it’s about being more and more clinical in front of goal. There have been a lot of things we have done well not just today, but this whole season, and we just have to keep on pushing, keep on working hard in training and things will evolve.\"",
      "Shaw expected Casemiro, the eldest player on the pitch, to be disappointed following his two yellow cards. \"I’m sure he is,\" Shaw added. \"He’s an extremely experienced player, I think he’ll be disappointed but it’s not individuals, it’s a team effort. I’ve not been in there since the final whistle, but I’m sure he’ll know.\"",

      "Instead of walking across the pitch when replaced by Leny Yoro, referee Peter Bankes instructed him to leave it at the nearest point.",
      "Maguire's route went behind the back of the goal that Chelsea defended during the second half. While walking around, he technically broke one of the Premier League rules, cheekily kicking a ball off one of the cones as it rolled towards the stand.",
      "Two replacement balls are on top of cones behind each goal line in line with the 18-yard box.",

      "They add that \"adherence to the relevant rules and guidance is of vital importance to maintain consistency and, crucially, to ensure that home clubs do not gain a competitive advantage through their misuse of the system.\"",

      "Manchester United youngster Chido Obi has sent a clear reminder of his quality to Ruben Amorim as he continued his rich vein of form in front of goal for the Under-21s. The striker has found it hard to break into the first team picture this season, having been on the fringes of Amorim's squad towards the end of last season.",
      "So far this season, the 17-year-old striker has not featured in a matchday squad for Amorim’s first team squad, returning to development squad action.",
      "The teenager has played in all four of United’s Premier League 2 games. Having started the previous two games and scored in both, Obi was again in the starting lineup for the game against Liverpool U21s on Sunday.",
      "With United 1-0 down heading towards half time, Obi got himself on the scoresheet before the interval. That goal started the comeback which was completed by full-back Jaydan Kamason in the 81st minute as United came out as 2-1 winners.",
      "The latest goal should serve as a reminder to Amorim of what the teenager can do, especially given United’s strikers' struggles so far this season.",
      "Neither of United’s two recognised strikers, Benjamin Sesko or Joshua Zirkzee, has appeared on the scoresheet in any of their five Premier League games.",
      "If Obi continues to score for the U21s, it could force Amorim to give the striker another opportunity in the first team. The youngster has been assigned squad number 32 for United this season, replacing the squad number 56 he wore last year.",
      "The game against Liverpool also saw summer signing Diego Leon start for the first time for the club since making the move from Cerro Porteno in Paraguay back in July. The left-back played 45 minutes of the game as he continues his adaptation to English football.",

      "Not even two years have passed since Alejandro Garnacho scored a sensational overhead kick to power Manchester United to a 3-0 victory over Everton.",
      "The strike was a goal of season winner as soon as it crashed into the net and at that stage it seemed the winger was destined to have a key role for years to come at Old Trafford.",
      "Six months later he scored in the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City and his future at United seemed as bright as his wonder goal.",
      "Yet this weekend he will trot out at Old Trafford in the blue of Chelsea having found himself ostracised by Ruben Amorim at United. He's gone from being talked about as having United parallels with Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, to being discarded having trained with a 'bomb squad'.",
      "Amorim did not even want to talk about him in his pre-match press conference and it is clear the head coach did not value the Argentina international, who criticised the manager's decision to omit him from the starting XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "That was the final straw in a tormented relationship between the pair and from that moment on it was a case of when the 21-year-old would leave, not if.",
      "Chelsea were long-term admirers and swooped in the closing days of the transfer window. The Blues considered the £40million fee a bargain price given Garnacho's ability, experience and high ceiling, and wanted additional competition for Jamie Gittens on the left flank.",
      "He's made only two substitute appearances since his move but could start against United. Blues boss Enzo Maresca has spoken positively of Garnacho and he played a part in Moises Caicedo's goal against Brentford last time out.",
      "The questions over his attitude while at United are not a concern at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea reporter for Football London, Bobby Vincent, pointed to the comparison between Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, who spent last season on loan at the club from United, as evidence of the Blues being able to get the best out of mercurial players.",
      "\"Like all things, it (his attitude) would have been considered when Chelsea were initially exploring a move for him,\" he said. \"Maresca worked with Jadon Sancho last season, who had similar complaints surrounding him, but from what I understand, Sancho worked really well during his time at Chelsea and the club were impressed with the winger's work ethic and professionalism.\"",
      "Yet Garnacho still has some work to do to win over the supporters, with Vincent adding: \"The fans are very much still split on his signing. It seems, though, most of them were encouraged by his cameo in Brentford. He has plenty to prove to the fans - let's put it that way.\"",
      "He will have plenty to prove to himself, too, particularly on his return to Manchester on Saturday evening.",
      "One man who knew him well coming through the ranks at Old Trafford was former United Under-21 boss Neil Wood.",
      "\"Garna' has got talent, some of the choices he has done off the pitch might have not helped him,\" said Wood, when speaking to the MEN earlier this year. \"A bit of immaturity maybe, but it is a shame to see it. A couple of those things can be easily stopped, whether it is a bit of education.",
      "\"He is not a bad lad or a bad guy but his choices have not helped him. He needs to get back to concentrating on his football and let that do the talking.\"",
      "We will see who has the last word come Saturday night.",

      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games, we just have to maintain the way we are playing but improving on the opponent’s box and our box.",

Then, again, I said after the last game, the way we suffer the goals, we can avoid it. We are being naive and we need to be more aggressive to win games. We just need to maintain how we are playing, with improving in the opponent's box and our box. That was the focus of the week, especially with Chelsea, which is a team that crosses they have more guys in the box and we suffer a little bit against Fulham and we work a lot during the week on that. It's always the same cycle. Analyse what we did and improve for the next week.",

      "Scott McTominay is officially the 18th best player in world football. He’s better than Jude Bellingham. He’s better than Erling Haaland. He’s better than Virgil van Dijk. He’s sure as sh*t better than any Manchester United player.",
      "Perhaps Rio Ferdinand should reflect on how after one season away from Old Trafford, he’s better than Declan Rice and only slightly worse than Harry Kane, who may not have been the pairing to cure all of United’s ills after all.",
      "In fairness to Ferdinand, he was against United selling McTominay to Napoli, although his steady Eddie reasoning hasn’t aged well after the Scot was named Serie A MVP in his debut season under Antonio Conte.",
      "“I look at Scott McTominay and not every player can be a star, a standout player,” Ferdinand said. “But to win the league you need the likes of John O’Shea, Wes Brown, Darren Fletcher.",
      "“They might not start every game but they were huge, you need those players and most of them know the DNA of the club, especially ones who have come through the academy, there’s a lot to be said for that. It really doesn’t sit well with me.",
      "“With McTominay you know what you’re getting. He might not always be a nine out of 10 but invariably he’s a solid seven out of 10 and sometimes he will be an eight out of 10 and get you a goal.”",
      "But the pundit recently fell into a trap which has claimed many a Manchester United stakeholder in the last decade or so, in claiming that issues can be solved by spending a couple of hundred million on two very good footballers.",
      "“I honestly think and I’m convinced that if Man United would have got Harry Kane and Declan Rice in that window, they’re in a different place now. It goes back to the environment, those two drive an environment I think because they’re two top pros.”",
      "There’s no doubt that Kane and Rice improve Manchester United, but Tottenham finished eighth in Kane’s last season for them despite his 30 goals in that campaign. Rice led West Ham to the Conference League title but a 14th-place Premier League finish. There’s only so much one man can do for a football club failing to meet expectations, or in this specific Ferdinand-imagined case, what two men can do at Manchester United.",
      "And based on the admittedly arbitrary Ballon d’Or ranking of all footballers in every position which sees McTominay placed between Rice in 27th and Kane in 13th, neither of those potential saviours would have had anything like the impact for the Red Devils that they’re currently having at Arsenal and Bayern Munich respectively.",

But we just kept believing in what we wanted to do and in our game plan, our processes.”",

It goes one of two ways, either sparking a necessary period of collective and individual self-analysis or feeding into what seems to be a sort of victim mentality which has been allowed to fester at Villa Park.",
      "There is an increasing divide between those backing Emery and others who believe him to be the problem and removing him at least part of the solution.",

      "Baleba has now been substituted at half-time in two of those starts, while being taken off in the quadruple substitution which triggered that exceptional win over Manchester City.",
      "Against Spurs it was he who surrendered possession in the build-up to the first goal and while Fabian Hurzeler ought to engage in a little more introspection when it comes to carelessly dropping points when leading at home, the manager was right in his assessment of Baleba: he’s “not a machine” and it’s Brighton’s “responsibility” to help him.",
      "",
      "An inability to see out games has been a consistent issue for Brentford these past couple of seasons. No team dropped more points from winning positions than their 30 in 2023/24, and last season only four had a worse record when ahead.",
      "This season has seen Brentford already drop as many points from winning positions (eight) as in the entirety of their first campaign in the Premier League. What was once a key strength has become a glaring weakness.",
      "And the problem with appointing a continuity candidate with no prior senior management experience is that they will struggle to change those aspects of a club’s identity. Indeed, the nature of his promotion only encouraged Brentford to maintain rather than evolve.",
      "In the face of adversity these players will lean into the long throws, the set-pieces and back fives because it’s what they know. But there remains doubt as to whether Andrews has the tactical acumen to override that muscle memory and imprint his own style.",
      "",
      "That is 58 visits to Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United in the Premier League without a single win, obviously only propagated by Everton having just three extra minutes in which they could at no point look like scoring.",

      "And nine times out of ten that performance would have been good enough for a win. But it does not take a vivid imagination to see how games against Real Betis, Sunderland, Midtjylland, Newcastle, Chelsea, Porto and Bournemouth cause things to suddenly spiral before November.",
      "Arsenal and their flawed manager dominate the narrative but there’s plenty to be said about Aston Villa too.",
      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "After spending over £200m on new players over the summer, Man Utd failed to improve their midfield, which was seen as key area they needed to improve by many fans and pundits.",
      "They were briefly linked with Brighton midfielder Calos Baleba but that serious interest is likely to be acted upon next summer at the earliest with Brighton demanding a huge fee.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim was criticised for publicly suggesting Mainoo wouldn’t be starting for the Red Devils unless it was at the expense of Fernandes.",
      "That led to the Red Devils attempting to persuade Mainoo to stay and not pursue a loan move away in the final days of the transfer window.",
      "READ: Rashford dropped by Barcelona for repeating Man Utd mistake days after Newcastle brace",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League match this season with the England international making three substitute appearances and now Football Insider claim that Man Utd ‘would be willing to part’ with Mainoo in the winter window if they sign a replacement.",
      "And Football Insider‘s transfer correspondent Pete O’Rourke added: “If he’s not playing regularly under Ruben Amorim, he might be keen on a move away, which was seemingly the case this summer.",
      "“I just think it’s a difficult deal to do because United don’t really want to lose him. And obviously if United are to sanction a move from him, it would only be if they could bring in a replacement in midfield.",

      "Scholes said last week: “No I can’t [understand the situation]. He came onto the scene a couple of years ago and I thought ‘Wow, what a player’.",
      "“His legs have been questioned, but go back to that game yesterday and it’s not all about that, they had plenty of possession. Bruno Fernandes can be fine in central midfield when he has hold of the ball.",
      "“When you are playing against better teams, there are times when you’re not going to have the ball, and that’s when you have to know the position brilliantly. Every manager is clever these days, and Pep is the very best at getting people in behind his midfield. He had Foden doing it and Bernardo doing it.",
      "“He had Doku coming inside. I’ve been there myself, you’re constantly looking over your shoulder, thinking where is my man, it’s a horrible place to be at times. If you’re on the ball all the time, then Fernandes is brilliant [in deeper midfield].",
      "“Now Kobbie Mainoo is the same I think on the ball, he can be fantastic, but he needs a proper partner next to him. I don’t think Ugarte… he’s got the legs but doesn’t have the quality.",
      "“We know Casemiro had the quality over the years but he’s slowed down now. Again, I look at my career, I wasn’t the greatest in that position, I didn’t know it brilliantly well, but the guy next to me always did.",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who only really has misery and Graham Potter for company.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",

      "Even after five wins from five games there is a small yet irritatingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but that voice won’t quit.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",

      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal are broadly unscathed, yet it also does feel like they’re already playing catch-up from that all-too-familiar second place. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",

      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brought back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "It’s not been awful, but it’s really not been great either. Being above Manchester United is not the boast it used to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there could be more on the wagon.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone – draws with Burnley less so – but it is an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening five games to go with a creditable draw against Newcastle is plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "Bleak fare indeed, and you do wonder whether Emery might now be minded to take any opportunity to jump ship that comes his way before his reputation starts to sink with Villa’s league position.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "There is some good news, though, because Wolves have a much-needed appointment scheduled with Dr Tottenham this weekend.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. The 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea is not a turning point; they’ve run out of those.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what four defeats in the opening five games will do to you after a summer where little went right for West Ham.",
      "Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that. Then any hint of renewed optimism was dashed by grim  flaw-exposing defeats to Tottenham and Crystal Palace.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "Amorim *could* do some coaching like Slot has done to transform a Liverpool star into ‘the best in the world’. The Man Utd boss has an opportunity vs Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘might not even be in his job’ if Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘hadn’t appointed him’ as Man Utd boss and the Chelsea win is ‘no turning point’.",
      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",
      "Paul Merson has made a prediction relating to Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, while Wayne Rooney has raised one “big question” about the game vs Chelsea.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has made three significant decisions for Manchester United’s game against Chelsea on Saturday evening.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United stars ‘privately’ gave a ‘withering verdict’ on Alejandro Garnacho before he joined Chelsea in the summer."

      "After a game in which Manchester United fans roundly booed a player they very recently considered one of their greatest hopes for the future, a number of them took a step towards ostracising a new great hope by abusing them on social media for their association with that most abominable defector.",
      "“Who’s that t*** from Argentina? Who’s that money-grabbing w**re” was the chant aimed at Alejandro Garnacho by the Red Devils faithful, all of whom will have no doubt sung ‘Viva Garnacho’ in earnest throughout a Manchester United career which, lest we forget, was cut short by Ruben Amorim, not Garnacho himself.",
      "Sure, Garnacho described the season as “sh*t” when asked for his assessment after being dropped for the Europa League final. But not one single United fan will have disagreed with that. And it was Amorim who told Garnacho in front of his teammates ahead of the final league game of the season that “you better pray you can find a new club to sign you”. He may well be a “money-grabbing w**re”, but he was given no option but to leave United.",
      "We understand some hostility on the basis of Garnacho wearing Marcus Rashford’s Aston Villa shirt, which was an absurdly childish means to wind up the club which was still paying his wages, but the decision had already been made by that point. He was never going to play for United again.",
      "Garnacho’s unforgivable crime was not being in the plans of a manager whose Old Trafford tenure is still widely deemed to be doomed despite the win over Chelsea, largely because of his failure to waver from a philosophy and formation unsuited to the vast majority of the players still in his squad, let alone those like Garnacho who have already escaped it.",
      "The 21-year-old was denied the opportunity to further rile with a goal and we suspect what would have been a badge-kissing celebration, but the Garnacho-obsessed United fans didn’t skip a post-match opportunity to make their confused feelings felt, when they piled on Amad Diallo for swapping shirts with the Argentinian.",
      "Amad was seen hugging Garnacho at full-time, like you or I might do when meeting a pal, before later posting a picture on Instagram of him and his former teammate smiling and posing with one another’s shirts, quite possibly under the instruction of Lead3rS, the agency which represents both of them.",
      "The more P.C. responses from United fans to the post, reported by The Sun, included ‘Amad is an idiot’, ‘Amad doing this sh*t after dropping a stinker’ and ‘can you read the room Amad?’ We don’t know how extensive and unpleasant the reaction was, though we can guess as the result was Amad deleting that post, all other Instagram posts and all but one on X.",
      "Our question to United fans is a simple one: Why do you care? The only effect of abusing Amad for being friends with Garnacho is to alienate another young player.",
      "It would have been unthinkable a year ago for Garnacho and fellow ‘untouchable’ Rasmus Hojlund to be playing elsewhere this season, while a third in Kobbie Mainoo looks for an exit. Amad was last season’s brightest spark, and is now being presented with reasons to think a future away from United is an attractive prospect by fans who can’t help but stick the boot in where it’s not needed.",
      "The switch from unadulterated love for Garnacho to pure hatred is weird enough, but for that remarkable feelings U-turn to extend to anyone who comes into contact with him is absolutely ridiculous.",
      "Enzo Maresca has explained why he decided to leave Chelsea without an attack through his substitutions in their defeat to Manchester United on Saturday.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United stars ‘privately’ gave a ‘withering verdict’ on Alejandro Garnacho before he joined Chelsea in the summer.",
      "A new report has revealed how Alejandro Garnacho and Ruben Amorim’s ‘relationship unravelled’, with an ‘intervention’ involving three Man Utd stars failing.",
      "Maresca dismissed suggestions he selected a weak Chelsea team with Bayern Munich in mind, while Garnacho is blamed for ‘falling asleep’.",
      "Chelsea needed a half-fit Cole Palmer to spark them into life at Brentford. But Alejandro Garnacho went to sleep on the Bees’ biggest weapon…",
      "It has been claimed that Chelsea could ‘almost immediately agree’ a mega-money transfer after signing Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United."

      "Manchester United’s victory over Chelsea on Saturday has relieved the mounting pressure on Ruben Amorim’s shoulders a touch, and he will no doubt take the win as a notch on his bedpost of obstinacy, but after Arne Slot turned a Liverpool star into one of the best, if not the best, in a previously alien position, Kobbie Mainoo must be wondering why a supposedly excellent coach can’t do the same for him.",
      "Mainoo was introduced in the 87th minute to see out United’s victory over Chelsea, and showed his worth to the team even in that short cameo, winning a corner in stoppage time to put the nail in the Blues’ coffin, having illustrated it far more evidently in the defeat to Manchester City as the Red Devils’ best player on the day after coming off the bench.",
      "The 20-year-old is yet to start a Premier League game this season, featuring for just 76 minutes in total, having been denied a loan exit at the end of the transfer window in search of more game time and amid rumours of January moves from various high-grade suitors.",
      "Amorim’s contention is that he can’t play Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in his double pivot. The United captain’s display against Chelsea served as a timely reminder as to why he remains so crucial to the Red Devils after an inauspicious start to the season.",
      "But Casemiro’s experience was no match for his stupidity and he is now suspended for their next game after his red card, and although Manuel Ugarte put in one of his better performances as his replacement in midfield at half-time, the Uruguayan’s very low bar suggests Amorim should at least be tempted to play Mainoo alongside his captain against Brentford next time out.",
      "Because while Amorim may currently feel as though he’s ill-suited to the role, and we don’t necessarily disagree, it is also possible for a coach to coach a footballer – particularly one so young and seemingly open to developing and adapting his game – into playing a new position.",
      "Just as Slot has done with Ryan Gravenberch, who was once again outstanding for Liverpool in their 2-1 win over Everton on Saturday, leading Michael Owen to question whether there is a better No.6 in the world right now.",
      "“He is seriously talented,” Owen said. “He can do anything. I love him in the sitting number six role. It just shows you can push him forward, and he can still have a big influence.",
      "“I look around the world at the moment at midfield players and I think, Who is better than him? Who is performing better than him? I don’t see many at all. I think, he is one of the finds of the last season or so.”",
      "He was heavily linked with the Liverpool exit in the summer of 2024, and if the Reds had landed Martin Zubimendi after having an offer accepted for the now Arsenal No.6, there’s a very good chance Gravenberch wouldn’t still be at the club.",
      "But in a situation very similar to the one being experienced by Amorim at United after they failed to sign Brighton’s Carlos Baleba or an alternative midfielder this summer, Slot was pushed into playing Gravenberch as a square peg in that round hole, and the Netherlands international is now perfectly spherical having adapted in stunning fashion.",
      "“Not just this season, he’s been playing like that from the moment last season started,” Virgil Van Dijk said after the win over Everton. “He’s unbelievable. He’s very important to the way we play.",
      "“You see the amount of times I try to look for him. It benefits him, me and the team. He’s in incredible shape. He’s in the form of his life. He has to keep going. He’s still young.",
      "“During his first season here he hardly played either. Listen, it’s a mix of everything: getting confidence, progressing and improving as a player, playing games at the highest level and knowing your role in the team.",
      "“I’m very pleased for him because he puts in a lot of hard work to do what he is doing.”",
      "We understand that a Mainoo-Fernandes partnership isn’t ideal, but nothing is at United right now, and if Slot can turn a negative into such a huge positive, why can’t Amorim?",
      "He’s concerned his players will lose respect for him if he wavers from his philosophy and formation, but surely the absolute opposite would be true if they witness him coaching one of the most talented footballers in the squad to operate in a role which – let’s face it – is hardly light and day to the one Mainoo thrived in for United and England last season.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Premier League Sack Race. But who will be next? Not much cover for Ruben Amorim now…",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘might not even be in his job’ if Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘hadn’t appointed him’ as Man Utd boss and the Chelsea win is ‘no turning point’.",

      "That pressure has now been transferred to Enzo Maresca, who’s been criticised for his reaction to Robert Sanchez’s early red card, which saw him take off Estevao for goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen and swap out Pedro Neto for Tosin Adarabioyo, before Cole Palmer’s niggle forced him off for Andrey Santos.",
      "Explaining his decisions, Maresca said: “The reason why we changed Pedro and Estevao was because they attack with the five players always.",
      "“And we defend with the four, and we can defend with the four when we are 11 vs 11, but 11 against 10, I think we need to defend with the width, so we decided to go with the back-five, this is the reason why.",
      "“And then the other one, Garna, he was ready to go on, but then Wes[ley Fofana] asked for the change, because he was tired after a long time, so we changed and we decided to go for Tyrique [George], and the idea was to give Garnacho minutes.”",
      "Asked if the crowd’s negative reaction to Garnacho warming up had any impact, Maresca insisted: “No, no, no. He was ready, I sent him for the warm up and he was ready but then Wes asked for the change so we decided to go with Malo.”",
      "Danny Murphy told BBC’s Match of the Day that he thought Maresca’s substitutions were “really negative”.",

      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",
      "It was an inexplicable game from the Chelsea coach who seemed to think there were no problems in publicly discussing afterwards how his panicking basically consigned them to defeat from as early as the fifth minute.",
      "Perhaps he owed Amorim a favour and wanted to ease the situation Manchester United.",
      "",
      "1) From openly defying hypothetical papal tactical demands one day to actively personifying the ‘call an ambulance…but not for me’ meme the next, it feels like whatever ultimately comes of this absurd reign of Ruben Amorim he has at least embraced the innate box-officeness of a Portuguese Manchester United manager.",
      "These are still foundations built out of water on a bouncy castle made from quicksand while wearing a blindfold and boxing gloves, but that Manchester United supporter is as close as he has ever been to getting a haircut and Amorim is delivering with interest on the promise he made upon his appointment.",
      "",
      "2) It should have been considerably easier. As the first half reached a crescendo of ludicrousness it became a case study in the importance of confidence in elite sport.",
      "These are ultra athletes who have every microscopic detail of the game fine-tuned by the finest minds around. But while Manchester United had the advantage in terms of numbers it was little more than 11 players with a collective belief surging through them against ten disjointed, shell-shocked individuals trying to survive.",
      "That sort of momentum never carries through over 90 minutes and it is crucial to adjust to those shifts in energy. It would have done Manchester United the world of good to win by three or four goals but the fortitude they displayed to hold on might actually be more beneficial in the long run.",
      "",
      "3) Even for Amorim personally it was far better game management than usual.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was unfortunate to be sacrificed at half-time but Manuel Ugarte helped ensure the midfield battle remained even on one of his better performances. Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro were more like-for-like replacements which introduced fresh legs. And Bruno Fernandes coming off was surprising, even before taking into account who was replacing him.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is still having his minutes bizarrely rationed but a cameo in which he won a free-kick and a corner while running down the clock was encouraging. He brought belated control to a game defined by chaos.",
      "",
      "4) Enzo Maresca, as the scriptures dictate, must adopt the crisis baton. And good lord was this a full-blown mid-life crisis.",
      "Robert Sanchez being sent off in the fifth minute was not ideal. Being critical, Robert Sanchez playing at all for a player trading entity which has spent £427billion on signings in the last three years is sub-optimal.",
      "But we’re splitting hairs and never has a single human been more bald than when Maresca responded by removing two of his forwards to chuck on a keeper and another centre-half, thus shedding more than a quarter of his starting XI within seven minutes of kick off.",
      "It does appear that an injury had befallen Cole Palmer, who himself was removed in the 21st. Yet Maresca himself said after the game that the England international had undergone fitness tests in the morning and “was not 100%”, so quite why Estevao Willian, Pedro Neto and any semblance of Chelsea’s pace and width had to also be abandoned is a mystery.",
      "Becoming the first manager in Premier League history to make as many as three substitutions in the opening 21 minutes of a game almost entirely because of a single mismanaged red card is hilariously damning.",
      "",
      "5) Maresca even openly and apparently without a modicum of professional shame admitted after the game that “all the plan went in the bin after the red card”, as if that isn’t a massively embarrassing indictment on him as the coach.",
      "It is honestly difficult to recall a worse example of management in an entire half of Premier League football.",
      "",
      "6) It transmitted a message of panic to the players, a collective headloss from which they could not fully recover.",
      "In the 13 minutes between the first two substitutes coming on and Palmer going off, Chelsea’s combined pass success rate was 53%. Every defender and keeper Filip Jorgensen was guilty of ceding possession in dangerous areas under pressure from an invigorated Manchester United as such a wholesale change of shape and personnel evoked a sense of hysteria and doubt.",
      "At one point in the first half a remarkably Italian voice could be heard screaming “eh, eh, eh, Reece take the throw-in” when Wesley Fofana had the ball in his hands on the halfway line. It epitomised a side being micro-managed into oblivion.",
      "The red card created the sort of problem coaches tend to try and alleviate. Maresca exacerbated it.",
      "",
      "7) It was a lightning quick Manchester United start. In the opening couple of minutes a cross barely evaded Sesko in the area, skidding across the turf and onto the head of Bryan Mbeumo to force a save from Sanchez.",
      "Soon after, a long Altay Bayindir kick was flicked on by Sesko for Mbeumo to chase, round Sanchez and elicit the red card.",
      "There was a sense at that point that Manchester United had to capitalise on their ascendancy. A desperation, even, summed up by Matthijs de Ligt shooting from range in the 11th minute as if trying desperately to break a low block in second half stoppage time.",
      "But then a fine move culminated in Noussair Mazraoui crossing for Patrick Dorgu’s clever head back into the centre as Bruno Fernandes timed his run impeccably to convert.",
      "Dorgu is bafflingly important in terms of the attacking structures of a club which spent £200m on new forwards this summer, but early on he was excellent and there is hope that, at 20, those fundamentals can eventually be polished and harnessed.",
      "",
      "8) Casemiro going through the back of Enzo Fernandez near the halfway line as both the Argentinean and Chelsea as an entity posed precisely zero threat had an immediate air of the foreboding seemingly random brief highlight on Match of the Day.",
      "The second yellow about half an hour later for an arguably soft but ultimately completely avoidable and entirely stupid foul on Andrey Santos confirmed it.",
      "If a 33-year-old 78-cap Brazil international five-time European champion doesn’t realise he can’t slide tackle from behind or grab people and fall over then he probably can’t be relied upon consistently in a competent midfield, never mind this Manchester United one.",
      "",
      "9) There was at least a parting gift as Casemiro headed Manchester United into a two-goal lead shortly before indulging in the sort of foolishness which really ought to be beyond his years.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is presumably still watching and waiting for that ball to come down into the gaggle of players while forgetting he has the slight in-built advantage over them in being able to use his hands.",
      "It was atrocious goalkeeping and Chelsea will remain completely unserious while they steadfastly refuse to acknowledge that having a good, even just reliable presence between the posts is quite important.",
      "",
      "10) A couple of minutes after that goal, Manchester United should have had another. Amad won the ball from Fofana in Chelsea’s defensive third and raced towards goal with Jorgensen venturing comedically and pointedly far off his line to close the angle.",
      "Sesko was waiting unmarked in the middle but the ball never came, with Casemiro’s red ultimately falling on the Slovenian’s head.",
      "Another goalless game will delight the growing critics but his flick-on for the Sanchez red proved decisive and there were some bright moments of link-up play from a striker whose development cannot have been aided by these stop-start beginnings.",
      "",
      "11) It did seem at one point as though Chelsea’s best hope would be for the game to be abandoned due to a waterlogged pitch.",
      "Or beyond that, maybe for them to have a semblance of an attacking idea beyond just giving the ball to Joao Pedro and expecting him to dribble past five or six players before scoring.",
      "Even when Casemiro was sent off and parity in terms of numbers was restored, Chelsea were in no position to capitalise after those perplexing early changes. It’s almost like giving up all hope on a game after five minutes because of one setback is unnecessary.",
      "",
      "12) Maresca did still have two substitutions left, so obviously brought on Tyrique George and Malo Gusto – a forward they tried to sell this summer and a full-back when theoretically chasing a result.",
      "It meant £48.5m Jamie Gittens, £40m and incredibly motivated Alejandro Garnacho and Marc Guiu, who has not played since being recalled from his loan at Sunderland almost three weeks ago, remained on the bench.",
      "The game management was poor but that man management is diabolical.",
      "",
      "13) The one positive to come out of this game for Chelsea was the performance of Reece James at right-back. A few of his deliveries were exceptional, including the cross Trevoh Chalobah converted late on.",
      "It doesn’t feel like that will be enough to convince Maresca it might be worth deploying the very good right-back at right-back more often but still.",
      "",
      "14) Manchester United were excellent defensively, with De Ligt continuing to grow into his leadership role. The hosts wouldn’t have held out without him. He’d have even given Gabby Agbonlahor and Gary Taylor-Fletcher a challenge in this mood.",
      "",
      "15) That is a bruising week for Chelsea, their first run of three winless games since February.",
      "Maresca does have credit in the bank through Champions League qualification and some lesser trophies but it has been an underwhelming start to the season with an even shorter title challenge than the one the Italian spent most of last season writing off anyway.",
      "He was right when he said these players were “not ready” to compete for that level of silverware; there needs to be a degree of introspection in accepting that the same should be said of him too.",
      "",
      "16) This was the first Premier League game Manchester United have won without scoring in the second half since March 2024. It inherently feels more sustainable than relying on stoppage-time penalties and late individual heroics to get through.",
      "For a team and a coach basically learning how to win together it was potentially transformative how they did it. They could also entirely feasibly follow this up with defeats to Brentford and Sunderland before the international break, because ultimately inferring anything about this club based on a single result or performance is really stupid and only the sort of thing their billionaire owners should indulge in.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Premier League Sack Race. But who will be next? Not much cover for Ruben Amorim now…",
      "Pep Guardiola resorted to parking the bus at the Emirates and it still wasn’t enough on a day where Liverpool feel like the only winners.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is a sackable offence for all but actual Manchester United managers. Enzo Maresca could be in real trouble now.",
      "Amorim *could* do some coaching like Slot has done to transform a Liverpool star into ‘the best in the world’. The Man Utd boss has an opportunity vs Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘might not even be in his job’ if Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘hadn’t appointed him’ as Man Utd boss and the Chelsea win is ‘no turning point’.",
      "Enzo Maresca criticised one of his Chelsea players who ‘made a right hash of it’ in defeat to Man Utd on Saturday, explaining what he would have ‘preferred’."

      "Facing a Chelsea side doing everything in their power to keep Ruben Amorim in a job, even Manchester United couldn’t mess that one up, despite Casemiro’s best attempts.",
      "First things first, that was an astonishing game of football. The first half between Manchester United and Chelsea was one of the most manic, ridiculous halves of football you will see all season. The second 45 didn’t have quite as much drama, but it still delivered some ridiculous Barclays.",
      "Robert Sanchez was sent off for taking out Bryan Mbeumo on the edge of the box with only five minutes on the clock, prompting Enzo Maresca to make an early double change, hooking Estevao and Pedro Neto for Tosin Adarabioyo and goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen in a bizarre ploy that removed all of the pace from his attack and the majority of their threat on the break.",
      "Nine minutes after Sanchez’s red, United took the lead through Bruno Fernandes. VAR then threatened to disallow it for offside. Chelsea continued to be absolutely shambolic thanks to some terrible in-game management from Maresca, while Cole Palmer was brought off with what was hopefully an injury. With 70 minutes remaining, Amorim’s men were up against 10 men, all over the place, without their best player and without the ability to counter-attack effectively. Even they couldn’t f**k this, right?",
      "Well, it got better when Casemiro scored in the 37th minute, until he went from unlikely hero to likely villain. With both teams down to 10 and Alejandro Garnacho on the bench, there was the potential for the most hilarious outcome ever.",
      "In the torrential rain that the Old Trafford roof definitely couldn’t handle, there were fouls left, right and centre and the ball was slowing down in puddles while Amorim wished he had his wellies for the paddling pool in his technical area.",
      "As we say, it was a mad one.",
      "Tactics were thrown out of the window with both teams — especially Chelsea — incredibly open, as Maresca continued to make things up as he went along. In a game Amorim desperately needed to win with United 17th in the Premier League at kick-off, he managed it much better than the Blues boss and has bought himself some time with a crucial win against a team doing their best United-under-Amorim impression.",
      "From the three early changes made by Maresca, it was surprising that Wesley Fofana was not one of the players he hooked, even with a natural defender in Tosin replacing a winger. But there was always a chance that United would go full United and throw away the most glorious opportunity to beat a ‘Big Six’ rival. At least they ended up not having to worry about Garnacho influencing a comeback after Maresca used his last substitution with 26 minutes left. His brother’s Instagram story will be interesting.",
      "One of those to come on was Tyrique George, who finally provided some pace out wide for the visitors. We’re very surprised it wasn’t Garnacho. And Fofana was eventually brought off as well. Were they the worst five substitutions made by a manager in a single Premier League game?",
      "Despite some questionable management, Chelsea were able to grow into the game by knocking it around, but their ability to unlock the United defence was restricted as Palmer watched from the bench. One moment of quality set up a big last 10 when Reece James’ pinpoint cross was met by Trevoh Chalobah’s forehead for Chelsea’s first effort on target — and a goal that Altay Bayindir could do nothing to stop.",
      "Chelsea pushed for an equaliser that they didn’t deserve and which would have made Casemiro public enemy number one in Manchester, having thrown away United’s control with a stupid second yellow card, but United held on and successfully navigated the closing minutes.",
      "Thankfully for Amorim, his players held on for a first home win against a ‘Big Six’ rival under his watch. Chelsea, on the other hand, end an abysmal week with one of their most dysfunctional and calamitous performances under Maresca. They threw it away at Brentford last weekend, were thumped by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, and now they’ve lost to the most beatable United team since, well, last season, giving them little choice but to take advantage and earn a fat, juicy win.",
      "United will take what they’re given and try to beat what’s in front of them. This victory gives Amorim more time to get his players used to a formation that hasn’t been working and shows he can beat teams deemed direct rivals, even if 11 places separated them last season.",
      "He’s clearly still working things out, continuing his 100% record of changing his back three every single game this season as Matthijs de Ligt was again the only centre-back to start and finish a Premier League match.",
      "With United 2-0 up and looking for more, one thing Amorim probably felt he’d worked out was his best central-midfield pairing, with Fernandes and Casemiro on the scoresheet. But the latter did his best to make an already breathtaking game even more dramatic. We thank him, but Amorim definitely will not.",
      "At the end of the day, it’s three points for Amorim and Manchester United. Three fat, succulent points they desperately needed. A turning point? Nah, they’ve run out of turning points. But there’s hope. And that’s all you can ask for.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is a sackable offence for all but actual Manchester United managers. Enzo Maresca could be in real trouble now.",
      "Enzo Maresca criticised one of his Chelsea players who ‘made a right hash of it’ in defeat to Man Utd on Saturday, explaining what he would have ‘preferred’.",
      "Enzo Maresca has explained why he decided to leave Chelsea without an attack through his substitutions in their defeat to Manchester United on Saturday.",
      "Ruben Amorim may be ‘gaslighting’ the Man Utd fans but he ‘exposed the fraud’ Enzo Maresca on Saturday, whose sacking should be one of two Chelsea priorities.",
      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",
      "Enzo Maresca has defended Chelsea’s treatment of ostracised duo Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi, saying his father’s life as a fisherman is more difficult."

      "The reason for Amorim’s clear stance is that he doesn’t want to lose face in the dressing room, but recent reports have indicated that the squad are giving up regardless, so this risk is necessary as a final Hail Mary to save his job. Without it, there is no road back for the head coach…",

      "Plus: Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner leaves Graham Potter on the brink at West Ham; Spurs show fight in Brighton comeback; Noah Okafor inspires Leeds' victory over winless Wolves; Nottingham Forest see the good and the bad of Ange Postecoglou",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 13:08, UK",
      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",
      "Glasner is such a smart cookie.Lewis Jones",

      "Match report and free match highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro's first-half goals were enough to see Man Utd past Chelsea; Casemiro's second yellow levelled the playing field after early sending off for Robert Sanchez and set up nervy ending after Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he hopes to get the time to show how his system will evolve, but insists not even the Pope will make him change it right now for fear of what the players will think of him.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" he said. \"Not once [have I thought about changing]. Not even the Pope [can make me], it will not change.\"",
      "Amorim has maintained he will stick with his 3-4-2-1 formation despite having the worst win percentage of any United boss since the Second World War and overseeing their worst start in the Premier League for 33 years.",
      "United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference - since Amorim was appointed last November.",
      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",
      "However, he is concerned about what his squad would think if he changed now and hopes he will be in charge long enough for it to happen.",
      "\"If I'm a player and I have a coach with a lot of pressure to change the system and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"When you think about the impact of any decision on the team, everything is important.",
      "\"This will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way. It will change, I hope to have the time to change.\"",
      "One of the issues with Amorim's system has been in midfield where Bruno Fernandes has played in a deeper role. Amorim believes he is still having an impact higher up the pitch and is integral in making them dominate games.",
      "\"Bruno wants all the freedom in the world but even when he played a No 10 role, it's getting the ball back,\" he said. \"Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box but he's getting there and is near the box and can have shots.",
      "\"I want Bruno to be more deep to have more possession to try and control more of the game. We are doing that. Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit in front, maybe because (Matheus) Cunha is not there. I'm trying to balance the team and imagine the game.",
      "\"I see Bruno [doing] well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further but he has a job to do. The important thing is not Bruno playing well, it's the team playing well and winning football games.\"",
      "Amorim believes the data is showing improvement although believes they lack belief compared to Liverpool, who have been winning games late on.",
      "He said: \"It's belief, confidence, aggression. It's everything. Sometimes what we call luck. It's the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"Liverpool are winning all the games in the 90th minute, it's something about the teams that are winning to have that feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well but something is going to go wrong.",
      "\"We need to change that but just with wins. If you look at the goals against Man City, Fulham, we scored against Burnley, we are good in the game but then we draw. All these moments I think we can do better. It's our fault.\"",

I don't care who is playing for the opponent, [or] what people are going to say in the end if the player plays well. They are good players and they play well if things happen. My only focus is winning the game.\"",

      "Friday 19 September 2025 14:16, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has played down the significance of a meeting with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe at the club's training ground this week, insisting their talks were \"normal\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract,\" Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe's visit.",
      "\"No, it's normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it's a long project. He said many times, 'This is my third season.' For me, it's not. But normal things.",
      "\"I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.",
      "\"So, a normal meeting, and we had several, but in this moment, it's normal that people pay attention to that.\"",
      "Amorim is under scrutiny having only won one of Manchester United's first four games of the season and also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town.",
      "\"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win,\" he said.",
      "The 40-year-old insists he sees improvement in their performances but admits they need to improve at both ends of the pitch.",
      "\"Last year I was very critical of the way we played,\" Amorim added. \"I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "Amorim has had a free week with his players to prepare for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on the training pitch and says they have focused their efforts on being more effective in the boxes.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and the next game, and to prepare different things,\" he said. \"We are playing well until we reach the boxes.",
      "\"We need to be more clinical. The number of shots and the xG are good, but if you don't score, it doesn't matter.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games.",
      "\"We have to maintain the way we're playing and improving in our box and the opposition's box - that was the focus of the week. Especially against Chelsea, when they cross, they are the side with the most players in the box.\"",
      "The Manchester United boss confirmed he will be able to call on Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Chelsea but Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot are unavailable.",
      "Amorim bemoaned the absence of Martinez, who is edging towards a return to fitness having not featured since suffering a knee injury in February.",
      "\"When you recover from that injury, you have time where you recover a lot of things fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step,\" he said.",
      "\"We've missed him a lot. Especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does. But he's always there, in every meeting and when he finishes he stays to watch training.",
      "\"We need him in this team.\"",

      "Between the Lines returns with an in-depth look at Ruben Amorim's system and the reasons why Man Utd are struggling to make it work; Sunday's 3-0 loss to Man City leaves them with a worse record than any ever-present Premier League side since last year",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Tom Stitson",
      "Saturday 20 September 2025 17:07, UK",
      "Manchester United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City in Sunday's derby increased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim and raised more questions about his favoured 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",
