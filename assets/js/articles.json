      "Gary Neville has taken aim at Ruben Amorim's tactics - as he claimed the Manchester United hierarchy will be wanting to see a turnaround in fortunes following their poor start to the season. Speaking to Rebecca Lowe on NBC Sports on Sunday afternoon, the former England international said: \"I am very worried, Rebecca; there is no point in me sitting here and saying I’m not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results and the substitutions yesterday. I saw something at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing-back.",
      "\"We admire managers who are stubborn and resilient around their system, we want them to stick to their plan, but when you have Mason Mount playing at left-back, you are going to look pretty stupid.",
      "\"It has happened twice now and it can't happen. The first time I thought it was unforgivable and yesterday it happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game and the performances and the results are just unacceptable.",
      "\"I'm really, really worried. I would never go on television, as I know how difficult a manager's job can be, and say a manager should be sacked, but I suspect the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround.\"",

      "The justification for Nathan Collins avoiding a red card during Manchester United's clash has received a potentially mortifying review after their 3-1 loss to Brentford. Ruben Amorim's team couldn't secure consecutive victories, leaving themselves with a steep challenge in the capital as Bruno Fernandes squandered a second-half spot-kick.",
      "It was how the Bees gave away the penalty that has caused controversy. Matheus Cunha delivered the ball to Bryan Mbeumo, who had a clear view of goal, before being dragged down in the box by Collins.",
      "The spot-kick was awarded and the Republic of Ireland defender received a yellow card for hauling down the Cameroon striker, but after clarification from the Premier League Match Centre X account, a community note has appeared on the post.",
      "Originally, the account explained why Collins escaped dismissal, stating: \"The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to pulled Mbeumo back.",
      "\"VAR also checked the referee's call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.\"",
      "Nevertheless, a community note - a feature of the social media platform introduced to prevent misinformation spreading rapidly - apparently dismissed the idea that Collins avoided red because it was judged that the United player \"wasn't in control of the ball\".",
      "Premium subscribers of the platform can add community notes when they can demonstrate that the original statement is false. Citing the International Football Association Board (IFAB) laws of the game, a counter-argument was presented which stated: \"Control of the ball is not required for a red card.",
      "\"For DOGSO (denial of a goalscoring opportunity), referees consider distance to goal, direction of play, likelihood of keeping/gaining the ball, and defenders' positions. It's about likelihood, not current control.\"",
      "The IFAB laws specify: \"Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.\"",
      "Within the match context, Collins stayed on the pitch when the dismissal would have boosted United.",
      "Whilst there's no certainty that Fernandes would have converted the spot-kick regardless, it might well have assisted their fightback from the 2-1 deficit - which ultimately became three when Mathias Jensen wrapped up matters in the fifth minute of added time.",
      "Amorim discussed the incident after the match but was determined not to be sidetracked from the outcome.",
      "\"The referee told me that Bryan was not in control of the ball,\" Amorim said via the BBC Sport.",
      "\"You [the media] can say what happened. I don't want to talk about the referee.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat after Manchester United suffered another Premier League defeat. After a triumphant 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford last weekend, Amorim had the opportunity to secure consecutive league wins for the first time since his arrival at United nearly a year ago.",
      "However, he fell short once again, presiding over a disappointing 3-1 loss to Brentford. United were on the back foot in the early stages as the Bees raced to a 2-0 lead, before Benjamin Sesko's maiden goal for the club sparked hopes of a comeback.",
      "But when Bruno Fernandes failed to convert a penalty following a controversial decision not to send off Brentford's Nathan Collins, it was clear that luck wasn't on United's side. The Bees netted a third in injury time, handing Amorim his 17th league defeat in just 33 matches.",
      "The United boss was asked if was confident he could turn it around following the defeat to Brentford, Amorim responded: \"It’s like ups and downs. When you win, you feel that everything, the momentum is there.",
      "\"When you lose, you go back to the same place and you fight again for one win that can help you to create the momentum. Guys, I'm always doing my job. If I win, I'm in a different state of mind. That is normal. I'm always confident because I know what to do.\"",
      "He added: \"Guys, I cannot tell you more than what I say every time when I lose the game.",
      "\"Sometimes we see a team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you don’t see that improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.\"",
      "Now, rumours about his future are escalating, the Mirror takes a look at the latest reports.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Gareth Southgate is on Manchester United's three-man shortlist to potentially replace Amorim - and he's already been in direct contact with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. It's reported that United are likely to hold off until November to make their move.",
      "This would minimise the compensation package, as Amorim will have completed 12 months in charge. Ratcliffe has reportedly reached out to Southgate in recent weeks to assess the feasibility of him stepping in, having been jobless since stepping down as England manager in July 2024.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly shortlisted Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola as potential replacements for under-fire manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Southgate, the former England manager, was previously linked to the role before his departure from the national team, and his name resurfaced during the process of appointing Amorim, who could be facing a four-game ultimatum.",
      "According to BBC Sport, Manchester United's top brass, including Sir Jim Ratcliffe, are still firmly behind Amorim. The report quashes rumours of a shortlist being prepared, asserting that the Old Trafford bosses are fully supporting the Portuguese manager to steer the ship in the right direction.",
      "Ratcliffe believes it's only just to evaluate Amorim over an entire season with what the United co-owner perceives as the appropriate squad for advancement. Insiders also reveal that no replacements are currently being considered.",

      "Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey has branded the statement explaining the decision to not send off Nathan Collins as ‘absolute nonsense’.",
      "The Brentford defender avoided getting his marching orders after conceding a penalty during their 3-1 win over Manchester United. With the Bees leading 2-1, Collins was penalised for pulling back Bryan Mbeumo as he was about to connect with the ball.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot, but decided against showing Collins a red card. That was despite the United striker being poised to fire a shot at goal from close distance.",
      "The VAR on duty backed up Pawson’s decision, with Bruno Fernandes missing from the spot to add further insult to injury. A statement from the Premier League Match Centre explained the decision with a statement released swiftly after the penalty was awarded.",
      "That statement read: \"The referee’s call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to have pulled Mbeumo back.",
      "\"VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.\"",
      "However, Halsey, who officiated in the Premier League for more than 10 years, slammed the decision - and subsequent explanation, suggesting the correct call was cut and dry.",
      "Halsey told the Sun: “The statement from the Match Centre said that Mbeumo did not have control of the ball.It doesn’t say in law about having the ball under control.",
      "“It’s about the likelihood of keeping control of the ball. “In my opinion, the Match Centre statement was absolute nonsense and it was a clear, clear denial of a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "“Manchester United will be very disappointed with that decision. A red card should have been shown to the Brentford player.”",
      "Defeat at the GTech was United’s third in just six league matches, leaving them marooned in the bottom half. It also continued Ruben Amorim’s long run of being unable to win back to back Premier League matches.",
      "Amorim refused to openly criticise the decision, instead lamenting his side’s inability to control the game. “We have the ability and the capacity to control the game, to calm down the game. We didn't do that today,” he explained.",
      "“You guys have the ability to make your decision with your opinion of the decision. The referee told me that Bryan [Mbeumo] was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled. So that was the decision.",
      "“Again, I want - especially in these kind of moments - not to focus on the referee. What we should have done this afternoon is play better, and we need to play better.\"",
      "Despite another chastening defeat, the Portuguese boss remains confident that he will be able to turn it around He added: \"It’s like ups and downs. When you win, you feel that everything, the momentum is there.",
      "“When you lose, you go back to the same place and you fight again for one win that can help you to create the momentum.",

The Champions League-winning gaffer's name has been thrown into the hat as a potential replacement for Ruben Amorim, as the pressure continues to mount.",
      "United were unable to secure consecutive victories, failing to capitalise on their recent win over Chelsea, with Brentford emerging as 3-1 victors on Saturday. A brace from Igor Thiago in the first half left the visitors with a steep hill to climb after a sluggish start in west London.",

      "The defeat leaves United languishing in 14th place with seven points, as Keith Andrews' squad leapfrogged them following their victory.",
      "Amorim is still facing rumours about his future at the club after failing to rectify their inconsistent and subpar performances. This has led to speculation linking Zidane to the role, but if a decision is made, they'll need to lure the former Real Madrid boss out of his hiatus.",
      "Zidane hasn't been seen in the dugout since 2021 after parting ways with Los Blancos for the second time. According to Petit, one of his ex-teammates, certain demands will need to be met for this to happen.",

      "A Wrexham legend once found himself struggling with debt until Gary Speed came to his aid. Former Welsh winger Mickey Thomas graced some of football's biggest stages during his prime, turning out for Manchester United and Chelsea alongside two stints with the North Wales club.",
      "But he plunged into serious financial trouble after squandering an estimated £500,000 through gambling. Thomas, who was raised in Mochdre, North Wales, previously revealed how he battled a severe gambling addiction that began after departing Wrexham for United in 1978.",
      "He confessed he had \"lost a fortune\" due to his compulsion, which persisted long after hanging up his boots in the mid-1990s.",
      "In his autobiography, published in 2008, he reflected on his addiction, saying: \"Most of the time it's boredom. More often than not it's a release of pressure. In extreme gambling cases like mine you always think you are in control – you never are.",
      "\"I've lost a fortune over the years. Maybe it's £250,000. Maybe it's more like £500,000. Thinking back, that's probably nearer the mark and I'm not proud to admit that. It was easy money. Easy to blow £10,000 on a spin of a roulette ball or the flick of a card.",
      "\"It's an addiction which grabbed me at United but it's one that has grabbed me more in my later years when I retired.\"",
      "Fortunately, the Red Dragons legend, who netted a memorable free-kick that helped Wrexham eliminate Arsenal from the FA Cup in 1992, managed to rebuild his life afterwards. Thomas, who represented Wales 51 times throughout his playing days, revealed it was partly down to his former Leeds colleague Speed's kindness that enabled him to begin settling the substantial debts he had accumulated.",
      "Reflecting several years following the ex-Wales boss's passing in 2011, he said: \"He was such a great bloke. After I hit hard times financially later in life, if he saw me he would always ask if I was all right for money. One day, I went to his house when he was with Newcastle United and he asked me if I wanted any boots.",
      "\"It was up to me what I did with them, maybe sell them to make a few quid to ease the debts. I ended up coming out of his garage with around 30 pairs. That's how generous he was. I will never forget his kindness.\"",
      "Thomas subsequently faced another ordeal following his cancer diagnosis in February 2019 when medics discovered a substantial tumour in his oesophagus. The growth was surgically removed in May that year, though he initially found the follow-up chemotherapy treatment challenging.",
      "He revealed he had received the cancer all-clear in November 2021 and has since campaigned to raise money for the department at Wrexham Maelor Hospital where NHS medics carried out life-saving treatment on him. The 71-year-old remains a familiar face at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground where supporters continue to adore him.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Wrexham's Hollywood owners, Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, also honoured Thomas after the club's promotion from League One in April this year. The pair invited him to their box to witness Wrexham secure their third consecutive promotion in style with a resounding 3-0 victory over Charlton Athletic.",
      "Post-match, Deadpool actor Reynolds shared his ambitions for the club: \"Our goal is to make it to the Premier League. It just seemed like an impossible dream, but as storytellers, you look as much as you can at the macro view of history.",
      "\"Without it I would not be here. You can go all the way back from the Gresford Disaster to Mickey Thomas, who is a huge point of aspiration for this club. And the goal was to reach that feeling – and it is a feeling.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",

      "Ben Foster has revealed the moment Sir Alex Ferguson delivered the crushing news that his Manchester United career was over. But he also explained why he still has nothing but admiration for his former boss despite the heartbreak.",
      "The shot-stopper arrived at United from Stoke City in 2005 after catching the eye of the legendary Scottish manager during a loan spell at Wrexham. He found it tough to establish himself in the first team throughout his Old Trafford tenure, with the reliable Edwin van der Sar firmly established as the club's number one.",
      "The former England goalkeeper went on to claim the League Cup on two occasions with United, though his Premier League outings remained limited. It was an unconvincing display during a heated Manchester derby clash in the top flight in September 2009 that marked the start of his downfall at the club.",
      "Foster was selected by Sir Alex to deputise for the injured Van der Sar in an enthralling 4-3 triumph over Man City, with Michael Owen netting a sensational stoppage-time winner at Old Trafford.",
      "However, a crucial error from the keeper resulted in him facing his manager's notorious \"hairdryer\" treatment once the final whistle had blown. Reflecting on the incident during the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, Foster revealed: \"I had an absolute stinker and I knew the writing was on the wall. I heard the manager saying something, because they had a telly in the changing rooms at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He was watching the replays, and I'm next to him thinking, 'Oh god, someone turn this telly off. This is s***.' He's watching it, and he's said to somebody, 'God, he needs to come out.' I knew he was talking about me and lo and behold, I was out the next week.",
      "\"He would tell you exactly where you stood, but I loved that about him. He was like, 'Listen, I can see that your confidence has gone so I'm taking you out of the team. I'm going to put Tomasz Kuszczak in for a bit, and then Edwin's back in a couple of weeks anyway.'\".",
      "Despite his blunder, Foster found himself back between the sticks for United's Premier League encounter with Sunderland at Old Trafford the following month. Another howler from the goalkeeper allowed Kenwyne Jones to find the net during the 2-2 stalemate.",
      "That crucial moment didn't merely cost him his spot in the squad - it effectively sealed his final top-flight outing for United. Yet reflecting on those dark days, Foster admitted he valued Sir Alex's brutal honesty, whilst departing the club actually kickstarted his career properly.",
      "He explained: \"Big Kenwyne Jones was up front for them, and the ball came into the box. I'd gone to punch it, but he headed it first and scored, and he left me on the floor in a heap. I'm like, 'Oh God'.",
      "\"Again, Patrice Evra scored a last minute goal which rescued me a bit, but the manager was fuming. I remember going into the changing rooms at full-time and then that was the hair dryer.",
      "\"He said, 'You're never playing for this club again', but it was in front of all the lads as well. I just remember thinking, 'Oh, this is horrible. I don't need this.' That was it in my head that I was done, and I was.",
      "\"At the time, it was horrible but I left at the end of that season and signed for Birmingham. That, for me, is when my career really started.\"",
      "Following his departure from Old Trafford at the conclusion of the 2009-10 campaign, Foster moved to Birmingham City, where he established himself as the club's number one keeper, securing a third League Cup triumph with the Blues in 2011.",
      "His stellar displays earned him a switch to West Bromwich Albion in 2012, where he continued his excellent form. Foster, who earned eight England caps throughout his career, subsequently enjoyed a four-year stint at Watford before concluding his playing days back at Wrexham, helping them secure National League glory in 2023.",
      "He now presents his own podcast, dubbed Fozcast, where he chats about football with various guests.",

      "Former Manchester United right-back Richard Eckersley will always remember January 24, 2009.",
      "It was the day he fulfilled his childhood dream of making his first-team debut for the club he joined at just nine years old. Coming off the bench at Old Trafford, Eckersley replaced Fabio in a thrilling FA Cup fourth round tie against Tottenham Hotspur, with United leading 2-1.",
      "At a time when the squad was brimming with big names, Eckersley was pushing for a spot in the first team. He drew inspiration from the commitment, dedication and desire of the club's leading stars.",
      "He recalled: \"You hear stories about them when you're growing up and coming through the academy. You heard about Roy Keane, Giggs, Scholes and their professionalism. You hear in the academy that this is what these players are like and how they got to that stage. It was really inspiring and, for the most part, all the things that I learnt there I have taken into my life now.\"",
      "Eckersley, now 36, made just four first-team outings but does possess a League Cup winners' medal from his Old Trafford days. Despite failing to feature for a single minute during the Reds' march to the 2009 final, he was among the substitutes at Wembley after impressing Sir Alex Ferguson in a reserve clash against Manchester City a few days earlier.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson used to watch all the reserve games and obviously contacted all the coaches,\" said Eckersley. \"I was playing really well in the reserves, and I think we played Manchester City in a reserve game a few days before the League Cup final, and I played really well.",
      "\"I think he just put me on the bench almost as a reward. I guess he was seeing it as an opportunity for me to get some time with the first team and potentially win something.",
      "\"Also, the confidence in me after seeing me play and the confidence in me to say, 'I can put you on the bench.' It was a surreal moment, and I do have a League Cup medal; I think it is in the loft at the minute. Actually, I have not looked at it for a while!\"",
      "Despite remaining an unused substitute, it represented the high point of Eckersley's United journey. Later that year, he chose to leave Old Trafford for newly-promoted Burnley.",
      "It was a choice he would come to rue, as he featured just twice for the Clarets and was sent out on various loan moves. He reflected: \"I think the decision to leave United was probably too early for me.",
      "\"I think I probably should have stayed on and developed at Carrington under the coaches that I was already working with, because I was making steady progress.",
      "\"I think the jump from the cusp of one of the world's greatest teams, you could say at that time, to Burnley, who had just got promoted but were going to be a struggling team in the Premier League, was a massive jump and a massive education for me, in terms of what is men's football and what is it like to play with players that haven't had the pedigree that people at United had.",
      "\"It was a huge shift from where I was at United and the standards that we were setting with professionalism, the facilities and all the kinds of things that we had. You were basically looked after to the nth degree. Then going somewhere like Burnley - and no disrespect to Burnley - they were just in a different headspace.",
      "\"It was just a completely different experience and, in hindsight, I think it would have been sensible for me to stay on [at United].\"",
      "Following loan spells at Plymouth Argyle, Bradford City and Bury, Eckersley headed to the MLS in April 2011, signing for Toronto FC. He said: \"I was desperate just to play and desperate to enjoy football, because at the time I wasn't enjoying football. I was playing in League Two, going on loan to Bradford, Bury, places like that.",
      "\"I went on loan to Plymouth and we were in a bit of a relegation battle. I played under a manager called Paul Mariner, who really liked me and really liked how I played. He got the general manager's job at Toronto, and that is how the move came about to North America.",
      "\"He said come over to the MLS, play for six or seven months on loan and enjoy the football. That is exactly what I did. He took me over and I loved it.",
      "\"I loved living by myself, I loved the culture, I loved the relaxation around football and people just enjoying the football. Don't get me wrong, the football was a very physical league, going here, there and everywhere, but I just felt that it was such an enjoyable time for me as a player, to enjoy just focusing on football and also off the pitch as well, learning to live by myself and on my own.",
      "\"I had a close-knit bond with my team-mates and it was a really enjoyable time. From there, I just wanted to stay and that was how it triggered.\"",
      "Eckersley stayed at Toronto for just under three years, featuring 92 times for the club. His next move kept him in the MLS, with New York Red Bulls snapping him up in January 2014, although he left less than a year later.",
      "He was keen to reignite his career back in England and had trials with Swindon Town and Southend United before signing for Oldham Athletic. Looking back on that spell, he said: \"I came back [to England] in January [2015] and for the first few weeks, nothing came about. I was waiting, waiting and waiting and nothing was available.",
      "\"I ended up signing for Oldham but I didn't enjoy my time there. By that time, I think I realised that I didn't really want to play football anymore. I was on the way out and I wasn't enjoying playing.\"",
      "At 26, while crossing the Irish Sea on a ferry from the Isle of Man, Eckersley decided to hang up his boots for good. He wanted to discover what else life could offer that would bring him even closer to his family.",
      "\"My daughter was born in the June and I literally stopped playing,\" he said. \"I wasn't interested in making any calls to my agent and I wasn't interested in football.",
      "\"We went to this wedding on the Isle of Man, we were hanging out as a family, just the three of us, and on the way back I was like, 'I really enjoyed that, I want to do it more often. I don't just want to keep being moved to here, there and everywhere, trying to find a career in football.'",
      "\"I felt that it was telling me something and that I needed to do something different. That was the reason that I said to my wife on the way back, 'I'm done, I'm not going to continue with this, I'm going to do something different'.\"",
      "What followed wasn't your typical ex-footballer tale. Determined to start afresh for himself and his family, Eckersley, alongside his wife and daughter, journeyed to Totnes in Devon in a camper van.",
      "They immediately fell in love with the town, so much so that they chose to relocate there for good. Eckersley was determined to contribute something meaningful to the local community and launched a shop. With a deep passion for vegan and organic produce, Eckersley and his wife established Earth.Food.Love, pioneering zero-waste retail outlet.",
      "He said: \"We wanted to find somewhere where we wanted to live; it wasn't the zero-waste shop that came first, it was where we wanted to live.",
      "\"We were living in a city centre apartment near Spinningfields [in Manchester] and we wanted to move somewhere where there was nature, vegan alternatives and all these kinds of things that we had picked up on our road leading up to this point.",
      "\"Obviously, having lived in Toronto and New York, you get access to these alternatives. Living in Manchester, there are alternatives, of course, but I felt to choose a place where we wanted to live was the cornerstone.",
      "\"We sat on the beach [near Totnes] and said that we wanted to make this our home. Obviously, we need to do something while we're here. We wanted to invest back into the community. The idea of a shop came about and, initially, the idea was that it was going to be a whole foods shop.",
      "\"There was already a whole foods shop in Totnes. We thought about what else we could do that makes us unique. The idea of a zero-waste aspect whole foods shop was unique and would draw people in. That was how it started.\"",
      "Besides operating Earth.Food.Love, Eckersley also runs ReRooted, which produces plant milks that are now distributed across the UK. Despite how hectic managing two distinct enterprises can be, Eckersley is enjoying life.",
      "\"I don't finish at 2pm anymore,\" he quipped, referring back to his football days. \"Those days are pretty much gone. But there is flexibility.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like I am getting pulled from pillar to post. But it is a joy because it is something that I am enjoying doing. It doesn't feel like a chore and it doesn't feel like I am working a 9-5 job.\"",
      "Despite only making a few appearances for United, Eckersley reveals he's often recognised by customers in the shop, leading to requests for him to participate in charity matches.",
      "\"I am just like, after a long day in the shop or at my other company, I am a little bit knackered,\" he said. \"I just want to go home, put my kids to bed, and then probably go to bed myself.",
      "\"I don't really want to play football afterwards. I do play every now and again down on the astroturf at the local school, but it is very fleeting.\"",

      "Mathieu Debuchy slammed Arsene Wenger for blocking a potential move to Manchester United. The former Arsenal defender was candid about his wish to leave the club in December 2016 after joining from the Gunners' Sunday opponents Newcastle two years prior.",
      "The right-back was signed for around £12million, having previously enjoyed a successful period at Lille where he clinched the Ligue 1 title in 2011. In his debut season with the Gunners, Debuchy was restricted to just 15 appearances across all competitions due to injuries.",
      "Upon regaining full fitness, he found it difficult to replace Hector Bellerin as the first-choice right-back. In the 2015/16 season, he only played twice before securing a loan move to Bordeaux in the January transfer window, hoping to secure a spot in France's Euro 2016 squad.",
      "Despite returning to his home country, Debuchy expressed frustration over how he was treated at Arsenal. He claimed that the Gunners had stopped a possible move to Premier League rivals United a year earlier and admitted that he barely spoke with Wenger.",
      "Reflecting on his proposed move to Old Trafford, Debuchy told L’Equipe, as per ESPN: \"I wasn't playing a lot, it was United, there's nothing else to say.",
      "\"For me, it was almost unexpected, but the coach said no. It's something I did not appreciate. He wasn't using me, so I didn't see his interest in doing that.\"",
      "When asked about his relationship with veteran Arsenal boss Wenger, Debuchy revealed he barely communicated with his fellow Frenchman. \"We acknowledge each other, we say hello, nothing more,\" he added.",
      "Debuchy claimed that Arsenal had blocked his transfer to Old Trafford, forcing him to join Bordeaux, where he featured nine times. Despite rumoured interest from clubs including Espanyol and Fiorentina, he couldn't secure a permanent switch and encountered a similar scenario once more in December 2016, though fitness issues prevented him from securing a fresh start.",
      "\"My situation doesn't meet what I had been hoping for, but that's football,\" he said. \"There have been things, injuries and the coach's choices that have meant that I haven't played. Even if I don't understand, I'm not surprised, I know how it works. [I want] a way out. I want to take on a new challenge, to get back into it, to simply do my job properly.\"",
      "However, Debuchy's accusations didn't go unanswered. Arsenal manager Wenger rejected the notion that Arsenal had prevented a potential switch to United and also addressed other transfer speculation concerning the defender.",
      "\"They have never made an offer for him,\" Wenger said, as per the Guardian. \"It's completely untrue. It's sometimes surprising to hear things like that.",
      "\"When he had the opportunities to play when Bellerín was injured, he was injured [too]. So I cannot do anything about that. I gave him last year the opportunity to go to Bordeaux on loan, but we had nobody coming in for him over the summer period and there are some things that are not true in this article.",
      "\"We never blocked him to go to Fiorentina, nor Espanyol. They had no interest in him at all because we checked that, so you have to take this [L'Equipe] article with a little distance.\"",
      "Debuchy eventually got his wish to leave Arsenal in January 2018, six months before his Gunners contract expired. He moved to Saint Etienne without a transfer fee and remained there for three and a half years. He then enjoyed a two-year stint with Valenciennes before retiring in 2023.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim's 3-1 defeat to Brentford was dubbed \"a joke\" by Usain Bolt. Exiled defender Tyrell Malacia also sent the Red Devils' head coach a telling message.",
      "Amorim's men suffered their third loss of the new Premier League season on Saturday when they travelled to the Gtech Community Stadium. Bees striker Igor Thiago fired in a first-half double before Benjamin Sesko pulled one back, and although United were given a penalty on 76 minutes, Bruno Fernandes failed to convert.",
      "Brentford bagged a third goal to seal United's fate deep in added time, and during a calamitous first half, one of the club's more high-profile fans, 100m and 200m world record holder Bolt, branded the performance a \"joke.\"",
      "Brentford's first goal on Saturday saw Harry Maguire play striker Thiago onside before he slotted home past Altay Bayindir after just nine minutes. Less than 10 minutes later, and it was 2-0, the Brazilian bagging his second, with United's goalkeeper parrying a cross into his path.",
      "This disastrous opening 20 minutes had some fans up in arms, and even Bolt couldn't help but voice his frustrations. He took to social media and posted to X: \"This must be a joke.\"",
      "Fans in the comments of this post were equally as frustrated, with one writing: \"United are a joke. Have been for a decade.\" Another added: \"Even Bolt cannot believe how useless this club is.\"",
      "Although Sesko pulled one back for the visitors, his first goal for the club, Amorim's side were yet again defeated. The Portuguese head coach is yet to win two consecutive Premier League matches in charge of the Red Devils.",
      "Away from the Brentford clash, outcast Malacia has proven to potential suitors and Amorim that he is ready to play. Failing to secure a move away this summer was another blow for the Dutchman, who has endured a torrid spell in Manchester after being brought to the club under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Though he arrived as a potential starting full-back, Malacia has found minutes tough to come by. He was sidelined for over 500 days after suffering a knee injury in 2023, which hasn't helped his cause.",
      "Moves to Elche in Spain and Turkey didn't materialise over the summer, after he spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV. Now, Malacia finds himself in exile, not suited to Amorim's wing-backed formation.",
      "However, the 26-year-old has indicated that he is ready to lace up his boots again, posting to Instagram videos of himself training at non-league side Trafford FC. He has shown both Amorim and any coaches of clubs who could look to take him on in January that he is keeping match-fit.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was introduced after 66 minutes against Brentford, and while he failed to make too much of an impact, he has shown glimpses of promise in recent weeks. Amorim continues to play Manuel Ugarte at the base of his midfield, however.",
      "Red Devils icon Ferdinand thinks the head coach must do all he can to get Mainoo more minutes, and he told the MEN: \"If he was agitating to get a loan now, if he is not playing in January, he will be agitating and knocking the door down even more to go and get game time.",
      "\"You have to have two hats in these situations. If you think about it, being a player again, you have got to be thinking about yourself in these situations. You are lucky to go to multiple tournaments in your career, you are lucky to go to just one tournament, so I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself.",
      "\"But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes was presented with the opportunity to level from the penalty spot midway through the second period when Nathan Collins brought down Bryan Mbeumo, but his feeble attempt was kept out by Caoimhin Kelleher.",

      "American referee David Gerson reckons Brentford should have been reduced to 10 men during Manchester United's crushing 3-1 defeat at the G-Tech Community Stadium. Brentford defender Nathan Collins escaped a red card after hauling down Bryan Mbeumo in the second half. The Bees defender pulled back his former teammate inside the box.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson brandished a yellow card whilst Video Assistant Referee Andy Madley, working alongside assistant Nicholas Hopton, reviewed the incident at Stockley Park and ruled it wasn't worthy of a dismissal. Bruno Fernandes stepped up to take the penalty with Brentford leading 2-1, but his strike was kept out.",
      "Justifying the call, the Premier League Match Centre posted on X: \"The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to pulled Mbeumo back. VAR also checked the referee's call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.\"",
      "Yet Gerson, who shared his thoughts on Instagram, took issue with the Premier League's stance.",
      "\"This is absolutely a red card for denial of obvious goalscoring opportunity,\" he declared. \"How this was only a yellow card and penalty, I don't understand. Let me go ahead and dispel some myths, double jeopardy, you can't give a red card in a penalty kick. Absolutely, you can. The laws have changed over the years, it used to be the case you couldn't, now you can.",
      "\"The second thing, what are DOGSO (Denial of Goal Scoring Opportunity) conditions, so distance, absolutely met, number of defenders, there's no one between the foul and the goal, and then you got direction, he's right in the middle of the field, he's going towards goal and then, likely to control.",
      "\"That's right, you don't need to have control of the ball for it to be a red card, for DOGSO opportunity. This ball has not come across him yet and he's being pulled back so the foul has occurred, he's being pulled away from the ball, he absolutely has likelihood of control - a slow rolling ball for a Premier League or running onto the ball, that is absolute likelihood of control.",
      "\"So the correct decision should be a red card and a penalty kick. How they did not award this, I don't understand because it makes a difference, right. We got 15 minutes left in the game, player gets sent off and obviously they missed the penalty kick, but still, now you're playing 11 vs 10 men.",

      "Martin Keown has raised serious doubts about Manchester United's continued backing of manager Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils slumped to a 3-1 defeat at Brentford on Saturday afternoon and have still failed to string together consecutive Premier League wins under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "United had hoped their 2-1 victory over Chelsea the previous weekend might signal a fresh start as they looked to build momentum under the former Sporting Lisbon chief. Despite Benjamin Sesko netting his maiden goal for United, a first-half brace from Igor Thiago and Mathias Jensen's late strike condemned the visitors to another disappointing result in West London.",
      "The setback has intensified scrutiny on Amorim after last campaign's dismal 15th-place finish - United's worst in Premier League history. Former Arsenal defender Keown has now delivered a scathing assessment of Amorim's reign, drawing parallels with the pressure Graham Potter faced at West Ham before his dismissal on Saturday.",
      "\"It seemed obvious that [Graham] Potter was going to lose his job [at West Ham], so with Amorim, why is it not the same for him?\" Keown questioned on BBC Sport.",
      "\"Is it because we're now the ninth manager in 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson left? This stubbornness to play the same way - they look very ordinary.",
      "\"Mbeumo playing against his old team must be wondering 'what on earth have I signed for?' because the team he plays against, his old team, was way better than them today. This is Manchester United in dire trouble right now. Decisions need to be made.\"",
      "Amorim confessed to feeling \"hurt\" following Saturday's disappointing defeat at the Gtech Community Stadium. \"It's always the same to lose at this club, it hurts a lot,\" he expressed after the match. \"We need to think about the next one.",
      "\"Of course we want to win. We didn't control the game. We played the game of Brentford. First balls, second balls, set-pieces. All the crucial moments were against us. It's tough to lose again but we need to think about the next one.",

      "Ruben Amorim insists he is still the man to turn Manchester United around – despite defeat at Brentford piling the pressure back on him.",
      "Amorim has taken just 34 points from 99 since being appointed United boss nearly a year ago and won just nine of his 33 Premier League games in charge. United were 2-0 down after 20 minutes, with Brentford forward Igor Thiago scoring twice, before Benjamin Sesko pulled one back with his first goal since his £74million summer move.",
      "Skipper Bruno Fernandes missed a penalty to make it 2-2, with Brentford sub Mathias Jensen scoring with a fine strike in added time to compound United's miserable afternoon. Despite this latest setback, Amorim said he remains confident he can turn United around – despite their shambolic run of results under him suggesting otherwise.",
      "“I'm always doing my job,” said Amorim. “If I win, I'm in a different state of mind. That is normal, but I'm always confident, because I know what to do. It's my job and I'm not here just to protect the players. I'm trying to do what is best for the club and the team.",
      "“But that is the pressure of the club. So I'm just thinking what is the best way to win the next game. I'm not trying to protect the players or myself. I'm just trying to win the next game, create momentum.",
      "“I try to be really objective in my analysis of the game. Today we played Brentford's game, not our own game. And when you play the opponent's game, it's harder to win. When we win, it's not the system, when we lose it's the system. I understand that. I think it's more that we play this game like Brentford wanted to play this game.",
      "“We never settled down to play our game. We never pushed the opponent. We knew that every time they recovered the ball, they would make a run and they would fight for the ball. We need to work on a lot of things. My biggest concern is that we didn't settle down in the game. In the final third we missed a lot of crosses.",
      "“That's frustrating. We can do better with the ball. We can have more control. We can understand that sometimes when the decisions are not in your favour, the momentum is not in your favour, we can still control the ball.",
      "“When everything, the moments, the penalty, the foul before the first goal, all these things are against us, we need to have more personality to control the game and calm down the game.",
      "“When you win, you feel that everything, the momentum, is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and you fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.”",
      "United forward Matheus Cunha said: “Right now, to say something is really, really hard. We know how important it is to wear this shirt and win every game. It's very frustrating to come here and not win because we know every game in the Premier League is important for us this season. We need to do more.”",

      "Micah Richards has warned Manchester United that their backing of Ruben Amorim is failing to deliver results. The Red Devils suffered a 3-1 defeat at Brentford on Saturday afternoon, meaning they are yet to string together back-to-back Premier League victories under Amorim's guidance.",
      "United had hoped that last Saturday's 2-1 triumph over Chelsea at home could serve as a catalyst as they seek to gain traction under the ex-Sporting head coach. However, Igor Thiago's double in the first half and Mathias Jensen's late effort, in between Benjamin Sesko's maiden goal for United, meant the Red Devils returned from West London with nothing to show for their efforts.",
      "The loss has heaped additional scrutiny on Amorim following last campaign's 15th-place finish - easily United's poorest showing in the Premier League era. Former Manchester City defender Richards has now delivered his assessment - expressing his view that United's trust in their manager is proving fruitless.",
      "\"I think because Ruben Amorim is being so stubborn in what he's trying to do, it could be the undoing of him down the line,\" he told BBC Sport. \"We can talk about the owners backing him, but ultimately it's just not working.\"",
      "\"It's tough to lose again, but we need to think about the next game. The first goal was a long ball. We worked on that in the week and we worked on set pieces. We knew the long balls [were going to come], but one touch and they had the opportunity. We need to do better.",
      "\"We didn't play our game. We had control for some moments, but it was more or less all the same. We need to play our game, not the opponents', but they were stronger on that.\"",
      "Regarding the mounting pressure following yet another setback, he added: \"It is always the same to lose at this club. It hurts a lot. We need to think about the next game now.\"",
      "The defeat to Brentford leaves United in 14th place with just seven points from their opening six games and they take on Sunderland at Old Trafford next weekend.",

      "Manchester United are prepared to sacrifice getting any kind of transfer fee for Jadon Sancho as club chiefs lean towards letting him leave for nothing.",
      "It is a damning indictment of what has happened to Sancho's career at Old Trafford since they splashed £73million to sign him from German side Borussia Dortmund. The 25-year-old has become an outcast at United and is now on his third loan spell away from the club.",
      "After a stint back in the Bundesliga with Dortmund and last season's ill-fated spell at Chelsea, he's now on loan at Aston Villa. And the Villans are hopeful that they can get the ex-Manchester City youngster back to something like his best, before signing him permanently at the end of the season.",
      "At that point Sancho is hopeful of becoming a free agent. His current £200k-a-week deal at United runs out in June, but the Red Devils have the option to activate a 12-month extension to his current contract.",
      "That would subsequently allow United to demand a small fee, with the club aware that they simply won't see big money for the winger. But such a move would risk complicating a possible transfer for Sancho elsewhere.",
      "And it's understood United are so keen to see the back of Sancho, that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is prepared to let him walk out on the club for nothing - bringing to an end one of the most disastrous signings in English football history.",
      "That's good news for Villa, who will have first refusal from Sancho and his camp, if he can make a success of his spell in the West Midlands.",
      "Sancho joined United in 2021 in a £73m deal that was widely seen as something of a coup at the time, such had been the impression he had made in Germany. But he never made a significant impact and was loaned back to Dortmund following a public bust-up with ex-United boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "He made 31 appearances for Chelsea last term, and helped them win the UEFA Conference League. But Chelsea were forced to pay United a £5m penalty fee, after rejecting the option to make the deal permanent for £25m.",
      "Sancho returned to United in June, but became one of five stars to find themselves banned from joining the squad for pre-season training by manager Ruben Amorim. He was told to stay away and resolve his future, which he did by engineering a move to Villa.",

      "The centre-back is a long-time target of the Old Trafford top brass, who tried to sign him from the blue half of Merseyside before. But when the Toffees stuck to their asking price, that deal went away.",
      "However, United's interest in Branthwaite didn't and he remains their No.1 choice to replace Harry Maguire. The England defender turns 33 in March and is out of contract at the end of the season. The expectation is that United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe won't be giving Maguire an extension to his current deal.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is planning for life without Maguire next season, while he also has doubts about the long-term fitness of injury prone defender Lisandro Martinez.",
      "That will see United move for Branthwaite again - but Liverpool are also very keen on the 23 year-old. It remains to be seen whether Branthwaite would be willing to make the move across Merseyside, but it hasn't stopped others in the past.",
      "And there can be no doubt that right now, a move to Liverpool rather than United is likely to be more tempting.",
      "However, Everton won't be easy to negotiate with, given Branthwaite has a deal until 2030 and he's one of their prized assets. Yet United may test the water with a £65m bid in the January transfer window, looking to steal an early march on the Premier League champions.",
      "Branthwaite is regarded as one of the brightest young prospects in English football.",

      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to let down, frustrate and infuriate him and United's loyal fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "When Brentford's third goal in added time, their fans taunted Amorim with chants of \"sacked in the morning\" and their returning former hero, Bryan Mbeumo, with cries of \"Bryan, what's the score?\", sparing neither as they revelled in their deserved victory.",
      "Here, the seeds of United's latest setback were sown inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after United's chief executive Omar Berrada went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "After this defeat, Amorim now has just nine wins from 33 Premier League games. For all the talk from inside the club about an improved xG, fewer shots conceded, more shots on target and a significant upturn in the data, the only stat that matters is results, which have been lamentable.",
      "A season without European football was supposed to be a blessing in disguise for United and Amorim, giving him free weeks to work with his players on his philosophy and system, but that argument has proved illusory, with the players just as unreliable and clueless as last season.",
      "Amorim made three changes from the Chelsea win, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte and Matheus Cunha coming in for the injured Noussair Mazraoui, the suspended Casemiro and Amad, absent following a family bereavement.",
      "There was no first Premier League start of the season for Kobbie Mainoo, with Ugarte given the nod to replace Casemiro, who was serving a one-match ban following his red card in the victory over Chelsea.",
      "United fell behind in the eighth minute, the defence having pushed up, allowing Jordan Henderson to pick out Thiago, who let the ball bounce once before thrashing a shot past Altay Bayindir, the ferocity of the shot giving the keeper no chance.",
      "Thiago notched his second of the game 12 minutes later, Brentford again exposing United's weakness down the right side, Bayindir palming away Kevin Schade's dangerous ball, but only as far as Thaigo, who steered it back over the line for the hosts to establish a 2-0 lead.",
      "United did not look like scoring, but £70m summer signing Benjamin Sesko gave them a lifeline in the 26 th minute, scoring his first goal since his move from RB Leipzig, with a fierce finish high into the net.",
      "Amorim's side failed to build any real momentum thereafter and never looked like scoring, but earned another lifeline in the 75th minute when Bryan Mbeumo – returning to his old club for the first time since his summer move - was brought down by Bees skipper Nathan Collins.",
      "United skipper Fernandes stepped up to take the resulting penalty – after a lengthy VAR check to see if the challenge from Collins warranted a red card – but failed from the spot for the second time this season, following his miss in a 1-1 draw at Fulham, with Caoimhin Kelleher saving his effort this time. United's misery was compounded in the 95th minute, when sub Mathias Jensen made it 3-1 with a majestic strike after a breakaway move.",
      "Next up for United are Sunderland at home. Given how well the Black Cats have started on their return to the Premier League, that promises to be another unsettling afternoon at Old Trafford for Amorim and his under-performing players.",
      "If this wretched run carries on much longer, Amorim is likely to be put out of his misery and go the same way as his five predecessors, all of whom followed Sir Alex Ferguson and failed in what has now become the impossible job.",

      "Last weekend's win against Chelsea improved the mood at Old Trafford, but United were unable to build on that result. Amorim has won just 34 points from a possible 99 in the top flight during his time in charge and the Brentford defeat will increase the pressure on his shoulders.",
      "Sources confirmed Amorim retained the backing of the board after Grimsby Town defeat in the Carabao Cup, but further setbacks against Manchester City and Brentford have followed.",
      "De Ligt was the only United player to take time to speak to reporters as the players left the Gtech Community Stadium. The Dutchman was not included in the leadership group that was formed in the summer, but he is understood to have taken on a leadership role in the dressing room regardless.",
      "\"Really disappointed because all week we were speaking about keeping the momentum going, getting another win under our belt and yeah, if you lose this game, it's a big blow obviously,\" he said.",
      "\"Not a nice feeling, obviously. Everybody is really disappointed. I think first of all, they are disappointed with themselves. The first thing you have to control is yourself. And if you can do that, you are first disappointed with yourself, and then also with the team and the whole result, so really disappointed.\"",
      "De Ligt stressed United must stick together. \"It's the most important thing, it's the only thing we can do,\" he said. \"As I said, it's a lot of time the same song, but still we have to stick together.",
      "\"We lost against City, we won against Chelsea, so for the next game we have to analyse what went wrong in this game because a lot of things went wrong. We need to be prepared for the next game.\"",
      "When asked about what went wrong against Brentford, he responded: \"We were short in key moments where we made the wrong decisions. That makes a big difference in football.",
      "\"I think obviously we were quite unlucky also with some chances, but yeah, overall, it was not good enough. That's a fact. Then you know, against a team like Brentford who play on the transition, with long throw-ins and corner kicks, then it's going to be really difficult.\"",
      "De Ligt was signed by Erik ten Hag and the anniversary of his sacking is next month. Amorim looked like a manager under pressure on the touchline against Brentford, but De Ligt insisted the players must deliver on the pitch and cut out the mistakes that are leading to goals.",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" he said about taking responsibility. \"I mean it's always easy to look to the manager, but in the end, the players on the pitch have to do it. We can't say the goals we conceded, or the chances we conceded, are because of what... I don't know, you guys always talk about the system.",
      "\"That also has a lot to do with focus, concentration, and if that's lacking in key moments, it's going to make a difference. Against a Brentford team who plays like this, they will kill you.\"",
      "United made a fast start against Chelsea last weekend, but were unable to reproduce those levels against Brentford. \"I think we knew exactly what they were going to do,\" reflected De Ligt.",
      "\"It was the long ball to the strikers, the counter-attack. The first goal, I haven't seen it back. Obviously it was really tight. And yeah, then it's difficult. You're 1-0 behind, which is what you don't want.",
      "\"And then it goes 2-0 quite quickly afterwards. We came back quite well, we make it 2-1 and get a penalty. In my opinion... I'm not going to say [it was a red card], but the rules are the rules. But still, we have to do it ourselves and we didn't do it today. That's really disappointing.\"",

      "Gary Neville fears for Ruben Amorim's job prospects at Manchester United after Saturday's 3-1 defeat at Brentford.",
      "The Reds are yet to secure consecutive victories in the Premier League under Amorim after losing at the Gtech Community Stadium. United will have been hoping that their 2-1 victory over Chelsea last Saturday could signal a turning point as they aim to build momentum under the former Sporting boss.",
      "Despite Benjamin Sesko netting his first goal for United, a first-half brace from Igor Thiago and a late strike from Mathias Jensen ensured the Reds left West London with nothing. The loss has piled on more pressure for Amorim following last season's disappointing 15th-place finish - United's lowest in the Premier League era.",
      "And former United captain and defender Neville has delivered a worrying assessment of Amorim's future at Old Trafford.",
      "“I am very worried, there is no point in me sitting here and saying I’m not,\" he told NBC. \"The levels of performance, the results and the substitutions yesterday. I saw something at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing-back.",
      "“We admire managers who are stubborn and resilient around their system, we want them to stick to their plan, but when you have Mason Mount playing at left-back you are going to look pretty stupid.",
      "“It has happened twice now and it can’t happen. The first time I thought it was unforgivable and yesterday it happened again.",
      "“He changes his back three and his back five every single game and the performances and the results are just unacceptable.",
      "“I’m really, really worried. I would never go on television as I know how difficult a manager’s job can be and say a manager should be sacked, but I suspect the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to frustrate and infuriate him and United's fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "Here, the seeds of their latest setback were sewn inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals, the United boss left shaking his head at his team's continued failings.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after the United chief executive went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "After this defeat, Amorim now has just nine wins from 33 Premier League games. For all the talk from inside the club about an improved xG, fewer shots conceded, more shots on target and a significant upturn in the data, the only stats that matter are the results, which have been lamentable.",
      "Amoirm has still to win back-to-back Premier League games, despite being in charge for nearly a year, another shocking stat for the embattled head coach.",
      "A season without European football was supposed to be a blessing in disguise for United and Amorim, giving him free weeks to work with his players on his philosophy and system, but that argument has proved illusory, with the players just as unreliable and clueless as last season.",
      "Amorim made three changes from the side that secured a hard-earned 2-1 win over Chelsea a week earlier, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte and Matheus Cunha coming in for the injured Noussair Mazraoui, the suspended Casemiro and Amad, absent following a family bereavement.",
      "There was no first Premier League start of the season for Kobbie Mainoo, with Ugarte given the nod to replace Casemiro.",
      "United fell behind in the eighth minute, the defence having pushed up, allowing Jordan Henderson to pick out Thiago, who let the ball bounce once before thrashing a shot past Altay Bayindir, the ferocity of the shot giving the 'keeper no chance.",
      "Thiago notched his second of the game 12 minutes later. Brentford again exposed United's weakness down the right side, Bayindir palming away Kevin Schade's dangerous ball, only for Thaigo to steer it back over the line for the hosts to establish a 2-0 lead.",
      "United did not look like scoring, but £74m summer signing Benjamin Sesko gave them a lifeline in the 26th minute, scoring his first goal since his move from RB Leipzig with a fierce finish high into the net.",
      "Amorim's side failed to build any real momentum thereafter and never looked like scoring, but earned another lifeline in the 75th minute when Bryan Mbeumo – returning to his old club for the first time since his summer move - was brought down by Bees skipper Nathan Collins.",
      "Fernandes stepped up to take the resulting penalty – after a lengthy VAR check to see if the challenge from Collins warranted a red card – but failed from the spot with Caoimhin Kelleher saving his effort.",
      "Next up for United is Sunderland at home. Given how well the Black Cats have started on their return to the Premier League, that promises to be another unsettling afternoon at Old Trafford for Amorim and his under-performing players.",
      "If this wretched run carries on much longer, Amorim is likely to be put out of his misery and go the same was as his five predecessors, all of whom followed Sir Alex Ferguson and failed in what has now become the impossible job.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Sunday, September 28.",
      "Pressure is once again increasing on Ruben Amorim following United's 3-1 defeat to Brentford. The result leaves the club in 14th, behind Saturday's opponents who leapfrogged them as they ended their run without a win.",
      "United failed to make it back-to-back wins once again and their wait for successive triumphs in the Premier League will go on after they last enjoyed that feat in March.",
      "Amorim had already been under fire following their start to the campaign, but the scrutiny has increased with a crucial encounter against Sunderland next weekend before the international break.",
      "Former Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane has been tentatively linked, while there have been sensational reports of Sean Dyche and recently-sacked Graham Potter mooted to replace the Portuguese tactician.",
      "In transfer news, United have once again been linked with a move for Nigerian star Victor Osimhen.",
      "The forward currently plies his trade in the Turkish Super League after leaving Napoli. He has long been linked with a move to the Premier League, including last summer but it didn't materialise.",
      "Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane remains in the headlines and spoke recently about a possible return to the Premier League.",
      "Meanwhile, there is talk that Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is on the radar for United too.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day....",
      "Micah Richards has told Manchester United that their patience with Ruben Amorim is not working. The Reds lost 3-1 at Brentford on Saturday afternoon, ensuring they have yet to win consecutive games in the Premier League under Amorim.",
      "United will have hoped that last Saturday's 2-1 win at home to Chelsea could be a turning point as they look to build momentum under the former Sporting boss.",
      "But Igor Thiago's first-half brace and Mathias Jensen's late strike, either side of Benjamin Sesko's first goal for United, ensured that the Reds left empty-handed in West London. The defeat has piled further pressure on Amorim after last season's 15th placed fnish - comfortably United's lowest in the Premier League era.",
      "Read more here",
      "Gary Neville has admitted that he is \"very worried\" about the current state of Manchester United as he criticised performances and results from Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "He said: “I am very worried, there is no point in me sitting here and saying I’m not.",

      "Alan Shearer have slammed the decision to not send off Nathan Collins after being penalised for a foul on Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man United missed the resulting spot-kick but the former stirker feels that the defender should have been dismissed.",
      "He said: \"So they should [be aggrieved]. Yes, they got the penalty but what they didn't get, the officials, it should have been a red card as well.\"",
      "\"They get it right in terms of the referee's call: he gives the penalty for the pull back. But what they didn't get right was the yellow card check for Collins.",
      "\"They deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball, I mean honestly, it's just a terrible decision.",
      "\"He can't be in control of the ball because someone is pulling him back, he's a yard from the ball, clearly.",
      "\"Yes, [Fernandes] had to wait four-and-a-half minutes before getting to that decision but that's a mistake from him. [Collins] should have been sent off - absolutely no doubt about it.\"",

      "Speaking after Saturday's 3-1 defeat, he said: “Of course, I mean it’s always easy to look to the manager, but in the end the players on the pitch have to do it.",
      "\"We can’t say the goals we conceded, or the chances we conceded, are because of what… I don’t know, you guys always talk about the system.",
      "\"That also has a lot to do with focus, concentration and, if that’s lacking in key moments, it’s going to make a difference.\"",
      "Thank you for your comments on the live-blog so far, if you want to get involved, don't hesitate to have your say - but please keep it respectful.",
      "We've had one from Legend1990, who says: \"Ruben should put his pride aside and change his formation to one which fits the players current profile.",
      "\"Get some decent results then slowly change the formation into what he truly wants.",
      "\"If it doesn’t work out then it’s time to let him go. Shame because he is a good guy and we all want it to work out for him.\"",
      "That has been a common theme for the criticism for Amorim, this season. Often pundits and experts are picking up on his stubbornness to sway away from his system and those who discuss it, believe it's having a detrimental effect on the team.",
      "According to talkSPORT's Alex Crook and Ben Jacobs, Gareth Southgate, Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola are on the shortlist for new managers if Ruben Amorim is sacked.",
      "The former England manager has been out of the dugout since leaving in the wake of the European Championships defeat for the Three Lions.",
      "Glasner has guided Palace to European contenders and currently boasts an 18-match unbeaten run after beating Liverpool - ending their 100 percent record.",
      "Iraola has also worked wonders on the south coast, even managing to keep performing despite their entire backline being snapped up in the summer.",
      "Stick or twist? That's the question facing the Manchester United hierarchy.",
      "Far too many times in the last decade or so, they have been in this position where results haven't been great and they have been forced to make a decision.",
      "With the new era at Old Trafford, they have already made the bold call to sack Erik ten Hag and appoint Ruben Amorim.",
      "Ten months later, they're in a position where they face key decisions.",

      "\"We need to think about the next one.",
      "\"Of course we want to win. We didn't control the game. We played the game of Brentford. First balls, second balls, set-pieces. All the crucial moments were against us. It's tough to lose again but we need to think about the next one.",
      "\"The first goal was a long ball. We worked on that in the week, and on set pieces. We knew the long balls were coming and one touch they had the opportunity. We need to do better.",
      "\"We didn't play our game. We only had control for some moments. But it was more or less all the same. We need to play our games, not the opponents', but they were stronger on that.\"",
      "Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown questioned why Man United haven't sacked Ruben Amorim following his poor start.",
      "\"It seemed obvious that [Graham] Potter was going to lose his job [at West Ham], so with Amorim, why is it not the same for him?\" he told BBC Sport.",
      "\"Is it because we're now the ninth manager in 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson left? This stubbornness to play the same way - they look very ordinary.",
      "\"Mbeumo playing against his old team must be wondering 'what on earth have I signed for?' because the team he plays against, his old team, was way better than them today.",
      "\"This is Manchester United in dire trouble right now. Decisions need to be made.\"",

      "Dorgu just lost possession and Mbeumo waved his arms in frustration at the other side of the pitch.",
      "Here we go for the second half of the game in London.",
      "Here are your half-time ratings:",
      "Bayindir - exposed 6",
      "De Ligt - uncertain 5",
      "Maguire - hesitant 4",
      "Shaw - sloppy 4",
      "Dalot - erratic 5",
      "Ugarte - busy 6",
      "Fernandes - quiet 5",
      "Dorgu - determined 6",
      "Mbeumo - peripheral 5",
      "Sesko - clinical 6",
      "Cunha - industrious 6",

      "Dorgu just told Bayindir to calm down and take his time on the ball.",
      "Brentford fans just heckled Shaw for sending a long ball into the stands instead of finding Fernandes.",
      "Although United have not made the start they wanted, it's an entertaining game. The early-kick off slot can often produce slow contests, but there's a good pace to it and there has been chances at both ends.",
      "Sesko hardly celebrated and Amorim gestured his players to rush back for the restart - game on.",
      "Sesko has his first goal for United, although VAR are checking the goal for a foul in the build-up.",
      "United are undone once again, conceding a sloppy second, with the home fans singing “Bryan, what’s the score?” to their former forward Mbeumo, who left them for United in the summer. Amorim’s defence found themselves on the back foot again, Bayindir palming away Schade’s cross and very nearly kept out the rebound, which was turned in by Thiago, for his second of the game. It’s a long way back for the Reds from here.",
      "This could be a repeat of the embarrassing defeat 4-0 in August 2022. Brentford lost to Fulham last weekend, and this was a huge chance to build momentum after Chelsea. United have made a shocking start and have given themselves a mountain to climb in London.",
      "Thiago scores again for Brentford, who have been the dominant side in the opening exchanges.",
      "Bayindir made a save, but Thiago was there to tap in the rebound to make it 2-0.",
      "Cunha is becoming unhappy with Sesko, who picked the wrong pass just there.",
      "He had another word with him when the ball went out of play.",
      "Cunha comes close to producing an immediate response, just shooting wide of the post. United need to get him on the ball because he is bound to make something happen.",
      "Amorim is clearly not happy with how deep his United team are sitting, shaking his head and imploring them to push up.",
      "Moments later, United are caught cold, a long ball from Jordan Henderson met by Igor Thiago, who lets it bounce before thrashing it past Bayindir. United’s defence were convinced Thiago was offside, but after a VAR check, the goal stands and Brentford lead 1-0.",
      "That's a horrible goal to concede. It was far too simple to launch that ball forward to Thiago. Maguire was left isolated. Amorim did not look pleased before the goal, and certainly won't be happy now."

      "Manchester United have had their final Premier League points total predicted after their latest disappointment away to Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men fell to a 3-1 defeat in the capital. Although the game saw Benjamin Sesko score his first goal since signing for United, captain Bruno Fernandes failed to convert a crucial spot-kick that would have levelled the score with 14 minutes left to play.",
      "Instead, the Bees were able to add their final goal in stoppage time - meaning United have been left 14th in the Premier League standings after six matches.",
      "They possess a points tally of seven, which is eight fewer than current leaders Liverpool and only four above the bottom three relegation spaces.",
      "With that, Opta Analyst have been able to make a fresh prediction for how the final standings will look come the end of the campaign.",
      "They estimate that at their current rate, United will not budge from their current position. They will finish the 2025/26 campaign with a tally of 48 (47.94) points, which may be five higher than the total they managed in 2024/25 but suggests they will only collect another 40 points from their remaining 32 games.",
      "This would be 31 points fewer than the total predicted champions Liverpool have been given (79), and also 15 behind what is estimated to be required to beat Crystal Palace (63) to the last top-four spot and qualify for next season's Champions League.",
      "If anything, Opta's prediction suggests United should be looking over their shoulders as West Ham are estimated to finish in 18th - the highest space for relegation - with 37 points, therefore just 10 behind United.",
      "This kind of prediction does not bode well for Amorim at a time where speculation is rife about his future in the dugout at Old Trafford.",
      "But for all the suggestions he could be sacked, it does not concern Amorim. After the latest defeat, the boss told BBC's Match of the Day: \"I am never concerned about my job - I am not that kind of guy. It is not my decision. I will do the best I can every minute I am here.\"",
      "Speaking to the press, Amorim added: \"I'm always doing my job. If I win, I'm in a different state of mind. That is normal, but I'm always confident, because I know what to do.",
      "\"It's my job and I'm not here just to protect the players. I'm trying to do what is best for the club and the team.",
      "\"But that is the pressure of the club. So I'm just thinking what is the best way to win the next game.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has not even been Manchester United manager for an entire whole calendar year but is facing scrutiny over his position at the club.",
      "A 3-1 defeat at Brentford - a third in six total matches in the 2025/26 campaign so far - has left United stranded in 14th place. They are eight points shy of the top of the Premier League, four points off the top-four, and are the same total above the relegation zone at this early stage.",

      "With results in their current state, Amorim faces the same heavy pressure the Dutchman experienced this time last year.",
      "Seven points after six matches means 2025/26 is United's worst start to a Premier League season since they achieved the same tally at the same stage of the 1992/93 campaign.",
      "Equalling unwanted records such as this is naturally going to pile the pressure right back on Amorim.",
      "There was also the matter of exiting the Carabao Cup at the second round stage to League Two outfit Grimsby Town last month.",
      "This is all after spending £216m on three attackers this summer, who have scored a combined three goals between themselves, plus a back-up goalkeeper. No additions were made to the midfield or defence.",
      "Micah Richards is the latest to tell United their patience with Amorim is not leading to the intended reward.",
      "The BBC Sport pundit said: \"I think because Ruben Amorim is being so stubborn in what he’s trying to do, it could be the undoing of him down the line. We can talk about the owners backing him, but ultimately it’s just not working.\"",
      "Martin Keown also questioned the club's faith in the coach, adding: \"It seemed obvious that [Graham] Potter was going to lose his job [at West Ham], so with Amorim, why is it not the same for him?",
      "\"Is it because we're now the ninth manager in 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson left? This stubbornness to play the same way - they look very ordinary.",
      "\"Mbeumo playing against his old team must be wondering 'what on earth have I signed for?' Because the team he plays against, his old team, was way better than them today. This is Manchester United in dire trouble right now. Decisions need to be made.\"",
      "If United made the decision to relieve Amorim of his duties, they would incur a hefty cost.",
      "According to The Daily Mail, they would have to cough up £12m. The Portuguese was appointed on November 1, 2025, and signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with the option of a 12-month extension.",
      "United paid around £9.2m to buy him out of his Sporting CP contract, and should they decide to part ways within the first year of his contract, they will have to pay what is still owed as compensation.",
      "Rumours are already beginning to circulate about who could potentially replace Amorim in the dugout at Old Trafford.",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate, former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, and current Crystal Palace coach Oliver Glasner are three of the star names linked with the role. There have been tentative reports around Sean Dyche and even Potter, who became the latest Premier League managerial casualty at West Ham only yesterday.",
      "But BBC Sport report that 'shortlists of replacements having been drawn up have been dismissed by United officials, who are adamant no-one is being lined up to replace Amorim'.",

      "Brexit rules mean Manchester United's academy recruitment is limited to the United Kingdom. English clubs cannot sign talented teenagers from Europe under the age of 18.",
      "That means United must wait until a player from Europe celebrates their 18th birthday to act on their interest. However, players are usually tied down and more difficult to sign by that stage of their career.",
      "United still operate in the European market when opportunities arise and were proactive in wrapping up the signing of Enzo Kana-Biyik on a free transfer from Le Havre this summer.",
      "Since Ineos invested in the club, there has been increased activity in markets outside of Europe. Sekou Kone was signed from Mali in 2024, Diego Leon arrived from Paraguay this summer and United have struck a preliminary agreement to sign Colombian teenager Cristian Orozco.",
      "The defensive midfielder plays for Fortaleza CEIF, has captained Colombia's Under-17 team and helped his nation reach the final of the U17 South American Championship in the spring.",
      "United have identified Orozco as an exciting young talent with potential to progress to the first-team. However, Orozco will not be able to complete a move to Old Trafford until he turns 18 next year, so he will continue to play for Fortaleza CEIF until the transfer can be finalised in July.",
      "The same approach was taken with Leon. In January, United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, to sign Leon and he continued to play in Paraguay until relocating to Manchester this summer.",
      "Kone was signed for around £1m from Mali club Guidars FC. He was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "Having followed Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where Kone featured as one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament.",
      "The likelihood is that Orozco was tracked by United at the U17 South American Championship. Scouts were impressed by Kone's displays for Mali and Orozco has shown great potential with Colombia.",
      "Orozco will arrive in Manchester with a similar profile to Kone: young, raw and possessing huge potential. These kinds of transfers are essentially low risk and high reward for United.",
      "The best-case scenario is that a signing breaks into the first team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "United are planning for the future and trying to explore markets further afield more often. Other Premier League clubs have made more use of non-European markets and have landed some gems.",
      "Brighton have been the standard-setting team in the league for recruitment for some time now, and the Seagulls' data-driven approach has unearthed some wonderfully gifted players.",
      "United wanted to sign Moises Caicedo in December 2020, but the £5.5m asking price was too steep. Brighton agreed a deal and sold Caicedo to Chelsea just two-and-a-half years later for £115m.",
      "Ineos' decision-makers will be praised if Kone, Leon or Orozco can develop their games like Caicedo did. The only downside is they need time and patience to grow, which is something rarely afforded at United.",
      "Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources have indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand is fronting a new campaign this weekend to help end the stigma around parents discussing careers with their children.",
      "Ahead of this weekend's Premier League action, Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch Half Time Talks. The idea is for parents to sit down with their children during the 15-minute break to discuss more than just tactics but also their plans for their future careers.",
      "Ferdinand, alongside Talking Futures, have created online resources to help prep parents for what is arguably one of the toughest conversations they can have with their teenagers. When asked why he chose to front this new initiative, the former United Premier League and Champions League winner explained how he wanted to end the panic that sets in when talking about jobs.",
      "\"I just thought that I am in the sweet spot of people who need this type of information,\" he explained in an exclusive interview with MEN Sport. \"I have got three teenage kids, two boys and a girl.",
      "\"My two boys have made their mind up and want to be footballers, but my daughter is 14 and she is having a panic attack every time we mention careers because she does not know what she wants to do. We are saying to her, most kids your age haven’t normally got a clue what they want to do.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"If they have got their eye on something right now, it doesn’t always end up being that job that they go in. It is very, very fortunate if that’s the case.",
      "\"I think this initiative kind of helps parents talk to their children through football. At half-time, that is when you have got your kids engaged.",
      "\"That’s when parents have got that connection with their kids and it is at that time to broach the conversation about careers which is normally a difficult conversation for parents to have with their kids.\" At the Premier League matches this weekend, leaflets will be handed out about the Half Time Talk and further information will also be available for parents in the matchday programmes.",
      "And it is a lack of information which Ferdinand believes can only end up driving anxiety in the subject. \"You need the information at your fingertips to go and execute [a career] and not knowing creates panic and anxiety within families,\" he added.",
      "\"As a parent, you want to help your kids and give them the opportunities and that’s why I think it is important for families to watch the film that we have done - there are loads of tips and resources in there - to put you in the best position to help them get their hands on a good job that they can get up everyday and feel passionate about.\"",
      "You can download all the information you need to conduct a Half Time Talk here. Plus, you can view Ferdinand's analysis of the Sidemen Charity Match, with a careers twist, on YouTube here.",

      "Chido Obi was rested for Manchester United Under-21s' game against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.",
      "Travis Binnion named Obi on the bench for the opening Premier League International Cup game. The U21s have a busy schedule this month and the decision was made to give Obi a rest.",
      "Obi played the full 90 minutes in a league victory against Liverpool last Sunday. The U21s were still able to claim a 2-1 win against Bilbao to get their PL International Cup campaign off to a flying start at Old Trafford.",
      "Bilbao were leading 1-0 and were comfortable until Binnion made four changes on the hour mark.",
      "Shea Lacey, Amir Ibragimov, Finley McAllister and Gabriele Biancheri were introduced for Jayce Fitzgerald, Jim Thwaites, Victor Musa and Reece Munro, and the changes had the desired effect.",
      "Biancheri provided an assist for James Scanlon and scored a late match-winner in added time.",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "\"They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "\"That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Obi must continue to work hard to earn first-team involvement. \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games. If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘identified’ a left-field candidate to replace under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man Utd have endured a woeful start to the 2025/26 campaign as last season’s problems under Amorim have carried over into this term and there is no sign of improvement.",
      "On Saturday, the Red Devils were deservedly beaten 3-1 by Brentford, with a brace from Igor Thiago and late strike from Mathias Jensen condemning the Premier League giants to another damaging defeat.",
      "This result leaves Man Utd 14th in the Premier League, with Amorim leading the sack race following Graham Potter’s exit from West Ham.",
      "Naturally, Man Utd are being linked with several managers as potential replacements for Amorim, with Potter the latest to be mentioned.",
      "READ: Amorim has to be sacked as De Ligt, Ugarte and Thiago expose inept Man Utd manager",
      "According to Spanish outlet Fichajes, who are renowned for their reliability *wink*, Man Utd have ‘identified Potter as a possible replacement’ as they are ‘considering him’ as a successor.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Faced with persistent poor results, Manchester United’s board has begun to evaluate possible replacements for Ruben Amorim.",
      "‘One of the candidates that has gained the most traction is Graham Potter, recently sacked by West Ham United following a series of defeats that left the team second-to-bottom in the Premier League.’",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate has also been regularly linked with Man Utd in recent years and Joe Cole has explained why he thinks he is the “perfect man for the job”.",
      "“It’s not just a Ruben Amorim problem; there’s huge issues around the club. But he looks anxious on the bench, he looks worried, and I think that will filter through to the players.",
      "“The fact he hasn’t won back-to-back league games is a huge concern. They need a different direction in my opinion.",
      "“You know I don’t like saying that, but for him [Ruben Amorim] as well, he was the bright spark, people were talking about him like the messiah.",
      "“I thought Gareth Southgate was the perfect man for the job in terms of building a culture and understanding the players. They went with Amorim and it doesn’t look like it’s working.”",
      "Speaking after the loss to Brentford, Amorim revealed why he is not “concerned” about his job at Man Utd.",
      "“I am never concerned about my job – I am not that kind of guy,” Amorim told BBC Match of the Day.",
      "“It is not my decision. I will do the best I can every minute I am here.”",
      "An insider has revealed how long Sir Jim Ratcliffe will give Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as the boss has revealed he is “never concerned” for his job.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been in ‘direct contact’ with Gareth Southgate as Ruben Amorim faces being sacked.",

      "Ruben Amorim is on his last legs after another insipid Premier League display from the ‘trash’ that is Man Utd, as Bruno Fernandes is slammed.",
      "Manchester United have been slammed as “shambolic” and a pair of players called out for making individual errors, while Ruben Amorim’s system caused “100 per cent confusion.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is surely done for. The Man Utd defence is laughable, the midfield unworkable and there’s no great change in the forward fluency."

The names on the teamsheet might change, the manager on the touchline might change, but the cycle remains the same: fleeting flashes of hope followed by familiar disappointment.",
      "It’s become a grim ritual — one promising performance, then a string of losses, then the inevitable talk of “turning a corner.” Just when you think the nightmare might be over, United hit the reset button and we’re back at square one, stuck in the same endless loop.",
      "Like Bill Murray’s character, we wake up every morning expecting something different, only to realise it’s the same story we’ve been living through for over a decade: false dawns, wasted potential, and a club that doesn’t seem to learn from its mistakes.",

Massive stoppage, Bruno made to wait half an hour and then Brentford were allowed to delay the kick longer by making substitutions. You just knew he would miss after that.",
      "Either way, we didn’t create enough and were too weak in defence; particularly in the first 20 mins. Maguire stepping up to play offside was akin to a tectonic plate moving. Ironically on a par with VAR making a simple decision. We were 5 vs 2 for their second and still couldn’t get close enough. Start like that then you’re always up against it.",

He has conspired to bring a certain sehr schlecht element to our mannschaft, it’s just not quite clicking with him anywhere near the side and we look better when he sits, or we improve when he’s come off.",
      "Yes probably all very kneejerk as Salah, Konate, and later Frimpong, Jones and so many others were also excruciatingly poor today making it rather unfair to leave it all at the feet of the German. But we’ve paid an awful lot for this fella and he’s brought so very little to the side. He’s had a full preseason, he speaks the language fluently, he’s bedded in and fully settled, and he’s been utter shite on a huge wage. The fanfare has died.",

      "In truth I think 2-1 flattered us; on another day we are losing that by 3 or 4 goals. Kerkez just doesn’t quite look ready for this level of scrutiny and pressure. He probably benefit from the introduction that Robertson got when he signed by being the understudy until Christmas and getting all the low profile games for now.",
      "I think in the first half we tried to play a 4-4-2 with Wirtz in some sort of free role but I don’t think it quite suited. He did pop up in lots of places but I am not sure it really suited anyone else in the team. We looked so disjointed and were maybe guilty of overthinking the set up for this game. Gakpo and moving back to a 4-3-3 instantly made us look more balanced and dangerous.",
      "Finally we need to have a think about Salah. He’s not having a great season performance wise and I can’t help but think he’d benefit from a little break. He might be struggling to cope with the loss of Jota or he might just be tired from nearly a decade of top level football. I just don’t see how leaving him out there for 90 minutes every week is productive when he’s struggling to pass effectively and snatching poorly at chances.\nMinty, LFC",

What a phenomenal job done by him! Given that he’s out of contract next summer and assuming he doesnt sign a new deal, I imagine he’d be on the radar of quite a few big clubs (with all due respect to palace). If Arsenal come up short again this season, they should certainly be interested.

      "But can we all address the elephant in the room and I am honestly looking forward to some elucidation or correction from my fellow mailboxers. There were, in my humble opinion, two absolute shockers from VAR today. Firstly that was an obvious foul on Cunha for the first goal. The Brentford player absolutely plows through the back of him. Crickets. Secondly, can someone please explain to me how the last man pulling at Mbeumo and clearly preventing a clear goal scoring opportunity doesn’t receive a red?",
      "What is it that VAR actually does? Do they have a separate rulebook that they need to apply? One of those very subjective types with we can’t give a red because it will affect the game.

Only really Dorgu and Sesko offered any sense that they had turned up today, though there was little quality from United altogether.",

      "United put on another below-par performance, with Amorim still struggling to put his stamp on things. So far this season in the Premier League, the Red Devils have had the best xG of any club.",
      "And they were again positive on the front foot against Brentford, with more shots and more of the ball, yet they lost 3-1.",
      "Former Premier League defender Richards feels that’s the fault of Amorim, as while two players were called out for their roles in Brentford goals, it all boils down to the system not suiting them.",
      "Richards said: “Shambolic! I still think the system is hampering them. They’re not sure where they’re meant to be. In terms of the goals though, there were individual errors. Harry Maguire trying to play offside for the first one – there’s no point gambling there.",
      "“Then, for the second goal, [Matthijs] de Ligt doesn’t know where he’s going and then Maguire isn’t sure where to position himself. It’s 100 per cent confusion caused by playing that system – it doesn’t suit the players there.”",
      "Indeed, the camera operators couldn’t even catch up for the first goal, as a long ball was sprayed from nowhere after United lost possession, only for the broadcast to pick up Maguire chasing down Igor Thiago – to no avail as he slotted in the top corner.",
      "For the second goal, De Ligt followed a ball dropping behind the United defence, but changed his run to focus on the attacker the ball was going to land with, getting there too late, so a shot could come in, and the rebound was scored.",
      "Altay Bayindir was unable to save the rebound despite getting a hand to it, and might have proven Peter Crouch right in the process.",
      "Prior to the game, Crouch said: “It feels to me, the situation with the goalkeeper just hasn’t been addressed. I think it feels like they’ve got three No.2s. It’s an issue that was obvious, [Andre] Onana wasn’t going to be the No.1. I think we knew that. And I don’t think the situation’s been addressed.”",

      "It’s never a great sign when the producer of a broadcaster flips from a close-up reaction shot of a player to a wide image of someone bearing down on goal with no-one anywhere near him. Something has definitely gone wrong.",
      "The individual in question presumably, and quite reasonably, thought Matheus Cunha’s frustration at not being awarded a free-kick after Diogo Dalot’s poor pass spoiled a very presentable opportunity on the break for Manchester United would make for better TV than whatever might happen from Jordan Henderson’s hoof forward.",
      "They couldn’t have predicted the electric shock Harry Maguire appeared to be subjected to as his absurdly tardy and ill-advised decision to play offside saw him jump forward in vain, as Igor Thiago charged toward the United goal to create a delightful 30-yard gap between the pair by the time the cameras caught up.",
      "It was some strike. The sort of f***-it finish that would end up in row Z 99 times out of 100 as Thiago half-volleyed the bouncing ball in off the stanchion.",
      "And after Ruben Amorim’s worrying suggestion that Bryan Mbeumo is “different” to the rest of his teammates as he doesn’t immediately catastrophise after going behind, the summer signing was powerless to a collective sh*tting of the bed from the pessimistic Red Devils which ensued for the next 15 minutes and barely abated for the rest of the game.",
      "The widely condemned Altay Bayindir did indeed look like the “only line of defence”, as observed by commentator Darren Fletcher, with the Turkey international making two excellent saves in quick succession to deny Sepp van den Berg and then Nathan Collins, as United’s work on set pieces in the warm-up looked only to have confused them. Brentford were first to every long throw-in or corner delivered into the box. And to balls smashed out from the back.",
      "Thiago is a big lad, and there’s no great shame in losing an aerial battle to him, but there absolutely is in allowing him to chest the ball down to a teammate under no pressure from a ball punted from at least 60 yards. It was pathetic from Mattihjs de Ligt, as was his failure to then track Thiago into the box as he tapped the ball in to double Brentford’s lead.",
      "His United teammates could have helped him out of a bind, but didn’t, with Manuel Ugarte, Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw the firefighters with their d*cks in their hands.",
      "And in a clear example of the fragile confidence at United, after a very solid start to the season, certainly compared to last, De Ligt crumbled, misplacing passes, misjudging the flight of the ball and conceding needless free-kicks. We particularly enjoyed that bit when he air kicked and fell over in his own box.",
      "We didn’t see any great uptick in forward fluency as United’s £200m forward trio started together for the first time. Link-up between Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha ended with either a poor final pass or a timid effort from one or the other until Cunha’s cross for Mbeumo led to the United penalty. And while Peter Crouch claimed Benjamin Sesko’s goal was an example of his “commitment”, it is undeniably funny that he needed three shots to score from inside the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United may well have had the most shots (79), created the most chances (60) and accrued the most expected goals (9.7) in the Premier League after the first five games, but it never really felt as though the Brentford goal was under any great pressure.",
      "Amorim was proved right in sticking with Bayindir, who made another brilliant save to deny Dango Ouattara and keep his side in the game midway through the second half, but the space Outtara found himself in on the penalty spot begs the question as to why he continues to pick Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could be just as late in tracking back as the Uruguayan in such a situation, but also probably wouldn’t be, and wouldn’t either give the ball away or play a pass sideways or backwards whenever he has possession.",
      "And as predicted when the team news was announced, Amorim will face some difficult questions as to why he’s dropped Leny Yoro for the last two games after what looked to be a very assured start to the season. Both his speed and ability to progress the ball would have very useful here, and surely an improvement on what any of Maguire, De Ligt or Shaw provided.",

      "We thoroughly look forward to the PGMOL apology to Manchester United for somehow failing to advise Craig Pawson to even look at the pitch-side monitor as Nathan Collins denied Mbeumo one of the clearest goalscoring opportunities imaginable, particularly as the time it took to make that wrong decision contributed to an interminable wait for Bruno Fernandes to take the penalty which he then missed, as some excellent substitution sh*thousery from Keith Andrews made it a five-minute delay.",
      "United still had 15 minutes including stoppage time to draw level against a side which has dropped more points (8) from winning positions than any other team in the Premier League this season, but it was Brentford who added to their lead, with substitute Mathias Jensen combining with Yehor Yarmolyuk on the break before smashing the ball past Bayindir.",
      "Joe Cole described Manchester United as “abysmal” after the final whistle, but refused to pin the blame on Amorim, instead claiming it’s the old “culture of the club” problem rearing its head again.",
      "But f*** that. This is on Amorim. He picked the wrong team, his formation and tactics don’t work, and his players crumble at the merest hint of a hardship. If this isn’t the worst team in Manchester United history, it’s surely the easiest to play against. The best the fans can hope for is more false dawns under a manager not fit for purpose.",

      "Within the first few minutes of the match against Brentford, Bayindir both made a positive contribution, with a good double save, and undid that with the Bees second goal.",
      "Bayindir saved a tight effort from Kevin Schade, but parried immediately into the path of Igor Thiago, whose effort into the middle of the goal was met with Bayindir’s left hand, but he was unable to stop it, and he followed by punching the turf in frustration.",

      "Potter has been shown the door by the Hammers, with the side currently sat 19th in the Premier League. The call was curiously made after the boss had given his pre-match press conference for Monday’s trip to Everton.",
      "Multiple sources expect former Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo to take over.",
      "Some have suggested that Nuno will be in the dugout when West Ham take on the Toffees.",
      "The risks of one of Potter’s potential replacements, Gary O’Neil, have been reported, and our friends at TEAMtalk have got information from insider Jones about why Kieran McKenna is also not viewed as a serious candidate.",
      "He also detailed the potential of a Manchester United move for the Ipswich boss, who was formerly on the coaching staff at Old Trafford.",
      "Jones said: “I see links with McKenna, but I don’t see how either West Ham or Man United can gamble on him in this specific moment.",
      "“I know that West Ham have considered it to be too risky. Turning to a Championship manager is not a guarantee of things being any better than they are under Graham Potter.",
      "“By the same token could United really turn to the Ipswich manager if they decide that another high-profile appointment has not worked out? Obviously there are historical links, which make it seem somewhat feasible yet when you consider this is a club that were aiming to win the Premier League by 2028 it really would seem an extremely brave decision.",
      "“At some stage, McKenna is going to get an opportunity again in the Premier League but I do not see the current situation at either of those clubs being the moment that opens it up.”",
      "For West Ham, there is surely a perceived danger of McKenna not helping them avoid the drop, given he was relegated last season with Ipswich, and they’ll want a boss who they know can make a fist of the battle.",
      "At United, there’s an even bigger risk. Ruben Amorim is beginning to make his mark on his side, who have had the most xG of any side this season in the Premier League.",
      "To turn away from that for a manager who is currently in the Championship and has led his side to just one win there, there’s a huge danger that things will go wrong and they’ll put themselves in a tough spot.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘identified’ a left-field candidate to replace under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "A report has detailed the two key metrics West Ham looked for on their hunt for their next manager, as they landed on Nuno Espirito Santo to succeed Graham Potter, ...",
      "Joe Cole and Paul Merson have both hit out at West Ham for the timing of their sacking of Graham Potter, while the latter feels expected replacement Nuno Espirito Santo ...",
      "Graham Potter has been sacked by West Ham just five games into the Premier League season and his ‘expected’ replacement has been revealed.",
      "According to reports, Graham Potter has been ‘given’ a brief ‘stay of execution’ at West Ham United, who have been told to appoint Frank Lampard.",
      "West Ham will reportedly give Graham Potter until after the international break amid complications over Nuno Espirito Santo’s potential appointment."

      "Ruben Amorim has set himself up for criticism after three controversial selection calls as the Manchester United boss seeks back-to-back Premier League wins for the very first time as his side take on Brentford on Saturday.",
      "Amorim relieved some of the pressure on his shoulders through a 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out, but it didn’t feel all that much like a turning point with Robert Sanchez’s red card and Enzo Maresca’s substitutions in response giving the Portuguese boss and his players a huge helping hand.",
      "Rio Ferdinand reckons seven points from five games constitutes a “remarkable” start to the season, though that claim in itself is far more remarkable than two wins and a draw.",
      "Much of the criticism of Amorim, aside from the results and performances, has centred around his refusal to waver from his now infamous 3-4-3 system and how it’s failing to get the best out of his players.",
      "It’s left Kobbie Mainoo, who was one of United’s greatest hopes for the future before Amorim arrived at Old Trafford, with a bit-part role, with the midfielder – who also starred for England at Euro 2024 – again starting on the bench vs Brentford, as has been the case in every Premier League game so far.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, who looks nothing like the player he was under Amorim at Sporting, has come in for Casemiro as the Brazilian serves a suspension following his daft red card against Chelsea.",
      "But it wasn’t Mainoo who was trending on social media when the team news was revealed – his absence is no great surprise – but Leny Yoro.",
      "The feeling among many Manchester United fans is that he’s been their best centre-back this season, maybe second best behind Matthijs de Ligt, but having been dropped for the win over Chelsea, the 19-year-old has again been left out, with Amorim sticking with a back three of De Ligt, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.",

      "And the third controversial call sees Altay Bayindir retain his spot in the team ahead of summer signing Senne Lammens amid suggestions this week that the £18m summer signing may come in for the Turkey international and despite the 23-year-old impressing in training.",
      "“I think he’s got all the fundamentals to be excellent. Again he’s another young boy. He’s coming to such a big club with lots of pressure. But I know he will deal with it and I’m sure he’s going to have a long future at this club.”",
      "The Red Devils fans will see forward trio Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo starting together for the first time against Brentford as a huge positive, but the pitchforks will be out for Amorim if they fail to beat the Bees, with the likely focus of that frustration around the three young talents he continues to snub in favour of players without such promising futures, either at Old Trafford or beyond.",

      "Here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",

      "Even after five wins from five games there is a small yet irritatingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but that voice won’t quit.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Finally managed to win a game without needing a dramatic late goal against Everton, but didn’t quite put to bed those ‘weirdly flaky when 2-0 up’ allegations, either.",

      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal are broadly unscathed, yet it also does feel like they’re already playing catch-up from that all-too-familiar second place. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",

      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brought back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "It’s not been awful, but it’s really not been great either. Being above Manchester United is not the boast it used to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there could be more on the wagon.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening five games to go with a creditable draw against Newcastle is plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone – draws with Burnley less so – but it is an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "There is some good news, though, because Wolves have a much-needed appointment scheduled with Dr Tottenham this weekend.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "Bleak fare indeed, and you do wonder whether Emery might now be minded to take any opportunity to jump ship that comes his way before his reputation starts to sink with Villa’s league position.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. The 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea is not a turning point; they’ve run out of those.",

      "Former Liverpool coach Thomas Gronnemark has hit out at Arne Slot, Mikel Arteta and other Premier League managers over their “really ugly” strategy.",
      "Gronnemark is famed for working under Jurgen Klopp between 2018 and 2023 and has imparted his expertise on a number of top clubs and national teams as the world’s only professional throw-in coach.",
      "The 49-year-old used to hold the world record for the longest throw-in, at 51.33 metres and has spent 21 years carving throw-in niche for himself, but isn’t impressed by the standard of them in the Premier League this season as we see a huge uptick in the number of long throws.",
      "He claims “the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low” in what is a “really ugly” part of the game thanks to the poor strategy.",
      "“You can say there are many more long throw-ins in the Premier League. You can say ‘isn’t that good?’ No, not necessarily! There are far too many teams taking low-quality long throw-ins. Some of the throw-ins are just not long enough, so they’re not dangerous, and sometimes it’s about the strategy,” Gronnemark told Mirror.",
      "“It’s also about entertainment for the fans. People might think that a guy who coaches long throw-ins wants a lot of them. Actually, I don’t. I don’t want to see every team take 10 long throw-ins in every game because then we have too much start and stop.",
      "“People just look at the best teams and say ‘they’re having real success data-wise, so we’ll do the same’. But they are forgetting that there’s a lot of work, many years’ worth, behind it. You have to do space creation around the opponents’ penalty area.",
      "“To be honest, for most teams, throw-ins are a really ugly part because the quality is so low, the ball is being thrown into high-pressure situations where there are duels,” he explains. “There are too many chaotic throw-ins in the Premier League: the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low. Possession rates are at around 25 to 33 per cent on throw-ins under pressure. The standard is really low.",
      "“When I was at Liverpool the quality went up, but it’s started to go down again. I think one of the reasons is that they’re only training one or two routines in each zone. Yeah, it can work but your players have to learn to think throw-ins.”",
      "MORE LIVERPOOL COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Liverpool: New Romano update on Reds star suggests only one outcome of ‘difficult conversation’\n👉 Arsenal: ‘Fed up’ Paul Merson proves panic with two kneejerk PL title predictions amid baffling U-turn\n👉 Arsenal title hopes ‘kaput’ this weekend on two conditions: ‘Liverpool big favourites’",
      "Gronnemark has been working with Brentford this season and they stand out as a team benefitting from their use, having put 23 into the opponents’ penalty area this season, resulting in one goal, 11 shots and 1.29 xG.",
      "“If you’re a world-class throw-in taker, it’s much easier to put the ball where you want with a throw-in than with a corner kick,” he added. “How many corners hit the first man? It’s hard to kick with your foot. It’s much easier to throw with your hands if you have the right technique.",
      "“There are a lot of set piece coaches now and a lot of them treat the throw-in like a corner or a free-kick.",
      "“So they say ‘we can have one or two routines in each zone’. But the challenge is that the opponents’ defending pattern will already mark this from the start then the players have a big challenge.",
      "“Even with the biggest teams in the Premier League, you can see that if they make one move and it doesn’t work then the players don’t know what to do – they’re getting confused, frustrated because they don’t have a high throw-in intelligence.”",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot hit out at one of his players for costing his side against Crystal Palace, while another player “didn’t know what he was doing”.",
      "Arne Slot has confirmed that Liverpool defender Geovanni Leoni will miss “around a year”, but refused to say he regrets missing out on Marc Guehi.",
      "Arne Slot has revealed how he “disciplined” Hugo Ekitike following his “stupid” red card in Liverpool’s win over Southampton on Tuesday.",
      "While Hugo Ekitike’s red grabbed the attention, another moment in Liverpool’s victory over Southampton would have been far more worrying for Arne Slot.",
      "Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy reckons Hugo Ekitike has a “bee in his bonnet” after being sent off against Southampton on Tuesday night.",

      "What’s the ‘only reason’ Ruben Amorim hasn’t been sacked by Manchester United? And which two Red Devils heroes are poised for a caretaker role?",
      "Amorim relieved the pressure with a 2-1 win over Chelsea last weekend but there has been no great sign of improvement after leading them in their worst season in living memory last term.",
      "Incredibly, a trip to Brentford on Saturday lunchtime offers the Portuguese boss the opportunity to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time as Manchester United boss.",

      "Carrick is currently without a club having been let go by Middlesbrough in the summer, while Fletcher is coaching the United U18s.",
      "“Short term, I wouldn’t be surprised at [Carrick or Fletcher to replace Amorim] at all,” Nevin said, speaking to gaming news publisher Escapist Magazine. “That would be absolutely fine. And they might do well.",
      "“They offered the caretaker role to Ole first didn’t they. It takes the pressure off, you can have a good look around. And if he does well, we just keep him. That’s fine. You’ll get a bit of pressure in the press saying, ‘They don’t know what to do, they haven’t got a clue, they can’t get the right man, all that sort of stuff.’",
      "“I”ve been there before. I just blanked it. I don’t care. I’ve got a guy doing a good job here and I wouldn’t look for the other manager. And I’ll say to them, ‘If you keep on doing well, you can get a job.’ I’m not hiding anything from anyone here. I’m looking at every possible option.",

      "“Maybe that’s been United’s problem. They’ve tried, they’ve had plans. They’ve had two, three, four, five year plans that have all lasted a year. And that’s not good. Because the next person comes in and they change it, the next one changes it.",
      "“That’s the only reason why they’re standing by Amorim just now. It’s because they know they didn’t spend time with the other ones, so we now end up with a Frankenstein team. All bought by different managers. None of it really fits together. And then you find out they got rid of some people they shouldn’t have gotten rid of like McTominay.”",

      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "And why are Football365 trying to get Ange Postecoglou sacked?",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Longtime reader, first time mailer. Naturally I decided to pop the cherry on a safe and non-controversial topic: Marcus Rashford.",
      "I think the problem with what Ian Watson and a handful of Mailbox ultras have been saying about the ongoing Scholes/Rashford drama is that they think that the reason why what Scholes said is problematic is solely because of the content. It’s not. It’s the very presence of the comment in a public space.",
      "To explain: Paul Scholes is fully entitled to enjoy (or not enjoy) any opinion of Marcus Rashford that he likes. He can hate him for any number of reasons, including – and this is important – stupid, nonsensical ones. Furthermore, as a United fan it makes perfect sense for him to resent Rashford up and leaving them, and there is no sense in demanding that he or any United fan wish him the best.",
      "The problem is that Paul Scholes is not just a United fan. He is a massively famous pundit who is paid, I imagine, a lot of money to talk about football. And what irks me about him STILL moaning about Rashford is just how utterly unnecessary it all is at this point. Love them or hate them, United this season are absolutely delicious narratively. They are either a sleeping giant about to awake or an old palace burning down, depending on your outlook, but the one thing that is totally not part of this saga is Marcus bloody Rashford. He is GONE. It is time to MOVE ON.",
      "I guess what I’m saying is that there seems to be an assumption from old pros that their every opinion deserves to be heard, all the time, no matter what. But I don’t particularly give a monkey’s what Scholes thinks of Rashford as a person. I’m interested in what he thinks of him as a footballer, but modern pundits aren’t quite as vocal on that subject.",
      "There is also something so bitter and nasty about Scholes saying what he said, because as much as it’s fair to hold Rashford responsible for his performances at United, it’s also important to bear in mind that the club wanted him gone. It was generally accepted that he had to go in the summer for his own good and the club’s. So with that in mind, what is the point of seeing a young man finding a new lease of life after years of sullen, uninspired football, and then nastily snipe him from the pundit box? It smacks of spitefulness and is one of the many reasons why I think all the Alex Ferguson old boys – Scholes, Keane, Ferdinand and Neville – have been absolutely toxic for both punditry and United as an institution. If we must talk about United then let’s talk about United, if we must talk about Barcelona let’s talk about Barcelona, but swiping at Rashford for his bad performances last season just drags down the conversation. I would expect better from a man of Scholes’ age.",
      "Correct opinion? Maybe. I don’t think so personally, but that’s not really the point. Why does it actually need to be said, is the real question. Does it enlighten the fans? Does it explain United’s struggles this season? Does it explain Barcelona’s success? No. It’s just meaningless negativity, like so much of modern football.",
      "It also is yet another example of United old boys finding a way to tear down a young black man no matter the situation. Every single time. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, this mail is long enough as is.\nSamuel, Fulham fan till the end",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "I hope you are all well (or at least caffeinated). I just read two recent F365 takes on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Let me save you some time: I don’t care whether Rashford sulked at Manchester United.",
      "Before you throw a tomato at me for lack of nuance, allow me to explain:",
      "1. Sulking is a spectator’s hobby",
      "If a player is walking, moody, whispering dire oaths in the tunnel — I’ll raise an eyebrow, maybe tweet (sorry X) about it, but I’m not launching moral crusades. Football is messy. Players are people. Sometimes they sulk. Big deal.",
      "2. Would you want to play in the current Manchester United team?",
      "Let me ask you this, dear reader: if someone handed you a contract today to play for this Manchester United — the board, the chaos, the constant managerial churning, the pressure to be more myth than person — would you take it?",
      "Because spare me the nostalgia of “United would have done this” — the United of today is a far cry from the Fergie glory years.",
      "3. Rashford is doing well at Barça",
      "While some are busy flinging “disgrace” accusations, Rashford has started making noise in Barcelona. He’s scoring, contributing, adapting. He’s quieting critics the best way — by playing. And (whisper it) I happen to think that’s more compelling than being praised from my cheap seat at Old Trafford.",
      "4. Even Alex Hunter wouldn’t want to play for Manchester United",
      "Yes, I just dragged a FIFA video game character into this. But hear me out: Alex Hunter (from the FIFA story mode) has tons of dramatic options. If the script handed him the chance to play for Man Utd — under the current regime, under the weight of expectation and instability — I reckon he’d look at his agent and say, “Nah, I’ll play for a mid-tier side and enjoy my life.”",
      "Because even in fantasy land, there’s an escape clause.",
      "So here’s my bottom line: you can publish/ podcast a hundred think-pieces dissecting Rashford’s body language, demeanor, or public statements. But unless you’ve walked in his boots — including the ones he’s now laced up in Barcelona — you should STFU and don’t get to claim moral high ground.\nGaptoothfreak, Man. Utd. fan with too much time, New York",

      "Long, long time reader of 2 decades. Occasional letter writer.",
      "I wrote in last year about how the site is actively trying to generate managerial sackings and drama, to create negative narratives about clubs, managers and players. For clicks I assume, and instead of analytical articles that are harder to write. The standard of writing has fallen a long way.",
      "I have a 15 year old daughter who has a longer concentration span, and is less fickle and emotional,  more mature . The knee jerking and need to create a story is a far cry from earlier years, where there was mature reporting and genuine humour.",
      "Now we have a site that is essentially a list of top 10s. “Next manager to be sacked“,  “Top 10 replacements for Ange”. A couple of bad results and the narrative begins “X is under pressure”.",
      "Ange has had 4 games. 4 away games. He had a couple days before the Arsenal game, so essentially 3 games. All away. 2 draws where they dominated. Let’s start building an Ange out narrative, spread it across social media until it reaches fans who put pressure on the owner and he pulls the trigger so you can say “we were right”.",
      "He won a major trophy, got Spurs into the CL. Recruited a large number of excellent players. Such is the poor attention span and need for instant gratification people are now disregarding a 5th place finish in his first season. He got lucky at the start of the season apparently. Trying to paint him as though he’s a village idiot. There was a zero percent chance of Spurs going down at any time, and he knew it, so switched attention to CL qualification.",
      "Would fans rather win a trophy or finish 8th? Who had a better season last year, Spurs or Villa? One won a trophy they’ll be talking about for generations, qualified for the CL. Would you rather finish 6- 8th every year, play conservatively and have a cup run?",
      "Oh, and now apparently Emery, the golden boy of the last 2 seasons is now under pressure after a slow start, according to 365. His last 2 seasons don’t count anymore because of a few poor games.",
      "Jesus.\nFadida",

      "Read that Sulivan is considering Bilic as manager with Mark Noble and James Collins as assistants. This beggars belief but perhaps helpfully demonstrates the board’s thought process.",
      "While Nobes and the ginger Brazilian will always be club legends, we all know that the ‘club player to manager role’ route is almost always a complete disaster. And Bilic is conspicuously out of work. So for Sullivan, he thinks “fan favorites, and they are all so thick that this will therefore surely stop the protests, tick, “costs me absolutely nothing”, tick. That’s how shallow and clueless this guy is.",

      "xG is pretty meaningless in telling you about how an individual game has gone. A late goalmouth scramble having been under the cosh all game can massively boost a side’s  xG but isn’t reflective of the whole. The stat only becomes relevant when viewed over a sweep of games, and can then be used to tell you trends of many goals a team should be scoring/conceding and whether they’re getting lucky.",

Not like the weird, yet heart-warming feeling of seeing early Shearer footage in the red and white of the Draper Tools kit – but actually quite horrifying.",
      "Then it gots me to thinking… who could never have worn anything but their last clubs shirt?",
      "I don’t think it’d have bothered me to see Giggs or Scholes wear an Arsenal shirt for example and that’s not an indictment on those two, just, some players would look ghastly in another teams shirt and the initial ones that come to mind are:",

      "Every Arsenal game currently seems to be wracked with tension, and a trip to Newcastle will be no different on another Big Weekend.",

      "However, injuries and poor form have impacted the Man Utd star in recent years and Keane blasted him for his poor performance in his side’s 3-0 loss against Manchester City.",

      "“I think he has been getting away with murder for years at United. Always injured and never quite fit.",
      "“We make excuses and then he gets a few games under his belt and he’s making decisions like he doesn’t even want to tackle anyone.”",
      "Shaw subsequently issued an honest response, admitting that the pundit had a point as he needs to do better for Man Utd.",
      "The left-back has since been defended by teammate Harry Maguire, with Ferdinand taking time to praise the two defenders.",
      "Ferdinand has backed Shaw to respond by “putting in a performance” against Brentford this weekend.",
      "“Personally I think it is great from Harry Maguire because that is the job of a captain/senior player to come in and defend your players if you think that they are being unfairly treated,” Ferdinand told MEN Sport.",
      "“I also think Luke Shaw coming out and speaking himself is what I like.",
      "“I like to see players come out and go: ‘You know what, I am not having that or actually, they are right. I was under par for the level that I have set myself.’",
      "“I am sure he will put in a performance this week Luke Shaw, that will make you think: ‘He is made of the right stuff.’ I just think that Luke Shaw is a magnificently talented player, he has just been so unfortunate with injuries that he has never been able to maintain his fitness and it goes back to that word again, consistency.",
      "“If you can’t be consistent with appearances and being available, it is going to be difficult for you to really stamp your authority and really sustain the level of performances that is required for a top club.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand thinking Man Utd have been ‘remarkable’ is far more remarkable than their start to the season under Ruben Amorim. How the mighty have fallen.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has criticised Benjamin Sesko after the striker had just six touches in the first half against ten-man Chelsea.",
      "Mikel Arteta isn’t a gambler like Sir Alex Ferguson was, and that could cost Arsenal the Premier League title, says Man Utd legend Roy Keane.",

      "Ruben Amorim is a man now famed for his honesty in press conferences. If anything, he’s too honest.",
      "The Manchester United chiefs weren’t all that enamoured with his response to questions about Kobbie Mainoo’s future, for example, nor his threats last season to walk away from the club if results didn’t improve.",
      "That integrity is a key part of his charisma, which was supposedly a key draw for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses when selecting the Portuguese boss as their replacement for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But again, with Brentford incredibly offering up an opportunity for Amorim to earn back-to-back Premier League wins for the very first time, when asked by a reporter in the press conference what the key to consistency is for Manchester United, we would advise Amorim against “complete honesty” when it’s an admission of ignorance.",
      "“It is normal that the fans don’t know what is going to happen in the next game. To be completely honest, I have an idea, but I don’t know how it’s going to be and I’m the manager of the team! The best way of dealing with that is every game is the last one.”",
      "We enjoy self-deprecation as much as anyone, and understand that it’s no more than a jovial, throwaway comment from a man under pressure; someone quite frankly embarrassed that after ten months in charge of one of the biggest clubs in world football he’s yet to win two league games on the bounce.",
      "Without similarly cheeky lines he may not still be in the job, with his press conference manner the key to this aura of stability and confidence he’s managed to fabricate for himself despite the chaos on the pitch.",

      "And of course, like any other football manager, he doesn’t really know what’s going to happen in any game. It’s presumably why he loves football, if he does indeed still love it.",
      "But five games into a new season in which there’s been no great sign of progress after leading them in their worst campaign in living memory, not knowing whether his team is going to be any good or not feels awfully close to the bone of contention that he doesn’t know how to turn things around at Old Trafford.",
      "No Manchester United fan will be turning up for this clash at Brentford tomorrow with any clue as to how their team perform on a scale from not bad to terrible, but should the manager not have more than “an idea”? Or at least put the brutal honesty on hold and claim that he does?",
      "Because as much as anything, we’re not sure it’s an admission the famously fragile Manchester United players will be using as any great motivation to break this two-game hoodoo."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has won nine of his 33 games in the Premier League and is yet to record consecutive victories in the competition 10 months into the job. The momentum of victory over Chelsea vanished when his side were beaten at Brentford for a third time in four visits",
      "Sunday 28 September 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went to Brentford in search of their first back-to-back league wins under him, which tells you all you need to know about the progress made in the 33 games since he took charge.",
      "Amorim described the game as the club's \"most important in a long time\" but his players failed to translate that urgency onto the pitch as they suffered a deflating 3-1 defeat.",
      "Victory over 10-man Chelsea last week was unable to inspire the consistency that will ultimately be required to keep Amorim in a job and they have sunk back into the bottom half of the table. So where does Amorim go from here?",
      "It was once again so obvious that United's set-up was a massive issue at Brentford.",
      "Forget criticism of playing three at the back, others have shown it is no impediment to success. It is Amorim's insistence on leaving his two-man midfield pivot exposed that comes back to bite him time and again.",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three-at-the-back system, while keeping a midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were overrun by Brentford, who richly deserved the three points.",
      "Amorim did not seem to want to acknowledge those issues after the game. \"It's always the same, when we win it's not the system, when we lose it's the system,\" he said.",
      "So far, we've yet to see Amorim's United dominate a top team in the Premier League that has a full accompaniment of players. After Casemiro's red card last week, Chelsea made United sweat for the win.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews, who was in charge of set pieces in the club's set-up under Thomas Frank last season, explained after the game how his side overloaded United's midfield.",
      "\"It's the natural way you prepare for games,\" said Andrews, when asked if he targeted United's midfield. \"You try and create overloads,\" he added.",
      "\"One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in, then they have a four'. But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through [them], at times, would be on.\"",
      "Andrews, in his first season as a senior head coach, demonstrated the value in adaptability on Saturday, while Amorim finished the game with Mbeumo and Mason Mount as his wing-backs.",
      "Defeat at Brentford means that is exactly where United will start the month after finishing last season 15th in the table despite a spend of more than £200m over the summer on a new strikeforce, who failed to impress on their first outing together at Brentford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did manage to score his first United goal, though there was little spark between himself, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players,\" Neville, the former United captain, said at the time.",
      "United's decision-makers are behind Amorim, but another defeat when Sunderland go to Old Trafford next week would ramp up the pressure on the head coach over the international break.",
      "However, Amorim, who has reportedly offered his job up on more than one occasion, says fears about potentially being sacked do not enter his mind.",
      "\"I'm always comfortable with the job,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "Amorim got a message of backing after the Manchester derby defeat. You wonder how many more set-backs he can survive before patience runs thin.",
      "Results are the only thing that can save Amorim and he knows that. His record in the league stands at nine victories in 33 games. That is a win percentage of 27.3 per cent, lower than any other to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson by some distance.",
      "United have made a habit of starting games at a fast pace this season, certainly against Arsenal, Fulham, Burnley and Chelsea. Amorim wants his team to get off to a good start because he knows what happens when they don't.",
      "Each league game this season in which United have conceded the first goal, they have lost.",
      "The pressure cooker of Old Trafford has been too much for most players to sign for the club over the last decade and Amorim is trying to find a way to build confidence in the way his team plays.",
      "He has enjoyed some success with this, at least in United's home games, but at Brentford, there was no sign of the electric start that overcame Chelsea. Without the crowd, the players struggle to cope.",
      "This is reflected by their current eight-game winless run away from home in the league. The last one came in March at Leicester, who were relegated a month later.",
      "Before that, it was at Fulham at the end of January. United were hardly convincing in that game either. Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike just got them over the line.",
      "The mental fragility - and inability to cope without the support of Old Trafford - is a huge hindrance to Amorim's bid to bring consistency back to United.",
      "\"It's like ups and downs,\" said Amorim, when asked about this latest setback.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything and that the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"I cannot tell you more than I say every time I lose the game. Sometimes you see one team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you have some games that you don't see the improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.",
      "\"It's always the same conversation.\"",
      "Amorim has been in the job for 10 months and is yet to win consecutive games in the league. Momentum feels extremely distant right now."

      "United were 2-1 down as Fernandes waited more than four minutes to take his second-half spot-kick which was eventually saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after VAR checked if Nathan Collins should have been sent off for denying Bryan Mbeumo a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson's decision to book Collins was upheld, without him being sent to the monitor, despite the Brentford defender making no clear attempt to play the ball when pulling his former team-mate back by the shoulder.",
      "Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball.\n\n\nIn all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.",
      "United only have themselves to blame for the result, their third defeat in a four-game winless run at Brentford, that was sealed when Mathias Jensen struck a superb third goal in stoppage-time. All the momentum of the win over Chelsea had vanished.",
      "Brentford were two goals up after 20 minutes thanks to Igor Thaigo's first-half double and, although Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit six minutes later, United were never convincing in their fight-back.",

      "Amorim disagreed with the decision not to send off Collins but said his team should have done more to manage the game after Fernandes failed to convert his penalty.",
      "\"They told me Bryan was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled,\" Amorim said in his post-match press conference.",
      "He added: \"Sometimes the decisions are not in your favour. We have the capacity to calm down the game. We didn't do that today.\"",
      "Former Premier League official Mike Dean, speaking on Soccer Saturday, was in agreement: \"For me, it is a red card.\"",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three at the back system, but head coach Keith Andrews kept his midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were outnumbered and overrun by Brentford.",
      "Asked if he felt it was an area to target, Andrews said: \"It's the natural way you prepare for games. You try and create overloads. One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in then they have a four.",
      "\"But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through, at times, would be on. And I felt, going back to it, the players did that with real courage and conviction.\"",
      "On goalscorer Thiago, Andrews added: \"He's getting real rhythm in his game now and confidence in his game. He's shown exactly why the football club brought him here. He's such a powerful player. Very positive individual and very selfless.\"",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Old Trafford. They came to Brentford in search of the club's first back-to-back league wins under Amorim, but Thiago scored twice in the first 20 minutes before the United players had woken up.",
      "Harry Maguire was culpable for the opener as Jordan Henderson's long ball over the top caught him napping. Thiago was all alone when he hammered in the opener. The whole stadium thought he was offside, only for replays to show Maguire was slow off the mark.",
      "United, losers in every league game in which they have trailed this season, were unable to cope with Brentford, who terrorised their visitors from set-pieces. Altay Bayindir made two fine saves from Henderson and then Collins but was at fault for Thiago's second.",
      "The Brentford striker just had to fire in from close-range after Kevin Schade's cross was spilled by Bayindir in the six-yard box. Thiago needed just six touches to score his two goals, which takes him to five in seven games this season.",
      "This was the first time Amorim had started United's £207m front three of Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha but the first impression was not a positive one. Their lack of desire to help in midfield left the pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte exposed.",
      "Sesko did manage to break his United duck in his fourth start for the club as Patrick Dorgu's hopeful, looping cross eventually found him. It took three goes to beat Kelleher from close-range, the former Liverpool keeper pulling off a couple of fine saves.",
      "Brentford taking their foot off the gas gave United encouragement, though they lacked punch. When the spot-kick was awarded it felt like the piece of luck that Amorim needed to turn his troubled tenure around, but Fernandes let him down.",
      "There was no response from United as Brentford took further encouragement before adding a deserved third in stoppage-time through substitute Jensen. His swerving shot finished centrally to make Bayindir look foolish. He was not the only one.",

      "In Villa's last 14 Premier League games an opposition centre-midfielder has been carded in 12 of those matches with 16 carded in total. Fulham have history of cards in this fixture too, having been shown 20 yellows in the past five meetings, with Berge one of those players cautioned last time.",

      "Well, the maverick inside is being unleashed by David Moyes and Grealish is the most creative player in the Premier League as a result. Grealish has four assists, creating 2.9 chances per 90 from open play - no player to have played 200 minutes or more has a higher per-90 figure from that metric. He is 11/4 with Sky Bet to bag another assist in what should be a routine home win.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",

      "Speaking after the game, Amorim remained level-headed regarding his team's performance and called for them to create momentum moving forward.",
      "\"I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls.",
      "\"We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two.",
      "\"We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "Pressure had been ramped up on Amorim and his side in the build-up to the visit of Chelsea, which arrived as the following fixture to a dismal 3-0 defeat to local rivals Manchester City.",
      "Speaking after that loss, both Gary Neville and Roy Keane outlined their worries for United, with the former saying a loss to Chelsea would have caused \"big questions\" to be asked of Amorim.",
      "The United boss continued: \"People don't have too many good things to say about our team and our results.",
      "\"I understand that, I'm just joking around all the time. I have nothing to say to the critics; they are right most of the time. But we won, and that's a good thing for us.",

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 13:08, UK",
      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",

      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",
