      "TNT Sport co-commentator Lucy Ward has suggested that Brentford head coach Keith Andrews made a double substitution before Bruno Fernandes' penalty on purpose. United were awarded a spot-kick when Bryan Mbeumo was pulled to the floor by Nathan Collins inside the box.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men were putting pressure on the Bees to level the scoring after Igor Tudor scored twice in the first 20 minutes at the Gtech Community Stadium. Benjamin Sesko halved the deficit with his first goal for the club, with Matheus Cunha coming close to levelling.",
      "Towards the end of the game, United were awarded a penalty when Collins pulled Mbeumo to the ground inside Brentford's penalty area after Cunha's early cross. Referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot after a brief pause before the video assistant referee reviewed the footage for a red card.",
      "Collins escaped a red card, and Fernandes missed the penalty, his second spot-kick miss of the season. However, due to the check, the Portuguese was forced to wait close to five minutes between the penalty being given and it being taken.",
      "A double substitution from the home side also added a further delay. Andrews replaced Dango Outtarra and Aaron Hickey with Keane Lewis-Potter and Rico Henry.",
      "\"He (Keith Andrews) did that on purpose and he's got his reward for it,\" she claimed.",

      "Bruno Fernandes missed his second penalty of the Premier League season as Manchester United reverted to type in a disappointing defeat at Brentford. United came into the game on the back of the 2-1 win over Chelsea, yet familiar failing undermined their performance in west London.",
      "Brentford found themselves 2-0 up inside 20 minutes as Igor Thiago took advantage of some shaky United defending to help himself. First he latched onto a long ball over the top of the defence from Jordan Henderson to blast into the top corner before gobbling up a rebound after Altay Bayindir pushed the ball out into his path.",
      "United then finally woke up and Benjamin Sesko needed three bites of the cherry to slam in his first United goal from close range. Bayindir made a good low save to keep out Dango Ouattara before Nathan Collins' foul on Bryan Mbeumo offered a route back into the game for the away side.",
      "But after a long delay Fernandes saw his effort saved by penalty expert Caoimhin Kelleher and substitute Mathias Jensen made the three points safe for Brentford on the break in injury time as chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" rang out from the stands. Here are the talking points after United made it eight league away games without a win.",
      "United were seen drilling their preparations for defending set pieces before kick off, but they didn't seem ready for what Brentford threw at them once the match started. The same old shaky backline, that has come to define Amorim's side, was there and Brentford took full advantage.",
      "If it wasn't for a few strong saves from Bayindir, they could easily have been 3-0 down following a nightmare start. Harry Maguire played Thiago onside for the first goal before Matthijs de Ligt found himself out of position for the second, which came from another simple long ball.",
      "It was a shambolic start for the away side, who had a week to prepare for this game, having already been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, the third round of which took place in midweek.",
      "This match was a perfect example of trend as Brentford's Michael Kayode and United's Diogo Dalot launched the ball into the box at every opportunity. It's nothing new at Brentford, who used the tactic successfully last season, but United have now jumped on the bandwagon.",
      "But, as Gronnemark warned, there's a lot more to it than simply chucking it and hoping. “For most teams, throw-ins are a really ugly part because the quality is so low, the ball is being thrown into high-pressure situations where there are duels,\" he said. \"There are too many chaotic throw-ins in the Premier League.\"",
      "Sesko arrived at United in a £73.7million deal from RB Leipzig with a lot of expectation on his shoulders. Having seen how Rasmus Hojlund struggled to cope with that, the Slovenian knew he needed to make a good impression early on. That didn't happen and there were signs of it beginning to get to him.",
      "His first United goal owed a lot to Caoimhin Kelleher, who failed to do with Patrick Dorgu's simple cross, but Sesko showed good determination to keep shooting. He couldn't miss the third go and the 22-year-old, who got 21 goals for Leipzig last season, is now off the mark in his seventh appearance.",
      "United's captain had the chance to bring his side level from the penalty spot after Nathan Collins pulled back Mbeumo in front of goal. Referee Craig Pawson took his time in pointing to the spot and there were further delays before Fernandes stepped up as VAR checked for a potential red card for denying a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews then made him wait even longer by making a double substitution. Fernandes side-footed towards the corner but Kelleher kept up his impressive record in penalties, saving his fourth from seven outside of shoot-outs with Brentford and Liverpool.",
      "Fernandes, meanwhile, has now missed two out of three in the Premier League this season, having skied one at Craven Cottage earlier in the season.",
      "Amorim has been United manager since November 2024. His side are still yet to win back-to-back Premier League games under his management. The United fan who has vowed not to cut his hair until they win five in a row may be waiting a long time on this evidence.",
      "Watching games like this makes you wonder what they do all week on the training pitch. With no European football or Carabao Cup to consider, United have all week to prepare for their league matches, yet they were blown away inside the opening 20 minutes and then offered little as they chased the game. The penalty was a point gift-wrapped yet they shouldn't take advantage.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Nathan Collins escaped a red card during Manchester United's 3-1 defeat against Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The Bees defenders fouled Bryan Mbeumo in the second half, pulling down his former teammate inside the box.",
      "Shortly after pointing to the spot, Craig Pawson brandished a yellow card. The Video Assistant Referee, Andy Madley, and his assistant, Nicholas Hopton, reviewed the incident at Stockley Park, and they confirmed with the on-field decision.",
      "An official statement from the Premier League Match Centre on X, formerly known as Twitter, reads: \"The referee’s call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to pulled Mbeumo back. VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes, whose spot-kick was interrupted by a substitution, failed to draw United level. Then, in the dying embers of stoppage time, Mathias Jensen, who had replaced Igor Thiago, put the third and final nail in the coffin.",
      "This weekend, United had the opportunity to win back-to-back games in the Premier League for the first time since last year. Speaking to reporters ahead of the clash, Amorim said: \"Yeah, it's really important, and we talked about that at the end of the game.",
      "\"It's really important for us to have that sense of urgency that we need to win no matter what, and it's going to be really difficult. Every time we start preparing the game and you watch the next opponent, you think, ‘It's going to be really, really tough’.",
      "\"I have that feeling. We cannot control the result of the game, but for me, the most important thing is to start the game the way we started against Chelsea, the way we started against Burnley, the way we started against Arsenal.",
      "\"These kinds of games, we need to be really focused and to have that feeling that we need to win every match.\"",
      "Back in May, at the end of last season, Mbeumo was on the winning side when Brentford stormed past United at the G-Tech Community Stadium. The Cameroon international didn't get on the scoresheet, but he certainly caught Amorim's eye.",
      "On whether that particular display convinced the United boss to sign Mbeumo, he said: \"It was not that performance. But [it] helped me to understand that he's a very good player, not [just] with the ball, without the ball.",
      "\"And when you see that live, it’s completely different. When you see a guy doing that, with all due respect, it's not because he’s in Manchester United.",
      "\"He was in Brentford, he was sometimes defending as a right-back. So, that was really important to have that feeling live. And if I'm the owner of Brentford, I will do the same, to keep the best players and try to sell the best players for big amounts.",
      "\"So, I completely understand that situation.\"",

      "Manchester United's forgotten defender, Tyrell Malacia, has sent a clear message to boss Ruben Amorim that he's ready for action, sharing snaps of his solo training sessions.",
      "Malacia's time at United has been nothing short of disastrous since being signed by Erik ten Hag as his first-choice full-back. The 26 year old's career was derailed by a knee injury in 2023, which saw him sidelined for an astonishing 500 days.",
      "During his lengthy lay-off, Malacia missed out on 70 United games and by the time he was fit again, Ten Hag had left the club. Under Amorim's new three-at-the-back system, with two wing-backs, Malacia found it hard to secure a spot.",
      "In January, PSV Eindhoven took Malacia on loan where he managed to clock up 12 appearances.",
      "However, come season end, there was no interest in making the move permanent and he returned to Carrington.",
      "Back at United, Malacia joined the so-called 'Bomb Squad' alongside Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Marcus Rashford.",
      "But while the others all secured moves away, Malacia was left in limbo.",
      "A potential switch to Elche fell through and Eyupspor's bid to sign Malacia outside the English transfer window was turned down by the player himself.",
      "With the Turkish and Saudi transfer windows now closed, Malacia looks set to stay put at United until at least January.",
      "Despite being registered for the Premier League, Malacia hasn't made the bench for United this season. Nevertheless, he's keeping his fitness levels high, ready to step in if needed.",

      "After the striker doubled his tally in the 20th minute, the goalkeeper could be seen pounding his fists on the ground. Bayindir had initially parried the ball away from Kevin Schade's cross before Thiago turned the ball home.",
      "As it happened, the Turkey international could not hide his frustration. His reaction as he lay on the floor perfectly summed up what a terrible start to the game it was for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "Bayindir has now started every game in the Premier League this season and is yet to keep a clean sheet. After being preferred over Andre Onana, United did sign a goalkeeper, but Senne Lammens is yet to gain any minutes.",
      "The decision not to sign Emiliano Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma, who joined Manchester City, has been heavily criticised. United failed to strengthen one of its weak spots within Amorim's squad.",
      "Fortunately for the Reds, Benjamin Sesko halved the deficit for United with his first goal for the club six minutes after Tudor's second. The striker was denied twice from close range before he smashed the ball into the roof of the net.",

      "Cristian Orozco has uploaded a cryptic post to his Instagram story ahead of a potential transfer to Manchester United. The 17-year-old midfielder has recently been linked with a move to Old Trafford following his impressive performances in Colombia.",
      "This means Orozco will remain at Fortaleza CEIF until July, and he'll rock up at Old Trafford boasting an already remarkable record. He has captained the Colombia Under-17s as they made it all the way to the South American Championship final earlier this year.",
      "As word spread about his potential move to United, Orozco headed to social media to share a message with his followers. Captioning a picture of Diego Maradona, who sadly passed in November 2020, he wrote: \"Good luck to all, blessings.\"",
      "The motive behind the post remain a mystery, but what's certain is that United are working hard to sign some of the world's most exciting young talents. The Colombian will be following in the footsteps of Sekou Kone, another teenage midfielder who recently joined United.",
      "Due to Brexit limitations, Ineos have adopted the strategy of casting their net wider to secure promising youngsters for their ranks. Diego Leon, the most high-profile signing since the shift in transfer strategy, was snapped up for a shrewd £3.3m in January, but he only joined the Reds in the summer.",
      "Leon is set to join his United teammates this afternoon for their face-off against Brentford, having been spotted at Stockport Train Station with the squad on Friday, ready for their journey to west London.",
      "Speaking reporters ahead of this weekend's clash at the G-Tech Community Stadium, Amorim claimed that he's starting to see the benefits of having more time with his players on the training pitch. The United boss said: \"You can try to work on different things, try to imagine different scenarios.",

      "\"So, I think that is special, to have that time with the team, and we are improving because of that. I think we would struggle a lot if we had a game in the middle of the week.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"Now, I have always the feeling that we can win the next game, and we can be dominant. I have that feeling now. What I'm saying is that sometimes, in the small things, in that urgency.",
      "\"If you compare the way we start against Chelsea to the way we start against [Manchester] City, [it] is completely different. In that, I'm not certain, all the time, what is going to happen.",

Melanie Kamayou, married to the Cameroon international since 2023, was spotted earlier this month wheeling luggage trolleys at Manchester Airport after leaving their north west home.",
      "She is now settling into life in Trabzon, beginning a fresh journey alongside her husband after two difficult years in England both on and off the pitch. When United paid £47million to bring him from Inter Milan in 2023, the expectation was that they'd snagged a reliable presence between the posts.",
      "Instead, costly mistakes undermined Onana's reputation and his time at Old Trafford soon soured. He had slipped to third choice, sitting behind Altay Bayindir and late summer signing Senne Lammens.",
      "Trabzonspor then stepped in with a loan move, sweetened by a salary increase for the 29-year-old. The transfer offered Onana a fresh start - something most United supporters welcomed.",
      "Through all the turbulence, his wife Melanie has remained a steady presence. Far from the stereotypical football WAG, Melanie holds a doctorate in pharmacy.",
      "She also co-manages the Andre Onana Foundation, which delivers healthcare and education initiatives for disadvantaged African children. Alongside her professional expertise, she models and has gained more than 70,000 Instagram followers.",
      "Together since 2019, the pair tied the knot in Paris two years ago and share a young son. Melanie previously lived with Onana in Amsterdam during his Ajax spell, then followed him to Milan, Manchester, and now Turkey.",

      "\"So, I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself. But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.",

      "Amorim has been frank about how Mainoo is competing directly with Bruno Fernandes for a place in the side. Ferdinand reckons it shouldn't necessarily mean the young midfielder must wait for the skipper's departure before establishing himself in the first XI.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo once highlighted his eagerness to play every minute by responding furiously to being substituted during a game at Brentford.",
      "A few months into his turbulent second spell at Manchester United, Ronaldo had already witnessed a managerial change, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer getting the axe and Ralf Rangnick taking charge on an interim basis. In January 2022, with United leading 2-0 at Brentford, the Portuguese superstar was withdrawn for Marcus Rashford after 71 minutes.",
      "Ronaldo struggled to accept the call, appearing furious as he trudged off while seemingly voicing his displeasure to his boss. However, Rangnick had no issues with Ronaldo's annoyance, maintaining he was prepared to discuss the move with the forward. The German coach quipped: \"I didn't expect him to hug me after being substituted.\"",
      "He added: \"He was asking why me, 'Why do you take me off?' I said, 'Listen, I have to take the decision in the interest of the team and the club. We had exactly the same situation five days ago at Villa Park, being 2-0 up with 15 minutes to play [Villa came back to draw 2-2], and we didn't want to make the same mistake again.'\"",
      "\"I decided to switch to a back five with Harry Maguire and bring on Marcus as another fast winger on the right-hand side, and I think it was the right decision.",
      "\"Cristiano was not happy. He's a goalscorer, he wished to stay on and maybe score himself. But, for us, it was more important to be compact.\"",
      "Rangnick's call proved spot on as Rashford netted the crucial third goal before Brentford managed a late consolation. He responded to that strike by offering Ronaldo some words of wisdom, revealing: \"When we scored the third, I said exactly that to him. I said, 'Look, Cristiano, I understand you're still ambitious and want to score yourself. Maybe in a couple of years, when you're a head coach yourself, you will hopefully take the same decision and be in the same role I was today after 75 minutes.'\"",
      "Rangnick then emphasised there was no rift between him and his superstar player, insisting: \"I have no issues whatsoever with Cristiano. He came back from a little injury, he didn't train for one-and-a-half weeks, and being 2-0 up with 15 minutes to play, having players like Marcus on the bench and even Anthony Martial, why should I not make use of that?",
      "\"And that's why I would always do it again in a situation like that. I've been here now for six weeks, I've never had any kind of issue with Cristiano.\"",
      "Their working relationship proved short-lived, as Rangnick departed the club by mutual agreement the following March. Ronaldo, who is still playing at 40, also left Old Trafford later that year following his explosive interview with Piers Morgan, in which he criticised how the club was run.",
      "United visit Brentford in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, hoping to improve on their poor recent record at the Gtech Community Stadium. United have lost two of their last three visits, drawing the other. Their last victory there was the aforementioned match involving Ronaldo.",

      "Manchester United face Brentford with the Red Devils looking to win their second successive game in the Premier League. Ruben Amorim relieved some of the pressure on himself last weekend thanks to a 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford.",
      "The beleaguered United boss had been battling mounting criticism with just one win in the league so far. However, goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro were enough to see off Enzo Maresca's side in a game that saw both teams reduced to ten men following the sendings off of Casemiro and Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez.",
      "Brentford have found themselves in similar trouble to United so far this season. The Bees have only won one league game under new manager Keith Andrews and sit in 17th, just one point above the relegation places, having lost 3-1 to Fulham last weekend.",
      "The clash at the Gtech Stadium will have the added spice of Bryan Mbeumo heading back to his old stomping ground after signing for United this summer.",
      "The 26-year-old forward was at the centre of a transfer tussle that rumbled on for much of the summer until finally securing his move to Old Trafford in July. Brentford also beat United 4-3 in the same fixture last season.",
      "Brentford host United at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday, September 27. Kick-off is set for 12:30pm UK time.",
      "Amorim will be without Casemiro after he saw red in last weekend's tie against Chelsea. Diogo Dalot could return however, but the game against Brentford is expected to come too soon for Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could find himself starting in midfield with Casemiro's absence, while Matheus Cunha is likely to be drafted into United's front line. Altay Bayindir is still expected to keep new goalkeeper Senne Lammens on the bench as he waits for his debut.",

      "Manchester United's clash with Brentford on Saturday has been spiced up following the summer saga over Bryan Mbeumo. The lunchtime kick-off will see Mbeumo return to his former club for the first time since his contentious £65million move to United, which could potentially rise to £71m with add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo finalised his transfer on July 21. However, the switch was marred by a dispute between the two clubs. United accused Brentford of inflating the forward's price and pressuring him to reduce his wage demands to secure a larger transfer fee.",
      "United insiders also alleged that Brentford tried to persuade Mbeumo to join Tottenham or Newcastle instead. However, the Cameroon international, a lifelong United supporter, insisted he would only move to Old Trafford and stood firm on his decision.",
      "Mbeumo is likely to receive a warm welcome from Brentford fans upon his return. However, it remains to be seen whether the controversy surrounding his move to United will create a chilly atmosphere between officials from both clubs at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday.",
      "It's no secret that United have had a tough time at Brentford's home ground since the Bees earned their Premier League stripes in 2021, establishing themselves as a formidable top-tier team.",
      "Despite securing a 3-1 victory during their first visit under temporary manager Ralf Rangnick, the win was overshadowed by United legend Cristiano Ronaldo's infamous tantrum.",
      "The following season saw Erik ten Hag's United suffer a crushing 4-0 defeat in his second match at the helm, leading him to order his squad to report for a gruelling 14km training run the next day - the distance they were outpaced by Brentford.",

      "The pressure has eased on Ruben Amorim following Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea last weekend. But more hazards lurk just round the corner, with United's trip to Brentford this weekend chief among them.",
      "The Red Devils face the Bees and newly-promoted Sunderland before the international break, when tricky fixtures against old rivals Liverpool and Europa League side Nottingham Forest loom into view. Nevertheless, it has been a positive week for Amorim, who has been able to welcome Diogo Dalot back into full training and seen the club make progress on two transfers for highly-promising youngsters.",
      "With two defeats in their opening five Premier League games and having been unceremoniously dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby, it's probably fair to say United have had a somewhat underwhelming start to the season.",
      "However, that doesn't appear to have affected morale around Old Trafford, according to Bryan Mbeumo. The forward was one of the club's marquee buys in the summer, joining from Brentford in a deal worth more than £70million.",
      "He has already scored twice for his new employers, a tally he'll be hoping to add to against his old club this weekend. Mbeumo has now spoken about his arrival at United, including the positive atmosphere around Carrington.",
      "\"They [the United players] have welcomed me straight away,\" Mbeumo said. \"They're a big part of it. Changing city or club always needs a bit of time, but everyone helped me a lot.",
      "\"When I first arrive somewhere, I don't like to be loud or show myself a lot, but I can go with people well and now that's what I've done. It's been great. It's a big club – everything about it – and I'm really happy.",
      "\"The team-mates and staff and everyone at Carrington are lovely people, so you really want to come and work here every day. So it's really good.\"",
      "Once upon a time there was a genuine belief that Marcus Rashford could depose Wayne Rooney as United's all-time top goalscorer. Events over the last 12 months mean that is now extremely unlikely, with Rashford enjoying life on loan at Barcelona, who also have an option to buy the England centre-forward.",
      "Rooney's advice to Barca star while he was still at Old Trafford has now emerged after the former Everton man spoke about Rashford on his Wayne Rooney Show podcast.",
      "\"I spoke to Marcus Rashford on this a couple of years ago, because I felt he was slowing the ball down too much and passing back and turning,\" Rooney said. \"I said, right, when you get the ball, all you need to do is get a full back one v one, knock it past him and run.\"He won’t catch you. And even if they do, you might win a free kick, might win a penalty, you get a throw-in high up the pitch. Be positive, because if you ask any defender, that’s what they don’t like, and then running behind off the ball.\"It’s so simple to be effective that way. And now players may want to do four, five, six step overs, and then they get a clip on YouTube, which they can show everyone. That’s the way it’s going.\"",
      "Amorim relieved the pressure on himself with last weekend's 2-1 victory over Chelsea. But that hasn't stopped the punditry world from chattering away about the Portuguese manager's future – and who could replace him.",
      "Former Blues star Pat Nevin has now weighed in, suggesting that former Red Devils midfielders Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher could be in the frame, on a short-term basis at least. Carrick is currently out of work after being sacked by Middlesbrough in June, while ex-Scotland international Fletcher is an under-18s coach at Old Trafford. Nevin also offered a theory as to why United are willing to stand by Amorim, despite the issues the club are facing on the pitch.",
      "\"Short term, I wouldn't be surprised at [Carrick or Fletcher to replace Amorim] at all,\" Nevin said, speaking to gaming news publisher Escapist Magazine. \"That would be absolutely fine. And they might do well.",
      "\"They offered the caretaker role to Ole first didn’t they. It takes the pressure off, you can have a good look around. And if he does well, we just keep him. That's fine. You'll get a bit of pressure in the press saying, ‘They don't know what to do, they haven't got a clue, they can't get the right man, all that sort of stuff.’",
      "\"I''ve been there before. I just blanked it. I don't care. I've got a guy doing a good job here and I wouldn't look for the other manager. And I'll say to them, ‘If you keep on doing well, you can get a job.’ I'm not hiding anything from anyone here. I'm looking at every possible option.",
      "\"But what you have to do is give it a number of months in that situation. If it does happen and things go badly for him then you have to have a direction. You have to have a two, three, four, five year plan.",
      "\"Maybe that's been United's problem. They’ve tried, they've had plans. They've had two, three, four, five year plans that have all lasted a year. And that's not good. Because the next person comes in and they change it, the next one changes it.",
      "\"That's the only reason why they're standing by Amorim just now. It's because they know they didn't spend time with the other ones, so we now end up with a Frankenstein team. All bought by different managers. None of it really fits together. And then you find out they got rid of some people they shouldn’t have gotten rid of like McTominay.\"",

      "But they are currently only in sixth place in the Premier League - seven points behind leaders Liverpool already.",
      "Following their disappointing 2-1 defeat to Manchester United last weekend, they returned to winning ways against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday. But Enzo Maresca’s side were largely disappointing and had to fight back from a goal down to beat League One opposition.",
      "As the Blues look to deliver a more convincing performance at home against Brighton on Saturday, there are still question marks over the quality of Chelsea’s squad and Maresca’s ability to get the best out of his players.",
      "Maresca has delivered the hugely disappointing news that talisman Cole Palmer is set for a spell on the sidelines. Palmer was substituted in the first half of the recent defeat to United, after which he was seen putting ice on his groin on the substitute's bench.",
      "The Blues are expected to be without their talismanic playmaker for around two to three weeks due to the ongoing groin injury, which has disrupted his 2025/26 season.",
      "Maresca said at his press conference on Friday: \"We decided to protect Cole a little bit in terms of not letting his injuries get worse. We decided to rest him for the next two or three weeks before the international break to see if he can recover 100% and be fully fit from the international break.",
      "\"I don't think he needs surgery. It's a matter of managing his pain in his groin, with the amount of games, it is something that can happen.\"",
      "Maresca was then asked who would replace the Englishman, before name-dropping Facundo Buonanotte, currently on loan from Brighton until the end of the season, as the player to step up in his place. The head coach said: \"Buonanotte can play in that position. But it depends a little bit on the game, the other team and how they defend. It depends.\"",
      "That could be seen as huge pressure to place on the 20-year-old Argentine, who played his first full 90 minutes in the 2-1 Carabao Cup win over Lincoln City in midweek. But it may also be a sign of Maresca’s faith in the player, who impressed by scoring the winner and his first goal for the club in that outing. However, the youngster is ineligible to face his parent club Brighton this weekend.",
      "Robert Sanchez’s red card against Manchester United and Filip Jorgensen’s poor display against Lincoln City have done little to alleviate concerns over Chelsea’s goalkeeper position. But the Blues are reportedly now eying up a move for Mike Maignan.",
      "France’s first-choice goalkeeper was heavily linked with the west Londoners in the summer transfer window, but Chelsea failed to agree a fee with AC Milan. However, the 30-year-old is in the final year of his contract at the San Siro, meaning he can either be bought for a cut-price in January or signed as a free agent next summer.",
      "TBR reports that, despite United’s interest in Maignan, Chelsea are further along than their Premier League rivals in their negotiations with the shot-stopper, who is considered one of the best in Europe and is said to specifically want a transfer to Stamford Bridge. Whether Chelsea opt to wait until next summer for the experienced goalkeeper or look to sign him in January remains to be seen.",

      "“I’m really happy here at Bayern,” he said. “I have two years left on my contract. And to be honest, I’m enjoying every minute. I enjoy playing here in front of the fans. I enjoy the team, the coach.",
      "\"So that’s not on my mind at all. I’m just looking forward to this season and hope we’ll be successful.”",

      "\"Top player. I think there's a lot of Tottenham fans, including myself, who would like to see Kane back. Personally, I don't think he will do it right now if I'm honest.",

But the United boss said he no longer travels to games dreading them like he did last season, because he knew beforehand his players were not able to compete with their opponents.",
      "United travel to Brentford on Saturday with Amorim aiming to put together back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "It is a damning statistic for Amorim and underlines the unpredictable nature of his players, with the 40-year-old head coach admitting even he does not know what to expect when they play. “It's normal that the fans don't know what's going to happen in the next game,” said Amorim.",
      "“To be honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager of the team. The best way of dealing with that is approaching every game like it's the last one. I always have the feeling that we can win the next game and we can be dominant. I have that feeling now. It's in our hands to change things.",
      "“What I'm saying is that sometimes in the small things, in that urgency, if you compare the way we started against Chelsea, to the way we started against City, it's completely different. So in that, I'm not certain all the time what's going to happen and I'm really clear on that with you and with the players, but the feeling is completely different.",
      "“I look at my team and I'm going to play against City, Arsenal and I'm feeling that we can score goals, we can be dominant, we can control the game in certain moments, so it's a completely different feeling from last year. I know it's going to be tough, but it's more excitement than fear, this year. But it's about the way we're going to do the warm-up and the preparation.",
      "“If we're excited to go to the game like we are sometimes when we are at the limit and if we always have that feeling, I think it's going to be massive for us. So it's massive to win this game.”",
      "Bryan Mbeumo returns to his former club for the first time since leaving for United in a £71million deal, with Amorim claiming the forward can help change the negative mentality among his players.",

Against that backdrop, Amorim has told his players they must show the same energy, focus and aggression they display against the so-called smaller teams, not just the big guns.",

      "“We need to win the next game. It's not about 10 wins in a row. I'm talking about winning the second one, then the third one, then the feeling will change.",
      "“If we, as a team, don't understand the momentum now, we have a big problem. Anything could happen in a game, especially in the Premier League, and you can see that in every game.",
      "“But the feeling in the first minutes is really important so, for me, since we started the first training, we started talking about that. We need to understand the momentum of the club and the opportunity that we have to win the next game. So it's on us - the responsibility is on us.”",

      "Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has questioned why Manchester United failed to make a serious move for Nicolas Jackson before his summer exit. United were among the Premier League clubs linked with the Senegal striker during the window as his departure from Chelsea appeared inevitable.",
      "Bayern Munich completed a deal to sign Jackson, despite enduring multiple twists following reports that the move was blocked after Liam Delap's injury setback. However, Jackson eventually signed for the German giants on transfer deadline day.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side was among the most active sides in the market. They focused heavily on bolstering their attacking options, with Benjamin Sesko joining Bryan Mbeumo and Mathues Cunha.",
      "Hasselbaink, who bagged 87 goals across 177 outings for the Stamford Bridge outfit, leapt to Jackson's defence, expressing his amazement that neither United nor Newcastle pursued the striker.",
      "\"I've always liked Nicolas Jackson,\" Hasselbaink told Betway. \"I think he could bring something to the team, but obviously two strikers have come in and he felt that he was not going to play as much as he was.",
      "\"He wanted to leave and you can understand that. I think Chelsea were happy to sell him.",
      "\"I was just surprised that Newcastle or Man Utd didn't try to get him.",
      "\"But he asked to leave, and I don't know what I can say about that really. He's at another club outside of England and I think Chelsea wish him well.\"",
      "Jackson secured his move to Bavaria on deadline day, with the deal keeping him at the Bundesliga outfit on loan until the season concludes.",
      "It has been claimed that the 24-year-old's temporary switch will become permanent if he reaches a specified number of appearances - netting Chelsea a reported £56.2million for the former Villarreal star.",
      "It has been a tough start for the forward. So far, he has failed to register a goal in his opening three outings in Germany, including a brief substitute appearance against his parent club in the Champions League as Harry Kane's brace helped defeat Enzo Maresca's team 3-1.",
      "Sesko has also drawn a blank in his early United stint following a sluggish beginning to Premier League life.",

      "\"When you are in a club like this, you want to have the best players but you also have to imagine the future,\" he said at the end of last month. \"That is so exciting – I like to know the players, I like to see the videos of the players and to try to get all the information, but you want that confirmation and I felt Sesko was even better than what I was thinking.",
      "\"I have to be careful, Sesko is going to be our striker for many, many years so we need to put that in his head and let him settle down, to stay calm and enjoy his day because he's really like you said, obsessed.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly revised their plans for the new Old Trafford, ditching the controversial canopy from their initial designs unveiled earlier this year.",
      "The club had released concept images and videos of their proposed 100,000-seater stadium in March, which included a massive, umbrella-like canopy. The design aimed to create a modern, sustainable destination complete with a public plaza.",
      "On a clear day, the canopy, held up by three masts, would be visible from as far away as Liverpool. However, the ambitious design was met with mixed reactions from United's fans. Critics described the colossal structure to a circus tent, and the cost of constructing and installing the canopy alone was estimated to be between £300million and £400m.",
      "Fast forward a few months, and according to The Athletic, the club is now exploring different options for their new stadium. It's reported that the so-called 'vast umbrella' was scrapped due to space constraints.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe explained at the time: \"The brief to Norman Foster here was to build the world's most iconic football stadium. It had to be a stadium which was recognisable around the world.",
      "\"We said to [architect] Norman that we would like a stadium where when anybody in the world sees that stadium, they'll know it's Manchester United. It's more than a new stadium.",
      "\"Everyone knows the Eiffel Tower, everyone wants to visit. Everyone in the world will want to come visit this stadium. I think the design of the stadium is a 10 out of 10. I think it's a really special design.\"",
      "After a review, sources have allegedly described the revised designs as more aligned with conventional stadium aesthetics. Nevertheless, talks are still reportedly continuing and Foster's design remains 'on the table.'",
      "Conversations are understood to have occurred with Freightliner, which controls much of the territory to the west of the existing stadium that had been designated for part of the new stadium footprint and approximately 17,000 homes.",
      "Yet, the report states that Freightliner is seeking around £400million ($535m) for the land and whilst the firm are supposedly prepared to relocate the freight terminal to a fresh site, it is 'so far holding out for a major windfall.'",
      "But should United now proceed without the canopy, the scheme would need less Freightliner territory, enabling construction to advance more rapidly.",
      "Meanwhile, the stadium's precise location is also being examined, as each alternative demands 'different amounts and configurations of land.'",
      "\"The government has identified infrastructure investment as a strategic priority, particularly in the north of England, and we are proud to be supporting that mission with this project of national, as well as local, significance,\" Ratcliffe said after United launched their campaign for government funding.",

      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to frustrate and infuriate him and United's fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "Here, the seeds of their latest setback were sewn inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals, the United boss left shaking his head at his team's continued failings.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after the United chief executive went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "After this defeat, Amorim now has just nine wins from 33 Premier League games. For all the talk from inside the club about an improved xG, fewer shots conceded, more shots on target and a significant upturn in the data, the only stats that matter are the results, which have been lamentable.",
      "Amoirm has still to win back-to-back Premier League games, despite being in charge for nearly a year, another shocking stat for the embattled head coach.",
      "A season without European football was supposed to be a blessing in disguise for United and Amorim, giving him free weeks to work with his players on his philosophy and system, but that argument has proved illusory, with the players just as unreliable and clueless as last season.",
      "Amorim made three changes from the side that secured a hard-earned 2-1 win over Chelsea a week earlier, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte and Matheus Cunha coming in for the injured Noussair Mazraoui, the suspended Casemiro and Amad, absent following a family bereavement.",
      "There was no first Premier League start of the season for Kobbie Mainoo, with Ugarte given the nod to replace Casemiro.",
      "United fell behind in the eighth minute, the defence having pushed up, allowing Jordan Henderson to pick out Thiago, who let the ball bounce once before thrashing a shot past Altay Bayindir, the ferocity of the shot giving the 'keeper no chance.",
      "Thiago notched his second of the game 12 minutes later. Brentford again exposed United's weakness down the right side, Bayindir palming away Kevin Schade's dangerous ball, only for Thaigo to steer it back over the line for the hosts to establish a 2-0 lead.",
      "United did not look like scoring, but £74m summer signing Benjamin Sesko gave them a lifeline in the 26th minute, scoring his first goal since his move from RB Leipzig with a fierce finish high into the net.",
      "Amorim's side failed to build any real momentum thereafter and never looked like scoring, but earned another lifeline in the 75th minute when Bryan Mbeumo – returning to his old club for the first time since his summer move - was brought down by Bees skipper Nathan Collins.",
      "Fernandes stepped up to take the resulting penalty – after a lengthy VAR check to see if the challenge from Collins warranted a red card – but failed from the spot with Caoimhin Kelleher saving his effort.",
      "Next up for United is Sunderland at home. Given how well the Black Cats have started on their return to the Premier League, that promises to be another unsettling afternoon at Old Trafford for Amorim and his under-performing players.",
      "If this wretched run carries on much longer, Amorim is likely to be put out of his misery and go the same was as his five predecessors, all of whom followed Sir Alex Ferguson and failed in what has now become the impossible job.",

      "Mount has replaced Shaw for the final 10 minutes.",
      "Fernandes' penalty is saved - that was a huge moment.",
      "Mbeumo is brought down and United have a penalty.",
      "I wanted Mainoo to start today because he's so much better on the ball than Ugarte.",
      "He's already been an improvement in the midfield",
      "Mainoo and Yoro ON.",
      "Ugarte and Maguire OFF.",
      "The 1,721 United fans who have made the trip to Brentford are getting frustrated by what they’re seeing and have made clear their feelings with a sustained chant of “Attack! Attack! Attack!”",
      "They have every right to demand more from their team, who have been meek and insipid going forward, failing to cause Brentford any problems, aside from Sesko’s first-half goal. There is no sense of United getting in behind Brentford’s defence and threatening their goal, and as it stands, the visitors are toothless in attack. Changes need to be made, with Mount and Zirkzee surely set to come on soon.",
      "Lovely ball in the box from Mbeumo, but Sesko can't connect and Dorgu failed to meet it at the back post.",
      "United have been poor on the ball today, which is why Amorim looks so stressed on the touchline.",
      "Dorgu just lost possession and Mbeumo waved his arms in frustration at the other side of the pitch.",
      "Here we go for the second half of the game in London.",
      "Here are your half-time ratings:",
      "Bayindir - exposed 6",
      "De Ligt - uncertain 5",
      "Maguire - hesitant 4",
      "Shaw - sloppy 4",
      "Dalot - erratic 5",
      "Ugarte - busy 6",
      "Fernandes - quiet 5",
      "Dorgu - determined 6",
      "Mbeumo - peripheral 5",
      "Sesko - clinical 6",
      "Cunha - industrious 6",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Brentford are leading at the Gtech.",
      "Dorgu just told Bayindir to calm down and take his time on the ball.",
      "Brentford fans just heckled Shaw for sending a long ball into the stands instead of finding Fernandes.",
      "Although United have not made the start they wanted, it's an entertaining game. The early-kick off slot can often produce slow contests, but there's a good pace to it and there has been chances at both ends.",
      "Sesko hardly celebrated and Amorim gestured his players to rush back for the restart - game on.",
      "Sesko has his first goal for United, although VAR are checking the goal for a foul in the build-up.",
      "United are undone once again, conceding a sloppy second, with the home fans singing “Bryan, what’s the score?” to their former forward Mbeumo, who left them for United in the summer. Amorim’s defence found themselves on the back foot again, Bayindir palming away Schade’s cross and very nearly kept out the rebound, which was turned in by Thiago, for his second of the game. It’s a long way back for the Reds from here.",
      "This could be a repeat of the embarrassing defeat 4-0 in August 2022. Brentford lost to Fulham last weekend, and this was a huge chance to build momentum after Chelsea. United have made a shocking start and have given themselves a mountain to climb in London.",
      "Thiago scores again for Brentford, who have been the dominant side in the opening exchanges.",
      "Bayindir made a save, but Thiago was there to tap in the rebound to make it 2-0.",
      "Cunha is becoming unhappy with Sesko, who picked the wrong pass just there.",
      "He had another word with him when the ball went out of play.",
      "Cunha comes close to producing an immediate response, just shooting wide of the post. United need to get him on the ball because he is bound to make something happen.",
      "Amorim is clearly not happy with how deep his United team are sitting, shaking his head and imploring them to push up.",
      "Moments later, United are caught cold, a long ball from Jordan Henderson met by Igor Thiago, who lets it bounce before thrashing it past Bayindir. United’s defence were convinced Thiago was offside, but after a VAR check, the goal stands and Brentford lead 1-0.",
      "That's a horrible goal to concede. It was far too simple to launch that ball forward to Thiago. Maguire was left isolated. Amorim did not look pleased before the goal, and certainly won't be happy now.",
      "Thiago fires into the top left corner after getting in behind United's backline.",
      "That was a mess from a United perspective - Maguire was left isolated."

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, September 27.",
      "We have a busy day ahead which starts nice and early as the Reds travel to Brentford in the early kick-off in the Premier League. Ruben Amorim will be hoping that his team will be able to build on the momentum created by the 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out.",
      "There will be a focus on transfers here today. Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane remains in the headlines and he has spoken about a possible return to the Premier League.",
      "Meanwhile, there is talk that Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is on the radar for United too. All eyes will be on Kobbie Mainoo this afternoon as speculation around his future continues.",
      "Take a look back at the United transfer news from this morning below...",
      "Thank you for joining the United blog this morning.",
      "We are now going to hand over to our colleagues at the Gtech Community Stadium as they build-up to the clash with Brentford.",
      "You can follow the match here.",
      "Ahead of today's clash with Brentford, Alan Shearer has insisted that he is yet to be convinced by United despite the victory over Chelsea last weekend.",
      "Making his prediction for today's game with Betfair, the Newcastle legend said:",
      "I'm still not convinced that all is well at Man United even though confidence should be sky high. Brentford will be tough for them, so I'll go for a draw.",
      "The Reds received good news this week in their bid to bring Adam Wharton to Old Trafford in the future.",
      "According to talkSPORT journalist Ben Jacobs, speaking on The United Stand, Wharton has a gentleman's agreement in place to leave Palace at the end of the season.",
      "If this is the case, United may hope to sign the former Blackburn man for less than the £100m+ price tag that is currently on Carlos Baleba.",
      "German publication Bild understands that United could sign Kane for a bargain £56.7m fee in the summer transfer window.",
      "However, this will only be the case should Kane inform Bayern, before the end of the January transfer window, that he wishes to leave.",
      "It is also believed that Spurs would be given the opportunity to match any fee that is proposed for Kane so United would have a few hoops to jump through to get the deal done.",
      "After becoming the fastest player in the top five European leagues to 100 goals on Friday night, Kane was asked about returning to the Premier League.",
      "He responded:",
      "I’m really happy here at Bayern. I have two years left on my contract. And to be honest, I’m enjoying every minute. I enjoy playing here in front of the fans. I enjoy the team, the coach. So that’s not on my mind at all. I’m just looking forward to this season and hope we’ll be successful.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog this Saturday morning.",
      "It is matchday in the Premier League for the Reds as they travel to Brentford this lunchtime.",
      "While we will be bringing you big match build-up lines, we shall be focusing mainly on transfers including what this man has said about a return to England...",
      "Manchester United will be without several members of their squad for the clash against Brentford.",
      "Amad, who will not feature after being granted compassionate leave after suffering a family bereavement.",
      "\"Amad is not here, someone in his family passed away and we are giving all the support to him,\" he said.",
      "\"For Amad, we are here for him, it's a tough moment. In these kind of moments it's not the most important thing [football]. We can win without Amad, but also we want to win for Amad.\"",
      "Noussair Mazraoui and Lisandro Martinez are both sidelined through injury. Casemiro will serve a one-game suspension for the red card he picked up in the win over Chelsea.",
      "Former Denmark international Mikkel Beckmann believes a move away from Manchester United may be an option for highly-rated forward Chido Obi.",
      "He told Viaplay: \"The reserve team matches… it doesn’t taste particularly good. It’s like when we have our Future Cup matches at home. It’s the reserves who play, and it’s just far from the same as playing first-team football,” he said.",
      "\"I just don’t think the time is right for Amorim to suddenly try Chido Obi out at United.",
      "“He is very, very far from the first team at United. I would like to see him play some senior football at a higher level than just reserves at United.”",
      "Chido Obi was in and around the first-team pictures last season under Ruben Amorim but has largely remained with the under-21s this season after an influx of attackers.",
      "Marcus Rashford grabbed another goal contribution for Barcelona in the 3-1 La Liga win over Real Oviedo on Thursday evening.",
      "The England international was back in the starting XI after being benched for their last encounter for being slightly late to training. That arrived just a few days on from his stunning brace in the Champions League against Newcastle.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has issued an update to Instagram.",
      "The 20-year-old, who wanted to leave the club on loan this past summer, has been a trending topic in recent weeks with his future seeming uncertain. However, MEN Sport have since revealed that he is working hard at Carrington to impress Ruben Amorim having also hired a new private chef.",
      "The latest update has come on his Instagram story with Mainoo reposting an update from Leny Yoro that shows the duo together in a number of photos. Mainoo is also in the replies of the French defender's post.",
      "A post shared by YL15 (@lenyyoro)",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Amad and Noussair Mazraoui will both miss Manchester United's trip to Brentford in the Premier League.",
      "\"Licha [Lisandro Martinez} is out. Casemiro is out because of the red card. Amad is not here because someone in his family passed away. We are giving all the support to Amad and understood he needed to return home,\" he said.",
      "Diogo Dalot is in line to replace Amad with the Portugal international returning to training on Thursday. Mazraoui meanwhile, has been ruled out.",
      "\"He [Mazraoui] is out also. He will not be back until the international break,\" Amorim revealed.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with moves for Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba of Crystal Palace and Brighton, respectively.",
      "When speaking on the United Stand, journalist Ben Jacobs has provided a verdict on interest in both.",
      "At the moment I'm not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deeper-lying midfielder if anything, should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder.",
      "With the likes of Wharton and Baleba, we know that they're going to be in demand. With Carls Baleba, there's going to be two aspects.",
      "One is naturally the market pushing towards trying to sign him with multiple suitors, and Manchester United fans shouldn't be surprised by that.",
      "The second aspect is obviously price, and even though many may feel £100m is a lot of money and something that could get a deal done, Brighton's data and Brighton's approach is to think this is a player that might be a Moisés Caicedo-type fee, £150m or more in 12 months' time.",
      "I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. I don't see a January sale for Carlos Baleba. The slow start to the season has maybe been influenced by some of the summer speculation.",
      "There's other names that could be available mid season if Manchester United have the funds from potentially a Kobbie Mainoo exit, we'll have to wait and see what transpires.",
      "Manchester United could face competition for the signature of Carlos Baleba if they opt to actively pursue his services next summer.",
      "Interest in the Brighton star was made clear towards the latter stages of the most recent trading period and now SportsBoom are claiming that Spurs have joined the race for Baleba but that he still would prefer a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Alternatives for United include Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton.",
      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United news and transfers live blog brought to you by MEN Sport.",
      "Transfer rumours have continued to circulate around Old Trafford with a move for a marquee midfielder expected. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton features very high on the club's shortlist.",
      "There is also plenty to look at regarding the futures of Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo following very different weeks for the two United academy graduates.",
      "To also learn of the latest updates ahead of the trip to Brentford!",
      "Further to the update surrounding Baleba, Jacobs gave United a boost in their hopes to sign Wharton in the summer.",
      "The journalist believes that Wharton has a gentleman's agreement with Palace to leave the club at the end of this season.",
      "Should this be the case, it would be a shock if United do not try and pursue a move for the ex-Blackburn Rovers man.",
      "Some nerves have been jangled recently after reports emerged suggesting that Liverpool were willing to challenge United to sign Carlos Baleba next summer.",
      "However, journalist Ben Jacobs understands this is not the case.",
      "Talking to The United Stand, Jacobs claimed that Liverpool are not looking at the possibility of adding a deeper midfielder due to the ongoing success of Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "Panic soon began to spread after Obi was dropped to the bench to face Athletic Club especially after he made a promising breakthrough into the first team squad last season.",
      "But speaking recently to the MEN, academy head coach Travis Binnion urged fans to be patient with the striker and his development.",
      "It's not easy for him because people look at him like he's a big kid. The key thing there is he's still very young, he's still learning his game. Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that. The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball. They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Obi was rested against Athletic Bilbao this week for the U21s.",
      "The striker seemed disappointed as he was named on the bench for the contest against the Basque club in the Premier League International Cup.",
      "However, it is understood the decision was made to rest him due to United's U21s having a busy schedule.",
      "READ MORE HERE",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog.",
      "Jack Flintham here to take you through the next couple of hours of United news.",
      "We are going to start by taking a look at this young man and what is happening with his development.",
      "Jadon Sancho helped Aston Villa get their European campaign off to the perfect start as they beat Bologna.",
      "The on-loan Manchester United man came on as a substitute on the 58th-minute mark as he replaced Emi Buendia.",
      "Villa eventually won 1-0 thanks to John McGinn's strike.",
      "Former Premier League star Gabby Agbonlahor has been baffled by United's approach to Casemiro and Harry Maguire's futures.",
      "talkSPORT host Alan Brazil said: “Man United, they’re talking about players that are out of favour and who’s staying. It looks like they might let Harry (Maguire) go but keep Casemiro and I don’t get that,” Brazil said.",
      "“That’s very odd,” Agbonlahor replied.",
      "“Harry Maguire played on the weekend. Harry Maguire for me, he played on the weekend against Chelsea. He’s their best centre-half. I don’t understand that.”",
      "Manchester United are set to sign Charlie Hardy.",
      "And he has since spoken out on the move. He said: “After almost a decade at Derby County, the time has now come for a new chapter.\"",
      "Man United winger Amad has named his three best moments playing alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "He said: \"The hat-trick against Real Sociedad, the goal against Liverpool at home, so many great moments.",

      "Liverpool are reportedly rivalling United for Gleison Bremer.",
      "Tutto Juve claims that Juventus are aware of transfer interest from both clubs. However, the Turin club are said to have made it known informally that they do not intend to sell the Brazilian, considering the defender a cornerstone of their team.",
      "Steven Railston reports that United are set to sign teenage goalkeeper Charlie Hardy from Derby County.",
      "Hardy will sign scholarship terms at United after receiving Premier League ratification to join. The expectation is for Hardy, who is 16 years old, to play for United's under-18s, who former midfielder Darren Fletcher coaches.",
      "Adam Wharton is said to have a gentleman's agreement with Crystal Palace to leave the club next summer.",
      "The journalist Ben Jacobs, via The United Stand, claims the situation will clearly be one to watch. United are one of multiple Premier League clubs credited with an interest in the England international central midfielder.",
      "United were reportedly willing to sign Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kaua Santos before eventually bringing in Senne Lammens.",
      "BILD claims United came knocking towards the end of the transfer window, but had an offer blocked by the Bundesliga club and Santos himself. United were reputedly willing to pay them around £22-£26million.",
      "The reported United transfer target Lucien Agoume is said to be someone Arsenal will likely be monitoring as well.",
      "CaughtOffside reports that they looked at the player before signing Christian Norgaard instead as a replacement for Jorginho. They claim that Agoume will remain on their radar over the coming years.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted he still never knows which version of his Manchester United team will turn up for games. But the United boss said he no longer travels to matches dreading them like he did last season when he knew his players were not able to compete with their opponents.",
      "United travel to Brentford at lunchtime on Saturday, with Amorim aiming to put together back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time since taking charge nearly a year ago. It is a damning statistic for Amorim and underlines the unpredictable nature of his players, with the 40-year-old head coach admitting even he does not know what to expect when they play.",
      "“It's normal that the fans don't know what's going to happen in the next game,” said Amorim. “To be honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager of the team. The best way of dealing with that is approaching every game like it's the last one.",
      "“I always have the feeling that we can win the next game and we can be dominant. I have that feeling now. It's in our hands to change things.",

      "“So in that, I'm not certain all the time what's going to happen and I'm really clear on that with you and with the players, but the feeling is completely different.",
      "“I look at my team and I'm going to play against City, Arsenal and I'm feeling that we can score goals, we can be dominant, we can control the game in certain moments, so it's a completely different feeling from last year.",
      "“I know it's going to be tough, but it's more excitement than fear, this year. But it's about the way we're going to do the warm-up and the preparation.",
      "“If we're excited to go to the game like we are sometimes when we are at the limit and if we always have that feeling, I think it's going to be massive for us. So it's massive to win this game.”",

      "Altay Bayindir has shown his frustration during Manchester United's clash against Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium on Saturday afternoon.",
      "The goalkeeper could be seen pounding his fists on the ground after the Reds conceded their second goal of the afternoon inside 20 minutes. Initially, the goalkeeper managed to parry the ball away from his goal, but it hit Thiago and trickled underneath the 'keeper.",
      "As the Bees' striker wheeled away to celebrate, the goalkeeper could not hide his frustrations. The Turkish international repeatedly hit the ground, summing up what has been a terrible start for the Reds.",
      "Bayindir has had his doubters this season particularly after he was given the responsibility of replacing Andre Onana. On deadline day, the Reds brought in Senne Lammens as a replacement for Onana but he has yet to gain any minutes with Bayindir keeping his place inbetween the sticks.",
      "Fortunately for United, their two-goal disadvantage did not last too long. Benjamin Sesko was allowed three opportunities to score, and on the third time of asking, fired home to reduce the deficit.",
      "However, a defeat for United today would do little to boost Ruben Amorim's position. The Portuguese head coach was under fire last week before the victory over Chelsea gave him respite.",
      "But, should they lose, fresh questions will be asked of not only Bayindir but Amorim too.",

      "Will Ruben Amorim give Kobbie Mainoo his first Premier League start of the season against Brentford?",
      "Mainoo has changed his private chef at home and worked with a private coach during the September international break in an attempt to improve. The youngster is understood to be determined to earn a starting role, with a view to representing England at the 2026 World Cup next summer.",
      "It's encouraging to learn that Mainoo has reacted positively to the disappointment of the denial of his loan request, but it will become harder for him to stay focused if his wait for a league start continues.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute in the opening games against Arsenal and Fulham. He has made appearances from the bench against Burnley, Manchester City and Chelsea, and his only start of the campaign came against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round last month.",
      "Amorim has challenged Mainoo to improve - he provided detailed thoughts on Mainoo's development before facing City - and has confirmed he is competing with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo are seen as competitors for one of the midfield roles, while Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are competitors for the other position. From Mainoo's perspective, that raises the possibility of him hardly starting because Fernandes is practically viewed as undroppable by Amorim.",
      "There was a chance against Chelsea last weekend to move Fernandes forward and start Mainoo because Matheus Cunha was returning from injury and was named on the bench. However, United's captain started alongside Casemiro, who received a second yellow card at the end of the first half.",
      "Casemiro is unavailable to face Brentford on Saturday afternoon. That means Amorim will pick between Fernandes, Ugarte and Mainoo for the two midfield positions in his system.",
      "If Amorim does not budge from his stance on his midfielders, then Fernandes will play alongside Ugarte. Mainoo will be named on the bench and the conversation around the academy graduate will continue.",
      "Amorim will decide whether Mainoo and Fernandes is the best partnership to win the game. And in the circumstances, that may be the case. Ugarte offers more defensive cover, but Mainoo is better on the ball and will be the better option to help control the game at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Speaking before the Manchester derby, Amorim said: \"I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "\"I think for some guys it is enough (their talent), but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie Mainoo, and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "\"If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he is going to play. And that I proved already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot... I have the same thing that you have: that he is a top, top player, but he can be so much better. So I'm focused on that.\"",
      "He continued: \"You have to imagine… Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach. I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton.",
      "\"Then nowadays, you can see that Vitinha – maybe – is the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes. The way I play is completely different from the last manager.",
      "\"Sometimes, I look at Kobbie Mainoo and I feel that sometimes he was like – and I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal – and you can feel that the Manchester United team was really transitional.",
      "\"He was the only guy who calmed down the game. Now we have other players who can calm down the game. We play a different game, and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo.\"",
      "It was illuminating to hear Amorim speak at length about Mainoo. He promised that he believed in the midfielder, and it's probably time to prove it against Brentford on Saturday afternoon.",

      "Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane has broken his silence over a potential return to the Premier League amid links with a move to Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "Reports in Germany this week have claimed that Kane's contract contains a hidden £56.7million release clause that can be activated if the striker desires to leave by the end of the January transfer window.",
      "The 32-year-old scored his 100th goal for Bayern on Friday night, netting a brace in their 4-0 win over Werder Bremen. Kane is the fastest player to reach the landmark for a club in Europe's top five leagues this century.",
      "Spurs boss Thomas Frank recently opened the door for Kane to return to north London, while links to United have re-emerged. Before he moved to Munich, the Reds were heavily linked with a move for the striker.",
      "However, despite the noise around his future, Kane has played down talk of his future. \"I'm really happy here at Bayern,\" he said. \"I have two years left on my contract. And to be honest, I'm enjoying every minute.",
      "\"I enjoy playing here in front of the fans. I enjoy the team, the coach. So that's not in my mind at all. I'm just looking forward to this season and hope we'll be successful.\"",
      "Bayern's sporting director Max Eberl has also played down speculation around Kane's future at the club, insisting the England international is in charge of his future. \"He's old enough to make his own decisions,\" he told BILD.",
      "\"Whether clause or no clause, whatever - if he says, 'I want to make a decision,' then he'll make it, as he showed at Tottenham. But our wish is, of course, to be very, very successful with Harry this season and in the future!\"",

      "During his pre-match press conference, Ruben Amorim announced that both Amad and Noussair Mazraoui would be absent for the game. And it was also confirmed that Dalot was back in contention.",
      "Taking to Instagram, Dalot posted a matchday graphic onto his story. While not a 100 per cent guarantee that he will start, players often post matchday graphics onto their social media channels when it is likely that they will play some part in the fixture.",
      "If Dalot is fit to start, he is more than likely going to as there is a current lack of players who can feature in the right wing-back slot. Another player who posted a pre-match graphic on his channels was Patrick Dorgu.",
      "The Dane provided a clever headed assist against Chelsea last weekend and is likely to retain his place in the squad. Less certainty surrounds what role Matheus Cunha will play in the game against the Bees.",
      "He came off the bench last weekend and did well but could be called upon to start against Brentford alongside former Bee Bryan Mbeumo. While Cunha has not posted himself about his availability, his wife Gabriela shared a matchday graphic posted by a Cunha fan account which could suggest that the Brazilian might be in a position to start today.",

      "Manchester United formally announced Stephen Torpey as the head of the academy on Wednesday.",
      "In June, it was confirmed that Nick Cox was set to leave after nine years of service to become technical director at Everton. During his time in charge, Cox has played a pivotal role in United's academy's renaissance, securing top youth signings and overseeing an FA Youth Cup triumph in 2021/22.",
      "Torpey has big shoes to fill. He worked closely with Jason Wilcox at Manchester City and the pair sat together at Old Trafford to watch the Under-21s against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.",
      "United have hired Torpey from Brentford, where he worked as the academy director from January 2024. Brentford hired Torpey to essentially build their academy from scratch and deliver Category One academy status. Torpey was previously at City, where he spent nine-and-a-half years in different positions.",
      "Torpey joined City in 2014 and gradually worked his way up in their academy to become the head of coaching between the Under-15 and Under-23 age groups, a role in which he oversaw trophy wins.",
      "The 43-year-old is credited with helping City implement a Barcelona-style coaching system, which has subsequently enabled the club's youth teams to win trophies with a similar style of football to their first-team.",
      "Torpey played a role in the development of Cole Palmer, James McAtee and Rico Lewis, who all progressed through the academy system at City to make senior debuts under Pep Guardiola. He also played a role in player recruitment as part of a team of academy staff who pitched to potential new signings.",
      "After a modest playing career, Torpey explored a career in coaching and returned to former club Liverpool. He was welcomed back to Merseyside as a Liverpool academy graduate, and worked in the youth system while it underwent a period of change, guided by the Spanish influence of Rafael Benitez.",
      "Speaking in a recent interview with The Times, Torpey said: “When you see players walk out for the first team and you’ve worked with them from the very earliest ages, they feel like one of your own.",
      "“There’s no better feeling for a fan than to watch one of your own. I think that’s the challenge here: to try and create that same special feeling for our fans when they see one of our local players run out at the Gtech and play in the Premier League and represent the club that they love.”",
      "Torpey was born in Kirby in Merseyside. He began his playing career in Liverpool's academy and played for the likes of Prescot Cables, Altrincham and FC United of Manchester during a lengthy non-league career.",
      "The new United chief joined FC United in 2005 following the founding of the club as a protest against the Glazer family. Torpey scored the club's first goal in a friendly match against Flixton in August 2005.",

      "The club have released images of the players training in the gym this week. As confirmed on Tuesday, Diogo Dalot is back in training after missing the clashes with Manchester City and Chelsea through injury. Dalot was forced to pull out of international duty with Portugal during the September internationals, but he could return for the trip to the capital on Saturday.",
      "There were worries Harry Maguire may have picked up a knock after he was taken off in United's victory over Chelsea. However, he was seen in training and so his removal was likely more of a move to manage his workload.",

      "Diogo Dalot (to the right of Bryan Mbeumo) could return on Saturday.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee will hope to play a part in Saturday's game.",

      "Casemiro will miss this weekend's game after being sent off against Chelsea.",
      "Leny Yoro dropped out of the starting XI last weekend but will hope to feature on Saturday.",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored his 100th United goal last weekend and will look to add to that tally against Brentford.",
      "Luke Shaw has spoken openly about Roy Keane's recent criticism of him and he looked in good spirits in training.",

      "It’s never a great sign when the producer of a broadcaster flips from a close-up reaction shot of a player to a wide image of someone bearing down on goal with no-one anywhere near him. Something has definitely gone wrong.",
      "The individual in question presumably, and quite reasonably, thought Matheus Cunha’s frustration at not being awarded a free-kick after Diogo Dalot’s poor pass spoiled a very presentable opportunity on the break for Manchester United would make for better TV than whatever might happen from Jordan Henderson’s hoof forward.",
      "They couldn’t have predicted the electric shock Harry Maguire appeared to be subjected to as his absurdly tardy and ill-advised decision to play offside saw him jump forward in vain, as Igor Thiago charged toward the United goal to create a delightful 30-yard gap between the pair by the time the cameras caught up.",
      "It was some strike. The sort of f***-it finish that would end up in row Z 99 times out of 100 as Thiago half-volleyed the bouncing ball in off the stanchion.",
      "And after Ruben Amorim’s worrying suggestion that Bryan Mbeumo is “different” to the rest of his teammates as he doesn’t immediately catastrophise after going behind, the summer signing was powerless to a collective sh*tting of the bed from the pessimistic Red Devils which ensued for the next 15 minutes and barely abated for the rest of the game.",
      "The widely condemned Altay Bayindir did indeed look like the “only line of defence”, as observed by commentator Darren Fletcher, with the Turkey international making two excellent saves in quick succession to deny Sepp van den Berg and then Nathan Collins, as United’s work on set pieces in the warm-up looked only to have confused them. Brentford were first to every long throw-in or corner delivered into the box. And balls smashed out from the back.",
      "Igor Thiago is a big lad, and there’s no great shame in losing an aerial battle to him, but there absolutely is in allowing him to chest the ball down to a teammate under no pressure from a ball punted from at least 60 yards. It was pathetic from Mattihjs de Ligt, as was his failure to then track Thiago into the box as he tapped the ball in to double Brentford’s lead.",
      "His United teammates could have helped him out of a bind, but didn’t, with Manuel Ugarte, Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw the firefighters with their d*cks in their hands.",
      "And in a clear example of the fragile confidence at United, after a very solid start to the season, certainly compared to last, De Ligt crumbled, misplacing passes, misjudging the flight of the ball and conceding needless free-kicks. We particularly enjoyed that bit when he air kicked and fell over in his own box.",
      "We didn’t see any great uptick in forward fluency as United’s £200m forward trio started together for the first time. Link-up between Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha ended with either a poor final pass or a timid effort from one or the other until Cunha’s cross for Mbeumo led to the United penalty. And while Peter Crouch claimed Benjamin Sesko’s goal was an example of his “commitment”, it is undeniably funny that he needed three shots to score from inside the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United may well have had the most shots (79), created the most chances (60) and accrued the most expected goals (9.7) in the Premier League after the first five games, but it never really felt as though the Brentford goal was under any great pressure.",
      "Amorim was proved right in sticking with Bayindir, who made another brilliant save to deny Dango Ouattara and keep his side in the game midway through the second half, but the space Outtara found himself in on the penalty spot begs the question as to why he continues to pick Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could be just as late in tracking back as the Uruguayan in such a situation, but also probably wouldn’t be, and wouldn’t either give the ball away or play a pass sideways or backwards whenever he has possession.",
      "And as predicted when the team news was announced, Amorim will face some difficult questions as to why he’s dropped Leny Yoro for the last two games after what looked to be a very assured start to the season. Both his speed and ability to progress the ball would have very useful here, and surely an improvement on what any of Maguire, De Ligt or Shaw provided.",
      "We thoroughly look forward to the PGMOL apology to Manchester United for somehow failing to advise Craig Pawson to even look at the pitch-side monitor as Nathan Collins denied Mbeumo one of the clearest goalscoring opportunities imaginable, particularly as the time it took to make that wrong decision contributed to an interminable wait for Bruno Fernandes to take the penalty which he then missed, as some excellent substitution sh*thousery from Keith Andrews made it a five-minute delay.",
      "United still had 15 minutes including stoppage time to draw level against a side which has dropped more points (8) from winning positions than any other team in the Premier League this season, but it was Brentford who added to their lead, with substitute Mathias Jensen combining with Yehor Yarmolyuk on the break before smashing the ball past Bayindir.",
      "Joe Cole described Manchester United as “abysmal” after the final whistle, but refused to pin the blame on Amorim, instead claiming it’s the old “culture of the club” problem rearing its head again.",
      "But f*** that. This is on Amorim. He picked the wrong team, his formation and tactics don’t work, and his players crumble at the merest hint of a hardship. If this isn’t the worst team in Manchester United history, it’s surely the easiest to play against. The best the fans can hope for is more false dawns under a manager not fit for purpose.",
      "Since Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim was appointed, only one team that has not been relegated or promoted has picked up fewer points than his Red Devils.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Ruben Amorim should brace himself for pelters if Man Utd fail to beat Brentford after social media backlash over three selection calls.",

      "Bayindir started his sixth straight Premier League game as United made the trip to Brentford on Saturday. He’d been behind Andre Onana in the pecking order last season, but was clearly preferred to him at the beginning of this campaign, leading to Onana being loaned to Trabzonspor.",
      "He said: “It feels to me, the situation with the goalkeeper just hasn’t been addressed. I think it feels like they’ve got three No.2s. It’s an issue that was obvious, Onana wasn’t going to be the No.1. I think we knew that. And I don’t think the situation’s been addressed.",
      "“And obviously they’ve brought the young lad in who isn’t starting, Lammens, has come in, and you know, he was brought to potentially be a No.1 and can’t get in the team. He’s still a young lad. He’s had one real season in in football, and obviously they’re starting Bayindir.”",
      "Within the first few minutes of the match against Brentford, Bayindir both made a positive contribution, with a good double save, and undid that with the Bees second goal.",
      "Bayindir saved a tight effort from Kevin Schade, but parried immediately into the path of Igor Thiago, whose effort into the middle of the goal was met with Bayindir’s left hand, but he was unable to stop it, and he followed by punching the turf in frustration.",
      "Whether Lammens is given his first start soon remains to be seen. Our friends at TEAMtalk have suggested it is coming.",
      "For Crouch, he feels that will eventually be the case, though he’s not sure why one of two better keepers were not signed at Old Trafford.",

      "Graham Potter has been sacked by West Ham, and they have already considered one replacement to be “too risky” as the potential of Manchester United instead landing that man has been discussed by insider Dean Jones.",
      "Potter has been shown the door by the Hammers, with the side currently sat 19th in the Premier League. The call was curiously made after the boss had given his pre-match press conference for Monday’s trip to Everton.",
      "Multiple sources expect former Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo to take over.",
      "Some have suggested that Nuno will be in the dugout when West Ham take on the Toffees.",
      "The risks of one of Potter’s potential replacements, Gary O’Neil, have been reported, and our friends at TEAMtalk have got information from insider Jones about why Kieran McKenna is also not viewed as a serious candidate.",
      "He also detailed the potential of a Manchester United move for the Ipswich boss, who was formerly on the coaching staff at Old Trafford.",
      "Jones said: “I see links with McKenna, but I don’t see how either West Ham or Man United can gamble on him in this specific moment.",
      "“I know that West Ham have considered it to be too risky. Turning to a Championship manager is not a guarantee of things being any better than they are under Graham Potter.",
      "“By the same token could United really turn to the Ipswich manager if they decide that another high-profile appointment has not worked out? Obviously there are historical links, which make it seem somewhat feasible yet when you consider this is a club that were aiming to win the Premier League by 2028 it really would seem an extremely brave decision.",
      "“At some stage, McKenna is going to get an opportunity again in the Premier League but I do not see the current situation at either of those clubs being the moment that opens it up.”",
      "For West Ham, there is surely a perceived danger of McKenna not helping them avoid the drop, given he was relegated last season with Ipswich, and they’ll want a boss who they know can make a fist of the battle.",
      "At United, there’s an even bigger risk. Ruben Amorim is beginning to make his mark on his side, who have had the most xG of any side this season in the Premier League.",
      "To turn away from that for a manager who is currently in the Championship and has led his side to just one win there, there’s a huge danger that things will go wrong and they’ll put themselves in a tough spot.",
      "Joe Cole and Paul Merson have both hit out at West Ham for the timing of their sacking of Graham Potter, while the latter feels expected replacement Nuno Espirito Santo ...",
      "Graham Potter has been sacked by West Ham just five games into the Premier League season and his ‘expected’ replacement has been revealed.",
      "According to reports, Graham Potter has been ‘given’ a brief ‘stay of execution’ at West Ham United, who have been told to appoint Frank Lampard.",
      "West Ham will reportedly give Graham Potter until after the international break amid complications over Nuno Espirito Santo’s potential appointment.",
      "Former West Ham midfielder Scott Parker is in the frame to replace Graham Potter if the Hammers decide to sack their current manager, according to reports.",
      "West Ham have reached the stage where anger is in danger of giving way to apathy. It’s a club where absolutely everything seems broken beyond repair."

      "Ruben Amorim has set himself up for criticism after three controversial selection calls as the Manchester United boss seeks back-to-back Premier League wins for the very first time as his side take on Brentford on Saturday.",
      "Amorim relieved some of the pressure on his shoulders through a 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out, but it didn’t feel all that much like a turning point with Robert Sanchez’s red card and Enzo Maresca’s substitutions in response giving the Portuguese boss and his players a huge helping hand.",
      "Rio Ferdinand reckons seven points from five games constitutes a “remarkable” start to the season, though that claim in itself is far more remarkable than two wins and a draw.",
      "Much of the criticism of Amorim, aside from the results and performances, has centred around his refusal to waver from his now infamous 3-4-3 system and how it’s failing to get the best out of his players.",
      "It’s left Kobbie Mainoo, who was one of United’s greatest hopes for the future before Amorim arrived at Old Trafford, with a bit-part role, with the midfielder – who also starred for England at Euro 2024 – again starting on the bench vs Brentford, as has been the case in every Premier League game so far.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, who looks nothing like the player he was under Amorim at Sporting, has come in for Casemiro as the Brazilian serves a suspension following his daft red card against Chelsea.",
      "But it wasn’t Mainoo who was trending on social media when the team news was revealed – his absence is no great surprise – but Leny Yoro.",
      "The feeling among many Manchester United fans is that he’s been their best centre-back this season, maybe second best behind Matthijs de Ligt, but having been dropped for the win over Chelsea, the 19-year-old has again been left out, with Amorim sticking with a back three of De Ligt, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.",

      "And the third controversial call sees Altay Bayindir retain his spot in the team ahead of summer signing Senne Lammens amid suggestions this week that the £18m summer signing may come in for the Turkey international and despite the 23-year-old impressing in training.",

The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but that voice won’t quit.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",

      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal are broadly unscathed, yet it also does feel like they’re already playing catch-up from that all-too-familiar second place. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",

      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brought back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "It’s not been awful, but it’s really not been great either. Being above Manchester United is not the boast it used to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there could be more on the wagon.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening five games to go with a creditable draw against Newcastle is plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone – draws with Burnley less so – but it is an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "There is some good news, though, because Wolves have a much-needed appointment scheduled with Dr Tottenham this weekend.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "Bleak fare indeed, and you do wonder whether Emery might now be minded to take any opportunity to jump ship that comes his way before his reputation starts to sink with Villa’s league position.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. The 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea is not a turning point; they’ve run out of those.",

      "Former Liverpool coach Thomas Gronnemark has hit out at Arne Slot, Mikel Arteta and other Premier League managers over their “really ugly” strategy.",
      "Gronnemark is famed for working under Jurgen Klopp between 2018 and 2023 and has imparted his expertise on a number of top clubs and national teams as the world’s only professional throw-in coach.",
      "The 49-year-old used to hold the world record for the longest throw-in, at 51.33 metres and has spent 21 years carving throw-in niche for himself, but isn’t impressed by the standard of them in the Premier League this season as we see a huge uptick in the number of long throws.",
      "He claims “the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low” in what is a “really ugly” part of the game thanks to the poor strategy.",
      "“You can say there are many more long throw-ins in the Premier League. You can say ‘isn’t that good?’ No, not necessarily! There are far too many teams taking low-quality long throw-ins. Some of the throw-ins are just not long enough, so they’re not dangerous, and sometimes it’s about the strategy,” Gronnemark told Mirror.",
      "“It’s also about entertainment for the fans. People might think that a guy who coaches long throw-ins wants a lot of them. Actually, I don’t. I don’t want to see every team take 10 long throw-ins in every game because then we have too much start and stop.",
      "“People just look at the best teams and say ‘they’re having real success data-wise, so we’ll do the same’. But they are forgetting that there’s a lot of work, many years’ worth, behind it. You have to do space creation around the opponents’ penalty area.",
      "“To be honest, for most teams, throw-ins are a really ugly part because the quality is so low, the ball is being thrown into high-pressure situations where there are duels,” he explains. “There are too many chaotic throw-ins in the Premier League: the level from Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle is really low. Possession rates are at around 25 to 33 per cent on throw-ins under pressure. The standard is really low.",
      "“When I was at Liverpool the quality went up, but it’s started to go down again. I think one of the reasons is that they’re only training one or two routines in each zone. Yeah, it can work but your players have to learn to think throw-ins.”",
      "MORE LIVERPOOL COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Liverpool: New Romano update on Reds star suggests only one outcome of ‘difficult conversation’\n👉 Arsenal: ‘Fed up’ Paul Merson proves panic with two kneejerk PL title predictions amid baffling U-turn\n👉 Arsenal title hopes ‘kaput’ this weekend on two conditions: ‘Liverpool big favourites’",
      "Gronnemark has been working with Brentford this season and they stand out as a team benefitting from their use, having put 23 into the opponents’ penalty area this season, resulting in one goal, 11 shots and 1.29 xG.",
      "“If you’re a world-class throw-in taker, it’s much easier to put the ball where you want with a throw-in than with a corner kick,” he added. “How many corners hit the first man? It’s hard to kick with your foot. It’s much easier to throw with your hands if you have the right technique.",
      "“There are a lot of set piece coaches now and a lot of them treat the throw-in like a corner or a free-kick.",
      "“So they say ‘we can have one or two routines in each zone’. But the challenge is that the opponents’ defending pattern will already mark this from the start then the players have a big challenge.",
      "“Even with the biggest teams in the Premier League, you can see that if they make one move and it doesn’t work then the players don’t know what to do – they’re getting confused, frustrated because they don’t have a high throw-in intelligence.”",
      "Arne Slot has confirmed that Liverpool defender Geovanni Leoni will miss “around a year”, but refused to say he regrets missing out on Marc Guehi.",
      "Arne Slot has revealed how he “disciplined” Hugo Ekitike following his “stupid” red card in Liverpool’s win over Southampton on Tuesday.",
      "While Hugo Ekitike’s red grabbed the attention, another moment in Liverpool’s victory over Southampton would have been far more worrying for Arne Slot.",

      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot has hit out at Hugo Ekitike for his “stupid” decision to take off his shirt and snub Federico Chiesa in their win over Southampton.",

      "What’s the ‘only reason’ Ruben Amorim hasn’t been sacked by Manchester United? And which two Red Devils heroes are poised for a caretaker role?",

      "Carrick is currently without a club having been let go by Middlesbrough in the summer, while Fletcher is coaching the United U18s.",
      "“Short term, I wouldn’t be surprised at [Carrick or Fletcher to replace Amorim] at all,” Nevin said, speaking to gaming news publisher Escapist Magazine. “That would be absolutely fine. And they might do well.",
      "“They offered the caretaker role to Ole first didn’t they. It takes the pressure off, you can have a good look around. And if he does well, we just keep him. That’s fine. You’ll get a bit of pressure in the press saying, ‘They don’t know what to do, they haven’t got a clue, they can’t get the right man, all that sort of stuff.’",
      "“I”ve been there before. I just blanked it. I don’t care. I’ve got a guy doing a good job here and I wouldn’t look for the other manager. And I’ll say to them, ‘If you keep on doing well, you can get a job.’ I’m not hiding anything from anyone here. I’m looking at every possible option.",

      "“Maybe that’s been United’s problem. They’ve tried, they’ve had plans. They’ve had two, three, four, five year plans that have all lasted a year. And that’s not good. Because the next person comes in and they change it, the next one changes it.",
      "“That’s the only reason why they’re standing by Amorim just now. It’s because they know they didn’t spend time with the other ones, so we now end up with a Frankenstein team. All bought by different managers. None of it really fits together. And then you find out they got rid of some people they shouldn’t have gotten rid of like McTominay.”",

      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "And why are Football365 trying to get Ange Postecoglou sacked?",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Longtime reader, first time mailer. Naturally I decided to pop the cherry on a safe and non-controversial topic: Marcus Rashford.",
      "I think the problem with what Ian Watson and a handful of Mailbox ultras have been saying about the ongoing Scholes/Rashford drama is that they think that the reason why what Scholes said is problematic is solely because of the content. It’s not. It’s the very presence of the comment in a public space.",
      "To explain: Paul Scholes is fully entitled to enjoy (or not enjoy) any opinion of Marcus Rashford that he likes. He can hate him for any number of reasons, including – and this is important – stupid, nonsensical ones. Furthermore, as a United fan it makes perfect sense for him to resent Rashford up and leaving them, and there is no sense in demanding that he or any United fan wish him the best.",
      "The problem is that Paul Scholes is not just a United fan. He is a massively famous pundit who is paid, I imagine, a lot of money to talk about football. And what irks me about him STILL moaning about Rashford is just how utterly unnecessary it all is at this point. Love them or hate them, United this season are absolutely delicious narratively. They are either a sleeping giant about to awake or an old palace burning down, depending on your outlook, but the one thing that is totally not part of this saga is Marcus bloody Rashford. He is GONE. It is time to MOVE ON.",
      "I guess what I’m saying is that there seems to be an assumption from old pros that their every opinion deserves to be heard, all the time, no matter what. But I don’t particularly give a monkey’s what Scholes thinks of Rashford as a person. I’m interested in what he thinks of him as a footballer, but modern pundits aren’t quite as vocal on that subject.",
      "There is also something so bitter and nasty about Scholes saying what he said, because as much as it’s fair to hold Rashford responsible for his performances at United, it’s also important to bear in mind that the club wanted him gone. It was generally accepted that he had to go in the summer for his own good and the club’s. So with that in mind, what is the point of seeing a young man finding a new lease of life after years of sullen, uninspired football, and then nastily snipe him from the pundit box? It smacks of spitefulness and is one of the many reasons why I think all the Alex Ferguson old boys – Scholes, Keane, Ferdinand and Neville – have been absolutely toxic for both punditry and United as an institution. If we must talk about United then let’s talk about United, if we must talk about Barcelona let’s talk about Barcelona, but swiping at Rashford for his bad performances last season just drags down the conversation. I would expect better from a man of Scholes’ age.",
      "Correct opinion? Maybe. I don’t think so personally, but that’s not really the point. Why does it actually need to be said, is the real question. Does it enlighten the fans? Does it explain United’s struggles this season? Does it explain Barcelona’s success? No. It’s just meaningless negativity, like so much of modern football.",
      "It also is yet another example of United old boys finding a way to tear down a young black man no matter the situation. Every single time. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, this mail is long enough as is.\nSamuel, Fulham fan till the end",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "I hope you are all well (or at least caffeinated). I just read two recent F365 takes on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Let me save you some time: I don’t care whether Rashford sulked at Manchester United.",
      "Before you throw a tomato at me for lack of nuance, allow me to explain:",
      "1. Sulking is a spectator’s hobby",
      "If a player is walking, moody, whispering dire oaths in the tunnel — I’ll raise an eyebrow, maybe tweet (sorry X) about it, but I’m not launching moral crusades. Football is messy. Players are people. Sometimes they sulk. Big deal.",
      "2. Would you want to play in the current Manchester United team?",
      "Let me ask you this, dear reader: if someone handed you a contract today to play for this Manchester United — the board, the chaos, the constant managerial churning, the pressure to be more myth than person — would you take it?",
      "Because spare me the nostalgia of “United would have done this” — the United of today is a far cry from the Fergie glory years.",
      "3. Rashford is doing well at Barça",
      "While some are busy flinging “disgrace” accusations, Rashford has started making noise in Barcelona. He’s scoring, contributing, adapting. He’s quieting critics the best way — by playing. And (whisper it) I happen to think that’s more compelling than being praised from my cheap seat at Old Trafford.",
      "4. Even Alex Hunter wouldn’t want to play for Manchester United",
      "Yes, I just dragged a FIFA video game character into this. But hear me out: Alex Hunter (from the FIFA story mode) has tons of dramatic options. If the script handed him the chance to play for Man Utd — under the current regime, under the weight of expectation and instability — I reckon he’d look at his agent and say, “Nah, I’ll play for a mid-tier side and enjoy my life.”",
      "Because even in fantasy land, there’s an escape clause.",
      "So here’s my bottom line: you can publish/ podcast a hundred think-pieces dissecting Rashford’s body language, demeanor, or public statements. But unless you’ve walked in his boots — including the ones he’s now laced up in Barcelona — you should STFU and don’t get to claim moral high ground.\nGaptoothfreak, Man. Utd. fan with too much time, New York",
      "",
      "Long, long time reader of 2 decades. Occasional letter writer.",
      "I wrote in last year about how the site is actively trying to generate managerial sackings and drama, to create negative narratives about clubs, managers and players. For clicks I assume, and instead of analytical articles that are harder to write. The standard of writing has fallen a long way.",
      "I have a 15 year old daughter who has a longer concentration span, and is less fickle and emotional,  more mature . The knee jerking and need to create a story is a far cry from earlier years, where there was mature reporting and genuine humour.",
      "Now we have a site that is essentially a list of top 10s. “Next manager to be sacked“,  “Top 10 replacements for Ange”. A couple of bad results and the narrative begins “X is under pressure”.",
      "Ange has had 4 games. 4 away games. He had a couple days before the Arsenal game, so essentially 3 games. All away. 2 draws where they dominated. Let’s start building an Ange out narrative, spread it across social media until it reaches fans who put pressure on the owner and he pulls the trigger so you can say “we were right”.",
      "He won a major trophy, got Spurs into the CL. Recruited a large number of excellent players. Such is the poor attention span and need for instant gratification people are now disregarding a 5th place finish in his first season. He got lucky at the start of the season apparently. Trying to paint him as though he’s a village idiot. There was a zero percent chance of Spurs going down at any time, and he knew it, so switched attention to CL qualification.",
      "Would fans rather win a trophy or finish 8th? Who had a better season last year, Spurs or Villa? One won a trophy they’ll be talking about for generations, qualified for the CL. Would you rather finish 6- 8th every year, play conservatively and have a cup run?",
      "Oh, and now apparently Emery, the golden boy of the last 2 seasons is now under pressure after a slow start, according to 365. His last 2 seasons don’t count anymore because of a few poor games.",
      "Jesus.\nFadida",

      "Read that Sulivan is considering Bilic as manager with Mark Noble and James Collins as assistants. This beggars belief but perhaps helpfully demonstrates the board’s thought process.",
      "While Nobes and the ginger Brazilian will always be club legends, we all know that the ‘club player to manager role’ route is almost always a complete disaster. And Bilic is conspicuously out of work. So for Sullivan, he thinks “fan favorites, and they are all so thick that this will therefore surely stop the protests, tick, “costs me absolutely nothing”, tick.

      "There was a rare occasion where I agreed with John Nicholson when he bemoaned stats and said we’d turn football “from poetry to maths”.  One of the things that’s especially irritating about the saturation of stats is that the average punter either doesn’t understand them or misuses them, xG being the most obvious example.",
      "xG is pretty meaningless in telling you about how an individual game has gone. A late goalmouth scramble having been under the cosh all game can massively boost a side’s  xG but isn’t reflective of the whole. The stat only becomes relevant when viewed over a sweep of games, and can then be used to tell you trends of many goals a team should be scoring/conceding and whether they’re getting lucky.",

Not like the weird, yet heart-warming feeling of seeing early Shearer footage in the red and white of the Draper Tools kit – but actually quite horrifying.",
      "Then it gots me to thinking… who could never have worn anything but their last clubs shirt?",
      "I don’t think it’d have bothered me to see Giggs or Scholes wear an Arsenal shirt for example and that’s not an indictment on those two, just, some players would look ghastly in another teams shirt and the initial ones that come to mind are:",

      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",

      "Man Utd have only failed to score against Arsenal and Manchester City, and there’s been at least three goals scored in United’s last four games across all competitions.",
      "Brentford are leaky, having let in eight in the last four, but they are on target at the other end having scored in every game this season.",
      "Combining both teams to score and over 2.5 goals will give you some better odds.",
      "All eyes will be on former Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who has impressed the United faithful in the handful of appearances he has made for his new side.",
      "He has two goals already and while it may be tempting to stick him down for a goal against his old club, shots are a more likely success route.",
      "He has registered a shot on target in four of his last five league games, and is averaging three shots per game.",
      "The Cameroon international will be fired up for this one so stick your neck out for over two shots on target against the Bees."

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has made a prediction relating to Luke Shaw after the England international was heavily criticised by Roy Keane.",
      "When fit and firing, Shaw has proven that he is can be one of the best full-backs in the Premier League.",
      "However, injuries and poor form have impacted the Man Utd star in recent years and Keane blasted him for his poor performance in his side’s 3-0 loss against Manchester City.",
      "Keane has argued that the England international has been “getting away with murder for years”.",
      "“Shaw is an international footballer, so for him to get caught out like that,” Keane said.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim should avoid ‘complete honesty’ when it’s an admission of Man Utd ignorance",
      "“I think he has been getting away with murder for years at United. Always injured and never quite fit.",
      "“We make excuses and then he gets a few games under his belt and he’s making decisions like he doesn’t even want to tackle anyone.”",
      "Shaw subsequently issued an honest response, admitting that the pundit had a point as he needs to do better for Man Utd.",
      "The left-back has since been defended by teammate Harry Maguire, with Ferdinand taking time to praise the two defenders.",
      "Ferdinand has backed Shaw to respond by “putting in a performance” against Brentford this weekend.",
      "“Personally I think it is great from Harry Maguire because that is the job of a captain/senior player to come in and defend your players if you think that they are being unfairly treated,” Ferdinand told MEN Sport.",
      "“I also think Luke Shaw coming out and speaking himself is what I like.",
      "“I like to see players come out and go: ‘You know what, I am not having that or actually, they are right. I was under par for the level that I have set myself.’",
      "“I am sure he will put in a performance this week Luke Shaw, that will make you think: ‘He is made of the right stuff.’ I just think that Luke Shaw is a magnificently talented player, he has just been so unfortunate with injuries that he has never been able to maintain his fitness and it goes back to that word again, consistency.",
      "“If you can’t be consistent with appearances and being available, it is going to be difficult for you to really stamp your authority and really sustain the level of performances that is required for a top club.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand thinking Man Utd have been ‘remarkable’ is far more remarkable than their start to the season under Ruben Amorim. How the mighty have fallen.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has criticised Benjamin Sesko after the striker had just six touches in the first half against ten-man Chelsea.",
      "Mikel Arteta isn’t a gambler like Sir Alex Ferguson was, and that could cost Arsenal the Premier League title, says Man Utd legend Roy Keane.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has revealed whether he’d rather have Erling Haaland or Kylian Mbappe with the Manchester City star “blitzing” teams like he did Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United lost their third game of the season on Sunday as rivals Manchester City beat them 3-0 in a comprehensive performance.",

      "Ruben Amorim is a man now famed for his honesty in press conferences. If anything, he’s too honest.",
      "The Manchester United chiefs weren’t all that enamoured with his response to questions about Kobbie Mainoo’s future, for example, nor his threats last season to walk away from the club if results didn’t improve.",
      "That integrity is a key part of his charisma, which was supposedly a key draw for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses when selecting the Portuguese boss as their replacement for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But again, with Brentford incredibly offering up an opportunity for Amorim to earn back-to-back Premier League wins for the very first time, when asked by a reporter in the press conference what the key to consistency is for Manchester United, we would advise Amorim against “complete honesty” when it’s an admission of ignorance.",
      "“It is normal that the fans don’t know what is going to happen in the next game. To be completely honest, I have an idea, but I don’t know how it’s going to be and I’m the manager of the team! The best way of dealing with that is every game is the last one.”",
      "We enjoy self-deprecation as much as anyone, and understand that it’s no more than a jovial, throwaway comment from a man under pressure; someone quite frankly embarrassed that after ten months in charge of one of the biggest clubs in world football he’s yet to win two league games on the bounce.",
      "Without similarly cheeky lines he may not still be in the job, with his press conference manner the key to this aura of stability and confidence he’s managed to fabricate for himself despite the chaos on the pitch.",

      "And of course, like any other football manager, he doesn’t really know what’s going to happen in any game. It’s presumably why he loves football, if he does indeed still love it.",
      "But five games into a new season in which there’s been no great sign of progress after leading them in their worst campaign in living memory, not knowing whether his team is going to be any good or not feels awfully close to the bone of contention that he doesn’t know how to turn things around at Old Trafford.",
      "No Manchester United fan will be turning up for this clash at Brentford tomorrow with any clue as to how their team perform on a scale from not bad to terrible, but should the manager not have more than “an idea”? Or at least put the brutal honesty on hold and claim that he does?",
      "Because as much as anything, we’re not sure it’s an admission the famously fragile Manchester United players will be using as any great motivation to break this two-game hoodoo."

      "We must be honest and concede that it’s not quite as chunky a Big Weekend as the last couple, but it’s another where the fixture computer’s capriciousness could leave Arsenal again fearing the worst and playing catch-up at a ground with bad recent memories for Arteta and co.",
      "Meanwhile every weekend is Big for Big Ange Postecoglou as he has another stab at getting a first win to go with all the lovely attacking football he’s got Forest playing now.",
      "And in not unrelated news, beleaguered Wolves head to London hoping for a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham.",
      "",
      "We once again find ourselves with some degree of sympathy for Arsenal and the machinations of the fixture computer. Liverpool once again have first-mover advantage on a weekend when Arsenal’s task is a difficult one.",
      "Liverpool have no penalty kick themselves at Selhurst Park, but if they can win – via late shirt-removing methods or otherwise – then Arsenal face another Sunday afternoon when any slight slip will come with outsized consequences.",
      "Arsenal could be eight points adrift by the time they kick off at a stadium where their recent record is not good. Arsenal lost twice at St James’ Park last season without scoring a goal, in the league and again in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, extending a record in Newcastle that now reads one win and four defeats on their last five visits.",
      "For Newcastle, this game represents a test of what has been a few weeks of tentative promise since the cruel late defeat to Liverpool. That was a game that featured 83 per cent of all goals scored in Premier League games involving Newcastle this season. Three of their other four games have finished goalless, along with a 1-0 home win over hapless Wolves.",
      "This is a game that should give a pretty clear indication of whether the last few weeks have represented recovery and growth, or just not playing any of the top teams for a bit. At least domestically; there was plenty of encouragement too in a narrow Champions League defeat to Barcelona.",
      "The fact Liverpool have already won here adds another dash of intrigue and jeopardy for Arsenal; it already feels like an achievement that even at this early stage they must match. And a game where all evidence from Newcastle’s efforts outside that Liverpool defeat suggest Mikel Arteta will simply have to release that infamous handbrake of his.",
      "",
      "We’re really not sure how much longer Viktor Gyokeres scoring the wrong kind of goals is going to keep providing a covering narrative for the fact the big-money striker Man United chose after missing out on the Swede still doesn’t have any goals, at all, against anyone up to and including Grimsby Town.",
      "Sesko played the full 90 minutes of that match before infamously stepping up as the last outfield player to take a penalty for United in the dignity-sapping shoot-out that followed.",
      "While he’s been more sporadically used in the Premier League, he has nevertheless now played a tick under 300 minutes of football for United without a goal or assist to his name.",
      "It’s not Sesko’s fault that United paid what they paid for him, nor that he is the latest pawn in the wider United banter circus.",
      "But he’s going to need to start helping himself soon, and a Saturday lunchtime trip to a hollowed-out Brentford side who have shipped seven goals in their last three Premier League games represents just about as good a chance as any at this point.",
      "If anything, has the great man’s start at Nottingham Forest perhaps been too Postecoglou? We really don’t want to complain, or indeed to appear greedy and ungrateful, but it has felt like all the key elements of Postecoglou’s football have been crammed into the last few weeks.",
      "Forest have started playing some truly gorgeous attacking football, and some truly catastrophic defensive football. They have failed to defend leads against teams as diverse as Swansea, Burnley and Real Betis, while the hamstring injuries that plagued Big Ange’s riotously entertaining two years at Tottenham are already making an unwanted appearance in Nottingham.",
      "Sunderland at home would have been a fixture most teams were chalking up as three points when the computer spat out the schedule back in June, but a lot has changed for both Sunderland and Forest since then.",
      "It’s an awkwardly big game now for Postecoglou, with last weekend’s failure to put Burnley away exacerbated by the same failing in the Europa League in midweek.",
      "There are many reasons why Postecoglou is currently a fixture in the manager to watch slot. One, it’s just pretty much always entertaining and who doesn’t enjoy that? But a second reason is the clear and certain sense that we should enjoy it while we can, because it doesn’t feel likely that Angeball is back on any kind of long-term basis.",
      "We’re not yet in must-win territory, even for Mr Marinakis, but there is a sense of ‘if not now, when?’ about Postecoglou’s quest for a first victory with his new club. After Sunderland, it’s Midtjylland and Newcastle before the October international break and Chelsea, Porto, Bournemouth, Manchester United, Sturm Graz, Leeds, Liverpool and Malmo before the end of November.",
      "Manchester United should provide few problems, given Postecoglou’s formline there, but with the rest of that run of games it doesn’t require a vivid imagination to picture it all spiralling rapidly out of control.",
      "",
      "Five defeats to begin the Premier League season, which extends Vitor Pereira’s side’s overall winless league run to nine vexing matches since the giddy spring days of winning six in a row.",
      "With Wolves’ own deep woes and a squad left woefully under-powered after a difficult summer exacerbated by clear signs of life at all three promoted clubs, you already find yourself wondering how much longer the club can afford to wait before taking decisive action to arrest the slide and save their season.",
      "It feels wild to be talking this way given just how adroitly Pereira steered Wolves out of trouble back in March and April, but the drop-off has been gargantuan and the context of that six-game winning run starting to look slightly different.",
      "It was a run that featured all three relegated sides as well as West Ham, Manchester United and Tottenham who were very much the worst of the non-relegated teams in the second half of last season.",
      "Six straight wins is still six straight wins, but there has to be some acknowledgement they came against the six easiest possible opponents with very little scope for hope or optimism since.",
      "Until now. It’s Spurs again for Wolves this weekend and, while they do look a very different and less banterous beast under Thomas Frank, they are still Tottenham. The Doctor will see you now.",
      "",
      "A key midlands derby between two teams with clear Premier League ambitions, Coventry having lost out in the play-offs in two out of the last three seasons while remaining unbeaten in the Championship this season under Frank Lampard, and Birmingham’s targeting of back-to-back promotions back to the big time long since certain to be one of the EFL’s key talking points this season.",
      "Coventry could do with turning draws into wins, while Birmingham are still yet to truly settle on their best XI in a brave new world, yet both can be reasonably content with how things are shaping up, both reaching ten points after six games to sit in and around the play-off spots at this early stage.",
      "",
      "The two Madrid giants have made wildly contrasting starts in La Liga thus far, with Real Madrid currently boasting a flawless 18 points from their opening six games but Atleti managing only half that.",
      "They needed a late Julian Alvarez-inspired comeback to see off Rayo Vallecano at home in midweek, while their Champions League campaign got off to a gut-wrenching start at Liverpool the week before.",
      "It doesn’t quite feel like the ideal time to be facing their big noisy neighbours, where things are currently progressing so serenely they didn’t even feel the need to have a hissy fit about the Ballon d’Or this time.",
      "",
      "There is no imaginable football where this isn’t a big game, albeit that as far as the women’s game is currently concerned the balance of power lies rather differently to the men’s. United have made a fine start to the new WSL season after a pair of handsome wins over Leicester and London City and a creditable goalless draw against Arsenal.",
      "Liverpool, meanwhile, still await their first point after a humbling Merseyside Derby defeat to Everton and then going down at Leicester after the hosts were reduced to 10 early in the second half.",
      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "Spurs are definitely about to sign stars from Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona while keeping Djed Spence and his penitentiary at left-back.",
      "Has the Club World Cup absolutely cocked up Chelsea’s season? It’s starting to feel like that with such a long injury list.",
      "Liverpool will probably manage without their fourth-choice centre-half and there are a fair few reasons why panicking over Eberechi Eze at Arsenal is daft.",

      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Manchester United remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Man Utd made a late move for Baleba, 21, in the summer transfer window after spending over £200million on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "There have been reports of Liverpool competing with the Red Devils for Baleba’s signature, but transfer expert Jacobs poured cold water on that.",
      "“I’m not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deep-lying midfielder. Should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder,” he told The United Stand.",
      "Jacobs added that Man Utd did a lot of “legwork” in August, making it very unlikely they will walk away from their pursuit of Baleba next year.",
      "“One of the reasons they (Man Utd) did all the legwork over the final weeks of the window was to try and put themselves in the strongest possible position, because I think they will be moving for Carlos Baleba,” he continued.",
      "MORE: Man Utd choose ‘elite’ manager as ‘prime candidate’ to replace Amorim amid two reasons for verdict",
      "“You don’t commit to what would have been potentially a 100 million-plus spend and then just walk away, because there’ll be a point in 12 months’ time where that player is for sale.",
      "“Even though many may feel 100 million is a lot of money, and something that could get a deal done, Brighton’s data and approach is to think this is a player that might be a Moises Caicedo-type fee, 115 million or more in 12 months’ time.",
      "“That projection of value effectively priced Baleba out of the market and stopped anybody bidding, because Brighton felt no one is going to match the valuation, and therefore the player is simply not for sale.",
      "“So if Manchester United want Carlos Baleba, but they don’t have to worry about Liverpool or anyone else, they have to worry about probably finding 100-plus million, maybe even closer to 115 or 120 million, hoping that Brighton want to sell, which is far more likely in a year’s time.",
      "“If it isn’t Liverpool, there’ll be other suitors for Baleba, and that’s the whole point really. Brighton think that, first of all, in a year’s time there’ll be multiple suitors, so the price goes up. Second of all, form, hopefully, from Brighton’s point of view in the next 12 months, also adds to the valuation.",
      "“With Manchester United and senior midfielders, I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. So could it be Baleba and [Adam] Wharton, or two other senior midfielders? Absolutely. First of all, because Casemiro could still depart, even though he’s found favour under Ruben Amorim. Second of all, because Bruno Fernandes could go off to Saudi Arabia, and that could fund the window in 12 months’ time.”",
      "Asked if Man Utd could bid for Baleba in January, Jacobs quickly quashed the idea.",
      "“I don’t see a January sale for Carlos Baleba, that’s the first thing to say,” he said.",
      "“The start to the season may have been influenced by some of the summer speculation. There’s no doubt his head was turned by Manchester United, but we’re so early in the season, I don’t think we can equate a dip in form with a dip in valuation, or a dip in form with a January exit.",
      "“Brighton have shown with several players that they sell when they want to, based on their own long-term plan, and the only thing that may alter the Baleba situation is the fact that David Weir unexpectedly left, and Jason Ayto, the former Arsenal interim sporting director, has come in. So there’s a new voice and consideration over what they do in the market.",
      "“But remember, January is very much a seller’s market. It’s difficult for buyers in a short space of time, and it’s mid-season, and we know Brighton’s approach is to sell on their terms, their timeline, their price.",
      "“In addition to that, with a replacement coming in — all of which would be hard to do in a January window — it would be a big shock if Baleba went anywhere in January. But I also think it’d be equally as big a shock if Brighton didn’t engage more seriously over a summer sale, because these players, when they join Brighton, know there will be a period in time where they can be sold and move on to another club.",
      "“With Baleba, the feeling is that if you look at the whole season, rather than just these first few games, come the end of the season, Brighton feel his valuation will be even higher than the number that they put over his head privately, but not to Manchester United.”",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Liverpool are making ‘serious moves’ to land a star Manchester United midfield target in the January transfer window, according to insider Indy Kaila.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’."

      "He has been a crucial player under Oliver Glasner, who lost Ebere Eze to Arsenal in the summer transfer window after Eze scored the only goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City.",
      "Glasner kept hold of club captain Marc Guehi after his transfer to Liverpool fell through, while Jean-Philippe Mateta and Wharton also stayed at Selhurst Park.",

      "Asked on The United Stand if Liverpool are interested in signing Man Utd-linked Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, Jacobs dropped the transfer bombshell regarding the Palace and England youngster.",

      "Under Amorim, the Red Devils have gone backwards and hit a new low in 2024/25, finishing 15th in the Premier League in a trophyless season.",
      "This season, Man Utd have already been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town and have suffered defeats in the Premier League against Man City and Arsenal to sit 11th after five games.",

      "Man Utd are said to be in favour of Iraola due to ‘his tactical acumen and ability to maximise limited resources’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘United’s hierarchy view Iraola as an elite coach capable of navigating the intense pressure of managing a global giant. His ability to implement a cohesive system at Bournemouth, coupled with his success in developing young talents, has convinced United bosses of his readiness for a step up.",
      "‘Manchester City are also tracking Iraola as a potential successor to Pep Guardiola, whose departure is speculated to be on the horizon in the coming seasons.

      "“The Manchester United job will still be attractive, whatever their current situation, still a huge club, huge fan base and obviously there has been financial backing in the transfer market as well for managers.",
      "“Iraola has done a remarkable job of Bournemouth, because he lost most of his top players this summer, but still really flourishing at Bournemouth.",
      "“Obviously, Bournemouth are looking to tie him down to a new contract.",
      "“They’re doing everything they can to agree terms and convince him to stay, because they don’t want to lose him, especially to a Premier League rival even if it is Man United.",
      "“But look for United right now, they’re still remaining fully behind Amorim and they hope that he can turn things around.”",

      "Paul Scholes won’t claim to speak for anyone. In the past, he barely spoke for himself and some, including Matt Stead, might recall the former midfielder’s mute period with some fondness. But while Scholes’ latest outburst has not been well received in some quarters, he succinctly summed up the feelings of many Manchester United fans towards another of their former heroes.",
      "Scholes labelled Marcus Rashford a ‘disgrace’ for his conduct, demeanour and perceived levels of effort towards the end of his Old Trafford career. Strong words from Scholes at a time he just so happens to be launching a new podcast.",
      "Maybe it is a cynical soundbite carefully crafted by Scholes to amplify the platform more than the message. However thick he might be laying it on, there will be plenty who watched Rashford ‘walking…not trying’ that broadly agree with his sentiment.",
      "Rashford really ought to have been carried out of Old Trafford shoulder high, if he had to leave at all. The academy graduate was a hometown hero turned national treasure for feeding hungry kids and bothering Tories. For the relationship between Rashford and his boyhood club to turn so sour, there are many with questions to answer.",
      "Steady rightly points the finger at United, a ‘broken club’ with a ‘corroded culture’. He’s right. Rashford’s United is a sh*tshow compared to Scholes’s.",
      "But at some point, individuals have to be held accountable rather than just attributing failure to some mysterious, ruinous post-Fergie curse. Rightly, flak is flung at the boardroom and axes swung at managers. The players? They cop it too, mostly for the crime of not being fit to lace the boots of Scholes, Butt, Keane, Beckham, Neville. Many of today’s squad, promoted above their levels and high above their ceiling, are being damned by comparison.",
      "But what about the ones who do have the talent to follow in those illustrious footsteps? And those who were reared to view The United Way as a concept vastly different to what it currently represents?",
      "Rashford is one of a few who ticked both boxes. It would have pained him to see what the club was becoming but, unlike the fans, he was in a position to lead a change. The extra adoration reserved for academy graduates also comes with the responsibility of maintaining the standards set by those that came before.",
      "Instead, as Scholes put it, Rashford ‘quit on United’. Whether he was exasperated or not, the evidence offers no other conclusion.",
      "Over 18 months, Rashford’s actions and demeanour spoke of a player who steadily gave up on his club. Repeated disciplinary breaches, the barely-arsed body language… the writing was on the wall long before Henry Winter posted it on X.",
      "When Ruben Amorim arrived last November, Rashford was certainly not alone in giving the impression that just going through the motions was too much to ask.",
      "The rotten standards prompted anger from supporters towards many players, most notably Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho. But those faces are quickly forgotten. The disappointment and regret over Rashford inevitably lingers.",
      "No doubt he was held to a higher standard. Hardly unfair when you consider Rashford’s pedigree and his status as one of the club’s highest earners. But in the end, the bare minimum was too much bother, an attitude that prompted some sympathy, some acrimony, but now mostly apathy towards the one-time local hero.",
      "“I really struggle to feel happy for him,” said Scholes, a stance that angered Steady and a few more besides. Including The i’s Pete Hall, who writes that Scholes’ criticism and previous narratives around Rashford amount to ‘bullying’. Knowing Pete, once of these parts, that’s a genuine belief. And given his leaning towards United, it highlights that no view on Rashford is unanimous.",
      "The witch-hunt in the right-wing media which attempted to smear Rashford amid the activism that prompted so much pride among United fans – that was bullying. Calling out his woefully-slipping standards as a footballer, one awarded one of the highest contracts in the history of his club, is not.",
      "So there are plenty of Stretford Enders who would echo Scholes’s sentiment. And that’s a reasonable reaction – human, even – in the circumstances. Only the most bitter would take satisfaction should Rashford flop at Barcelona, but neither should United fans be made to feel as though they ought to be cheering him on at the Nou Camp after he chose the path of disinterest out of Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford’s thunderb*stard at Newcastle in the Champions League last week will have caused many eyes in Manchester to roll. For United fans know better than anyone how Rashford is capable of such moments of brilliance having witnessed plenty for themselves. But those eyes will have rolled all the way back when news emerged of what followed next.",
      "With a brace at St James’ Park to build upon following an otherwise inauspicious start at Barca, Rashford turned up late for duty the following matchday. By two minutes, apparently.",
      "The level of his tardiness does not matter, especially when it is part of a pattern of behaviour. When you have unquestionably fallen upwards to a club as prestigious as Barca, where judgements are still being drawn by a new, hard-to-please manager, team-mates and fans, it is damning that it did not occur to him to be in at 9am, rather than skirting close enough to the 9.30am deadline to miss it.",
      "Damning but no longer surprising. Which goes a long way to explaining why Scholes and many others are returning the indifference that dripped off Rashford as he sloped towards the United exit.",
      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "Spurs are definitely about to sign stars from Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona while keeping Djed Spence and his penitentiary at left-back.",
      "Has the Club World Cup absolutely cocked up Chelsea’s season? It’s starting to feel like that with such a long injury list.",
      "Every Arsenal game currently seems to be wracked with tension, and a trip to Newcastle will be no different on another Big Weekend.",
      "Liverpool will probably manage without their fourth-choice centre-half and there are a fair few reasons why panicking over Eberechi Eze at Arsenal is daft.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’."

      "United only have themselves to blame for the result, their third defeat in a run of four-game winless run at Brentford, that was sealed when Mathias Jensen struck in a superb third goal in stoppage-time. All the momentum of the win over Chelsea had vanished for Amorim.",
      "Brentford were two goals up after 20 minutes thanks to Igor Thaigo's first-half double and, although Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit six minutes later, United never convinced that they believed in a comeback.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League, sharing his best bets and predictions.",
      "Football loves a storyline and sometimes spotting a potential one can lead to some profitable betting decisions. This fixture has it written all over it. I'm looking straight at the Bryan Mbeumo to score price and getting involved at 2/1 with Sky Bet. It's a selection where football's emotion meets football's logic. A case of the ex.",
      "Football fans have seen it before. A player goes back to his old stomping ground, a place where he was adored, nurtured and given the stage - and what happens? He scores. The emotion of the occasion can lift a player. Add in that little extra point to prove, and suddenly you've got the perfect recipe for a goalscorer bet.",
      "Also, Mbeumo knows Brentford inside-out. He knows the weaknesses, the defensive gaps, the way his opposition full-back will defend. And since joining United, Mbeumo has looked the part too - stretching defences, taking on full-backs, and looking dangerous between the lines. He's averaging a healthy 0.39 expected goals per 90 - a clear sign that chances are falling his way therefore his goal return should see an uptick soon enough.",
      "If you're the kind of punter like me who likes clean sheets, defensive discipline and backing under-goal lines - then this game isn't for you. This clash has got goals written all over it.",
      "Past meetings have at times descended into footballing mayhem. The last six meetings have averaged 4.3 goals per game and who can forget last season's fixture at Stamford Bridge where Brighton's offside trap was exposed brutally by Chelsea and shots were flying in from 30 yards in a 4-2 home win.",
      "Brighton remain the most reliable team in the Premier League for goals. Only one of their last 25 games across all competitions has seen less than two goals scored with the per game total goals average at a fiery 3.64 per game. Expect entertainment and the over 3.5 goal line to give you a great run at 6/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "The lazy narrative will tell you that Liverpool have the title wrapped up already. Results say they're flying - unbeaten in five, late winners. But peel back the scoreboard and ask yourself, are this team that convincing?",
      "For me? No.",
      "This team are getting the job done, yes, but there's a lack of control in games that is leading to fine margins deciding the outcomes. That should ring a few alarm bells. Bournemouth caused them problems. Newcastle ran all over them. Burnley almost stifled them. Everton nearly nabbed them.",
      "Palace can punish them. Oliver Glasner has built a no-nonsense team that are almost perfect in terms of organisation without possession. Since they got beat 5-0 at Newcastle they are unbeaten in 17 competitive games, and they've won two trophies in that time. Across those 17 games they have just conceded nine goals and bagged nine clean sheets. That pure structural discipline can lead them to a result here on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "I think this game sets up very well for a Leeds win here at 2/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth are a fantastic team to bet on as their style never changes and clear, trustworthy patterns are emerging in that when teams allow them the ball, they struggle.",
      "In their last 14 matches where they've averaged 56 per cent or more possession, their record is W4 D3 L7. In that sample size they have been beaten by Brentford twice, Leicester and Ipswich. If Bournemouth can't force you into transitions, they become awkwardly one-paced and predictable in the final third.",
      "And this is how Leeds have been trying to play this season. They are full of physicality and built to play very direct and aggressive football with also being very secure at the back where the excellent Ethan Ampadu leads their defensive organisation.",
      "This will be a game where punters will be twitching their fingers instinctively towards the overs with visions of City with Erling Haaland in the form of his life carving through a low block like a hot knife through butter. But if you scratch beneath the surface, there's a compelling case for going the other way. The under 2.5 goals angle looks best bet of the weekend material at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Pep Guardiola just might be building a team that dominates through defensive output - and the rock-solid axis of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol is absolutely pivotal to that. They've started 11 games together domestically since the start of April and City won eight of those games with the only defeat being the FA Cup final. Across those 11 games they only conceded five goals, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "And now if you add Gianluigi Donnarumma and Rodri into that defensive unit, you've got yourself a really domineering and formidable defensive axis, one that could be the backbone of a team that challenges for major honours once again.",
      "Also, of the 50 Premier League games played this season, 25 have fallen under the 2.5 goals line and the overall goals per game average sits at 2.48. That will eventually rise but it's just another bit of evidence to throw in the mix for an unders bet.",
      "Hello, old friend. Nice to see you again. Ange-ball was back and dancing to the tune of some very happy Forest fans in the away end at Real Betis.",
      "Yes, Forest didn't get maximum points but boy were they pulsating for most of that game. Ange Postecoglou has flicked the tactical switch as the new boss and has painted his footballing identity all over these Forest players already which is based around: attack first, ask questions later.",
      "You could see the blueprint Postecoglou built at Celtic and Spurs - overloads in wide areas, full-backs tucking in to build and midfielders darting between lines, something Elliot Anderson absolutely thrived at.",
      "It was fun to watch. And we can declare with confidence that they're going to create chances. Lots of them. And concede lots of chances too.",
      "This new Forest style is going to blow the lid off their goal lines. Forget the side that grinded out 1-0s at home - this is now a team actively embracing risk and one who will become an over 2.5 money-spinner while the prices remain behind the curve. It's Evens here and where Postecoglou is involved, over 2.5 lines simply must be your punting friend.",
      "Vitor Pereira needs to change something. Dating back to last season, Wolves have no win in nine games, taking just one point from the last 27 available. However, he might just have stumbled upon the system that could lead to a change in fortunes. The 4-4-2 he played in the midweek win over Everton made Wolves more compact and - crucially - seemed to help get support into their key striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "This Wolves side might still be winless but playing Spurs, weirdly, brings out their best. They have amassed nine Premier League wins vs Spurs, the club's joint-most against any opponent and have won four of the last five meetings.",
      "Maybe, the old-school 4-4-2 could be the key to spark Wolves into life against their favourite opponent? They could be worth a swing at 4/1 on the draw no bet with Sky Bet.",
      "Sander Berge to be carded at 3/1 with Sky Bet is simply too big for a player who's being thrust into the midfield furnace against one of the most skilled card-drawing teams in the Premier League.",
      "Aston Villa's engine room of Morgan Rogers and John McGinn - with the occasional Ollie Watkins thrown in from further forward - isn't just technically sharp, it's a card magnet's dream. They rotate positions, carry the ball with purpose and are constantly engaging the opposition.",
      "In Villa's last 14 Premier League games an opposition centre-midfielder has been carded in 12 of those matches with 16 carded in total. Fulham have history of cards in this fixture too, having been shown 20 yellows in the past five meetings, with Berge one of those players cautioned last time.",
      "This is the last fixture Mikel Arteta needs right now.",
      "A trip that's rapidly becoming one of the most emotionally charged and physically demanding fixtures in the Premier League calendar and one where Arsenal have history of succumbing to the atmosphere.",
      "Arsenal are favourites with the markets here at Evens with Sky Bet. But should they be? I'm not having it. Not when Newcastle are in this kind of mood at home as the underdog.",
      "There's something about Newcastle that rattles Arteta's Arsenal. The Gunners have lost four of their last five games in all competitions at St James' Park, including both visits last season. They have failed to score in all four defeats.",
      "Arteta teams love rhythm and structure and the Newcastle midfield don't give you that. They break your passing lanes, slow down your build-up and make it a scrap. They don't just play the occasion, they use it as a weapon. And in front of the Geordie faithful, Newcastle look a savvy bet on the draw no bet market at 6/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Since swapping the somewhat clockwork football of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City for the freedom given to him at Everton, Jack Grealish looks like Jack Grealish again.",
      "His take-ons per 90 has rocketed from 3.7 per game at City from the past two seasons to 9.1 per 90 in the Everton blue. Grealish's time at City wasn't wasted of course, he won trophies, created history and matured. But he wasn't the maverick that made him box office.",
      "Well, the maverick inside is being unleashed by David Moyes and Grealish is the most creative player in the Premier League as a result. Grealish has four assists, creating 2.9 chances per 90 from open play - no player to have played 200 minutes or more has a higher per-90 figure from that metric. He is 11/4 with Sky Bet to bag another assist in what should be a routine home win.",
      "This prediction was made before Graham Potter's sacking.",

      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",

      "\"We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 13:08, UK",
      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",
      "Glasner is such a smart cookie.Lewis Jones",

      "Match report and free match highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro's first-half goals were enough to see Man Utd past Chelsea; Casemiro's second yellow levelled the playing field after early sending off for Robert Sanchez and set up nervy ending after Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",
