      "Sir Alex Ferguson has suggested it could be another decade before Manchester United win the Premier League again. The legendary former Red Devils boss has, however, praised current United manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "United have struggled since the Scotsman retired in 2013, with their last Premier League title coming under him in 2012/13. The Old Trafford club have had six permanent managers since Ferguson - winning five major trophies in that time.",
      "None of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Erik ten Hag where able to deliver the sustained success many demand at M16. United finished 15th last term, their lowest finish in the Premier League era, and missed out on Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "And Ferguson, who won 38 major trophies at the Red Devils, has offered a brutal warning to his former club. The 83-year-old has praised Amorim, but believes the club's 12-year wait for a league title could extend into the next decade.",
      "Speaking via Press Box PR, he said: \"He [Amorim] is a good personality. It is not easy.",
      "\"I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee’s knees. They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",
      "\"We are now in the same situation. It could be ten years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle.",
      "\"It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\"",

      "Few would look at Ruben Amorim's situation at Manchester United and think: 'This is a calm situation'. However, Bryan Mbeumo may find himself doing just that after linking up with his Cameroon colleagues.",
      "Just as the summer signing found his feet at Old Trafford, he is departing the red side of Manchester to compete in Morocco for Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). But the situation at the Indomitable Lions has grown chaotic as he has been called up to the national team by two different managers.",
      "His former United colleague and international captain Andre Onana has also been called up for one Cameroon team and not the other. Marc Brys, the former manager of the country who was sacked by Cameroonian FA president Samuel Eto'o, is insisting he is still in post, despite David Pagou being appointed at the start of the month.",
      "Ahead of the start of the competition, which begins on December 21, two different Cameroon AFCON squad lists have emerged. Fortunately for Mbeumo, as one of his country's star players, he has appeared on both.",
      "The same cannot be said of Onana, who left United and was sent on loan to Trabzonspor after a poor start to this campaign. Brys was sacked by the Cameroon FA shortly after Eto'o, the iconic former Barcelona and Inter Milan ace, was re-elected as Cameroonian FA president after receiving 97% of the votes.",
      "He and Brys had a fractious relationship, which stemmed from the Cameroonian sports ministry taking the decision to appoint him as manager instead of Eto'o. When Eto'o was re-elected, he took his majority as a mandate to dismiss the Belgian.",
      "According to ESPN, a fierce meeting between Eto'o and his committee ended with them alleging Brys had committed \"11 infractions\" ranging from \"disrespectful\" and \"biased\" remarks, \"professional misconduct\" and \"manipulation\" of players, where they specifically accuse him of trying to turn them against the country's FA.",
      "Despite this, Brys insists he has not received any formal communication from the Cameroonian FA regarding his dismissal, even though Pagou is in situ. He has been working, business as usual, except this situation could not be more unusual.",
      "He submitted his own squad list for the competition, featuring Onana as well as other experienced Cameroon stars Vincent Aboubakar, Eric Choupo-Moting and Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui. On the same day, Pagou issued his own squad for the tournament, without the aforementioned quartet.",
      "Last week, confusion reined as to whether the excluded Onana, Aboubakar, Choupo-Moting and Ngadeu-Ngadjui would actually be involved in north Africa. A Cameroonian official has made it clear in the same source any player who is on Brys' list, but not on Pagou's, will not be involved.",
      "The former Cameroon manager, despite asserting that he is still the current boss, has been left furious by this situation. He specifically lashed out at Eto'o, claiming the experienced quartet have been excluded because they challenged the ex-Chelsea forward's authority.",
      "He told Afrik Foot: \"Eto'o has left out important players, and leaders, because he's obviously the one who made this list. How can you go to such a tournament without a world-class goalkeeper, or without Aboubakar? Because these are players with character, who stand up to the president.\"",
      "Cameroon's tournament kicks off with a Christmas Eve clash against Gabon, before facing Ivory Coast on December 28 and Mozambique on New Years Eve.",

      "Manchester United have been tipped to revive their interest in Ruben Neves in January. The Red Devils were linked with the Portugal international before he left Wolves for Al Hilal in 2023, and those connections have now resurfaced.",
      "Neves, 28, captained Wolves to promotion to the Premier League in 2018 and played more than 250 times for the Molineux club in six years. He became one of the Saudi Pro League's big statement signings, though, following compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo in moving to the Gulf.",
      "Al Hilal paid a reported £47million for the midfielder, who is believed to be one of the higher earners in Saudi football. His contract is expiring this summer, though, potentially paving the way for a cut-price January exit.",
      "According to The Mail, Al Hilal are prepared to accept around £20m for Neves, who is said to have no plans to extend his contract. That could make him a more realistic prospect than some of the other midfield targets on United's radar.",
      "Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are both high on the Red Devils' list, but neither is unlikely to be available for less than £100m in January. If Ruben Amorim decides new blood is required in the middle of the park, Neves could tick a lot of boxes.",
      "Neves helped Al Hilal win the Saudi Pro League title in his first season, with the Riyadh club going the whole season unbeaten. They only finished second last term, though, replacing manager Jorge Jesus with former Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi at the end of the campaign.",
      "They are unbeaten after nine games of Inzaghi's first season at the helm, though they're four points adrift of league leaders Al Nassr. Neves has scored four goals - two of those in his last two games - as well as one in a King's Cup quarter-final victory over Al Fateh.",
      "United's links with Neves come at a time when Bruno Fernandes has once again been linked with a move in the opposite direction. Al Hilal failed with a summer move for the Old Trafford captain, who opened the door to a future move in a November interview which has come to light this month.",
      "\"I can’t complain, I’m very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge,\" former Sporting CP star Fernandes told Canal 11 (via Maisfutebol and translated by Sport Witness).. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I’ll play in Saudi Arabia,”",
      "“My lifestyle will change, my children’s lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I’ll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players.\"",
      "He said he decided to stay after conversations with manager Amorim but was \"hurt\" by the club's position on a potential exit. \"“I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club,\" he added.",
      "\"The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Aston Villa head into Sunday’s clash with Manchester United on the back of nine consecutive wins in all competitions. Unai Emery’s side have lost just two of their last 12 matches in league and cup, and six of their last seven games have featured both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals. The hosts have netted at least twice in seven of their last eight outings, but have only managed one clean sheet in their previous seven matches.",
      "However, Villa’s recent record against Manchester United is less impressive, with just two wins from the last 10 meetings between the sides in all competitions. United have lost only once in their last four visits to Villa Park, earning two draws and a win in that span. Five of the last eight encounters between these teams have seen both sides score and over 2.5 goals.",
      "In the Premier League, Manchester United have suffered just one defeat in their last 10 games, though four of those have ended in draws. Seven of United’s last 10 league matches have produced both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals, and they’ve scored at least twice in eight of those fixtures. With both teams in strong attacking form, another high-scoring encounter is expected at Villa Park this weekend.",
      "Unai Emery faces a headache with Emi Martinez (back) and Pau Torres (calf) facing late fitness tests ahead of the match at Villa Park. Jadon Sancho is not available as he is not allowed to face his parent club as per loan rules while Tyrone Mings (thigh) and Ross Barkley (knee) continue to serve long layoffs.",
      "Not much has changed in terms of the injury front with Harry Maguire (thigh) and Matthijs de Ligt (back) hope to end their setbacks later this month. However, the Red Devils will need to make adjustments over the festive period with Bryan Mbuemo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui all on AFCON duty with their respective nations.",

      "Manchester United are entering a very tricky portion of their campaign after three players departed for the Africa Cup of Nations. As such, the club could do with as few distractions as possible, but not everyone close to the squad has complied.",
      "In fact, United icon Roy Keane has described his disdain following a recent development in the Kobbie Mainoo storyline. That's after the midfielder's half-sibling was spotted wearing a divisive piece of clothing during the latest Premier League fixture.",
      "Amid the furore concerning Mainoo's playing time (or lack thereof), the midfielder has remained largely silent on the matter. The same can't be said for half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames, however, after he watched Monday's 4-4 draw against Bournemouth while wearing a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt.",
      "Mainoo came off the bench for the final half hour in what was a topsy-turvy encounter, during which the lead changed hands three times. Almost halfway through the Premier League campaign, Mainoo is still waiting on his first start of the season.",
      "The stunt might have gone under the radar had Mainoo-Hames, a former Love Island contestant, not made the decision to pose in front of the Old Trafford turf and posted the image on Instagram. Word of the incident eventually got back to club legend Keane, who addressed it on the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "The Irishman asked: \"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months? He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer. He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie [Carragher] made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'He has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane was open to the prospect of Mainoo going out on loan but challenged the prospect to prove Amorim wrong at Old Trafford instead. Amorim, meanwhile, has said he's be open to sitting down for a discussion with the player if approached.",
      "Many a United fan, and likely Amorim himself, is wondering just how the club will fare during the absence of their AFCON stars. And there's little doubt Mbeumo will be the biggest presence missing from their right flank.",
      "However, it's perhaps Mbeumo himself who should feel concern after a supercomputer tipped his Cameroon side for an early departure. The model, which was devised by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com, forecast the Indomitable Lions will fail to get out of Group F after facing the Ivory Coast, Gabon and Mozambique.",
      "Mbeumo's absence would therefore be relatively short, and he may even be back for the fixture against Leeds on January 4 as a result. Former United defender Paul Parker recently put into words the effect Mbeumo's absence will have on the team, with no other player at Amorim's disposal able to fulfil the same duties.",
      "\"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON,\" said two-time Premier League champion Parker. \"They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.\"",

The Red Devils face some lofty competition for the Cherries star, who has a release clause of £65million that activates in January.",
      "Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool are all interested in agreeing a deal for the Ghana international. Ruben Amorim met Semenyo in London at the end of last season, but United were put off by Bournemouth’s £80m plus asking price.",
      "The Portuguese coach called Semenyo a 'special player' before United's match with Bournemouth on Monday. The charm offensive may prove more convincing if City cannot provide assurances over Guardiola, and United will look to take advantage, according to the Telegraph.",

      "McTominay had been part of the United set-up since the age of five, progressing through the academy system before making his first-team debut in 2017. Under different managers, he developed a knack for scoring goals, but the versatile midfielder was deployed in various positions and never became a guaranteed starter.",

      "\"I don't think every player has that set balance or is not given the grace of playing badly. I think that comes when you're a homegrown talent, though.",

      "Ex-Liverpool skipper Graeme Souness also believes that McTominay may have been let go too soon, arguing that if he had stayed, he would currently be United's top midfielder.",
      "\"They've spent a lot of money on [Manuel] Ugarte and Casemiro. I got much criticised for saying I thought he was an ordinary Joe when they signed him. I still see him as an ordinary Joe, a very steady player,\" Souness told the Daily Mail.",
      "\"They sold the best one: Scott McTominay. He was better than those two and he's just grown in his job since he's been at Napoli. I understand why you would use Bruno as a six, but then you want to use him as a 10 as well.",
      "\"I still don't like him waving his arms and telling other people what to do all the time. Slightly frustrating. I couldn't have played with him if he was like that.\"",

      "Ian Wright has claimed that Arsenal would sign Bruno Fernandes ‘tomorrow’ after calling out Manchester United chiefs. The Portuguese playmaker has put his future at Old Trafford in major doubt by claiming that the Red Devils wanted him to leave in the summer.",
      "United have however insisted that Fernandes remained key to their plans and they did not want to sell him. The Portuguese midfielder has now fired an ultimatum at his bosses, saying that he will only stay with the club so long as he is wanted.",
      "As the row continues, Arsenal icon Ian Wright has shared his thoughts and claimed the Gunners would snap Fernandes up should he leave United.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Wright said: “When you look at Bruno’s quotes, it comes back to Man United being indecisive. So someone comes in for Bruno Fernandes last summer… you shut that down.",
      "“He didn’t want to go. Bruno is basically saying the club went, ‘it’s up to you if you want to leave’. That’s not what you want to hear when you’re the person who has basically held the club up by yourself.",
      "“You want the club to say, ‘you’re not going nowhere, you’re a massive part of this’. But Manchester United didn’t do that.",
      "“They gave him the option and said, 'if you want to go, you can go'. What is that saying to him? I would take him tomorrow.”",
      "Wright’s comments come after Fernandes broke rank to share his stance on an exit from Old Trafford. Speaking while on international duty earlier this year, he said: “I could have left like many people do and said: ‘I want to leave, I don’t want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side.’ But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same.",
      "“But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything. The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision.",
      "“I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don’t value the club as much and don’t defend the club as much… that makes you sad.”",

      "Bruno Fernandes has said that his time at Manchester United hasn't run as planned, and that he had opportunities elsewhere when the club struggled the most. The Portuguese midfielder joined the Red Devils in a £47million deal with Sporting CP in January 2020.",
      "And while the 31-year-old will have held aspirations of reliving the trophy-laden glory that the club held under Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary tenure, things haven't quite played out that way under the tutelage of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag and now Ruben Amorim.",
      "In five years, Fernandes has just an FA Cup and a League Cup to show for his efforts in the heart of United's engine room, while the club's Premier League performances have also faded since his arrival. Last season saw United register their poorest-ever Premier League finish since the league's inception of 1992, as Amorim's debut saw the Red Devils finish in a lacklustre 15th.",
      "The club also missed out on winning the Europa League title in May, courtesy of a bitter 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. And now, appearing on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Fernandes has reflected on his time at Old Trafford.",
      "When asked about his love of the club by Ferdinand, the United captain said: \"Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lift as many as I should and I could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club in a certain way was still very important and not taking nothing away from other players that were here and everything. I think when we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I think everyone at the club, I hope, is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"So I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet.",
      "\"So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies. It changed a lot because if I look at the past, [Francesco] Totti is known as one of the best players in Italy and unfortunately for him he hasn't won many trophies.\"",
      "Fernandes spoke to Ferdinand earlier this month, ahead of a damning recent interview emerging which saw him claim that the United board wanted him away from the club in the summer. Saudi giants Al-Hilal were ready to offer United £100m to sign Fernandes, but the attacking midfielder instead opted to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "The club were also reportedly willing to pay Fernandes £700,000-a-week, which would have seen him rake in around £100m over the course of a three-year contract. And now, the playmaker has suggested that while Amorim wanted him to stay, the United hierarchy were keen to cash in.",
      "He told Canal 11: \"I can’t complain, I’m very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I’ll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children’s lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I’ll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players. I could have left like many people do and said, ‘I want to leave, I don’t want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side.’",
      "\"But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same. But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything.",

      "Roy Keane has urged Kobbie Mainoo to fight for his place in the Manchester United squad rather than seeking a move away. The United legend also tore in the midfielder's brother, labelling him an 'idiot' for wearing a 'free Mainoo' shirt at Old Trafford.",
      "Questions over Mainoo's future at United have persisted since the summer, with speculation only ramping up amid a lack of minutes under boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The England international requested a loan move towards the end of the transfer window, but the club refused to let him go. Mainoo has featured in just 11 Premier League matches under Amorim this season, every single one as a substitute.",
      "His sole start this campaign came in the EFL Cup loss to League Two outfit Grimsby Town back in August. Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, caused a stir by sporting a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the dramatic 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth.",
      "Mainoo entered the fray with less than half an hour remaining, marking his third-longest appearance in the league this term, in a pulsating encounter at Old Trafford. Mainoo-Hames shared the photo on his Instagram account, prompting fresh questions about the midfielder's future and mindset.",
      "\"He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane went on to discuss Mainoo's prospects at United: \"What's football about? The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong. There was chat about Bruno [Fernandes] leaving the summer, he might leave next summer. Bide your time.",
      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\".",
      "Despite all the speculation surrounding Mainoo, Amorim has declined to confirm whether a loan move would be approved. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

      "Following closely behind are challengers Manchester City and Aston Villa, who at worst will be hopeful of securing Champions League qualification via the top-four. Also in the running for European football look to be Chelsea, Manchester United, reigning champions Liverpool - who have been off the pace, and Sunderland.",
      "At the opposite end of the table, Wolves and West Ham have endured tough starts to the new campaign, and could become the first existing Premier League clubs in three seasons to drop down. Also in the scrap are Burnley, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest.",
      "So, how will the final Premier League standings turn out? The answer will not be certain until next May, but Opta's latest results give a hint as to how matters may play out...",
      "A genuine \"nightmare\" season. They are currently winless (0–2–14) and rooted to the bottom. New manager Rob Edwards faces a monumental task to overturn a -26 goal difference.",
      "Like many newly-promoted sides in recent seasons, Scott Parker’s side have found the jump in quality difficult, managing only three wins so far as they struggle to keep clean sheets.",
      "A disastrous season so far. Graham Potter was sacked in September, and Nuno Espirito Santo is currently struggling to pull the Hammers out of the relegation zone.",
      "Another newly-promoted side who is fighting hard, using an imposing physical style to stay just outside the bottom three, or so the prediction says will happen...",
      "A chaotic start saw Nuno Espirito Santo sacked, his successor Ange Postecoglou also got the boot after just weeks in charge, and now Sean Dyche has been brought in to do what he does best: grind out the results needed to stay up.",
      "Under Marco Silva, Fulham have continued to be the \"entertainers\" of the mid-table. They have been involved in some of the season's most chaotic matches, including a 4–5 loss to Manchester City earlier this month.",
      "It has been a season of significant transition for the Bees. After seven years, legendary manager Thomas Frank departed for Tottenham in June and was replaced by former assistant Keith Andrews, but the club has kept on fighting despite pre-season chatter of relegation.",
      "Despite selling key defenders Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, Andoni Iraola has kept the Cherries competitive with a high-pressing system that recently claimed a major scalp against Spurs.",
      "The surprise package of the season. Returning to the top flight after eight years, the Black Cats have been remarkably resilient, specializing in late drama with a league-high five goals scored in stoppage time.",
      "It’s been a bumpy road for Thomas Frank in his first season at Spurs. After replacing Ange Postecoglou, Frank has struggled to balance Europa League demands with domestic form, leaving Spurs in an uncharacteristic 11th place.",
      "Under the guidance of David Moyes, the Toffees have moved away from relegation scraps and into a comfortable top-half position, though they struggle for consistency against the elite.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler’s side remains tactically brave and entertaining, though they've dropped points in games they dominated.",
      "Limited summer spending has led to a sense of 'staleness'. They remain tough to beat at St. James' Park but have regressed significantly from the form that helped achieve Champions League qualification last season.",
      "Now under Ruben Amorim, United are showing signs of life after a \"historically bad\" 2024/25. While their defense is still leaky (26 conceded), their attack is much more fluid with Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount finding rhythm.",
      "Following their FA Cup win last season, Palace have maintained incredible momentum. Despite a tough schedule, Oliver Glasner has them playing high-intensity football that has them sitting above several giants.",
      "Under Enzo Maresca, Chelsea have finally stabilized. They’ve adopted a possession-heavy style and found a spark in Joao Pedro. But, it might be just too little to reach the Champions League next season...",
      "It has been a difficult second season for Arne Slot. After a brilliant title-winning campaign last year, the defending champions have struggled with mega-money signings Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz bedding in, plus injuries. A recent dip that saw them lose five out of six games in late autumn.",
      "Unai Emery has transformed Villa from \"best of the rest\" into genuine title threats. After failing to win in their first five matches, they've turned things around and sit just three points off the top, proving their staying power.",
      "Despite a rocky start that saw Pep Guardiola endure his worst-ever opening month, City have surged back. Erling Haaland remains inevitable with 17 Premier League goals already, though the team has looked more defensively vulnerable than in previous years (e.g., that wild 5–4 win over Fulham).",
      "The current leaders have been the model of consistency. Mikel Arteta’s side boasts the league's best defence (only 10 goals conceded) and an 11-game unbeaten run earlier this term. With new signings Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke helping to add the clinical edge they lacked last season, they look like the team to beat."

      "Manchester United are bracing for the absence of three key players in the coming weeks as Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui all head off to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations. The tournament, staged by Morocco, begins on Sunday with the hosts facing Comoros.",
      "The final is scheduled to take place in Rabat on Sunday, January 18 and United supporters will be keen to know when their trio could return. According to a new Afcon Supercomputer prediction, Morocco are favourites to secure their first Afcon title since 1976.",
      "The prediction, made by Afcon betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com, suggests that the host nation will edge out Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. If this comes to pass, United full-back Mazraoui won't be available for manager Ruben Amorim until the away match against Arsenal on January 25.",
      "In contrast, Mbeumo's Cameroon are predicted to make an early exit at the group stages, which could see him return for United's away game at Leeds on January 4. While such an outcome would not go down well with Cameroon and Mbeumo, it certainly would for United, who would have one of their leading players back available before long.",
      "The supercomputer also forecasts that Senegal will eliminate Amad's Ivory Coast in the semi-finals with a convincing 3-0 win. However, he would still miss the Manchester derby on January 17 as it coincides with the third-place playoff - a match the Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",
      "Therefore, the prediction suggests that Amad is likely to rejoin the squad around the same time as Mazraoui, potentially in time for the late January clash with Arsenal. In what could prove to be the tournament's most shocking result, Egypt and their talisman Mohamed Salah are tipped to suffer a 1-0 defeat to Comoros in the round of 16.",
      "South Africa and Algeria, both having secured their spots at next year's World Cup, are anticipated to progress to the quarter-finals, whilst Tunisia, another World Cup qualifier, are forecast to bow out before the knockout phases. Amorim faces the challenge of finding answers with Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui sidelined for the coming period, and former United defender Paul Parker reckons it will prove an enormously tough assignment.",
      "He said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo’s celebrity brother took a swipe at Ruben Amorim by wearing a provocative T-shirt at Manchester United’s Premier League clash against Bournemouth – and it’s not the first time the midfielder’s famous sibling has caused a stir at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo has fallen out of favour with boss Amorim as rumours swirl of a potential January exit. The England international has been left out of the starting line-up for all of United’s 16 league matches so far this season, with his only start coming in the Red Devils’ embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby.",
      "The future had looked bright for the 20-year-old after a breakthrough 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, where he scored the winning goal in the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester City and became a key cog in the England side that reached the Euros final.",
      "But things have turned sour for the Stockport-born academy graduate since Amorim arrived at Old Trafford, with United legend Paul Scholes among those urging Mainoo to leave his boyhood club in search of game time. According to reports, Mainoo was keen to join Napoli in the summer but had a transfer request turned down.",
      "The youngster received a rapturous reception from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he replaced Casemiro just past the hour mark during United’s absorbing 4-4 thriller with Bournemouth, but attention post-match quickly turned to an inflammatory statement made by his brother pitchside.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was pictured front row wearing a black T-shirt emblazoned with \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\" in a move that risks aggravating a delicate situation already fraught with tension. The stunt has split United’s fanbase, with some supporters accusing Mainoo’s relative of unnecessary provocation, but others viewing the statement as a justified protest.",
      "Mainoo’s older sibling may well be familiar to many – the fashion model and influencer appeared on the 2019 series of hit reality TV show Love Island and has since amassed over 680,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "He will also be a name known to those inside Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo revealed that his brother’s stint in the Love Island villa had earned him an unflattering nickname.",
      "He said: “My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me ‘Love Island’. He’s been doing so since I was like 16.”",

      "Manchester United could be set for a busy January transfer window, not only in terms of potential incomings but also possible outgoings - with Kobbie Mainoo the star attraction.",
      "The Red Devils enjoyed a productive summer window with several key additions, including the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. However, the work is far from complete, with a number of areas across the pitch still in need of reinforcement.",
      "One way to make room in both the squad and the budget for further arrivals is to offload players. A handful of names have been linked with potential exits in recent times, none more so than midfielder Mainoo.",
      "The England international had been tipped to depart in the summer, with Serie A champions Napoli rumoured to be among the suitors. However, a move never came to fruition and the academy graduate was made to stay put.",
      "Unfortunately for Mainoo, his game time under Ruben Amorim has not improved this season. The 20-year-old has featured 12 times across all competitions this term, but has not started a single Premier League fixture.",
      "Amorim raised some eyebrows over the past week with his comments about United's young, up-and-coming players and his reluctance to use them. Mainoo was not the only name discussed, with 18-year-old Harry Amass, currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, also singled out.",
      "\"It’s the situation, what’s happened,\" the United boss said prior to Monday night's meeting with Bournemouth. \"I don’t know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let’s see after this match.",
      "\"[Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido [Obi] is not always a starter in under 21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\"",
      "As the January window approaches, both Mainoo and Amass are among the United starlets attracting plenty of attention. There are claims that as many as 12 clubs are in the race for the midfielder's signature.",
      "The article notes that Mainoo is prioritising a move that would see him become a regular starter elsewhere. While Chelsea and Bayern Munich are said to be leading the chase, their already stacked midfield options mean Napoli reportedly remains the player's preferred destination at this stage.",
      "Like Mainoo, Amass also has a dozen clubs interested in signing him next month. He is currently on loan at Wednesday and is already featuring regularly, with 16 starts to his name.",
      "If a move is on the cards in January, with Wednesday struggling towards the bottom of the Championship, the Daily Mail say around 12 teams have made contact regarding the player's availability. Promotion chasers Millwall and Stoke City are rumoured to be among them.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Mainoo burst onto the scene at Old Trafford, scoring an FA Cup-winning goal and becoming a fixture in England's midfield at Euro 2024. However, since Erik ten Hag's departure, Mainoo has found it difficult to fit into new boss Amorim's team.",
      "With Bruno Fernandes filling the midfield role that Mainoo is perhaps best suited to, he has been relegated to substitute appearances and requested a loan this summer. Rumours continue to swirl about his potential departure from the club.",
      "Lescott, who coached him for the Three Lions, believes that he should be allowed to play elsewhere as he has a future at the club, unlike manager Amorim. \"I've worked with Kobbie. He's a very mature and impressive person,\" said Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"But if I'm the club, I'm saying, 'We're giving you a new deal and go and play.' Go somewhere else and play because the future is Kobbie Mainoo. It's not Amorim, is it?",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "\"You'd like to think he's going to be at Man United longer than the manager. So the club should step in and dictate how this plays out rather than just let the manager create a scenario where Kobbie is like, 'I'm not signing, I don't want to sign, I don't want to be here.'",
      "\"Because then you've lost the player of that ilk. I do really think that if the club steps in and controls this situation then it can still be manageable.",
      "\"You have the manager that might not be there in a year's time and then you've lost an asset. I'm not saying Amorim has to play him, but he's coming to the end of his contract. So in like 18 months' time or 12 months' time he's free.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted to sign three of world football's megastars when he was in charge of Manchester United, when they were still available for bargain prices. The Norwegian coach was keen to land Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice before they had fully made their names.",
      "Solskjaer urged United's hierarchy to move quickly, according to The Mail. It was not to be for the Red Devils as they instead spent £39million for Donny van de Beek in 2020, and £73m for Jadon Sancho and £13m for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021.",
      "Initially taking over as interim boss, Solskjaer was in charge of United from 2018 until 2021. At that time, Haaland was racking up goals at Red Bull Salzburg, Bellingham was breaking out at Birmingham City and Rice cemented himself as a key player at West Ham.",
      "Solskjaer saw Haaland and Bellingham both join Borussia Dortmund in 2020 and have since joined Manchester City and Real Madrid, respectively.",
      "United's signings failed to pan out. Van de Beek could not break into the Red Devils' side and spent time on loan before making his exit, while Jadon Sancho is currently on loan at Aston Villa, having been cast aside by Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, saw his contract ended early via mutual consent. The Portuguese icon failed to gel with Ten Hag, and they quickly parted ways.",
      "Solskjaer has previously spoken about how he encouraged United to sign Haaland in the summer of 2018, months before he replaced Jose Mourinho as boss. The former forward repeated the advice when in the dugout as Haaland had a release clause and little competition present for his signature.",
      "Speaking to the Stick To Football podcast, Solskjaer said: \"Erling was with me at Molde for two seasons, more or less. The summer before I came, I rang the club and said: 'You have to sign this boy, he is going to be absolutely top class.' That was in June or July and they said they didn't have enough reports.",
      "\"By the time I came in as caretaker, we [Molde] had sold him to Salzburg. I tell the club straight away: 'Buy him.' He had a release clause. No-one else then would have paid that money. It was 20m euros and it would have been a bargain. It was the club's decision to not go for him then.",
      "\"We didn't go for him until he started scoring for Salzburg but then Dortmund, Juventus, everyone was there.\"",
      "Solskjaer did manage to at least have a conversation with Bellingham, but the England star's demands were more easily met elsewhere. \"We had Jude in the building,\" said Solskjaer.",
      "\"We sold the club to him as best we could but he wanted X amount of minutes. He is the most mature 17-year-old I ever met in my life.\"",

      "Manchester United target Carlos Baleba has responded following a dip in form since being linked with a move to Old Trafford. The Brighton midfielder was touted as a £100million contender to join Ruben Amorim's ranks before a late transfer attempt collapsed in the summer.",
      "Baleba has been called up by Cameroon ahead of this year's Africa Cup of Nations, where he'll team up with United ace Bryan Mbeumo. And the 21-year-old has fronted up ahead of United potentially reviving their interest in his services next year.",
      "United fans thought they were onto a transformative transfer when it emerged late in the summer that the club was looking into Baleba. The Seagulls star was coming off the back of a breakout campaign on the south coast and ticked almost every box in terms of what the club requires in midfield.",
      "However, the Red Devils were priced out of a move after Brighton revealed his £100m price-tag. And some have speculated the distraction of United's interest has had a hand in his reduced output this season.",
      "Baleba, 21, has played a full 90 minutes just once in the Premier League this term after looking all but indispensable under Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngster pushed back on the notion United's enquiry has had anything to do with his form this season, though he acknowledged things aren't the same as they once were.",
      "\"I don’t think it affected me. But I had a lot of pressure on me,\" he said during an interview ahead of his AFCON involvement. \"When I started the season, I wanted to [have] the same performances as last season.",
      "\"Every day I try to work hard and to get [back] to my level. Did I put too much pressure on myself? Yes, I think so, but I think that’s good.\"",
      "Despite cultivating an iconic reputation at Old Trafford during his first stint, Ronaldo's return in 2021 was met with mixed response. Some loyalists were ecstatic about the reunion that had long been promised, even if he was 36 years old at the time and way past his prime, while others didn't see value in the investment.",
      "As it turned out, the latter camp was correct. Ronaldo scored 24 goals in his first season back at the Theatre of Dreams having left Juventus, but he eventually left for Al-Nassr in December 2022 amid reports he became a disruptive presence in the dressing room.",
      "And the Daily Mail has now revealed Ronaldo's agent, Jorge Mendes, orchestrated the move by stretching certain details. Namely, he led United to believe Ronaldo \"had the pen in his hand\" ready to join rivals Manchester City, and that was enough to urge the Red Devils into action.",
      "A source with knowledge of the deal was quoted, saying: \"It created a panic. The idea of him scoring for City against United was too much for them. They were frightened to death about how the fans would react when the reality was that signing him would go against everything that Ole was trying to do.\"",
      "It's perhaps no coincidence United had four different coaches during Ronaldo's second stint at the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge when the deal was completed, while Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick held caretaker roles before Erik ten Hag's appointment in 2022.",
      "Despite his prolific return initially back in England, Ronaldo's move back ended up costing United roughly £1.2m per goal he scored. And it was all down to the machinations of a certain super agent behind the scenes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim laid down the law to Manuel Ugarte last month when he told the Manchester United midfielder he had to improve in training to force his way back into his plans. A return of 13 minutes in five Premier League games since then would suggest the message hasn’t been taken on board.",
      "Ugarte hasn’t even made it off the bench in four of those five games and it feels like his Old Trafford career is teetering on the brink amid plans for a major midfield rebuild. Perhaps this weekend will offer the Uruguayan a chance to resuscitate it. It could well be the final chance. With Casemiro suspended after collecting a fifth booking of the season, Ugarte seems like the only possible replacement in that holding midfield role.",
      "If he is overlooked for Kobbie Mainoo, another player Amorim clearly has doubts about, it will surely spell the end for Ugarte. If he plays and doesn’t deliver, it could be just as damning. Last month, Amorim stressed that he wanted to help his former Sporting charge out of his funk, but what has happened since suggests that it hasn’t been achieved.",
      "“You can sense a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle,\" he said. \"He is struggling at the moment but it is our job to try to help and help him to feel like I felt when he was a Sporting player. But it is a different world. He needs to adapt, and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "It was the second time Amorim had been brutal about Ugarte, telling him after the Europa League final that he wasn’t the same player that the head coach encountered in Lisbon. Their shared history together should have been a significant advantage to Ugarte. He knew Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system, he had a head start when it came to the demands of the Portuguese and what he wanted from players in Ugarte’s position. But he hasn’t put it to good use.",
      "Ugarte left Sporting to join Paris Saint-Germain and managed a year in Ligue 1 before United spent £50.5m on him. His confidence looks to have been rocked by a tricky year in Paris and the chaos of Old Trafford.",
      "He wasn’t Erik ten Hag’s first choice for that position in the summer of 2024 and had a sluggish start to his time at the club. Amorim’s arrival led to a brief renaissance but there has been very little evidence across 18 months that Ugarte is going to cut the mustard.",
      "An exit in January might be unlikely, especially if Mainoo leaves on loan, but a summer transfer is a possibility, especially if Ugarte doesn’t find the improvement required.",
      "The future of every United midfielder is up in the air at the moment, for one reason or another. For Ugarte, the reason is his own performances, and what happens next is largely in his hands. He can take a step forward at Villa Park on Sunday, but if he doesn’t it could push him closer to the exit door.",

      "Mainoo's opportunities have been limited this season but, with no Casemiro on Sunday, the midfielder will hope for his chance in the starting XI. Amorim's team selection for the trip to Villa will be discussed today now Amad and Bryan Mbeumo have joined Noussair Mazraoui in leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations.",

      "Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson believes it could be at least 10 years before the Reds are battling for the Premier League title and insists he has sympathy for Ruben Amorim. Since the Portuguese head coach took over in November 2024, it has been difficult for United.",
      "Amorim chose to sacrifice the Premier League last season to concentrate on the most likely route to the Champions League through the Europa League. However, this plan backfired as United lost to Tottenham in an underwhelming final. The Reds would go on to finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "Since then, United have shown signs of improvement with the attack looking stronger and the Reds currently sitting sixth. However, there are still concerns about Amorim's tactics, with many criticising his reluctance to deviate from a three-at-the-back system, albeit this stance has softened recently due to absentees.",
      "Speaking to Press Box PR, Ferguson believes United are still on a long journey to the force they once were under him. He said: \"He [Amorim] is a good personality. It is not easy. I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee's knees.",
      "\"They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again. We are now in the same situation. It could be ten years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle.",
      "\"It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\" While Ferguson is pessimistic about United going for the title any time soon, he did provide some comfort for supporters.",
      "\"I think the appointment of the goalkeeper [Senne Lammens] has made a difference,\" he added. \"He's young at 23, he’s quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps. I think they have needed that player.",
      "\"United have always had inspirational players over the years. I think that has helped. The other two, [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Matheus] Cunha, they look as if they will contribute to the recovery of our form.\"",
      "The Reds will be without the services of Mbeumo until the New Year due to his involvement with Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are also absent for the festive period with Ivory Coast and Morocco respectively.",
      "This weekend, United will also be missing Casemiro from their squad. The Brazilian picked up his fifth yellow card of the season and will serve a one-game ban vs Aston Villa.",
      "His absence could provide an opportunity for Kobbie Mainoo. The academy graduate has yet to start a Premier League fixture this season.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has admitted that his spell at Manchester United hasn't unfolded as he'd envisioned, revealing he had chances to move elsewhere during the club's most turbulent period.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker arrived at Old Trafford in a £47million switch from Sporting CP back in January 2020. While the 31-year-old would have harboured dreams of recreating the silverware-rich success the club enjoyed during Sir Alex Ferguson's iconic reign, matters haven't quite materialised in that fashion under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag, and now, Ruben Amorim.",
      "In five years, Fernandes has collected just an FA Cup and a League Cup for his contributions in United's midfield, while the club's top-flight displays have also deteriorated since his arrival. Last season witnessed United record their worst-ever Premier League campaign since the competition's launch in 1992, with Amorim's introduction seeing the Reds languish in a disappointing 15th place, reports the Mirror.",
      "The club also fell short of claiming the Europa League crown in May, following a heartbreaking 1-0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Fernandes has now looked back on his Old Trafford journey.",
      "When Ferdinand questioned him about his affection for the club, the United skipper responded: \"Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lift as many as I should and I could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club in a certain way was still very important and not taking nothing away from other players that were here and everything. I think when we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I think everyone at the club, I hope, is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"So I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet.",
      "\"So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies. It changed a lot because if I look at the past, [Francesco] Totti is known as one of the best players in Italy and unfortunately for him he hasn't won many trophies.\"",
      "Fernandes had spoken to Ferdinand earlier this month, before a recent interview surfaced in which he alleged that the United board were eager to see him leave during the summer transfer window. Saudi powerhouses Al-Hilal were prepared to offer United £100m for Fernandes' signature, but the attacking midfielder chose to remain at Old Trafford instead.",
      "The club were also reportedly prepared to pay Fernandes £700,000-a-week, which would have netted him approximately £100m across a three-year deal. Now, the playmaker has indicated that whilst Amorim was keen for him to stay, the United executives were eager to cash in.",
      "Speaking to Canal 11, he said: \"I can't complain, I'm very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I'll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children's lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I'll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players. I could have left like many people do and said, 'I want to leave, I don't want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side.'",
      "\"But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same. But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision. I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay.",
      "\"But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'if you leave, it's not so bad for us.' It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about.",
      "\"I'm always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much...that makes you sad.\"",

      "The numbers don't lie for Bruno Fernandes, but the trophy cabinet does. 307 appearances for Manchester United, 103 goals, 91 assists, and four Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year awards have yielded two medals, in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.",
      "For all Fernandes' mixed messages over his Old Trafford future and how close he has come to leaving in the past, there can be no question mark over his loyalty to a club he has served with distinction and pride. He deserves more than that measly medal haul, to go with two runners-up efforts in the Europa League.",
      "Speaking to the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Fernandes said he had twice had chances to leave United, only for the club to ask him to stay. That contradicts what he told Canal 11 in an interview released earlier this week, in which he claimed the club wanted him out last summer but lacked the courage to inform him.",
      "That interview was conducted a few weeks ago and was arranged by the Portuguese national team. His chat with Ferdinand was conducted on Saturday, before the Canal 11 quotes were released.",
      "But whatever of Fernandes stirring the pot when it comes to his future and transfer tales of the past, as he points out to Ferdinand, he has given his all to the club and although it remains unsaid, it is clear he hasn't got what he deserves in return.",
      "Fernandes talks about his \"loyalty... in the toughest periods\" and how he opted to stay despite the fact that he hasn't won the silverware his career clearly merits. At times, he sounded reflective when he considered the seven years of service he has given.",
      "\"Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and I could,\" he said.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club in a certain way was still very important and not taking nothing away from other players that were here and everything. I think when we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I think everyone at the club, I hope is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",

So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.\"",
      "Fernandes made the point that players from previous generations weren't judged on medals, citing Francesco Totti's loyalty to Roma as an example. Totti made 786 appearances for his boyhood club across 25 seasons and won only one Serie A title and two Coppa Italias. Nobody decries that as a waste of time. Instead, Totti is lauded for both his loyalty and his brilliance.",
      "But times have shifted in the age of social media. Look at the ridicule Harry Kane got at Tottenham for not winning trophies. The only person who should be judging whether that loyalty is worth the payoff is the player.",
      "So far, Fernandes has felt it has been worth it and you can see why. Just imagine being the Manchester United captain - not to mention their best player - when they finally win the title again. That one title at Old Trafford would be worth countless others elsewhere.",
      "The reality for Fernandes is that the elusive prize is no closer to being delivered now than it was when he arrived at the club in January 2020. If anything, it is further away.",
      "Fernandes insists he stayed at United because he thinks they can still win trophies. They did reach a European final last season. But within a few weeks of this season starting, there was only one piece of silverware left on the table, in the FA Cup. It is cup competitions which have to be United's aim at the moment.",
      "Nobody could blame Fernandes if he decided this summer that he had had enough of that. If United fail to qualify for the Champions League for the third season in a row, it will only feel like those big prizes are getting further away.",
      "It would be no surprise if Fernandes were to decide enough was enough, and the worry for United is that the longer they go without competing for trophies, the more difficult it can be to attract and keep the best players.",

      "It's not been an easy business being a striker for Manchester United in recent years and Benjamin Sesko has found his start to life at Old Trafford to follow a familiar pattern. Two goals in his first 13 appearances tell the story of a centre-forward still getting to grips with the role.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has never convinced in the role and Rasmus Hojlund is now scoring goals for Napoli, having struggled to do the same for United. In search for a solution, Ruben Amorim spent nearly £74million on signing Sesko from RB Leipzig in the summer.",
      "Hojlund could attest that leading the line in this system doesn't come with a guarantee of chances. The Dane didn't look up to the job, but his frustration also regularly boiled over when the final pass never came or opportunities didn't find their way to him.",
      "It's been a similar story for Sesko, who has managed 18 shots in 12 Premier League games, six of which came in one game at Brentford. He has an xG of 2.1 in those games, which shows that chances just aren't coming to him. It's hard to be too critical in that regard and when the same happened to Hojlund, it starts to look like a pattern.",
      "It has been a smoother start to life at United for Bryan Mbeumo, who has quickly become the attack leader and the player in the final third always the likeliest to make something happen. He has six goals in 16 games from an xG of 5.5 and has been a more dangerous outlet than Sesko.",
      "But with Mbeumo now away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), United need someone to step forward, and this feels like the moment Sesko can really make his mark on a new club. That was put to Amorim last week and he sought to take the pressure off his new striker, but did hint at a change in approach.",
      "\"I think it's not just Ben, but everyone,\" he said. \"I think we need to adapt a little bit the way we are going to play the games and that is a good opportunity to do that because we cannot think that we are going to play the same way without Amad, Bryan and Nous but especially Amad and Bryan because of the characteristics. that is really hard to get.",
      "\"They have more or less the same characteristics, both of them, and we are losing them for a few games, but it's a good opportunity for us to try to play in a different way.\"",
      "That different way is something that looks more like a 4-3-3 and it might end up being a system that delivers more chances to the No.9. Sesko got only 22 minutes against Bournemouth and had a hand in Matheus Cunha's goal, but if he returns to the starting line-up at Villa Park it will be easier to judge him.",
      "No player wants an injury, but the four matches Sesko has missed with a knee problem might have given him the chance to reset and take stock, to assess his start at United and what, if anything, needs to change.",
      "He certainly needs to deliver more goals, although to do that he will need more chances. The next few weeks might offer an opportunity in that regard and Amorim will be hoping to see the best of Sesko over the festive period.",

Across the last three years, nobody has played more than Fernandes' 16,880 minutes.",

Last season, he was suspended for one Europa League game and one Premier League fixture and was rested at Brentford during the run-in as focus turned to Europe, but there were no injuries.",
      "The last time he missed a game through injury for United was in May 2024, when he was sidelined for two fixtures towards the end of the season. In total, he has missed just three matches through injury or illness since signing for the club in January 2020, which is an incredible record for a player who has now racked up 307 appearances.",
      "This season, Fernandes has played 96.4% of possible minutes for United. Last season, it was 89.7%, and the season before, 90.4%. He has been United's best player throughout that run, but is also always available.",
      "Having reopened the debate over his future this week, this is another aspect of Fernandes' game that United might find difficult to replace. He told Canal 11 in Portugal that he felt the club wanted him to leave last summer and he has already made it clear he will reassess his future after the World Cup.",
      "It's not impossible that he leaves United this summer, but in addition to replacing his influence in the final third, they will need to find a player who can match his robustness, and that will not be easy.",
      "United have had their injury issues in recent years. Erik ten Hag's second season in charge was wrecked by a string of fitness problems, but Fernandes was never affected. New research earlier this week labelled United the Premier League's most injury-hit club, with absences costing them £155million over the past five years.",
      "Throughout it all, Fernandes has remained the constant, and his ability to almost entirely avoid injury is remarkable. That will be even harder to replace than his goals and assists if he does call it a day at the end of the season.",

      "The January transfer window is fast approaching and Manchester United could be among the busiest Premier League clubs in the market. Ruben Amorim's side spent more than £215million in the summer and their expenditure is expected to rise next month with the Reds keen to bolster their squad.",
      "United wanted to sign a central midfielder before the start of the 2025/26 season and had courted Brighton's Carlos Baleba as a target. However, a deal didn't materialise and he stayed at the Amex Stadium.",
      "While United could go back in for Baleba, there are a number of alternatives that have emerged, including Al-Hilal's Ruben Neves and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton. Elsewhere, United are in the shop window for a versatile forward with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Antoine Semenyo is a player United wanted in the summer and the club are anticipated to target him again when January comes around. With that in mind, here are the latest transfer news and rumours involving United...",
      "Ruben Neves has reportedly emerged as a surprise transfer target for United in January as the former Wolves midfielder is keen on a return to the Premier League.",
      "Neves, who signed for Al-Hilal in a £47million deal in 2023, is out of contract in the summer and the Saudi Pro League side are prepared to let him go for £20m next month.",
      "The Reds are in the market for a new defensive midfielder and Neves is an option for Amorim's side, according to the Daily Mail. Although the Portugal international turns 29 in March, he has the benefit of having six years top-flight experience during his successful time at Wolves.",
      "MEN says: It's an option that United should consider but they would be better leaving Neves and attempting to lure Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace or Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest instead.",
      "Neves would be a suitable short-term option, at least for the next six to 18 months, but Wharton and Anderson are the future and the Reds should be eyeing up either one of them to lead their midfield.",
      "United will go all-out to sign Semenyo in January, according to the Telegraph. United are locked in a four-way tussle with Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool for the Bournemouth forward, who has a £65million release clause in his contract which activates at the start of next month.",
      "City want Semenyo but United are among the suitors to take advantage of the uncertainty around Pep Guardiola's future and whether he will remain at the Etihad Stadium beyond the end of this season.",
      "Semenyo, 25, is in huge demand and has a big decision to make regarding his next career move. The Ghana international scored his seventh goal of the season in the 4-4 draw against United at Old Trafford on Monday.",
      "MEN says: He would be the perfect signing for United. Although Semenyo has been used in an attacking wide role for Bournemouth, Amorim could use him in the left wing-back role for the Reds.",
      "Like Amad, Semenyo has the capabilities and tactical mindset to drop back and be used a little deeper but also have the license to get forward and create attacking opportunities. For me, it's a deal that should get done in January, even if a central midfielder is the priority target position.",

      "Ruben Amorim seems to have been enjoying keeping everyone guessing about his system in recent days. A head coach who once said Manchester United would need to sack him if they wanted to go with a different idea has spent much of the past 10 days working on just that.",
      "The 3-4-2-1 system so associated with Amorim wasn’t entirely thrown out of the window against Bournemouth, but it felt like a very different interpretation. Amad was playing well in advance of Diogo Dalot, who often lined up at left-back, with Leny Yoro at right-back. Amad was tucked inside as a midfielder before sometimes dropping back to the right wing-back slot.",
      "It was all very flexible, and after the game, Cherries boss Andoni Iraola said he felt it was the same system Amorim always used, but that it’s a system that comes with a lot of flexibility built in. It hasn’t always looked that way at United.",
      "Amorim was certainly giving nothing away after the match, beyond an acknowledgement that he had been working on a different shape at Carrington.",
      "“That is for you to discuss, not for me,” he said. “I will say the same thing, you can play with the same players, it looks like one thing is another thing. I know that you guys know that I trained this week the back four. I don't know how, but that is a good thing for you guys to discuss this week.”",
      "The question now is whether this weekend’s set-up at Aston Villa looks more like a 4-3-3. Amorim said last week United would have to change once Amad and Bryan Mbeumo left for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "That system would certainly work, except for a question about width, which would need to come from the full-backs. Diogo Dalot could revert to a natural role at right-back and Luke Shaw to left-back. Lisandro Martinez could be the left-sided centre-back and Matthijs de Ligt, if fit, on the right. If De Ligt isn’t fit, then Harry Maguire, currently also injured, is an option, as are Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, who are available.",
      "Casemiro could play the holding midfield role, although the Brazilian is suspended this weekend, so Manuel Ugarte might have to step in. A 4-3-3 formation would allow Amorim to play Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes together, if he wanted to.",
      "Benjamin Sesko can lead the line, with Matheus Cunha coming in off the left. Cunha has been excellent as a false nine, but if Shaw can get forward in support, he can drift infield from that role.",
      "It might be a similar situation on the right, with Mason Mount likely to play that position. Mount has been excellent recently and although Amorim would probably rather play him centrally, there is a lack of options on the right with Amad and Mbeumo unavailable.",
      "That XI would easily fit into a 4-3-3 formation, although it could revert to a back three with Patrick Dorgu brought in, likely replacing Mainoo.",
      "But there has been a growing anticipation that Amorim is considering a change, and this might just provide it.",

      "There was no shortage of relief among the Manchester United fanbase when Bruno Fernandes confirmed he would be staying at Old Trafford this past summer. The offer from the Saudi Pro League will have been tempting for the captain, considering the amount of money which they put on the table for players of Fernandes' quality.",
      "But after consulting his family, and speaking with the United board and manager Ruben Amorim, Fernandes wanted to stay. The captain has since gone on to score five goals and grab seven assists, so far this campaign. In October, the captain reiterated to MEN Sport the talks which settled his future involved the hierarchy.",
      "That is why a new interview with the midfielder, on Portuguese media outlet Canal 11, has been so surprising to all those involved with the club. Fernandes now appears to have contradicted himself, suggesting he felt 'hurt' by what he believed was the implication from United that they were not concerned about losing him.",
      "United sources have since reiterated the board made it clear to Fernandes he was part of the future at Old Trafford. But wherever the truth lies, the Reds should be treating this whole saga as a warning ahead of the next summer transfer window.",
      "Even if wires have been crossed between Fernandes and United, the captain has made it clear he wants to achieve other things before he hangs his boots. In the most recent interview, he mentioned his desire to play in Spain, Portugal and Italy before retiring, while also keeping the door open to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Fernandes is 31 now, certainly not at retirement age, but no spring chicken either. If he wants to achieve all of these things, or even some of them, before the end of his career, he will need to get a move on.",
      "There is a sense that Fernandes' time at United is coming to an end. He has been a brilliant servant to the club and he is the most deserving of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson crop of being given a proper send off.",
      "But United must start thinking about their own future and preservation. If Fernandes is to leave at the end of this season or in 2027 when his contract expires, the Reds need to make a plan for his replacement.",
      "For a long time, the plan seemed to revolve around Kobbie Mainoo. He was the academy graduate with the world at his feet and had the potential to produce the key moments Fernandes has done for the club.",
      "But a difficult 2025/26 season has put this succession path into major jeopardy. Mainoo's opportunities have dwindled and he handed in a request to leave the club on loan - which was rejected - over the summer.",
      "Since then the midfielder's situation has not altered. He is still yet to start a Premier League match this season and hopes of going to the World Cup have all but gone.",
      "There is a real possibility United could start next season without Fernandes and Mainoo. Surely then, this should be a wake-up call for the Reds.",
      "At the moment, it seems like they are sleep walking towards losing two of their most valuable midfielders. If they want to keep them, they need to start acting quickly.",
      "Both situations may be too far down the line for United to save them but if Fernandes' mind is made up, Amorim has got to start integrating Mainoo more to keep him from straying away. The Englishman needs to know there is a future for him at this club and a lot must change between now and the end of the season to prove it.",
      "Fernandes' bombshell interview is clear evidence United need to be looking into life without their captain and preparing for that eventuality. The trouble is, as things stand, it could be life without Fernandes and Mainoo next season which is enough to give the recruitment team sleepless nights.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has posted a fun, three-word message on social media after scoring in Napoli's Supercoppa semi-final win over AC Milan - a match which also saw Scott McTominay restrained following a heated flashpoint. The 2-0 win over their title rivals booked Antonio Conte's side a place in the final - where they will take on either Bologna or Inter Milan, who meet on Friday evening.",
      "The four-team competition, hosted in Saudi Arabia this year, features the winners and runners-up from the previous Serie A and Coppa Italia campaigns. There will be no repeat champions, with holders AC Milan now eliminated from the tournament.",
      "Hojlund - who is currently on loan with Napoli - continued his strong start in Italy by scoring in the 63rd minute to give his team some breathing space before the closing stages. Despite the importance of the goal, the Dane's post-match social media activity raised a few eyebrows.",
      "He posted a photo of himself lying flat on his back after falling in the aftermath of his goal. That image was also accompanied by the caption: \"No context Rasmus.\"",
      "Fans appeared largely unfazed by the cryptic message, instead filling the comments with praise for the striker - who seems to be rediscovering his form after departing Manchester United this summer.",
      "Another ex-United man thriving away from Old Trafford is McTominay. He also featured against AC Milan, though his evening involved a different kind of drama.",
      "With 81 minutes played, AC Milan were awarded a free-kick, following a challenge from the Scotland international. The ball then rolled into former Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori, who appeared to kick it back towards McTominay.",
      "Tempers quickly flared between the two sides. The atmosphere could have become even more combustible were it not for the neutral setting of Al-Awwal Park in Riyadh.",
      "McTominay took exception to Tomori's actions and he confronted the defender, going head-to-head before Napoli forward Lorenzo Lucca intervened to hold him back.",
      "Both players were shown yellow cards, and Napoli saw out the remainder of the match to secure their place in the Supercoppa final, which will be played on Monday night.",
      "Back in Serie A, meanwhile, the title race remains finely balanced heading into 2026. Just three points separate the top-four, with Napoli currently sitting third, two points behind leaders Inter Milan.",
      "Hojlund and McTominay could yet be joined by another ex-United teammate - with Kobbie Mainoo being heavily linked to a move to Naples in January's window. However, Ruben Amorim's side are said to require an 'exceptional offer' before even considering the sale of the academy graduate.",

Under various managers he developed an eye for goal, but the versatile midfielder was played in a range of positions and was never one of the first names on the teamsheet.",

      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "Since the move, he has won a league title, been named Serie A MVP, and guided Scotland to the 2026 World Cup. A Supercoppa Italiana semi-final against AC Milan now looms, and ex-Manchester City defender Lescott thinks he was never given a chance by coaches at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He was scoring goals. He was scoring goals for United and he was doing that when he played in a more advanced role,\" said Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"It was just that he wasn't allowed to do it every week and I also don't think he was allowed to have a bad game. I think there were times where he would score, do well, stay in the team and then if he didn't do it again, he was coming out.",
      "\"I don't think every player has that set balance or is not given the grace of playing badly. I think that comes when you're a homegrown talent though.",

      "Former Liverpool captain Graeme Souness also thinks that McTominay might have been sold prematurely, arguing that he would currently be United's best midfielder had he stayed put.",

Both United and Tottenham are reportedly prepared to pay up to €40million (£35m) for El Mala, while Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Bayern Munich are also mentioned as interested parties in recent weeks.",

      "Greer's YouTube channel, established by his parents Nathan and Tara a decade ago due to the high cost of football boots for their son, has charted his journey from grassroots football to Birmingham City's academy. Initially intended for boot reviews in hopes of securing a few free pairs, the channel has since documented his aspirations of turning professional.",

      "Despite starting for Birmingham's Under-18s team in a match against Manchester United, it was the home side that triumphed with a resounding 6-0 victory in the Under-18 Premier League Cup, ensuring they finished Group G with maximum points.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has admitted he can see himself playing late into his thirties, in contrast to former Manchester United teammate Victor Lindelof. Speaking to Portuguese broadcaster Canal 11, the United captain discussed his desire to prolong his career, admitting he would even consider playing in lower divisions such as district football.",
      "The 31-year-old, who is under contract until the summer of 2027, reaffirmed his love for football after summer interest from Saudi Arabia. Al-Hilal were said to have tabled a major offer for Fernandes, but the move collapsed, leaving Ruben Amorim's side to keep hold of their captain.",
      "During that interview, Fernandes also hinted about being open to leaving United in the not-so-distant future if he feels he is no longer 'wanted' at the club.",
      "He was asked if he would play until he was no longer physically able, to which he replied: \"I wouldn't say until I can't anymore, I want to prolong my career as much as possible.",
      "\"It's not about the attention I get, but about the love I have for football.",
      "\"I can't imagine doing anything else, and it's hard to think that in five years I might hang up my boots.\"",
      "Fernandes revealed a past conversation with Lindelof, from their time together at the club, adding: \"Some players see it differently.",
      "\"Victor Lindelof once told me he won't want to play beyond the ages of 33/34.",
      "\"But I told him, I can't accept that. I wouldn't mind playing in lower leagues - I just want to enjoy the game and keep playing football.",
      "\"Maybe even, in a moment of madness, I'd play district football at an advanced age.",
      "\"That's a different way of living the sport - football played purely for love, where you’re with your teammates and friends simply because you need to play.\"",
      "Lindelof, 31, left United in the summer after eight years when his contract expired at the end of last season.",
      "He joined Aston Villa in September on a two‑year deal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "After early attempts were saved by Birmingham goalkeeper Szymon Terenowicz, it looked like it was going to take something special to break the deadlock.",
      "Up stepped Jacob Watson, who found the net directly from a corner kick after 17 minutes, and received many deserved pats on the back from his United teammates.",
      "JJ Gabriel was denied numerous times during the first half, until he was in the right place at the right time to stab in a rebound and double United's lead. He spread his arms in celebration.",
      "The 15-year-old is one of United's - if not the world's - brightest talents. Just last week he scored on his first appearance at Old Trafford in the FA Youth Cup, and has already trained with Ruben Amorim's senior squad.",
      "The first-team manager and Gabriel have met behind the scenes, undertaking a long meeting about where his career could go at United. Although the club are keen to manage expectations, the teenager is doing all he can to impress for his first major breakthrough.",
      "Rafe McCormack put in another controlling midfield performance against the Blues, and even got the goal to show for it.",
      "He diverted James Bailey's free-kick in off the post, which always adds a shine to any goal, and truly wrapped up the match at 3-0.",
      "Minutes after assisting Rafe McCormack and James McEvoy's headed goal for 4-0, James Bailey added a fifth for the U18s.",
      "The playmaker thrashed in a powerful effort having been teed up by McEvoy in return, and celebrated passionately.",
      "Kai Rooney finished the afternoon's scoring, making it 6-0 to United. The teenager plucked the ball out of the air from a corner, took two controlling touches and smashed into the roof of Birmingham's net from a tight angle.",
      "It marked a delightful comeback for the son of United legend Wayne Rooney, who shared an update on a devastating injury sustained back in September. Although the exact nature was not known, the youngster showed off his right foot in a protective boot.",
      "The timing was heartbreaking as he had just been promoted to United's Under-19s squad, thus playing with others four years his senior. However, on Wednesday he was back with a bang and will be hoping to continue his upwards trajectory."

      "Manchester United players reportedly sense that this will be Bruno Fernandes' final season with the club, with his latest interview serving as an indicator.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head,\" he began telling Canal 11, adding: \"I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like; 'If you leave, it's not so bad for us'. It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, and I always play - good or bad - I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much... that makes you sad.\"",
      "This has plunged the 31-year-old's time with United into fresh doubt mere days away from the start of the next winter transfer window.",
      "And now according to talkSPORT, the sense inside the club's dressing is Fernandes could eventually leave the club after the 2025/26 season ends.",
      "The Portuguese international is under contract until 2027, whilst United hold the option to be able to extend this a further year. However, it is explained the sale of Fernandes to a club based in Saudi Arabia would unlock valuable funds to help reshape Ruben Amorim's squad into challengers in the long run.",
      "As he will have spent six-and-a-half years with United come next summer, it may also feel a natural time for Fernandes himself to decide a new challenge is in order.",
      "Fernandes' interview with Canal 11 contradicted what he told reporters in October. During that conversation he explained the club echoed Amorim's desire for him to stay.",
      "He said: \"The manager spoke with me. He said I was still part of the project. He wanted me to stay. The club said the same. And I always said that if the club was like ‘Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project’, or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has lit a fuse under Old Trafford. And it could end up being nearly as explosive as Mo Salah’s transfer saga at Liverpool.",
      "Fernandes’ interview - saying he was “sad and hurt” - accusing the Manchester United board were ready to sell him to Saudi club Al-Hilal last summer was incredibly powerful.",
      "It will have embarrassed the United hierarchy and left a potentially even bigger disconnect between the fanbase, Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Just when you think things could not get any worse, Fernandes has taken aim.",
      "United fans already worship Fernandes and him also expressing his love and commitment to the club and desire to win trophies will have only strengthened the bond. But it is hard to believe that there is not some strong politics going on here.",
      "Just to be sure, Fernandes says that Ruben Amorim wanted him to stay and that is the reason the board did not get their wish. However, Fernandes knows what he is doing. If you set up a battle between Fernandes and the hierarchy (making it clear whose side Amorim is on) then there is only one winner.",
      "Fernandes has been fabulous for United. His figures - goals and assists - in an ailing team have been remarkable. I don’t think he can be one of the Premier League all time greats because he has not won enough. But he deserves to be.",
      "Maybe that is the difference with Salah. He made it all about himself, it was a misstep and, despite winning so much at Liverpool, he was actually ready to throw everyone else under the bus - apart from himself.",
      "And this must be at the heart of Fernandes’ frustration because the club have let him down and failed to build a team around his strengths. He has been careful to say he has given himself for the club.",
      "You could make a stronger case for selling Fernandes last summer around Amorim’s tactics than a financial discussion. He is priceless to United.",
      "But United do still look unbalanced. That is why the back three discussion goes on. Can you really make Fernandes work in that system? Fernandes seems to make it work himself.",
      "However, in my mind, Adam Wharton would not fit in at United. Why? Have you seen him run? He is the passer in any team. He needs legs and energy with him. To make Amorim’s system work you need two midfield runners.",
      "But actually United have always been based around a player of Fernandes’ class. That is the club’s whole identity. And why people like me think they are special.",
      "It’s the style they stand for. The gripping eight goal thriller against Bournemouth was a taste of that. And Fernandes was at the very heart of it.",
      "Selling him would be like parting with the family silver. And now Fernandes has set us all up for a very messy divorce when it inevitably comes.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has hogged the spotlight this week, having first revealed in a bombshell interview with Portuguese outlet Canal 11 that Manchester United “wanted me to go” in the summer when Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal came sniffing for a potential £100m transfer.",

      "“I go and look at that because obviously, even more for me, when it’s from ex-players, I think I look at it and say like, OK, they’ve played the game, they’ve seen the game.",
      "“Let’s see if what they’re saying can help me to improve my game. When you guys, probably when you speak well about me, I try not to overlook that because I think as a human being, not as a player, as a human being, you tend to be like relaxed, like, oh my God, look at this.",

      "“And for us, you don’t talk in a bad way to us. But the problem is, for the perspective of the stadium, it’s bad. It looks bad on us because you’re waving your arms, you’re moving your arms.",

      "Man Utd have chosen Manuel Ugarte as the player they want to ‘sacrifice’ in January in order to bring in new players, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on new players over the summer transfer window with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backing Ruben Amorim in the market.",
      "Only four teams scored fewer goals in the Premier League last season and Man Utd invested most of their summer cash into their forward line with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko arriving.",
      "Many fans and former players were disappointed that Man Utd didn’t manage to bring in a midfielder with the position an obvious area for improvement after last season.",
      "Man Utd did make enquiries for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher but the potential deals didn’t go any further.",
      "Fabrizio Romano and other journalists have indicated that the Red Devils will attempt to bring in a new midfielder over the January transfer window.",
      "READ: Man Utd kids have ‘reactionary hissy fits’ after Mainoo brother ‘tantrum’",
      "However, there may have to be some outgoings too with Spanish website Fichajes insisting that Man Utd ‘have decided to take drastic measures to shape their squad according to Ruben Amorim’s demands.’",
      "Ugarte has been chosen as a ‘sacrifice’ for January and Man Utd ‘have decided to look for a way out’ for the Uruguay international this winter.",
      "The ‘absolute priority is to give the midfield a different dynamic’ with it ‘imperative to lighten the current squad, and therefore they are looking to offload the Uruguayan midfielder’.",
      "Ugarte has started just two Premier League matches this season with French side Nice keen to do a deal for the 24-year-old ahead of January.",
      "The report adds: ‘OGC Nice, a club with strong institutional ties through INEOS, appears to be the leading candidate to acquire the Uruguayan midfielder on loan. This move would allow Manchester United to free up a strategic roster spot and reduce their wage bill, enabling them to make an immediate impact signing this winter. Amorim is looking for a specific profile that can integrate into his characteristic double pivot and rotate with figures of the calibre of Casemiro. Manuel Ugarte’s situation reflects the urgent need for changes in a midfield that has shown a lack of pace in recent defensive transitions.’",
      "Fichajes continues: ‘Negotiations are expected to intensify after the holiday period, with the aim of bringing in the new signing in the first few days of next year. Manuel Ugarte ‘s departure would financially facilitate a transfer that the Red fans are demanding to stabilize a squad that has suffered too many setbacks.’",
      "Elliot Anderson could be the answer to their midfield issues but the £100m-rated Nottingham Forest player is much more likely to happen in the summer.",
      "Former Premier League striker Marlon Harewood insists that Anderson would “definitely” be worth his huge price tag.",
      "When asked if Forest have a fight on their hands to keep the England international, Harewood told Goal: “Yes, massively. I’m actually really surprised that Newcastle let him go. But with all the fair play and everything that is going on with the rules and regulations, it was good for Forest to get him in the squad.",
      "“He has really excelled. He has become one of the true Premier League midfielders that you can see go on and excel and do well. Yes, Forest will do well to keep him. If they keep him for the rest of the season it would be good, but I can see people coming in for him in January.”",
      "When asked whether the Man Utd target was worth the £100m quoted, Harewood added: “He is definitely one of those players. If someone said that and put that price tag, with the money that’s going on in the game over the last couple of years, he is definitely worth the price tag and I think he will go on and do really well at whatever club he is at.",
      "“I hope Forest can keep him for the rest of the season so that they can do what they need to do this year.”",
      "Arne Slot has become the actual favourite to lose his job as the Premier League lurches from one madness to another…",
      "Liverpool legend Graeme Souness insists that Man Utd sold their best player 18 months ago while he disagrees with Paul Scholes about Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘held talks’ over signing Al-Hilal star Ruben Neves, who is also linked with Newcastle United and Spurs.",
      "Manchester United are much better this season. But what it was, was complete turd. At the moment they’re still doing little more than polishing it.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United are *finally* evolving for the better, but Kobbie Mainoo and five teammates will be the six victims of these changes…",
      "Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘to leave’ Manchester United and will ‘not’ be in charge next season, with INEOS ‘ready to make a dramatic decision’."

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",

Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now 10 wins in 11 Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and now genuine title contention. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",

      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",

      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest and Leeds have to be a concern.",

      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "But derby defeat at Sunderland will inevitably sting, and the reality is that Howe and Newcastle remain for now behind Tottenham in the league, and that is not the place any self-respecting club should currently find themselves, all things considered.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Victory at Burnley has made it three wins from four, lifted Fulham away from the relegation battle and towards the mid-table strivers, and significantly lessened the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",

      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re definitely less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A pair of subsequent wins cool the immediate temperatures but it does all feel extremely precarious.",

It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. We don’t know, but we’d certainly contend he’s unlucky to be second favourite at this time on current form.",

      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",

      "“They sold the best one – Scott McTominay. He was better than those two, and he’s just grown in his job since he’s been at Napoli. I understand why you would use Bruno as a six, but then you want to use him as a 10 as well. So, he has a license.",
      "“He got a goal the other night [against Wolves] – he wasn’t playing as a six when he got his goal. I always thought a midfield player had to do a bit of everything – defensive work when needed, be creative when needed, and maybe chip in with a few goals.",
      "“That’s what Bruno’s doing right now. He is their go-to man. He’s easily their most talented player. But he has shortcomings. I still don’t like him waving his arms and telling other people what to do all the time. Slightly frustrating. I couldn’t have played with him if he was like that.”",

      "“If Paul Scholes were to have played against Mainoo, he would’ve had him on toast because he would never be where he should have been when Man United are out of possession.",

Is it too much to suggest the boos that rained down so infamously on Guglielmo Vicario against Fulham would in previous years have perhaps been aimed in more familiar fashion at the directors’ box?",

Frank’s version of Spurs have achieved something that you’d think impossible without real concerted effort: as moribund as Mourinho’s team in attack, as leaky and error-prone as Postecoglou’s in defence.",

      "But also aren’t they really quite sh*t? Like far, far sh*tter than it’s remotely necessary or acceptable for them to be in their Champions League-and-Saudi era? They are quite literally as bad as Tottenham, and Howe doesn’t even have Thomas Frank’s flimsy ‘I’m new here and this club is batsh*t’ excuse. And Frank is under immense pressure now.",

      "Feels like that’s a dangerous mindset that could easily lead a daft big club into trouble, but it’s also reasonable to be less bent out of shape about being 12th when the top five is four points away rather than 10.",
      "The other thing is that the fact there is absolutely no peril or jeopardy in the Champions League now – we designed it that way – means Newcastle are in no danger of messing that up in the way they ultimately (if slightly unfortunately) did a couple of years ago. They’ve hit the odd wrinkle, but still sit four points above the generous 24th-place cut line with two games to go.",

      "But not the distance there once was. They’ve won only once in the last month, and that was against Burnley which is mandatory anyway. Tricky away games at Brighton and Arsenal have gone as you might expect, but there really is no excuse for anyone losing a league game at Spurs this season. Not even Wolves did that.",

      "Still, though: it’s not all bad news: Wolves next. The ultimate Christmas present.",
      "",
      "Have inexplicably and incredibly irritatingly spent a second consecutive December talking themselves out of the title race for absolutely no good reason. Truly maddening stuff, especially on the back of fighting so, so hard to prove exactly why they could compete for the title in that 10-man draw with Arsenal – which was the same week they dismantled Barcelona in the Champions League.",
      "Have stumbled in that competition as well with defeat to Atalanta leaving them likely facing the unwanted hassle of the play-off round.",
      "Chelsea have reached the semi-finals of the Carabao, although presumably Enzo Maresca thinks it’s just plain daft to talk about them maybe winning it when so many other good teams are involved.",
      "",
      "Tentatively encouraging signs, on the field at least. They played well in Champions League victory at Inter before a solid home win over Brighton. Their next two league games are at Tottenham, which generally proves to be a lift for Liverpool spirits and absolutely should do this time, and then at home to Wolves.",
      "Every chance they hit 2026 on a four-game winning run and then an instant chance to kick off the new year by putting right what went wrong at Leeds the other week.",
      "And with absolutely no off-field drama whatsoever to worry themselves with, it’s all looking far rosier than it did even a couple of weeks ago, never mind at the time of the last Moods.",
      "",
      "We didn’t really expect Daniel Farke to still be here for this update. Leeds had lost four of their previous five Premier League games at that point and were heading into an absolutely brutal run of games: Villa, City, Chelsea, Liverpool.",
      "They duly lost the first two, but then took four points from a pair of riotously encouraging and potentially season-turning performances against Chelsea and Liverpool. Then followed that up with a point at Brentford, which is an absolutely acceptable result for pretty much anyone there; it’s more than Man United, Liverpool or Newcastle have managed there already this season.",
      "They remain under serious and obvious threat of relegation, but to be approaching the halfway stage of the season on an apparent upward curve, outside the bottom three and with the same manager they began the season with? It’s not too bad at all.",
      "",
      "Here’s what we said a month ago:",
      "Proving to be the most gloriously mid-table team imaginable, achieving that middle-of-the-road outcome via the most outlandish means possible.",
      "And a month later… here we still are. They have now, sadly, lost the dream of going through the entire season without having the same result in consecutive games – last month’s wins over Brentford and Forest put paid to that.",
      "But that is still the only time it’s happened to Brighton all season. A team that has beaten four of last season’s top seven already this season remain determined to have it count for as little as possible. And we respect that.",
      "In a congested mid-table built on endless shifts and flux, one where all positions between fifth and 14th seem to be handed out at random week by week, Brighton are 10th and it feels like they are always 10th. Seems churlish, considering that, to put them anywhere other than that here.",
      "",
      "Really did look like they were going to do something quite silly and bin Marco Silva for a while there. It would have been a catastrophic misjudgement. Fulham and Silva is one of those combinations that just works. Neither would be as good without the other; both should think long and hard before even considering the temptation to look elsewhere.",
      "The end of the Carabao adventure is a disappointment for a club who have seen peers claim silverware recently but three league wins in the last five – and a stirring if ultimately not quite successful comeback against City – have at least quietened the noise suggesting they might be about to do something stupid.",
      "In our best Mark Lawrenson voice: They’ll be fine.",
      "",
      "A month ago we demanded to be told whether Man United are good now, or what. Still none the wiser, frankly.",
      "The mood at Manchester United has definitely shifted over the last couple of months, but – as with the team itself – we’d stop some way short of calling it a good mood.",
      "Indeed, that is the very crux of the current problem for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United.",
      "They are no longer utterly, humiliatingly mortifying. That deep sense of embarrassment at being just so profoundly sh*t that United felt throughout last season and into the start of this one has now dissipated.",
      "The stain of finishing where they finished last season and bottling a cup final against a Tottenham – Tottenham! – side apparently being player-managed on the fly by Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven will never truly come off. And nor should it.",
      "You don’t have to be This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About for that to be an unacceptable season. There can exist no mitigation that justifies finishing 15th and collecting fewer league wins than a Wolves team now making a historic attempt at knocking Derby County off their f*cking perch.",
      "That shame will always be there. Grimsby will always be there.",
      "But it’s fair to say now that those very darkest days do appear to be behind United. Things still aren’t perfect by any stretch. At almost any other period of United’s Premier League history their current effort would be a poor one, and that itself is part of the problem for anyone trying to turn this ship around.",
      "Even after the historic lows of last season even the significant current improvement doesn’t constitute success.",
      "And herein lies the ongoing niggle. United are now at the very least competent. That doesn’t sound like much, and it isn’t, but it’s a huge step up from last season. Competence is welcome at this stage.",
      "But with it have already come some extremely irritating missed opportunities. Last year’s incompetence may have only slightly dampened expectations, with the club’s own stated aims for this season a nine-place leap into the top six, but it has handed United another advantage.",
      "It’s not the advantage any club of United’s stature wants, but the absence altogether of any European football – with the Grimsby debacle almost eliminating midweek football altogether – offers United benefits that none of their theoretical rivals can enjoy.",
      "And they just keep refusing to fully accept those chances. They have dragged themselves towards the top of the mid-table peloton but they really could have got themselves into something approaching Villa’s current situation.",
      "United have only lost once in seven Premier League games since the start of November, but it’s a run riddled with annoyance and frustration.",
      "The defeat was a ludicrous one, at home against a good-not-great Everton side who handed United an absurd early advantage by friendly-firing themselves down to 10 men.",
      "And the other six games in that run have all been against distinctly beatable opponents. The league positions for the seven teams at the time United played them were 18th, 6th, 13th, 5th, 17th, 20th and 13th.",
      "The sixth-placed team was Tottenham, who we now know to be more rubbish than that, and the fifth-placed one was Palace, who United beat. The only other win was against the team in 20th, who we don’t think we need identify by name.",
      "In the last seven weeks United have drawn four games against opposition of bottom-half standard. And they have been in front in every single one of those games. In three of them they have led going into the final 10 minutes.",
      "Sure, at Spurs they ended up salvaging a point in the last seconds but only after throwing away a winning position with six minutes of regular time remaining.",
      "West Ham equalised on 83 minutes at Old Trafford, and Bournemouth 84 in a game United had already led twice and trailed once before getting their noses in front with 11 minutes to go.",
      "And such is the congested nature of the league table that these spaffed points really, really hurt. They have had so many chances now to get themselves into the (likely) Champions League places and every time they seem to sabotage themselves, very often infuriatingly late on in games.",
      "Ifs and buts are candy and nuts, but when the table is so tight it is impossible to resist thinking about what might have been. There is a compelling case to make that United could have won every single one of their last seven league games, which is good. Instead, they have won only two.",
      "Even turning two of the five failures into the wins United really should have managed would be enough to have them in top four now. You might even, if you wanted to be entirely reckless, talk about them being on the fringes of the title race.",
      "Instead: there they still are in the mid-table bunch, still having to worry every bit as much about what’s behind them as ahead of them, still in danger of slipping right back into mid-table should they stumble again.",
      "So yes; it’s much better than it was. But what it was, was complete turd. At the moment they’re still doing little more than polishing it.",
      "",
      "A couple of vaguely alarming home defeats to the Manchester clubs are mood-dampeners, but the main thing keeping all things from being deliriously cheery for Palace is the long-term future of Oliver Glasner.",
      "It is the way of the world and Palace fans know their place in it. He will not be there for much longer but wonderful things have happened – and in a way entirely sustainable if they get the next appointment anywhere near as correct as this one – and continue to happen.",
      "Never mind what comes next for now. Palace are competing in the top six of the Premier League and on cup fronts European and domestic. They have never known days like these.",
      "",
      "Phew. Dycheball is doing the necessary, and then some. Let us never speak of Angeball and the most predictable Premier League disaster of all time ever again.",
      "",
      "Is it happening again? It does feel like it might be happening again. We’re not even really sure Arsenal have done a lot wrong. But you can entirely understand The Fear after a run of iffy away results and then a truly honking if still somehow just about good/lucky enough performance against Wolves.",
      "It says a lot about that performance that escaping with a last-gasp win when not playing well is usually your classic Hallmark of Champions territory. But Arsenal were so bad, so panicky when 1-0 up at home against what may yet go down as the worst Premier League team in history it actually became what might be the first in an entirely new genre: a match win that makes you less likely to win the title.",
      "That seems silly. Even as we write it, it seems silly. But it felt true at the time, and doubly so after especially Man City but even Aston Villa with another come-from-behind special recorded far more impressive wins from far tougher assignments the following day.",
      "A weekend that ended up ‘as you were’ on paper didn’t really feel that way in the gut.",
      "We’re not saying anything is f*cked for the league leaders who still have the best team and squad in the league, but surely everyone involved will feel a little more comfortable if they can quite swiftly find a convincing league performance.",
      "And their next few games are ticklish. Everton away is a funny one, because some teams – even crap ones – have found it very easy there and others absolutely have not, while after that it’s Brighton. You never know what to expect from Brighton but they can be extremely mischievous when put up against one of the bigger boys.",
      "And then it’s Aston Villa again. Hmm.",
      "",
      "We were very, very harsh on Everton in the last update. What we were cross about was that we wanted Everton be lots of fun this season and they’d only been quite fun. It was childish of us.",
      "But listen, fair play. Everton have taken it on board. Since that update they’ve gone down to 10 men in the opening minutes at Old Trafford after a fight between two of their own players and still gone on to win. In consecutive home games they’ve been beaten 4-1 and then won 3-0.",
      "They are in absolutely no danger of relegation, and at one point for a brief time even jumped up to fifth place in the table to the widespread delight and wide-eyed surprise of all.",
      "This is what we wanted from Everton in their first season at the Hill Dickinson. Plenty of fun, and no real existential drama or stress. They are now firmly on course.",
      "",
      "If the 24/25 season had an overriding theme it was the ending of trophy droughts.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first major silverware in their history. Newcastle won their first trophy that wasn’t in, well, black and white and even Tottenham ended the most discussed trophy drought of all, in the most Tottenham way imaginable and have since sacked or moved on almost everyone involved in such a hideously off-brand endeavour.",
      "But there was another story rumbling along in the background of all this drought-ending catharsis and joy. And it might have been, in its own roundabout way, just as necessary.",
      "For while all those droughts were ending, something almost as unthinkable was happening in Manchester: Guardiola and City won absolutely nothing unless you count the Community Shield which you absolutely should not. That is just not how things are supposed to be these days.",
      "It was City and Guardiola’s first trophyless season since his very first in England back in 20216/17. And it really might have been just what City needed.",
      "It’s not that there was massive complacency. Certainly older City supporters need no reminding that what they’ve experienced over the last decade is not normal, not Typical City.",
      "But for younger fans it was a more unusual experience; even in the years before Pep turned City into English football’s dominant force there was still success on a scale most clubs never experience ever in their history.",
      "Between 2010/11 and 2014/15, City won two league titles and finished second twice as well as an FA Cup and League Cup. And that was the bit before the gold rush.",
      "Since Guardiola’s arrival, City have won six more league titles, a Champions League, four Carabaos, a couple of FA Cups, A UEFA Super Cup and a Club World Cup.",
      "It is a lot of stuff. Even the most well-adjusted fanbase is going to get a bit blasé about it. How could you not? It’s inevitable.",
      "But a year of going without – especially one like 24/25 where City didn’t even really mount any kind of meaningful challenge for the two top honours – can have a reinvigorating effect.",
      "It certainly seems to have done so for Guardiola himself, who last season often appeared to have grown entirely weary of the whole thing. There were long spells where it wouldn’t have surprised us at all to hear he’d decided to leave in the summer a la Klopp. We’re certain he contemplated it.",
      "But now he’s got the scent in his nostrils again. He’s got a new-look team. It’s not quite as precise and efficient a machine as his very best City teams but in its way all the more charming for that.",
      "Above all, he’s once again caught up in the thrill of the chase. Worth remembering that after back-to-back early-season defeats to Spurs and Brighton it felt entirely reasonable to wonder whether City, so dominant so recently, would once again have to settle for the role of mere spectator and occasional agitator in the title race.",
      "They still don’t fully convince us. They still don’t quite have that look of champions about them. But that might be the most exciting thing of all; that for all the doubts, for all their flaws, for all the uncertainty, there they sit, right on the shoulders of Arsenal.",
      "Both these teams have been here before. Both know how that played out.",
      "City and their trophy-hoarding manager can smell blood in the water and are suddenly right up for this.",
      "Sometimes it really can be the ground left fallow for a year that proves the most fertile.",
      "",
      "A team that probably shouldn’t even have got promoted – they finished 24 points behind Leeds and Burnley and even 14 behind Sheffield United having ended the regular season in horror form – now absolutely ripping it up in the Premier League? Wonderful.",
      "First things first, they (although we must acknowledge Wolves’ selfless assist here) have already pretty much guaranteed we won’t be seeing the three promoted teams go straight back down which is a hugely welcome development. And if the three promoted teams do now all go down, then, well, we’re in for a truly astonishing second half of the season anyway so that’s also fine.",
      "More likely, though, is that Sunderland continuing knocking about in the rarefied top-half air they currently breathe. Even if they don’t in fact end up level on points with Liverpool and separated only on goals scored when the music finally stops in May.",
      "There are all sorts of ambitions you could reasonably have for the remainder of Sunderland’s season. They could definitely qualify for Europe, for instance, which would be a spectacular bit of work.",
      "Our goal for them is, inevitably, more mischief-based. We want them to reach 59 points. Why 59? Because it’s the sum total the three promoted teams Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton managed last season.",
      "At present speed and course, Sunderland get 61 points. We are watching, and hoping that AFCON doesn’t blast too big a hole in our dreams and/or Sunderland’s season before the next update.",
      "",
      "After five games of the season, Aston Villa had three points and had just managed their first goal of the campaign after a nevertheless disappointing 1-1 draw against 10-man Sunderland.",
      "It looked for all the world like last season’s Champions League near-miss after getting f*cked over at Old Trafford on the final day had ruined them. That something fundamental had been broken.",
      "That slow start to the season came on the back of a difficult summer, where Villa were unable to do the business they wanted to do and were hamstrung to a large extent by their continued flirtation with the very edges of the PSR regulations. Even now, it still feels like something quite bad is being stored up for the future there.",
      "But never mind all that now. Because since those five games in which Villa managed three points and one measly goal, they’ve scored 24 in a further 11. And rather ludicrously won 10 of them.",
      "Their late winner against Arsenal prompted absolute cinema in the reactions of the Gunners, but it was also one of the most significant three-point swings of the season, one swing of Emi Buendia’s right foot turning a six-point gap to Arsenal to a three-point one.",
      "Villa have even since then passed up the traditional opportunity for such over-achieving clubs to chucklef*ck their way back out of a title race the moment they unexpectedly find themselves in it.",
      "A trip to West Ham in which they found themselves behind in the first minute and trailing again by half-time looked to be going entirely to that script, but no. The run continues. Where will it end? When will it end? What if it never ends? Is there a plan in place for that? Has anyone put a plan in place for that? Guys? GUYS?",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano says “keep an eye on Saudi interest” in Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Fernandes has been the bright spark in a miserable few years for Man Utd under Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim and has attracted a number of potential suitors.",
      "Interest from Saudi Arabia in the Portugal international has been well known for a couple of years with rumours of clubs from the Middle East proposing huge offers.",
      "And Fernandes revealed in an interview earlier this week that Man Utd “hurt” him with the Red Devils hierarchy ready to sell him in last summer.",
      "In an interview he revealed: “The president of Al Hilal spoke to me. He called me directly. Neves sent me a message saying he wanted to talk to me. They wanted him to play in the Club World Cup with Al Hilal. It was a love that started back in the Jorge Jesus days, he had already called me in 2023.”",
      "Fernandes added: “I can’t complain, I’m very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I’ll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "READ: What every club needs most in January: Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea want the same thing",
      "“My lifestyle will change, my children’s lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I’ll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players.",
      "“I could have left like many people do and said: ‘I want to leave, I don’t want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side.’ But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same.",
      "“But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything. The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision.",
      "“I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’",
      "“It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don’t value the club as much and don’t defend the club as much… that makes you sad.”",
      "Despite that, Romano has claimed that it’s “completely quiet” in terms of a potential move away in January but the Italian admits there is likely to be more interest in Fernandes in the summer.",
      "On the Man Utd midfielder, Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Bruno Fernandes released a very strong interview in recent days. Just to clarify one thing, the interview was recorded in November, even if it was released recently. That doesn’t change the importance of what Bruno said.",
      "“Bruno made it very clear that he had the feeling Manchester United were prepared to let him go last summer. He said he decided to stay because he loves the club and also because of the manager, Ruben Amorim.",
      "“Bruno explained that Amorim was the one who really wanted him to stay, while the club, in his feeling, were not desperate to keep him. Bruno believes United were ready to accept a proposal from Saudi Arabia.",
      "“This is important because Bruno himself stopped that move. Saudi clubs wanted him in 2023, in 2024 and again in 2025, and every time Bruno said no. He also didn’t close the door to a future move, saying that one day playing in Saudi Arabia could be an option.",
      "“What I can tell you is that for January, the situation is completely quiet. Nothing is imminent. For the summer transfer window, I would keep an eye on Saudi interest because they are expected to try again.",
      "“At the moment, Bruno is fully focused on Manchester United. But in the future, the Saudi option will return, and it will be up to Bruno and the club to decide.”",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has sat down with Rio Ferdinand for an in-depth chat, and here are the five best takeaways from this interview…",
      "Arsenal legend Ian Wright insists that he would take Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes at the Emirates Stadium if he left Old Trafford.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd have “made contact” in the last 48 hours over a deal to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s players ‘feel’ captain Bruno Fernandes is in his final season with the Premier League giants.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has issued an ‘ultimatum’ that is in no way an ultimatum, while an ‘unrecognisable’ Premier League star is entirely recognisable.",

      "“This is not about a permanent transfer. This is about a loan move to get regular game time. There is a World Cup coming and Mainoo has started zero Premier League games this season.",
      "“Napoli are pushing strongly. They see Mainoo as a crucial target and believe he would be tempted by the move, especially after the success of players like Scott McTominay there.",

      "The January transfer window is nearly upon us, which means the less-well-run Premier League clubs will be just starting to contemplate what they might need.",
      "For the slackers – and the rest – we’ve pointed towards their most urgent requirement next month…",
      "",
      "Arsenal came out of the summer with perhaps the deepest squad – certainly in terms of quality – in the Premier League, which has come in handy as injuries have mounted. Mikel Arteta says the Gunners are ‘open’ and ‘alert’ to strengthening in January which, if done right, could offer a timely boost as they enter the second half of their title chase.",
      "Where could they use an addition? A dynamic left-sided forward would be lovely, but not easy to source. At the back, it ought to be simpler to add some further cover since Arteta’s rearguard has been stretched by injuries, despite the depth at his disposal.",
      "",
      "Similarly, Villa could benefit from a January boost, especially if they remain among the title contenders, and what they do in January could tell us how serious they are about pushing the likes of Arsenal, City and Chelsea. The summer showed the restrictions Unai Emery and his staff are working under, but if Villa can source an attacker who can play off either flank, like Marcus Rashford last January, then the manager will be keen to do it. Unless over Christmas Jadon Sancho suddenly remembers he’s a footballer. Some cover for Ollie Watkins would be nice too.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "",
      "All the noise around Bournemouth’s window will focus on Antoine Semenyo. If they can get beyond the first fortnight, after which the forward’s £65million release clause becomes inactive, the Cherries will be better placed to rediscover their early-season form through the second half of the campaign. Tyler Adams’ injury is a concern because without the USA international, Andoni Iraola is light on natural defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "“Yes, I’m sure there’s going to be options that we will look at and look to do in January if we feel it’s right,” said Keith Andrews amid a recent shortage of forwards. The bench against Leeds featured only two attackers with not a Premier League minute between them. Not only have the goals dried up in recent weeks, so too have the shots, with their three lowest performances for xG coming in the last three matches during which they have mustered a total of four shots on target. Losing Dango Ouattara to AFCON won’t help.",
      "",
      "Given the Seagulls generally use the January window to get ahead of the game for the summer, they would have been looking to strengthen at right-back with Joel Veltman, 34 next month and their only recognised full-back on that side, set to be on his way at the end of the season. But Brighton are also looking light at centre-forward, especially in light of Stefanos Tzimas’s season-ending injury.",
      "",
      "On paper, Scott Parker’s squad actually looks quite balanced and there are few areas that immediately look in need of reinforcing. But what it lacks is proven Premier League quality across the board. The Clarets have been competitive but their recent poor run has highlighted weaknesses in moments at both ends. Parker is missing a regular centre-back, central midfielder and centre-forward through AFCON, which does little to suggest their woes will end in time for Christmas. Easier said than done, but an experienced centre-back is a must if they have any realistic hope of improving the second-worst defensive record in the league.",
      "",
      "Despite signing all the players, Chelsea still look light in a few areas. Enzo Maresca needs more from his centre-forwards, with the two bought in the summer, Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, struggling to get going, but a dominant centre-back is more of a priority. What would Palace accept to wave off Marc Guehi half a season early? And, perhaps more to the point, what might Guehi accept to pass up the chance to pick his club in the summer?",
      "",
      "Oliver Glasner wants Palace to use the winter window to ‘correct what we missed in the summer’, with a wide forward and a right wing-back towards the top of his list. Ismaila Sarr’s injury and AFCON call-up gives Glasner the perfect opportunity to highlight how light they are on attacking width, especially on the left.",
      "READ: Five players who will benefit from AFCON absences: Chiesa, Mainoo and more",
      "",
      "David Moyes could use another forward, though Everton should probably stop trying to buy strikers until they have sussed how to sign a good one. The Toffees are also light in both full-back positions, with the right more of a priority than the left. Seamus Coleman, at 37, remains Moyes’ preferred option but the Irishman, inevitably, is creaking, meaning Jake O’Brien and James Garner have had to move across and back from central defence and midfield respectively.",
      "Garner has been very impressive, which might tempt the Toffees to wait until the summer, but the ex-Man Utd midfielder also deserves a chance to show what he can do in his preferred position.",

      "Marco Silva never looks happy but the manager’s mug will be even grumpier if Fulham don’t furnish his squad with reinforcements next month. Silva is particularly light on centre-forwards, with Raul Jiminez carrying the load singlehandedly while Rodrigo Muniz is hamstrung. A midfielder would be nice too.",
      "",
      "Although more pace in the forward line would be ideal, the urgency for a centre-forward isn’t perhaps as great as it was following Daniel Farke’s switch of formation, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha pairing up to great effect. Can Farke rely on both stay fit? He might have to gamble if he wants more creativity behind. Of course, it might not be one or the other, but with Leeds, it probably is.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo might be hogging much of the attention, especially while doubts remain over Mo Salah’s willingness to be a team player, but Liverpool’s most dire need is at the centre of their defence. They should have moved more decisively for Marc Guehi in the summer instead of waiting until the final day. They – like Chelsea – have an opportunity to pay for the Palace defender now rather than wait in line when he goes free in the summer. This time, they should grasp it.",
      "",
      "If there is any truth in the reports that Savinho and Oscar Bobb are among the three players most likely to be sold to fund some January strengthening, then Pep Guardiola will be wanting a winger, especially with Jeremy Doku facing a spell on the sidelines. There’s a lad at Bournemouth available for a fair price. A midfielder would be useful too if Rodri’s injuries are likely to persist.",
      "",
      "United can flutter their eyelashes at Semenyo as much as they like but they should be banned from signing anyone until they have recruited a mobile midfielder. Which, no doubt, they will tell us is impossible in January.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe is currently down to two fit senior centre-backs and although injury issues may ease, there is a strong case for adding more quality into the backline. Tino Livramento’s injury on Wednesday night is a huge concern as they could be short at right-back too. They could also use some creativity in attack, which is likely to be harder to source in January.",

      "Forest are flying right now but Sean Dyche is pushing for reinforcements in his first transfer window in charge, especially while they combine domestic and European commitments. A midfielder is said to be highest on Dyche’s wishlist, which makes sense with Ryan Yates sidelined and Douglas Luiz not pulling up trees at Forest. Ibrahim Sangare will be a miss too during AFCON. Dyche would doubtless like a centre-back, not just because he loves centre-backs, but Forest are short on depth in the middle of their back four.",
      "",
      "Firstly, they need all their half-dozen players back sharpish from AFCON. Then, you could understand the temptation to do very little given the success of their summer activity. But Sunderland – even if there are no gaping holes in a squad that, if anything, needs thinning out – have an opportunity here to strengthen from a position of maximum authority, especially if they have eyes on Europe. That will almost certainly be beyond them if Granit Xhaka, 33, or Noah Sadiki break down.",

      "“Of course, we will definitely be in the market. No doubt about that,” Thomas Frank has said, before showing he still doesn’t really know Spurs at all: “We want them as early as possible.” Frank has tried multiple options on the left following Son Heung-min’s departure. None have worked. Semenyo would be a very fine addition but Spurs will almost certainly spend most of the month fruitlessly chasing the Bournemouth winger before hurriedly signing an inferior alternative. A functioning football club would also seek some cover at full-back too.",
      "",
      "It wouldn’t be a window without West Ham being in the market for a striker. In this one, they will probably pack off Niclas Fullkrug, who could fall up to the actual AC Milan in a Serie A title race, leaving Nuno woefully light and banking on the robustness of Callum Wilson. Nuno needs a pacey forward with a goal threat. He’ll probably get Michail Antonio.",
      "",
      "Not to sound glib, but Wolves need quality across the board: up front, in midfield, at the back, and maybe in goal too. So poor was their summer, it makes the winter window almost irrelevant, since convincing players to sign for a club on their way to being the Premier League’s worst ever is a desperately tough sell. But if there’s one thing Jeff Shi and his cronies can do, it’s sell…",

      "Bruno Fernandes believes he can still win trophies with Manchester United, despite a difficult period for the club; on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the captain also discussed his leadership and how Man Utd has changed since he arrived in January 2020",
      "Thursday 18 December 2025 18:04, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has discussed his loyalty to Manchester United, saying he believes the club can return to former glories and win multiple trophies.",
      "The Man Utd captain appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, which was recorded before his explosive interview with Portuguese TV channel Canal 11 was published, and also revealed he stayed at the club despite two offers to leave.",
      "Fernandes told Canal 11 he was \"hurt\" that the club were open to offloading him to Saudi Arabia during the summer.",
      "But speaking to Ferdinand, the midfielder says the club can win regular silverware, and he would not have stayed as long as he has if he did not believe it was possible.",
      "Fernandes said: \"Loyalty in football before was like [Francesco] Totti at Rome, [Ryan] Giggs at United, [Paolo] Maldini at Milan, so when I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was in the toughest periods and I could have left two times.",
      "\"The club said 'no, we need you' and I said 'OK, you gave me something, I will give you something'. The time at the club has not been as I wanted because I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club was still very important and I'm not taking anything away from other players that were here. When we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I hope everyone at the club is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"I'm very aware that I could have gone a different path and probably won more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. Nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.",
      "\"When I speak about going and winning trophies, I stayed here because I think I still can win trophies here. I wouldn't have stayed here if the club hasn't told me our aim is still to be the highest we can be, get back to winning trophies, get back to be the club we were before.",
      "\"If that was not the aim then yes, I wouldn't have stayed here, but because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be and where I want the club to be, that's why I came to the club in the first place. If I can help to get back there, that's all I want to do.\"",
      "Fernandes is often the focal point of any Man Utd performance, whether that is having a hand in the goals or his passionate on-field reactions.",
      "That has often been the case since his arrival at Old Trafford in January 2020, with Fernandes also offering an insight into how his team-mates help him maintain the club's standards.",
      "He said: \"As a captain, obviously you're going to get more attention, stick and everything. But that comes with the club also - it's not just by the armband.",
      "\"I haven't changed the way I was for the way I'm now because I've got the armband. When Erik [Ten Hag] chose me to be the captain, he knew what type of captain I was. I know I lead by example, because I do everything is needed to do on the training pitch. I train as hard as I can.",
      "\"I can moan as much as people think, but I run more than I moan - I'm pretty sure of that. So I think I'm still an example of the way things have to be done for the club. The standard.",
      "\"Then I think I treat everyone as I would like to be treated and when I talk about everyone, I don't see anyone below me. For me, everyone's in the same level. It could be me, it could be the people that serve us at the restaurant, the chefs, the nutritionists, the staff.",
      "\"No one is below and no one is above me. Obviously, apart from the bosses, the manager and the other ones that are above the managers, but still, the managers, they say 'guys, I'm in the same level as you, I just have more responsibility and I have to take the decisions. That's where I'm above you'.",
      "\"And as a captain, I have sometimes to make decisions on things. But we have a leadership group that is me, Harry [Maguire], Licha [Lisandro Martinez], Tom [Heaton], [Noussair] Mazroui and Diogo [Dalot].",
      "\"We then add players in the situation that are not in the leadership group, like Casemiro and Luke Shaw, because we also want players with big responsibilities to have a say.",
      "\"From that six [of the leadership group], the message has to be clear for everyone else. We have to become a little bit of a bigger personality than the other ones, because we need to make the rules clear for everyone.",
      "\"But that's not just me, it's the leadership group that has to put a stamp in place, like, 'guys, this is what we're going to do and mandatory for us. This is the way, the path and what we have to have to play at this club'.\"",
      "There has been plenty of change at Man Utd in the almost six years since Fernandes joined. He has played under six managers - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and currently, Ruben Amorim, on a permanent basis, with interim spells for Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "There has been silverware, including the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, as well as success - and a lack thereof - in Europe.",
      "On what has changed since he first walked into the dressing room in 2020, Fernandes said: \"There were a lot of experienced players. You had David [De Gea], Nema [Nemanja Matic], Juan [Mata].",
      "\"Paul [Pogba] was already a big player. Jesse [Lingard] was a big player at the time already, you had Rashy [Marcus Rashford]. Then we'd come with a mix of youngest.",
      "\"I think everything has changed in the world of football in the last, not just five years, but also the years I've been in football. Nowadays, the young ones put the music [on] in the dressing room.",
      "\"But I really like the mix we have in the dressing room [now] because it makes me feel very young, the energy they have, the way we involve everyone together, and not looking at age difference, who's been here longer, who's been here less.",
      "\"We don't have that thing of who's more important, who's less important... The energy is very good.\"",

      "Friday 19 December 2025 09:04, UK",
      "He may be in his third season at Old Trafford, but it finally seems that Manchester United fans are starting to see the best of Mason Mount.",
      "Question marks were raised when Erik ten Hag paid £55 million for the then-maligned Chelsea star, especially given his fitness concerns and lack of obvious role in the Dutchman's system.",
      "After early struggles, he seems to have found his feet under Ruben Amorim. Earmarked as an early favourite of the Portuguese, he currently finds himself on his most consistent run in the team at the Theatre of Dreams, already equalling his previous best seasonal goals tally at the club.",
      "For many, Mount has become a focal point in how Amorim wants his United side to play. They clearly get better results when he is in the team - the Red Devils have lost just once in the Premier League when he starts, compared to three times when he doesn't. But the numbers show that doesn't necessarily equate to better performances.",
      "Amorim has often insisted that it doesn't matter in what formation his teams line up in. What matters is the finer details as to how the players operate within it.",
      "\"The most important thing is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past. We need time, but we have to win time. To win time is to win games. But the most important thing is identity,\" were his exact words when he was first hired in November 2024.",
      "While he hasn't spoken out on the specifics of what those principles are, history shows that Amorim's teams focus on a possession-based style built around shorter passes and a high defensive line that enables an assertive pressing approach.",
      "On the surface, that sounds like a way of playing that would suit Mount's strengths. Yet when he is in the team, those characteristics seem to falter.",
      "It has been a 50/50 between games started and games where the Englishman has either come off the bench or not featured. When he starts, United not only pick up more points, but they score more goals (2.25 per game vs 1.50) and are far more efficient when finishing their 'big' chances (1.38 goals vs 0.75).",
      "That points towards a positive impact, which can't be denied. Look further though, and you see that with Mount in the team, United tend to move further away from the fundamentals associated with Amorim.",
      "Though the number of chances created when Mount starts is significantly higher, the number of 'big chances' is lower, suggesting that United have far more low xG efforts built up in these games, rather than creating clearer goalscoring opportunities more frequently.",
      "Some of this lack of higher-quality chances can perhaps be attributed to the fact that there is also a major shift towards a more direct style of play when Mount starts compared to when he doesn't.",
      "With him in the team, United average more long passes. They also attempt 10 per cent fewer passes in the final third and pull off 17 per cent less.",
      "Perhaps most surprisingly, in games where Mount starts, United win possession back in their attacking third less too. Given that the narrative is that Mount's energy aids United in the press, you'd expect the opposite to be the case.",
      "That is not to say that Mount is the sole reason for the drop-offs.",
      "As an individual, he ranks sixth in the team in chances created, fourth in final third passes attempted and completed, only ninth in long passes and second in possession won in the attacking third among the squad.",
      "By those metrics, you can see that he is doing what you would expect him to do based on Amorim's requirements. Yet, as a collective, United are moving away from Amorim's principles more often when Mount is in the team.",
      "Is that a criticism? If anything, it's the opposite. Much has been said of Amorim's reluctance to adapt his way of playing in order to find success, but the data proves that there is flexibility to be played with.",
      "It is more interesting though that a player who was believed to be the epitome of what Amorim needed from his squad has highlighted that his success is coming when he steers away from the methodology that he was so steadfast in bringing to Old Trafford.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League card and tips up a 13/1 weekend treble with Sky Bet.",
      "Newcastle's injury crisis has had a huge influence on this market where Chelsea are now favourites at 29/20 with Sky Bet. It's a price which looks skinny to me but the team news angle still is a betting proposition as whoever fills in at right-back for Newcastle is going to be under serious pressure if Alejandro Garnacho starts.",
      "All signs suggest Lewis Miley is set to deputise on that side and at 5/1 with Sky Bet to be booked, that's a price that simply doesn't marry up with the task he's facing. When Garnacho is on song, he is the definition of a stress test for defenders.",
      "When at Manchester United, since the start of the 23/24 Premier League season, Garnacho drew a card every 206 minutes. That's elite territory for an attacker and it's not accidental data. He plays on the edge, he attacks defenders with pace and he's very theatrical under contact.",
      "Burnley going away from home still carry that old narrative of blunt, toothless and just happy to compete. But when you hone in on Bournemouth's defensive numbers of late, this trip to the south coast looks far more open than the prices suggest.",
      "Andoni Iraola's men have conceded 21 goals in their last nine games, and that isn't coming from freak results or red-card chaos. It's a structural issue, one that revolves around the centre-backs being far too exposed and unable to defend with the same one-to-one authority as Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Burnley to score over 1.5 goals is 100/30 with Sky Bet.",
      "I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 36 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 17 games otherwise. Sunderland are fifth in the long passes metric of all Premier League teams this season and are likely to undertake a style of play that causes Brighton issues.",
      "The away team are 6/5 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "A bet that stands out here at the prices is Manchester City to win the cards race at 7/2 with Sky Bet, meaning we need City to be shown more cards than West Ham to land the pot.",
      "Despite the bulky price, this bet has landed in eight of City's last 13 games in all competitions, which points to them carrying a cynical edge to their game of late. This includes in a similar home game against Leeds where they won the card race 4-1 despite being the outsiders in the market.",
      "Across their last eight games, West Ham have seen the opponents average two cards per game with the threat of Jarrod Bowen and Crysensio Summerville triggering some card-worthy action from defenders.",
      "Wolves top the charts this season for fouls committed and Matt Doherty really got into the spirit of things on his return at Arsenal, making a whopping five fouls.",
      "He will be tasked with keeping Kevin Schade quiet - a player that leads the way for fouls drawn this season for Brentford at 1.62 per 90. This makes Doherty's price to make two or more fouls at 5/4 with Sky Bet very appealing.",
      "Of Arne Slot's last 17 wins away from home at Liverpool, 12 of those have seen under 3.5 goals too. That is a relevant trend when assessing the best way to back a pro-Liverpool angle in this fixture.",
      "We all know about Tottenham's issues in forward areas and them being able to create quality chances. All their key attacking metrics have the look of a team that should be battling relegation: 9.6 shots per game, 3.3 shots on target per game, 1.0 expected goals per 90 and 1.8 big chances created per game. It's an underlying attacking process which is the fourth-worst in the Premier League. Another blank may follow here.",
      "You can get 21/10 with Sky Bet on Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals - a nice boost on the Evens for a Liverpool win.",
      "Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/5 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.7 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 15 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too, including last weekend against Wolves where they delivered the odds in dramatic fashion.",
      "With Everton certainly missing Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye and potentially without Keinan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish, David Moyes is going to have to go back to basics for a result. Defend deep, get the crowd involved and try to cause problems from set pieces. That's unlikely to be enough to work against this Arsenal machine.",
      "This is a fixture where the league table tells you very little, but the calendar tells you everything. At full throttle, with both teams fresh and raring to go, Palace have shown they are the better team.",
      "However, three games in six days, different opponents, different tactical demands and now a trip to Elland Road - one of the most physically demanding environments in English football - tips the scales firmly in Leeds' favour.",
      "Palace's schedule is unique and brutal. And what we've seen from Daniel Farke's team in recent weeks is that they make games an intense battle.",
      "This isn't a bet against Palace's quality. It's a bet against the schedule they're trapped in. Leeds at 8/5 with Sky Bet is best bet of the weekend material.",
      "This one is primed for chaos.",
      "Both teams rank inside the top four for xG created per 90 when trailing in a match. It's where Villa are actually thriving when it comes to the data.",
      "What this tells us is that if the scoreline changes early, the match won't settle. It'll stretch, open up, and turn into an end-to-end spectacle with two dangerous attacks.",
      "Villa have taken 15 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League side. That's not luck. That's mentality, style and intent.",
      "When they fall behind, they double down on attacking patterns rather than protecting themselves. At Villa Park, that philosophy is heightened, too. Against a Manchester United side that have averaged 3.5 total goals per game this season and one that also thrives in broken, transitional games, that points towards this being a potential banger.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is a winner in waiting.",
      "Marco Silva looked crestfallen watching Fulham being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek.",

      "Manchester United will only consider selling Kobbie Mainoo in January if they receive an exceptional offer.",
      "The club do not want to sell, and are equally reluctant to see him leave on loan.",
      "A string of Premier League clubs are interested in him, but only a handful could afford a permanent deal.",
      "What is impossible to predict, however, is how the player himself might react - and how that might impact the club's decision-making, if Mainoo remains on the fringes of the first team.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and his brother posed for photographs at Old Trafford on Monday night wearing a t-shirt which read \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", which has since gone viral on social media.",
      "There were loud cheers from the home support when the young midfielder came on against Bournemouth with half an hour to go.",
      "Mainoo is clearly still very popular with United fans, and he is clearly frustrated by the lack of game time, struggling to adjust to a fall from grace since he was a regular under Erik ten Hag and a starter at the heart of the England midfield for last summer's European Championship final in Berlin.",
      "Mainoo won the last of his 10 England caps in September 2024 and, ahead of next summer's World Cup, is yet to feature under new England head coach Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Apart from playing the whole of the second half against Burnley back in August, he hasn't featured for more than half an hour in any Premier League for United game since. His only 90-minute outing came in the ill-fated defeat at Grimsby Town, which saw United dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round.",
      "But Amorim has been very clear that he doesn't doubt Mainoo's talent - rather, the head coach says it is a straight choice right now between him and the United captain.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders,\" Amorim said. \"We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "When asked if he rates Mainoo highly, Amorim added: \"Of course. Like everyone else.\"",
      "It makes no financial sense for United's hierarchy to send Mainoo out on loan.",
      "Because of his route through the United age-groups he is on a relatively modest wage compared to other players in the first team, and so there is little incentive to have his salary covered by another team.",
      "Furthermore, if he were to go on loan next month, United would have to replace him to provide extra cover in their midfield for the remainder of the season. That is likely to mean a bigger bill to bring in a new player who would be less familiar than Mainoo with the United environment.",
      "Meanwhile, Roy Keane has urged Mainoo to fight for his place at Manchester United.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, former United captain Keane said: \"Are you telling me he can't sit there for another six months?",
      "\"He might think the manager might be gone in the summer, one or two of the senior players might be gone.",
      "\"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if you're not getting a chance, we've all had to do it at different levels.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is look at a manager and go 'I'll prove you wrong'.",
      "\"Every day is your challenge to prove to the manager and when that manager is picking the team I'm going to train like a beast and when you're writing that team [as a manager] you're going to go, 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that… we shouldn't even be giving his brother the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.",
      "\"The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong,\" Keane added when talking about Mainoo being in competition with Fernandes for a place in Amorim's starting XI.",
      "\"Bruno might get injured. There was a chat about Bruno leaving in the summer. Bruno might leave next summer, so you bide your time as a young player.",
      "\"I've no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team.",
      "\"Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in ahead of Bruno' [your mindset should be], 'I'm going to prove you wrong'.\""

      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Joe Watson",
      "Thursday 18 December 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Premier League players taking part in AFCON 2025 departed to join up with their national teams this week ahead of the tournament opener on Sunday, when hosts Morocco face Comoros.",
      "The players called up could be absent for over a month, with the final of the tournament scheduled for January 18. So which Premier League clubs will be the most and least impacted?",
      "Between the Lines drills into the numbers and looks at the challenge facing some clubs to adapt, including Manchester United.",
      "A total of 32 Premier League players are taking part in the tournament, representing 14 of the 24 competing nations.",
      "As shown in the graphic below, Sunderland are losing the most players with six. Their total is double that of any other Premier League club and the highest by any club across Europe's major leagues.",
      "It includes two players who have played important roles defensively in holding midfielder Noah Sadiki and left-back Reinildo.",
      "The pair have helped the Black Cats keep five clean sheets so far this season in the Premier League, the latest coming in Sunday's Wear-Tyne derby, during which they played the full 90 minutes.",
      "Manchester United are losing three players in Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, as are Fulham, in Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey and Samuel Chukwuemeze, and Burnley, in Lyle Foster, Hannibal Mejbri and Axel Tuanzebe.",
      "Seven clubs are losing two players, including Manchester City, in Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri, with a further three clubs losing one player, including Liverpool in Mohamed Salah, who has departed having impressed off the bench against Brighton.",
      "Leaders Arsenal are one of six Premier League clubs not losing any players to the tournament.",
      "Losing players is one thing, losing important players is another.",
      "In terms of minutes played by players taking part in AFCON, Sunderland again come out as the worst-hit.",
      "Their six players called up to the tournament have played a combined 4,412 minutes in the Premier League this season. Sadiki and Reinildo account for around half that total, but Chemsdine Talbi and Bertrand Traore have also featured regularly.",
      "Fulham are next on the list in second, narrowly ahead of Manchester United in third, as both teams lose players with just over 3,000 Premier League minutes played.",
      "For the Cottagers, the biggest losses, in terms of minutes played, are Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey, both of whom represent Nigeria. For United, it's Cameroon's Mbeumo and Ivory Coast's Amad.",
      "Everton and West Ham are next in the rankings, with Ndiaye, Idrissa Gueye, Malick Diouf and Aaron Wan-Bissaka all regular starters who have played more than 1,000 Premier League minutes this season.",
      "While Sunderland will have to cope without crucial defensive players, other clubs will have to manage without vital attackers.",
      "Manchester United and Fulham are losing 11 goal involvements respectively with the departures of Mbeumo, Amad, Iwobi and Samuel Chukwueze.",
      "Everton are next, losing eight, with six of them having come from Ndiaye, while Salah's involvement means Liverpool are losing seven, with the Egypt international having added his latest goal involvement with his assist off the bench in his last appearance before the tournament against Brighton.",
      "The clubs most impacted by AFCON have of course had time to prepare knowing which of their players would likely feature at the tournament well in advance.",
      "In Manchester United's case, did Monday's meeting with Bournemouth at Old Trafford hint at Amorim's plans?",
      "He is losing two players key to his preferred system in Amad and Mbeumo, who occupy the right wing-back and right-sided No 10 spots respectively in his 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "But the 4-4 draw with Andoni Iraola's side, during which Amad and Mbeumo made their final appearances before the tournament, saw an unprecedented change of shape from the head coach.",
      "For the first time at United, Amorim switched from a back three to a back four, a significant tactical adjustment which may be a response to losing Amad and Mbeumo for a busy run of fixtures.",
      "How Amorim adapts is just one of many questions as Premier League clubs contend with their AFCON absentees.",
      "Can Sunderland maintain their brilliant start?",
      "Will Salah's prolonged absence help or hinder Liverpool?",
      "And could Arsenal capitalise on having no players involved?",
      "We explain why Bruno Fernandes is this season's biggest Premier League game-changer - and why nobody can match Mohamed Salah over the last 15 years.",

      "Ruben Amorim got Manchester United fans back onside with tactical flexibility against Bournemouth, but AFCON absences raise new problems, writes Dan Khan...",
      "As I go for walks around Manchester I constantly bump into United fans and we always end up chatting about how they feel their club is doing.",
      "After drab, lacklustre performances against Everton and West Ham, one gentleman in my barbers last week - a season ticket holder in the Stretford End - told me he just wants to see United 'go for it' and put on a performance. That's all.",
      "Despite the draw against Bournemouth extending their run of form to just two wins from seven, the overall performance saw most fans leave Old Trafford satisfied with the display they had witnessed.",
      "You can look at the metrics like xG and shot count to explain why United could have had a hatful in the first half, but it was not just that which left their supporters content.",
      "It was Leny Yoro at right-back, looking revitalised on his return to the side, showing aggression and pressing high.",
      "Ayden Heaven and Luke Shaw, a centre-back duo I did not think I would ever write, also echoed that aggression with Mason Mount looking even more like the player United signed from Chelsea in July 2023.",
      "This was the difference: the intent from Amorim's team. This is what the home fans responded to and what Amorim had been asking from his players. To show that aggression, win their duels and give the fans at Old Trafford a show and they duly obliged despite the disappointment at sharing the points in the end.",
      "It is impossible to gloss over the ease which some of Bournemouth's goals were scored but perhaps context is required as well to explain United's defensive woes in recent weeks.",
      "Amorim told us after the game he does not believe significant investment is required in defence, and that he has the characteristics among his players to improve and defend better as a team.",
      "It is easy to forget United were without their best defender this season, Matthijs de Ligt, and two other potential starters in Harry Maguire and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Lisandro Martinez made another cameo off the bench but looked understandably rusty after returning from a knee injury that kept him out since February.",
      "With the defensive issues highlighted, it is also important to focus on an area which was of utmost urgency to improve from last season: scoring goals.",
      "Last season, United were among the division's lowest scorers and, of course, spent hundreds of millions of pounds to address that through signing Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But even with that added fire power the new front three have started just three Premier League games together due to untimely injuries to Cunha and Sesko.",
      "All things considered, if had you said at this point United would find themselves sixth, two points off a top four spot and the second-highest scorers in the division, you would have thought not is all bad for a team still working itself out.",
      "Despite positives about what could be going forward, I also cannot help but have a feeling of frustration for Amorim.",
      "Not that he needs empathy after the Bournemouth performance or result, not because he showed he can be flexible in his tactical system when often accused of the opposite, and certainly not because United were the better team but once again failed to see out a lead.",
      "I feel frustration for Amorim because just as we have finally seen his side put on their best attacking and entertaining home performance of his reign, other than maybe against Brighton this season, he now waves off two of his star attacking players, Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, as they depart for AFCON.",
      "Neither we nor Amorim will see a United team with that pace or threat of attack again for at least a month, until both players return.",
      "Amorim will welcome Sesko's return to the matchday squad and he could easily slot into Mbeumo's position alongside Cunha, but he has a huge dilemma on how to balance the right-hand side, which looked so effective against Bournemouth with the pace and combination play of Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "How does he fill that hole? There is no straightforward answer.",
      "The immediate thought is that if Yoro continues at right back, Diogo Dalot may be the most natural to slot in ahead of him as a makeshift winger with Patrick Dorgu on the left of defence - but United have often looked blunt in attack when both have started this season.",
      "Potential solutions may present themselves, perhaps. Kobbie Mainoo could get more game time if Bruno Fernandes is shifted upfield, or he could perhaps even find himself on the right of a narrow diamond in midfield.",
      "Mainoo has yet to start a league game this season but did enjoy a 30-minute cameo against Bournemouth and could be in line to replace the suspended Casemiro against Aston Villa.",
      "The Brazilian's absence adds another headache, robbing Amorim of his midfield enforcer against such an in-form Villa side. There will also be a focus from fans about Amorim utilising Academy products.",
      "The likes of Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher will more than likely find themselves on the bench in the coming weeks but is Amorim comfortable enough to turn to them? So far, the answer has been no.",

      "Between the Lines returns with a data-led look at the Premier League's game-changing players; Mohamed Salah's numbers are unmatched since 2010/11 but Bruno Fernandes has made the biggest contribution to his team this season",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Wednesday 17 December 2025 15:56, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes showed his importance to Manchester United yet again as he produced a goal and assist during a man-of-the-match performance in their 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.",
      "In an interview published after the game, he then accused the club's hierarchy of trying to cash in on him during the summer, saying the episode had left him \"hurt\" and \"sad\".",
      "But just how vital is he to Man Utd? And where does he rank among the Premier League's biggest game-changers?",
      "Between the Lines reveals which players' goals and assists have won their clubs the most points, both this season and historically - and Fernandes and Mohamed Salah, another player under the microscope lately, feature prominently.",
      "Fernandes comes out top for this season as he continues to show his value even in another tough campaign for Manchester United.",
      "His four goals and six assists have won Ruben Amorim's side a whopping 14 points.",
      "The Bournemouth game was the latest example, with his goal involvements proving the difference between a loss and a draw. He won Manchester United two and three points respectively in their recent wins over Wolves and Crystal Palace too.",
      "As shown in the graphic below, Fernandes has made result-altering goal involvements in eight Premier League games this season.",
      "Morgan Rogers sits second in the list with goal involvements worth 12 points to third-placed Aston Villa, a total which includes the three points won by his double against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "The England international has only contributed a combined eight goals and assists for Unai Emery's side in the Premier League but, with the exception of his assist in the 3-1 win over Fulham in September, all of them have been game-altering.",
      "His total puts him two points ahead of Erling Haaland. The Manchester City striker has nearly twice as many goal involvements as any other Premier League player this season, with 17 goals and three assists, but only seven have directly changed results.",
      "Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is tied with Haaland on 10 points won after his goal helped Bournemouth grab a point at Old Trafford on Monday, with Everton's Jack Grealish and Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike next on nine.",
      "Another way to measure player influence is to look at whose goal involvements have earned the highest proportion of their team's points. Again, it's Fernandes who sits top of the pile this season.",
      "The 31-year-old's goals and assists have won more than half of Manchester United's 26 points after 16 games.",
      "Semenyo is second, while Brentford striker Igor Thiago ranks third, his 11 goals having won 40 per cent of the side's 20 points.",
      "Grealish is just behind him on 38 per cent, with all of his six goal involvements this season having directly impacted Everton's results.",
      "Rogers, Ekitike, Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes, Sunderland's Granit Xhaka, West Ham's Callum Wilson and Brighton striker Danny Welbeck make up the rest of the top 10.",
      "So, Fernandes leads the way this season, but when factoring previous seasons, going back as far as 2010/11, it's Salah who comes out on top as the Premier League's biggest game-changer, despite his much-discussed recent dip in form.",
      "Salah's 280 Premier League goal involvements have been worth 177 points, putting him just ahead of Harry Kane on 173 points and highlighting the size of his contribution to Liverpool following his short spell at Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Former Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has the third-highest total for points won by goal involvements, with 127, while Kane's former Spurs team-mate Heung-Min Son is fourth on 106 and Manchester City legend Sergio Aguero is fifth on 104.",
      "Salah, in addition to having the highest total, boasts the highest percentage of a team's points won by goal involvements in a single season since 2010/11, with his 45.2 per cent last term just ahead of Robin van Persie's 42.7 per cent for Manchester United in 2012/13.",
      "Salah's output has of course dipped this season. He only has four goals and three assists in 14 Premier League appearances so far.",
      "But it is worth noting, as shown below, that those goal involvements have still won 23 per cent of Liverpool's points total, a higher proportion than in three of his previous campaigns at the club.",
      "So was he right to suggest he has been unfairly singled out during a difficult campaign for everyone at the club? The numbers suggest he has still made a useful contribution.",
      "But nobody can match that of Fernandes this season.",
      "Ninety-three injuries in 18 months? We dissected Arsenal's continued injury issues in last week's edition and the knock-on effects of losing players in the same positions.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed his hurt and sadness over feeling like Man Utd were ready to move him on in the summer when Al Hilal were ready to pay £100m to sign him after turning down a move to another club the season before, where he says he would have won 'many trophies'",
      "Wednesday 17 December 2025 08:39, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has claimed Manchester United bosses wanted to cash in on him in the summer but lacked the courage to defy Ruben Amorim.",
      "The United captain, who could have joined Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal for £100m, said he was \"hurt\" and \"sad\" about how the situation had been handled in an interview with Portuguese TV station Canal 11.",
      "Fernandes said in October that United's hierarchy told him they would not stand in his way if he wished to leave but that they wanted to keep him.",
      "However, the 31-year-old, who has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year, struck a very different tone in this interview which was recorded in November.",
      "\"I decided not to go [to Saudi Arabia], not only for family reasons, but because I genuinely liked the club,\" Fernandes said.",
      "\"From the club I felt, 'if you go it's not that bad for us'. It hurts me a bit. More than hurting, makes me sad, I'm a player who has nothing to point to, I'm always available, I always give the best of me.\"",
      "\"Jason [Wilcox], like Omar [Berrada], said 'we won't say no but we want you to stay at the club. If you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us because obviously it's massive money'.\"",
      "Amorim publicly said in the summer when Fernandes was weighing up his future that he hoped the midfielder would stay.",
      "Fernandes believes there was an unwillingness from those above Amorim to challenge the head coach.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go [away],\" Fernandes added.",
      "\"I told the directors that, I don't think they had the courage to make that decision because the coach wanted me. But if I said I wanted to leave, even though the coach wanted me to stay, the club would let me.\"",
      "\"Al Hilal are not guaranteed to make another move for Bruno Fernandes next summer, especially because the club is about to be bought by billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.",
      "\"Al Hilal are currently majority owned by the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.",
      "\"Prince Alwaleed's takeover, which could value the club at up to 2 billion Saudi Riyals [£397.2m], would see one of Saudi Arabia's biggest clubs being privately owned for the first time.",
      "\"Al Hilal are expected to spend big under new ownership in the summer but Fernandes will be 32 in September and Saudi clubs have been targeting younger players.\"",
      "Fernandes has been United's best player in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but the offer of £100m for a player turning 31 was viewed by many as too good to turn down.",
      "The Portugal international was frustrated that he perceived this to be the view from within the club after he had stuck with United through so many lows despite having the chance to win silverware elsewhere.",
      "Fernandes also revealed he could have left to join another club the season before Saudi came in for him.",
      "\"I was valued, what values me most has to be my club, although I feel, lately, that I'm a little on the tightrope. Because in England a player reaches 30 and they think he has to remodel.",
      "\"The issue of loyalty is not as well-regarded as it used to be. I could have left in this market, I was going to earn a lot more money, a season ago I was going to leave, I was going to win many trophies this season.\"",
