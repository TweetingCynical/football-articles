      "Manchester United target Bryan Mbeumo will bring some much-needed work rate and discipline if Brentford boss Thomas Frank's comments are anything to go by. The Danish head coach has made it clear in his past praise that Ruben Amorim would be gaining an exemplary professional at Old Trafford.",
      "The French-born forward made the switch to London in 2019, with the Bees signing him for a then-club record fee of £5.8million. Mbeumo hit the ground running, scoring 16 goals in his first campaign as they were thwarted in the Championship play-off final by Fulham.",
      "Redemption would be had 12 months later when Brentford were promoted to the Premier League by way of the play-offs, and the winger came on leaps and bounds in the top flight, going from wing-back to talismanic winger.",
      "With marksman Ivan Toney departing ahead of the 2024/25 season, Mbeumo stepped up to assume a starring role, and his 20 Premier League goals have caused a string of suitors to surround him as the summer window opens.",
      "It has been suggested that the Red Devils are the party who have taken Mbeumo's fancy, and his manager Frank has previously opened up about the impressive work rate and commitment that will be arriving at Old Trafford should a deal be completed.",
      "According to The Athletic, Mbeumo has decided that United are the team he wishes to join this summer, with Arsenal, Newcastle and Tottenham all interested. Talks are now expected to open between Brentford and the Red Devils, as the 25-year-old looks set to bring his goal-scoring prowess to Manchester should he get his way.",
      "Back in 2023, when Mbeumo was sidelined with an ankle injury, boss Frank shed some light on the winger's standing within his squad, admitting his efforts would be a big miss.",
      "\"[Mbeumo] must be number two after Ivan [Toney] in terms of goals and assists, which is key,\" said Frank. \"His work rate for the team is incredible.",
      "\"You don't see many wingers who work so hard and mean so much. He's become the key man saying, 'Give me the ball, I'll take this.' Who will that man be now? We'll find out in the next weeks.\"",
      "Praise for Mbeumo has long been offered up by the Danish manager, who, the year prior, with Brentford still in their Premier League infancy, lauded the forward's brilliance.",
      "\"It's brilliant, I must say,\" admitted Frank, speaking after a Mbeumo hat-trick gave his side a 4-1 FA Cup win away at Port Vale. \"He's been brilliant for us this year in the Premier League.",
      "\"He came back from a minor injury. We knew that he wanted to play ready for Tuesday. And three quality finishes, very composed. We know that these FA Cup games are very difficult.",
      "\"Second half we started bad, they played a tiny bit more direct. They put us a little bit under pressure, but in the end we, and especially Bryan Mbeumo, showed our quality.\"",

      "Manchester United can’t lose amid the Bruno Fernandes transfer saga, according to Gary Neville. The Portuguese playmaker’s future has been up in the air since he conceded after the Europa League final defeat to Spurs that he could be offloaded this summer, despite being United's standout player during an abject campaign.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have been pushing to sign Fernandes ahead of the Club World Cup. The playmaker was reportedly seriously considering accepting a £700,000 per week deal. Al-Hilal were also said to be prepared to pay up to £100million for the 30-year-old, cash that could have been ploughed into the much-needed revamp of the squad.",
      "However, according to fresh reports, Fernandes has rejected Al-Hilal’s interest and looks set to remain at Old Trafford, having consulted with his family.",
      "Neville said: “I’m torn on this one because if the £100million fee is right and United get that, I don’t think it’s a bad fee. In fact, I think it’s a great fee for someone at that age. United have had great years out of him. But I also think, if he stays, [he’s saying] ‘No, I want fight this out and turn it around’. I also think that’s a great thing as well.",
      "“So I’m 50-50 in what I think about it. The £100million United need to rebuild the squad. On the other hand, they need players with personality and quality, and they haven’t got that many. In fact, he’s the only one they’ve got. For me, it's a no-lose situation.”",
      "Fernandes captained United as they rounded off their post-season trip to Asia with a 3-1 friendly win against Hong Kong. Asked whether that might have been Fernandes’ last appearance for the club, Amorim said: “I don’t think so.",
      "“I don’t know for sure, nobody knows, but I don’t think so. I think he is seeing us taking some actions to change all the things and I think that is all that he asked. I think he wants to stay.",
      "“He’s saying no to a lot of things, but it shows that he wants to win and I think he’s really young, he’s really good. He needs to be in the best league in the world.\"",
      "A fee of £100m would help fund this summer’s much-needed rebuild as United navigate PSR. Pushed on whether United could turn down such a figure, Amorim said: “Yes, yes. We can find another way to earn money.”"

      "Chelsea will have to pay Manchester United £5million after failing to reach an agreement to make Jadon Sancho’s loan move permanent. Sancho spent the season on loan from United in west London and the Blues had an option to make it permanent for £25m, but talks with the winger have been unsuccessful.",
      "The 25-year-old returned five goals and 10 assists in 42 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea in the 2024/25 season. He helped Enzo Maresca’s side finish fourth in the Premier League and win the Conference League and had been expected to join the club permanently.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear that Sancho is not in his plans for next season and United are desperate to offload their fringe players in the summer transfer window to fund a squad overhaul. Sancho has not enjoyed himself since signing for United from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for £73m and will now have to search for a different exit route.",
      "Chelsea entered talks with Sancho and his representatives following the 4-1 win over Real Betis on Wednesday, in which the winger scored. But negotiations have now been called off, according to The Athletic, with Sancho now set to leave the Blues when his loan deal expires on June 30.",
      "Despite his modest returns on the pitch, Sancho integrated well at Chelsea and Maresca spoke glowingly of his contribution after lifting the Conference League trophy in Poland. But he will now have to search for a new club this summer, with a return to parent club United not suiting either party. The report states that Sancho has options in England and elsewhere in Europe.",
      "He has been linked with a return to Germany, where he starred for Dortmund, with Bayer Leverkusen reportedly interested. Leverkusen will be flush with cash this summer, with Florian Wirtz in talks to follow Jeremie Frimpong to Liverpool, but there is a stumbling block to a move for Sancho.",
      "The German side have appointed Erik ten Hag to replace Xabi Alonso, who joined Real Madrid, and the Dutchman does not have a good relationship with Sancho from their time together at United. It was a falling out with Ten Hag that prompted a loan spell to Dortmund in January 2024.",
      "It appears as though Amorim has taken a similar approach to Sancho, having bluntly dismissed him when asked earlier in the season. “I’m just focused on my players and my problems,” he said. “Sancho is not my problem.”",
      "The £5m fee owed by Chelsea for backing out of the deal for Sancho will come as a timely boost for United. However, it does mean they now need to find a new buyer for the unwanted winger, who has just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for the club over four years – a stark contrast to the 40 goals and 47 assists in 118 appearances for Dortmund.",

      "Manchester United are among a handful of clubs monitoring Gianluigi Donnarumma’s situation at Paris Saint-Germain as contract talks between the Italy star and the newly minted European champions continue to drag on.",
      "Donnarumma, 26, is widely regarded as one of the world's best goalkeepers and starred in PSG's triumphant Champions League campaign, which culminated with the 5-0 thrashing of Inter Milan in Saturday night's showpiece final. But his long-term future appears to be up in the air.",
      "The former AC Milan star's current terms expire next summer and talks over an extension have already taken place with the club, who have tabled a proposal.",
      "Foot Mercato, via GFFN, however, have revealed that Donnarumma has plenty of admirers among Europe's elite who are ready to pounce if the talented shot-stopper opts against signing a new deal.",
      "United are among those clubs and a move for Donnarumma would appeal given there are still doubts over Andre Onana following another mixed season for the Cameroon star.",
      "Whether they would be able to compete with some of the other teams in Donnarumma's signature remain to be seen, though, with the likes of Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid also lurking.",
      "City, like their neighbours, are also likely to be in the market for a new goalkeeper this summer with Ederson attracting interest from clubs in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Donnarumma may have suitors elsewhere, but could yet to decide to extend his stay in the French capital, with the ball said to be in his court. That would involve a pay-cut, though, with the report adding that the offer on the table includes a 'lower variable portion' given Donnarumma's contract is the 'last of the old regime'.",
      "Even if Donnarumma does decide to pursue a Premier League move, United would be unable to offer the PSG star European football as a result of their poor 2024-25 season.",

      "As the club's post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong ended, Ruben Amorim laid down the gauntlet to Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy, declaring simply: \"Find another way to earn money\".",
      "The United boss had been asked about Bruno Fernandes' future, as the Old Trafford talisman weighed up a £100million transfer to Saudi side Al-Hilal. For Amorim, despite the huge transfer fee and the fact Fernandes turns 31 later this year, the decision was a simple one for the club: Don't sell. Keep our captain. Build from there.",
      "Amorim's wish has been granted. Not by club chiefs, who, while publicly they'll insist they never wanted to sell, may have felt £100m was a figure they couldn't turn down, particularly given the £100m Champions League revenue lost in the Europa League final defeat to Spurs. But instead by Fernandes, who has decided that leaving the Premier League for the relative backwaters of the Saudi Pro League isn't for him just yet.",
      "That continues a pretty good start to June for the United boss, who saw No.1 transfer target Matheus Cunha complete his switch from Wolves on Sunday. The Brazil international has sealed a £62.5million move and taken a pay bump to £200k-a-week after United triggered his release clause at Molineux.",
      "That will not be the end of United's spending as they look to put their worst-ever Premier League season firmly behind them.",
      "Amorim has made clear his belief that there are players at the club who simply aren't fit for what he wants and has spent six months refusing to budge from his philosophy. He won't change, so the personnel at his disposal needs to. Now the hierarchy are pushing ahead with giving him what he wants.",
      "That means, next up, Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, fresh from a standout season in 2024-25. The South Africa international scored 20 Premier League goals last term and is precisely the kind of reliable finisher that United just don't have.",
      "Newcastle United have been pushing hard to land him, while Liverpool also hold long-standing interest. Crucially, the latter aren't interested in a move this summer, as they push for Florian Wirtz, while Newcastle's hopes of a £60m deal are all but over, after Mbeumo informed them he only wants to move to Old Trafford. Sources close to Newcastle insist he'll be getting paid above their pay scale by choosing not to join their Champions League fight next term, but they weren't interested in breaking their salary structure.",
      "The Fernandes decision means the pressure is on to sell others to pay for more incomings.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, told he has no future at the club, will go. Marcus Rashford and Antony too. The question on the trio is how much United can get for them?",
      "Jadon Sancho may be dumped back in United's lap too, with Chelsea gearing up to spend £5m to NOT turn their loan deal permanent. Amorim will need to decide what to do with a player that fell out with Erik ten Hag.",
      "Christian Eriksen, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof have already departed on free transfers, freeing up space when it comes to salaries, while Tyrell Malacia, who has been on loan at PSV, will be moved on.",
      "Then there is Kobbie Mainoo, the England international who broke through under Ten Hag and was seen as the future, but who Amorin doesn't see as a natural fit in his line up. Chelsea hold a big interest and there will be no shortage of suitors if United intimate he can go. He may just be the biggest sale of the summer.",
      "Then there are the strikers. Rasmus Hojlund looks set to return to Italy, with Champions League finalists Inter Milan pushing to take him to San Siro. Joshua Zirkzee showed fleeting moments of quality and is likely to stay albeit as back up to a new No.9.",
      "United missed out on Liam Delap but Victor Osimhen remains admired and is an option, particularly as Napoli eye Garnacho. But the question is whether the finances, both with Napoli and the player, can be made to work.",
      "The Nigeria international is wanted by clubs in Saudi too, and while he didn't want to go there last summer, a hugely successful year in Turkey could have worked to either embolden his view or changed his mind. Make no mistake, he would be ideal.",
      "And in midfield, with Fernandes due to drop into a deeper role next term for the most part, there is a spot to be filled, where both Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have been used.",
      "The Brazilian is 33, on big money, and while Amorim has been hugely impressed by him, club chiefs would like to get him off the wage bill if possible. As for Ugarte, he's had good moments and some that have been decidedly less stellar as he adapts to life in England.",
      "One player club scouts and bosses have watched extensively and are high on is all-action Atalanta midfielder Ederson. United are among a list of top European clubs to have held talks with the player's agent, Andre Cury, in the past few months and with Gian Piero Gasperini leaving Atalanta for Roma, Ederson too is ready to now leave the 2024 Europa League winners.",
      "At £50million, he could give United the kind of dynamism and physicality that Amorim is desperate to add to his midfield. There's Al Hilal interest too, but a switch to one of Europe's biggest clubs is understood to be at the forefront of the Brazilian's mind.",
      "Four signings, potentially 10 exits and one captain's decision. All in, that'd certainly give Amorim something he can work with next term to ensure he keeps to his post-season vow that \"better days are coming\".",
      "Potential Man United XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Dalot, Ederson, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Osimhen.",

      "Delap is heading to Chelsea in a £30m transfer having snubbed United and Everton, prompting a re-think at Old Trafford. Mbeumo enjoyed a wonderful campaign for Brentford, registering 20 goals and eight assists in 38 Premier League matches, and is poised to change clubs in the summer transfer window.",
      "United are understood to be ‘confident’ of landing Mbeumo, who has previously been linked with Liverpool, as well as Newcastle. Arne Slot’s side have also been busy in the early stages of the summer transfer window, signing Jeremie Frimpong for £29.5m while chasing the signature of his former Bayer Leverkusen team-mate Florian Wirtz.",
      "Mbeumo plays in the same position as Mohamed Salah on the right wing and has a similar style, often cutting onto his left foot to shoot at goal. It had been suggested that the 25-year-old Cameroon international would therefore make a solid long-term successor to Salah.",
      "Salah signed a new two-year contract with Liverpool back in April, but with the Egyptian star now 32 years old – and with a move to the Saudi Pro League still on the cards in the future – there is a need to plan ahead. If Mbeumo chooses to move to Old Trafford then it would seem that Liverpool will need to go back to the drawing board.",
      "United are facing a crucial summer transfer window after finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final. Ruben Amorim wants to overhaul his underperforming squad and the capture of Mbeumo – alongside Cunha, who is joining in a £62.5m move – would be a statement of intent.",
      "Brentford manager Thomas Frank has worked with Mbeumo for six years and has seen him blossom into one of the Premier League’s most effective forwards. He knows that, despite finishing 10th, five places above United, the Bees will struggle to hold onto Mbeumo, who can command much higher wages elsewhere.",
      "“I always knew he was a goalscorer. Now he’s now just a more consistent goalscorer. His hold-up play is even better, his assist play or link-up play, his work ethic is fantastic. So very impressed.”",
      "Asked if he will remain a Brentford player next season, Frank replied: “Let’s see. We all love him. I watch him every day, he comes in with a big smile, trains with a big smile. He loves to be a Brentford player but let’s see.”",

      "They have already confirmed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers. And he could be followed by Mbeumo, who has reportedly prioritised a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Should a switch go through as expected, Mbeumo could be handed his ideal shirt number. The Cameroonian already dons the number 19 shirt with current side Brentford and as it stands, nobody owns that at United.",
      "French defender Raphael Varane was the last man to wear the shirt, while Marcus Rashford and Amad also wore the number. But both forwards gave the number up - Amad moving to 16, while Rashford is currently the owner of United’s illustrious number 10 shirt.",
      "Even that might not last much longer. It has already been confirmed that their first signing of the summer, Matheus Cunha, will be handed the number 10 shirt once he officially arrives, potentially hinting that Rashford faces little future at the club following his loan spell at Aston Villa.",
      "Regarding Mbeumo, Brentford now face a tough task in replacing the forward after his 20-goal haul last term. Thomas Frank has claimed that his side face a near-impossible task should he depart.",
      "He said: “It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one.",
      "“It cannot be done. There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don’t look at him.",
      "“I would be surprised with what he has to offer. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.”",
      "United appear unlikely to end their summer shopping at the signing of Mbeumo. They are also keen to sign a new striker ahead of next term - the latest name emerging as former Fulham and Newcastle hitman Aleksandar Mitrovic.",

But their hopes of making Fernandes their marquee new signing - in a move that would see him link up with Portugal team-mates Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo - have failed.",
      "The 30-year-old has been weighing up a move to Saudi over the past couple of weeks, following United’s disastrous season. He has been aware of the monstrous money he could make by moving to the Middle East, as well as the effect the £100m could have on United, especially since there will be no European football at Old Trafford next term.",
      "But he has also been reticent to move from both a personal and professional point of view.",

Hugill struggled for game time at Wigan, with the 21-year-old playing a full 90 minutes in the league just twice, and returned to United after notching two league goals.",
      "He then joined Carlisle in a bid to help their relegation fight, but scored two goals in 17 league games as they finished second bottom. Hugill was a prolific goalscorer at youth level, but has yet to find his feet in senior football and another loan spell next season is likely.",
      "Tom Wooster, Elyeh Harrison and Tom Myles",
      "The three goalkeepers spent four months out on loan before being recalled early by the club. Wooster kept four clean sheets in 11 games for National League North side Farsley Celtic, while Harrison kept six in 18 for Chester.",

      "Jack Kingdon",

      "Gary Neville believes that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho should all leave Manchester United this summer. Former captain Neville has also named one player who the Red Devils desperately need to keep hold of and 'build around'.",
      "The Red Devils have made a fast start to the summer transfer window which opened on Sunday, confirming the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves by paying his £62.5million release clause. United are also confident of landing Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo in a £50m deal, fending off interest from Premier League rivals Arsenal, Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "It's hoped that those two attacking additions will transform Ruben Amorim's frontline and it's why Neville sees the aforementioned quartet leaving Old Trafford. Rashford, Sancho and Antony were all loaned out last season while Garnacho was the subject of interest from Chelsea and Napoli in January.",
      "But one academy product who Neville doesn't want the Red Devils to sell is Kobbie Mainoo. \"On these five I'm pretty certain,\" he began on the It's Called Soccer podcast. \"Marcus Rashford has to leave for him and the club. I think that ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club.",
      "\"I would worry that Aston Villa haven't announced that they're keeping him already because I think that could have been an easy deal to do with United if they were going to keep him, so it sounds to me like Villa aren't going to keep him. I would say for Marcus' sake and for United's sake that it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",
      "On Sancho, the ex-United defender continued: \"I feel a little bit similarly with him as I do with Marcus. I'd be a bit concerned that Chelsea haven't made the noises that they're going to keep him.",
      "\"Again, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him and, from Jadon's point of view, he has to make sure that he parts ways with Manchester United.\"",
      "Neville feels that Antony's loan spell has been different, labelling Real Betis and La Liga the 'perfect' destination. \"I can imagine he was absolutely going under while he was at Old Trafford,\" he explained.",
      "Who else do Manchester United need to sell this summer? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "\"He's gone to Spain and having seen a couple of players that I played with not do it Old Trafford but do it in Spain… I think he's suited down to the ground and it's been proven. Over there, there's a different tactical awareness, there's a different technical ability and there's a way of playing that's just more suited to players.",
      "\"The players I'm referring to are players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan. It just didn't quite happen for them but they had really good careers and I think there are players like that who just aren't suited to a league.",
      "\"I think Antony is perfect for Spain and, again, somebody who Manchester United should facilitate leaving. It's best for Antony and best for the club.\"",
      "Regarding Garnacho, whose future was thrust into the spotlight after being named on the bench for the Europa League final, Neville said: \"I think if players are taking on the manager and if players are questioning the manager in public through social media or through other means, the manager has to win.",
      "\"If the manager doesn't win, the manager has to leave and I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before. I think Garnacho will leave purely because of that, I think they've had enough.",
      "\"Garnacho can play in the Premier League, no doubt, but I think he'll love it in Spain, he'll thrive over there, he'll score goals. He'll probably be someone next season that we’re all looking back on thinking, 'Why didn't Manchester United keep him?', that type of thing will probably happen, there’s an element of that, but I think he has to go.",
      "\"That's not me throwing my toys out the pram and saying, 'Get him out the club'… no, for him and the club, I think it's right that he goes. Those four players should leave, not just because Manchester United should let them go, but because they should go and find themselves a place in their lives where they can go and play football because it's not at Old Trafford.\"",
      "But the thought of selling Mainoo - who's been at United since the age of six - is too much for Neville, despite Amorim also benching him for the last month's 1-0 loss to Tottenham in Bilbao. \"Mainoo, no. That's a step too far,\" Neville affirmed.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield… I look at Mainoo and the way he plays football and I think a top club would want him. Why can't we make him a top player? If he's one of ours and he's shown talent.",
      "\"I don't know what's gone on there in the last few months. He's obviously had some injuries which has caused him a problem so he needs to stay fit, but I'd like to think he could be one of that two in midfield that Ruben Amorim plays.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro as his partner and it's probably not [Manuel] Ugarte as his partner, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two, if I'm being honest. But we should be building around Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield and not because he’s come through the ranks.\""

      "However, according to a report from the Times, Cunha may be used in a deeper role by United next season. The report states that Amorim plans to play the 26-year-old as either one of the No.10s - a role he operated often at Wolves - or in a 'more defensive' role in midfield, potentially starting deeper, looking to pick up the ball in front of defence before driving it forwards.",
      "Cunha has never featured there for Wolves, mostly playing as a No.10 or up front, but it appears as though Amorim sees things differently. And Cunha has already hailed his new boss, telling CNN Portugal last month: \"Talking about him [Amorim] is easy.",

      "\"I don't know. There are a lot of questions that will be asked about that as well. Seventeen goals, six assists in 36 games for a Wolves team, I think it's impressive.",
      "\"I think the recruitment team for Manchester United would have seen, and the coaches here would have seen, what he did to Man United at Old Trafford. He was slicing through Man United like a hot knife through butter.\"",

      "United boss Amorim has previously highlighted why he believes issues have been found when playing more familiar opposition. \"When you play against any team in England, the physicality is there,\" he said.",
      "\"If you don’t have physicality, you will struggle a lot. Antony is so much better now in Spain. There are many factors, but I guarantee you it’s physicality.\"",
      "And bringing players in who already have Premier League experience, and have thrived in the environment, such as Cunha and Mbeumo, would not only improve the team but potentially require less time to adjust. After a dismal start for Amorim, he will hope such players at least offer part of the answer.",

      "It's the £300million question - and only Bruno Fernandes has the answer. The Manchester United captain has been given the chance to leave the sinking ship at Old Trafford for steadier waters in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Hilal, one of the big hitters in the Saudi Pro League, have offered Fernandes a mega £700,000 per week contract which the 30-year-old is understood to be seriously considering after his agent met Saudi chiefs in Riyadh last week. Three years in the Middle East would see him pocket a staggering £200m while Al-Hilal are also willing to pay United a £100m fee.",
      "That's enough to transform the Red Devils' summer transfer budget and give Ruben Amorim funds to further build the team in his own image. But at what cost?",
      "United's lowly 15th-placed finish was off the back of Fernandes' brilliant individual campaign, so would his departure deepen their ongoing crisis? Amorim, at least publicly, wants him to stay but the Portugal international hinted that he'd be open to leaving following last month's Europa League final defeat.",
      "Fernandes should be off from Manchester United like a shot. He owes United nothing, having carried them on his back for the last few seasons.",
      "And his reward for this is to be left stuck in a team without European football - and with a cat in hell's chance of winning the title next season. He will be 31 in September and is approaching the age when big names look to cash in one last time. And moves don't come more lucrative than ones to Saudi Arabia.",
      "He will know leaving Old Trafford would leave the team in an even deeper hole. But that's not his problem. And besides, club bosses have just made him go on a farcical post-season tour to Hong Kong and Malaysia, so he also knows where United's skewed priorities lie.",
      "From the player's point of view, this would seem like something of a no-brainer. Bruno Fernandes is the wrong side of 30, Manchester United are in a perilous state and there is no European football on the horizon.",
      "If Fernandes had a concrete offer from one of the continent's big-hitters, there would be a decision to make. But in lieu of that, could anyone really blame him for taking the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia rather than staying at Old Trafford?",
      "Yes, the standard of football is dramatically worse. But he will be a marquee figure and there is little evidence it will affect his international involvement given Cristiano Ronaldo's enduring Portugal career despite playing in the Middle East.",
      "I'm still not convinced Manchester United have quite bottomed out yet, and Fernandes should take the opportunity to make sure he's not around to see that happen. Not to mention the £100million parting gift to swell the club's coffers. It might even save a dinner lady her job.",
      "The focus shouldn't be on reasons for him leaving, they should be all about why he should stay. After all, Fernandes has essentially carried United on his back for five-and-a-half years, with only two domestic cups to show for it.",
      "In a hypothetical world, he could have moved to the other half of Manchester and already be in conversations for being the league's best player. United have done nothing to improve the squad around him since he arrived in 2020 - in fact it has got significantly worse.",
      "At 30, Fernandes could be excused for lacking the patience for what seems to be another massive rebuild at Old Trafford. I would like to see him stay in Europe, but who could blame him for taking the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia?",
      "United under Sir Jim Ratcliffe seem more bothered about their balance sheet than the team sheet. Fernandes would do well to cut ties.",
      "There's obviously the Club World Cup pressure as Al-Hilal press for a deal during this mini transfer window, but if any player deserves a summer off then it is Bruno Fernandes, so if he can find a way to sit tight then I'd do that right now.",
      "The Portuguese has just had arguably the best season of his career, despite everything crumbling around him at Manchester United. But if he is to leave - which he probably should do if he's interested in winning things - I'd like to see him at one of Europe's top sides before making the move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Fernandes previously had three seasons at Udinese and one at Sampdoria, is well respected at Italy's bigger clubs, and he'd certainly improve Inter Milan given their showing at the weekend. He'd make AC Milan, Napoli, Juventus and the rest better, too.",
      "Italy might not be an option for him just yet though, and it certainly won't be as lucrative as Saudi would be, but he should be sitting back and relaxing right now after the rigours of a tough season. Yes, get out of United, but take your time about it.",
      "The main argument against Bruno Fernandes leaving Manchester United comes from his perceived importance to everything the team does. However, if we translate that to league form, what does that actually mean? The difference between finishing 15th and 17th?",
      "United need a summer rebuild - that much is obvious. They'll need to sell in order to buy after missing out on Europe and there's only one member of their squad who can fetch the big one-off fee to accelerate that process.",
      "He's already given his best years to the club, and they're some way from being back in a position of being competitive at the top end of the league. By the time that happens (if it happens?), who knows how big a toll that average of 53 games per season for five straight years will have taken.",
      "Sure, United might miss Fernandes in the short term. As we've seen with Paris Saint-Germain post-Kylian Mbappe and Liverpool post-Phillipe Coutinho in recent years, though, forcing yourself to spread out the creative responsibilities can sometimes be the best way forward.",
      "Fernandes should go. He can only do so much in Manchester and he's about to find out that Amorim's system may not be overly inclusive of him as a player. Without a natural No.10 spot and more demands placed on positions, Fernandes may struggle to perform the role his manager wants.",
      "While I think he should leave the Red Devils, I'm not a lover of players heading to Saudi in their pomp, but heads get turned when mammoth sums are on offer, so it is understandable. It may not do much for his career but would be very kind to his bank balance.",
      "Fernandes has just had one of his best years to date and it got United absolutely nowhere, so it proves that one fantastic individual cannot solve a magnitude of problems. He's given it his all but a new challenge would certainly benefit him and the Middle East may be his only option."

He was signed as David de Gea's replacement, but the jury is out as to whether the club made the right move.",

The Serbian has played a major role for Torino, keeping ten clean sheets in Serie A, to put a number of clubs on alert.",

      "He said: \"I just have that feeling. When you talk to someone, you have that feeling if he wants to stay.

      "The most surprising aspect of Manchester United's early transfer business this summer is that it is coming in the area of the pitch where they are arguably strongest.",
      "If they get a deal over the line to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford following the acquisition of Matheus Cunha to Wolves, it will add more No. 10s to Ruben Amorim's squad. Given the money spent on the proven Premier League performers, they will surely be starters next season.",
      "They join a growing list of options for those positions, which for now includes Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Amad, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. Garnacho's expected departure will create some leeway for transfers, and Mainoo's future is hardly secure just yet.",
      "Mount enjoyed his best spell of football for United towards the end of last season and is an Amorim favourite, but he hasn't done enough to warrant being a first-choice in that position. Fernandes certainly has, and his decision to turn down Al-Hilal's advances should mean another year of consistent performances at Old Trafford, but his future could lie more often in a deeper midfield role. He played that position regularly last season without any real impact on his contribution in the final third.",
      "Cunha is clearly an ideal fit for the position, having excelled there in the same system under Vitor Pereira at Wolves. He brings an understanding of the role and more creativity and goal threat than someone like Mount.",
      "Mbeumo spent last season playing on the wing for Brentford, but could slot in as a No. 10. He has played centrally previously and, like Cunha, would significantly add to the attacking threat in a United squad that has struggled for goals.",
      "The 25-year-old could operate as a striker as well, although he might not be an ideal fit for what Amorim wants from a No. 9. Instead, his close control and dribbling ability could make him a better option between the lines. He also brings balance, something Amorim reflected on in December when he first moved Amad into a No. 10 role, after initially using him as a wing-back.",
      "\"He can be a good player in that position,\" Amorim said. \"We need left-footed players in this team to play that role. In the first half, he was coming for the ball too much. He needed to play near the opposition defence more. He will improve in the future for sure.”",
      "That comment came after United's win against Viktoria Plzen and signalled an almost permanent shift to Amad operating as a No. 10, but the interest in Mbeumo could yet signal a change of plan there.",
      "Given his impact last season, Amad is almost a guaranteed starter in 2025/26, which either means Mbeumo plays centre-forward or Amad drops into right wing-back.",
      "He has proven he can play the role under Amorim, and his dribbling is an asset there. He can come inside to link play and offer an overload centrally or go down the outside on his right foot. That is the type of attacking threat Amorim wants from players in those positions.",
      "This summer is clearly going to be transformative for United. Adding goals and creativity to the team is vital for Amorim, and bringing Mbeumo in as an attacker and shifting Amad to wing-back fulfils that brief.",
      "It will also offer the head coach versatility. Mbeumo could play as a No. 9 and a No. 10, and Amad could play wing-back and No. 10. There are options there, for Amorim has also prioritised players who can operate in a couple of different roles for his system. A move for Mbeumo would deliver just that."

      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres has also been linked with United, largely due to his strong relationship with manager Rúben Amorim. However, the Reds appear to face stiff competition, with a growing queue of suitors that now reportedly includes Liverpool.",
      "However, further signings beyond a striker are unlikely to be pursued until funds are generated through player sales. Unfortunately, that could see Bruno Fernandes depart the club, amid continued links to a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Sporting’s Pedro Goncalves has been earmarked as a potential replacement for the Portuguese captain.",

      "The Telegraph claim that the club know that there are other suitors for the player, and could use that to their advantage. Brentford are known as tough negotiators in the transfer window, with there being no release clause in the player's contract.",

      "The Blues will therefore pay a £5 million penalty to United this summer, with the player then being sent back to Old Trafford. United now have the chance to find another move for the winger this summer.",

      "Sacha Tavolieri claims that Al Hilal's hopes of landing Bruno Fernandes have taken a blow as the midfielder's family are not convinced on the move to Saudi Arabia.",

      "\"The lack of commitment from the Fernandes camp is slowing down the deal. Al Hilal needs Fernandes before the Club World Cup & ready to offer everything to the MUFC midfielder to prevent him from resisting the SPL’s astronomical allure.\"",

      "Last month, ESPN's Mark Ogden insisted United should have made a play to bring Kelleher to Old Trafford this window.",
      "\"An interesting one – I just don’t see it happening, but I think he’d be ideal for United – is Caoimhin Kelleher,” said Ogden. “I just don’t see Liverpool selling their number two to Man United, but Kelleher wants to move. He wants to play. Brentford have been linked with Kelleher but, you know, United would be a much better option for him.",
      "“United and Liverpool don’t trade players, do they? But I think in terms of a goalkeeper who’s proved himself in the Premier League and will be relatively inexpensive at around £20, Kelleher to United would be a good deal. Like I say, the history between the clubs is such that they just don’t do deals.”",
      "Manchester United reportedly want to strike a deal with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo regardless of what happens with Bruno Fernandes' future.",
      "Fernandes, 32, could end his five-year stint at Old Trafford this summer as he continues to be pursued by Saudi Pro League outfit Al Hilal.",

      "The Reds completed their first summer signing of the 2025 window on Sunday after announcing the arrival of Mathus Cunha. United have agreed to pay the Brazilian's £62.5million release clause in instalments.",
      "Cunha's arrival at M16 is likely to see the Reds hasten their efforts to offload academy graduate Rashford in hopes of selling the forward on a permanent deal. The England international spent the second half of 2024/25 on loan at Aston Villa, with the Villans having an option to purchase him for £40m this summer. However, it remains unclear whether Villa will exercise this option.",
      "Former United centre-back Ferdinand said:",
      "One of the few players I mentioned a few weeks ago, if I had a shopping list, he would be on there. He knows the Premier League, so he doesn't need any adaptation time.",
      "This is a huge factor. I think if you're going to go and buy players from foreign leagues, players that don't have the experience in the Premier League, there is always a risk. He has the experience here. We've seen him here. He grew up a Man United fan.",
      "I'm hearing he's taking the No 10 shirt, which was Rashford's shirt. What does that mean for Marcus Rashford? I don't know. There are a lot of questions that will be asked about that as well.",
      "Seventeen goals, six assists in 36 games for a Wolves team, I think it's impressive. I think the recruitment team for Manchester United would have seen, and the coaches here would have seen, what he did to Man United at Old Trafford. He was slicing through Man United like a hot knife through butter.",
      "Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres appears to be keeping his focus on his current club amid speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United this summer.",
      "Gyokeres has been eyed as a potential target for several European clubs this summer after a yet another terrific season in the Portuguese top flight. The Swede, who turns 27 on Wednesday, scored a whopping 54 goals in 52 appearances this campaign and it is understood that United have been keeping an eye on him.",
      "Taking to Instagram, Gyokeres shared a post by his current club with the caption (when translated): \"Have a good week, Two-time National Champions.\" This post refers to Sporting winning the double this season lifting both the league and the Portuguese Cup.",
      "Casemiro, Harry Maguire, Jadon Sancho and Dan Gore are about to head into the final year of their Manchester United contracts.",
      "Casemiro signed a four-year contract, with the option of another year, when he was signed from Real Madrid in 2022, but United won't trigger the 12-month extension in his deal.",
      "United were open to offers for Casemiro last summer and received no appropriate offer. Casemiro's stock has improved due to his performances in the Europa League and he could leave in this summer transfer window to prevent him leaving on a free transfer at the end of next season.",
      "In January, the one-year extension in Maguire's contract was triggered, meaning his contract now expires in June 2026. Maguire enjoyed a renaissance this term and scored important goals.",
      "The defender could negotiate fresh terms with United, otherwise, he'll leave for free next summer.",

      "Cunha has scored 27 goals in the Premier League since the start of the 2023/24 campaign, meaning he is an established operator in England's top flight.",
      "United always used to try and sign the Premier League's best talent, meaning this feels like a huge step in the right direction right at the start of an important summer.",

      "Fernandes was United's Player of the Season and in a dismal campaign, he still managed 19 goals and 20 assists across all competitions.",

      "United are in desperate need of a reliable goal-scorer this summer, having not had one since Marcus Rashford netted 30 goals in 2022/2023 under Erik ten Hag. Cristiano Ronaldo was United's last great striker in that regard with 24 goals in 2021/2022.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has regularly seemed out of his depth since arriving at Old Trafford from Atalanta in 2023, leading to successive managers using Bruno Fernandes as a false nine in some matches. It's no coincidence that United have suffered their lowest ever Premier League finish, in successive seasons, when the goals began to dry up for their strikers.",

      "Marcus Rashford remains in limbo with Manchester United looking to offload their academy graduate this summer.",
      "The Reds forward spent the second half of this season on loan at Aston Villa and showed some promise under Unai Emery. Rashford scored four goals and provided six assists before an injury ended his campaign prematurely.",
      "Villa have the option to sign United's attacker for £40million this summer in what would be a welcome PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) boost for the Reds. Rashford's homegrown status means any sale would represent pure profit for United - giving them greater flexibility to strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad.",

      "Gary Neville believes Bruno Fernandes has shown extreme loyalty to Manchester United by turning down a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Hilal are the most successful club in Saudi Arabia and they turned their attention to Fernandes after missing out on Mohamed Salah, who recently signed a new contract at Anfield.",
      "Saudi reports claimed Fernandes had been offered a huge financial package to sign for Al-Hilal. However, there has been no contact between the clubs and Fernandes is thought to have rejected their proposal.",
      "Speaking after the Europa League final, Fernandes admitted he could leave Old Trafford if the club wanted to cash in, but the Saudi proposal has been rebuffed after talks with his agent.",
      "\"But on the other hand, he is Manchester United's star player and only player at times, for the last four or five years, it's been Bruno Fernandes. He is the one who I can point at being a success out of the big signings they've made.",
      "\"He's so important and he's the only player with the personality and courage to take the ball in difficult situations. If he plays well, United have half a chance of winning a game.",
      "\"You saw it in the Europa League final when he had one of his more difficult games and United did next to nothing in attack. So I think him staying at the club and Cunha coming in does give them a couple of players with personality who might just make a difference next season.\"",
      "Neville continued: \"I don't think anybody is doubting his commitment to United over the last few years. He plays every single week, hardly misses a game and he's consistent.",
      "\"The chances, goals and assists have been sensational. And the fact he wants to stay, wants to go through this and come out of the other side, because it would have been easier for him at the end of this season to say 'I'm done here'. There would have been a huge amount of money on the table.",
      "\"But the fact he's stayed will endear him to United fans even more. The idea to turn that money down at a point when United are at their lowest ebb and say 'I want to fight'.",
      "\"I think that says a lot about him as a person, as a character and I think United fans will warm to that because at this moment in time, the club needs people who will run through a brick wall.\"",
      "The Portugal international won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for a fourth time this season, joining David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players who have won it four times.",

      "Last week, Marcus Rashford posted a thank you message to Aston Villa on his social media.",
      "Aston Villa have the option to sign Rashford permanently for £40million, but the player wants to play for a Champions League club and a move to Barcelona is gathering momentum.",
      "Rashford might have helped Unai Emery's side into the Champions League if he didn't pick up a hamstring injury in April. Rashford looked back to his best before sustaining that issue and might have been able to make a significant difference during the final weeks of the Premier League season.",
      "Aston Villa choked at Old Trafford on the final day of the campaign instead and they will not play in Europe's premier competition next season. Rashford could still pop up in the Champions League, though.",
      "The reports linking him with a move to Barcelona are not going away and their sporting director, Deco, went on record about Rashford when he spoke to BBC Sport this week.",
      "Deco insisted Barcelona will \"not sell our best players\". He said Barcelona were in the market for \"two, three or four signings\", without needing to enter the market \"like crazy\" thanks to a solid base.",
      "And when asked if Barcelona's plans included the option of signing Rashford, or Liverpool forward Luis Diaz, he added: \"We have been focusing on renewing contracts, after that, we'll discuss players to come.",
      "\"Of course, these two players, like you mentioned, they are good but have contracts in their clubs, so we won't speak because it's not fair. But when you decide to go to the market, for sure, we find some names. In my opinion, we don't need to bring many players.\"",
      "Deco continued: \"When I speak with the agents of the players, everyone wants to come or stay. So this is important. The image of the club is still good. We are proud because Barcelona is still such a big club, and the way we are playing football makes players want to come.\"",
      "The former Barcelona midfielder also denied the Catalan club are in financial trouble, although reading between the lines hints they don't have a war chest to splash in the market.",
      "That's why Rashford will tick a lot of boxes for Barcelona. The 27-year-old is available for £40m this summer and he is certainly worth more than that when he is playing his best football.",
      "Barcelona's situation means they must place informed bets in the transfer market, and they will feel Rashford is worth a punt. He proved his well-being during his loan at Villa Park, looking excellent against PSG in the Champions League, and has considerable upside for a £40m transfer.",
      "Manchester City paid £53m to sign Matheus Nunes from Wolves, Tottenham paid £50m to sign Richarlison and Chelsea paid £47.m for Raheem Sterling. They are just a handful of examples that suggest £40m for Rashford is reasonable.",
      "Barcelona can't break the bank in the transfer market, but they have enough to stump up £40m for Rashford, and it feels like a move that could be agreed sooner rather than later in the window.",
      "There is a lack of interest elsewhere in Rashford. Barcelona and Villa are the only clubs sitting at the table of interested parties, and it's obvious where Rashford would prefer to play.",
      "United will not particularly care where Rashford ends up this summer as long as they can bank a fee for the academy graduate, who is set to become one of their biggest-ever sales.",
      "The money raised from Rashford's sale will also be important for Ruben Amorim to strengthen."

      "Manchester United are pursuing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo, a move that could inadvertently impact Liverpool. United had initially shown interest in Ipswich striker Liam Delap while sealing a deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, but are now eyeing a £50million deal for Mbeumo.",
      "Delap is set to join Chelsea in a £30m transfer after turning down offers from United and Everton, prompting a change of tact at Old Trafford. Mbeumo enjoyed an impressive season with Brentford, scoring 20 goals and providing eight assists in 38 Premier League matches, and is expected to switch clubs during the summer transfer window.",
      "United are believed to be the frontrunners for Mbeumo, who has previously been linked with Liverpool, as well as Newcastle. Arne Slot's team have also been active in the early stages of the summer transfer window, signing Jeremie Frimpong for £29.5m while pursuing his former Bayer Leverkusen teammate Florian Wirtz.",
      "Mbeumo, who plays in the same position as Mohamed Salah on the right wing and shares a similar style, often cutting onto his left foot to shoot at goal, has long been suggested as a potential long-term successor to Salah.",
      "Salah's new two-year deal with Liverpool, signed last April, hasn't quelled speculation about his future, especially as he turns 32 and a potential move to the Saudi Pro League looms. Liverpool must strategise for the future, and if 25-year-old Mbeumo opts for Old Trafford, the Reds could be left scrambling for alternatives, reports the Mirror.",
      "United are gearing up for a pivotal summer transfer window following a disappointing season that saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and fall short in the Europa League final. Ruben Amorim is keen to revamp his lacklustre squad, and securing Mbeumo, along with the £62.5m acquisition of Cunha, would signal a bold ambition.",
      "Brentford's Thomas Frank has helped develop Mbeumo into one of the Premier League's top forwards over their six years together. Despite Brentford's 10th place finish, five spots above United, he knows there is a challenge to retain the player, who could earn significantly more elsewhere.",
      "\"I always knew he was a goalscorer. Now he's now just a more consistent goalscorer. His hold-up play is even better, his assist play or link-up play, his work ethic is fantastic. So very impressed.",
      "\"Let's see. We all love him. I watch him every day, he comes in with a big smile, trains with a big smile. He loves to be a Brentford player but let's see.\""

However, failing to sign one between now and the September 1 deadline is simply a non-negotiable for a team that has finished the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "Ideally, United will secure the services of an established and proven goalscorer who can come in and hit the ground running. Strikers of that ilk, however, cost a pretty penny.",
      "Having failed to secure Champions League qualification for next term, United's starting transfer budget is not as healthy as it would have been had they beaten Tottenham in Bilbao almost a fortnight ago.",
      "Therefore, it means United's hopes of signing a proven goal-getter will rest on raising funds via player sales. United want to cut their cloth this summer and have plans to shelve Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony among others.",
      "Bruno Fernandes continues to be linked with Al-Hilal and an impending offer of £100m has been mooted. If United can raise enough money via the seller's market, regardless if it means losing Fernandes or not, they need to source an elite-level goalscorer.",
      "Few have been linked with United more often than Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres in the last few months, and his goalscoring record is impressive to say the very least. He has scored 97 goals in 102 games since arriving from Coventry City in July 2023.",
      "Gyokeres joined Sporting on the back of an impressive 2022/23 campaign for the Sky Blues in which he scored 23 goals and registered 12 assists.",
      "Unsurprisingly, he attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs, and it felt inevitable that he would move to one of them given he was available for somewhere in the region of £20m. Therefore, it was a big surprise when he moved to Portugal.",
      "However, Gyokeres' agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, later revealed it was because of now-United head coach Ruben Amorim that he moved to the Portuguese capital.",
      "\"Everyone was waiting for Viktor to sign with a Premier League club,\" Cetinkaya said. \"And the answer to that question is that I brought Viktor to Sporting for just one reason, and this is also something I said to Mr Amorim when I saw him for the first time, and I said it before I even said hello to him: I only brought my player here because of you.",
      "\"Therefore, I only brought Gyokeres to Sporting because of Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "Gyokeres, of course, thrived under Amorim prior to the latter's switch to United last November, scoring 66 goals in 68 appearances under his stewardship. As a result, if the opportunity arose for him to be reunited with the United boss, Gyokeres would surely give it serious consideration.",
      "He excelled under his coaching methods, and his record in front of goal over the last two seasons makes him an attractive option for the Reds. However, the elephant in the room is that United do not have any form of European football to offer for next season.",
      "Gyokeres impressed in the Champions League this term, scoring six times in eight games, meaning he would be within his rights to want to play in the competition again next season if was to leave Sporting this summer.",
      "But his relationship with Amorim could give them an advantage."

      "Manchester United’s main sponsorship deals are the most overvalued in the Premier League according to a new report.",
      "With defeat in Bilbao last month to Tottenham Hotspur resulting in the north London side booking their spot in next season’s Champions League at the expense of United, something that could be worth in excess of £100m, the fair market value of the Red Devils’ sponsorship inventory in 2025 has diminished.",
      "Analysis from The Sponsor, one of the leading publications that focuses on the global sponsorship industry, has ranked the 20 Premier League teams that will contest the 2025/26 campaign in order of the value of their main shirt sponsorship deal, and how much overvalued or undervalued each deal is.",
      "The Sponsor’s 2025 Premier League Fair Market Sponsorship Values Report puts United third on the list in terms of the size of value of the deal with Qualcomm (Snapdragon) standing at £60m. But that valuation was noted in the report as being £8.9m overvalued, the largest overvaluation among Premier League clubs by some distance. Liverpool’s £50m per year deal with Standard Chartered, in comparison, was viewed as being £15.9m undervalued on the back of their Premier League success, while Manchester City, who have a £67.5m deal with Etihad Airways, were pegged as being £3.7m overvalued.",
      "United’s fair market value for 2024 sat at £64.5m in last year’s report, making this year’s £51.1m fair market value down £13.4m (21%) year on year.",
      "Speaking to the MEN, Sean Connell, editor of The Sponsor, said: “Manchester United’s sponsorship value has fallen sharply, and the timing couldn’t be worse for Snapdragon, who activated an extension through to 2029 at £60m per year, £10m more than Standard Chartered pay Liverpool.",
      "“With no European football next season and declining on-pitch performance, the deal now looks poor value, delivering significantly less exposure and weaker brand association than anticipated. Unless Ruben Amorim can quickly reverse the slide, United’s ability to command top-tier sponsorship fees not just for front-of-shirt, but across all assets will continue to deteriorate.”",
      "The lack of European football next season will bite hard commercially, although United’s historic legacy still holds weight in the sponsorship world and ensures some credit in the bank, but the lack of exposure to European audiences means commercial partners will see significantly reduced visibility, impacting the value they receive in return.",
      "Connell added: “There’s still time to turn it around.",
      "“United’s global fanbase and commercial legacy remain incredibly strong, and its front-of-shirt sponsorship value is still greater than those of Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham at £51.1 million. However, the gap between potential and performance is widening and sponsors are taking note.”",
      "The Sponsor methodology to reach Fair Market Value, which is a rule in play with the Premier League after being voted through after the takeover of Newcastle United by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, uses a number of different metrics.",
      "Each club’s sponsorship strength is evaluated relative to its peers using a weighted scorecard based on the criteria most important to senior brand marketers. These criteria are identified via a survey of The Sponsor’s audience of marketing leaders and grouped into three categories; reputation, audience and contribution.",
      "Brand reach was weighted most heavily, reflecting its importance to sponsors.",
      "The strength scores were then compared with publicly reported sponsorship values from trusted media outlets such to identify market trends and anchor points.",
      "Polynomial regression was then used and a market curve was generated to map sponsorship strength to value, producing a Fair Market Value for each Premier League club’s front-of-shirt and sleeve assets."

      "If he does make the move to Saudi Arabia, it will see him link up with his international team-mates Joao Cancelo and Ruben Neves.",
      "Ironically, United tried to sign Neves to play alongside Fernandes in their midfield under both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag while the Portugal international was at Wolves.",
      "A move never materialised, though, and he ended up making the £47million move to Al-Hilal in the summer of 2023 and he won the Saudi Pro League and King's Cup in his first season at the club.",
      "And speaking on international duty this week he has tried to convince Fernandes to join him in Riyadh.",
      "\"I recommend all the players in the national team, of course,\" he said.",

      "After several months of speculation, Cunha completed his £62.5million switch to Old Trafford from Wolves on Sunday, ensuring United made a successful start to this summer's transfer window.",
      "United had earmarked the Brazil international as one of their primary targets several months ago, identifying him as a perfect fit for head coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Thanks to his £62.5m release clause, which United will pay instalments, it was a relatively straightforward deal to get over the line. It also helped that Cunha was so determined to swap Molineux for Old Trafford.",
      "Even after United lost the Europa League final to Tottenham in Bilbao, the prospect of Cunha moving to Old Trafford was never in doubt.",
      "Recruiting a player of that character has instantly secured Cunha some brownie points from United's supporters, who are desperate for the club to sign players this summer that genuinely want to move to Old Trafford.",
      "And that is the criteria Amorim has set when it comes to United's recruitment this summer, admitting in April that he only wants to sign players who want to join United and help the club move forwards, opposed to moving to Old Trafford and using the move as a gateway to the Champions League.",
      "Asked if he had spoken to Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres, who continues to be linked with a move to United, Amorim said: \"I didn't talk to Viktor. But if a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won't come.",
      "\"We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play [in] certain competitions.\"",
      "United will be unable to offer any form of European football to prospective signings for next season having finished 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final, meaning they will be forced to focus on the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup next term.",
      "As damaging as that will be in a financial sense, one thing that could work to United's advantage is that they will develop an understanding of which players want to move to M16 purely for the thrill and excitement of playing for a club steeped in such history.",
      "In Cunha, United have made a good start on that front amid his desire to join the club come what may this summer. United will now be hoping to continue signing players this summer with an identical mindset and hunger to join the club."

      "Cunha's strong and competitive personality will be a good addition to a team that are feeling battered and bruised after a nightmare of a season, though that personality has led to disciplinary issues on the pitch.

      "It has even been suggested that Cunha could follow in the footsteps of United icon Eric Cantona, while for some fans, the £62.5m signing, which will be a spread out over two instalments, is an opportunity to start putting the past season behind them. Reader Dravic says: \"A very encouraging start to the transfer window. A priority signing, plays a position and role we are desperately in need of.

Perhaps the most unlikely of all.",

      "25) Leicester (2015/16)\nNampalys Mendy (Nice, £13m), Ron-Robert Zieler (Hannover 96, £2.6m), Luis Hernandez (Sporting Gijon, free), Raul Uche Rubio (Rayo Vallecano, undisclosed), Ahmed Musa (CSKA Moscow, £16m), Bartosz Kapustka (Cracovia, £7.5m), Islam Slimani (Sporting, £29.7m).",
      "It’s fair to say Mendy didn’t quite rise to the unreasonable challenge of replacing N’Golo Kante and actually, none of this bunch of misfits really rose to the challenge of playing Premier League football.",
      "",
      "24) Chelsea (2009/10)\nYossi Benayoun (Liverpool, £5m), Matej Delac (Inter Zapresic, £2.7m), Tomas Kalac (Sigma Olomouc, £5m).",
      "This sorry trio makes the decision to sack Carlo Ancelotti at the end of the 2010/11 season after finishing second, a year on from the double, all the more absurd.",
      "",
      "23) Manchester City (2011/12)\nJack Rodwell (Everton, £12m), Scott Sinclair (Swansea, £8m), Maicon (Inter Milan, undisclosed), Richard Wright (Preston North End, free), Matija Nastasic (Fiorentina, undisclosed), Javi Garcia (Benfica, £16m).",
      "City were really quite sh*t at transfers before Pep Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain arrived.",
      "",
      "22) Manchester City (2013/14)\nFernando (Porto, £12m), Bacary Sagna (Arsenal, free), Willy Caballero (Malaga, £6m), Eliaquim Mangala (Porto, £32m), Frank Lampard (New York City, loan), Bruno Zuculini (Racing Club, £1.5m).",
      "See, terrible.",
      "",
      "21) Manchester United (2012/13)\nGuillermo Varela (Penarol, £1m), Marouane Fellaini (Everton, £27.5m).",
      "David Moyes was on a hiding to nothing.",
      "",
      "20) Manchester United (1999/00)\nFabien Barthez (Monaco, £7.8m)",
      "He was essentially proof of United being so good that even a liability for a goalkeeper couldn’t knock them off course.",
      "",
      "19) Chelsea (2016/17)\nDanny Drinkwater (Leicester, £35m), Davide Zappacosta (Torino, £23m), Alvaro Morata (Real Madrid, £60m), Willy Caballero (Manchester City, free), Antonio Rudiger (Roma, £34m), Tiemoue Bakayoko (Monaco, £40m), Ethan Ampadu (Exeter, free)",
      "Rudiger is a big reason why Chelsea won a second Champions League, but Drinkwater and Bakayoko have got to be up there with pound-for-pound the worst midfield signings in Premier League history and Alvaro Morata’s Premier League goals cost Chelsea just shy of £4m each.",
      "",
      "18) Chelsea (2014/15)\nPedro (Barcelona, £21.4m), Baba Rahman (FC Augsburg, £17.7m), Asmir Begovic (Stoke, £8m), Kenedy (Fluminense, £6.3m), Nathan (Atletico Paranaense, £4.5m), Papy Djilobodji (Nantes, £2.7m), Danilo Pantic (Partizan Belgrade, £1.25m), Michael Hector (Reading, Undisclosed), Radamel Falcao (AS Monaco, Loan).",
      "We would suggest the excellent addition of Pedro from Barcelona was counteracted somewhat by them signing Baba Rahman for nearly as much money, putting him on £90,000 per week and then inexplicably extending his contract after three years, meaning his seven-year stay at Chelsea cost them nearly £33m. He made 23 appearances.",
      "",
      "17) Manchester City (2023/24)\nSavinho (Troyes, £21m), Ilkay Gundogan (Barcelona, free).",
      "Signing a £50m player from themselves for £21m hasn’t worked out as well as many hoped/feared and Gundogan hasn’t been the Gundogan which left for Barcelona, and crucially, not a Rodri.",
      "",
      "16) Manchester City (2022/23)\nMateo Kovacic (£25m, Chelsea), Josko Gvardiol (£77m, RB Leipzig), Jeremy Doku (£55.5m, Rennes), Matheus Nunes (£53m, Wolves).",
      "Kovacic has been fine and Gvardiol’s probably been the best left-back in the Premier League across his two seasons at the club, but Doku hasn’t lived up to his early promise and there’s been no promise of a positive sort from Nunes.",
      "",
      "15) Manchester City (2020/21)\nJack Grealish (£100m, Aston Villa), Karky (£9m, Fluminense).",
      "We’re guessing the majority would say Grealish has not been a success as Manchester City, but surely a treble is worth far more than £100m and we don’t think they would have done it without him.",
      "",
      "14) Manchester United (2007/08)\nDimitar Berbatov (Tottenham, £31m), Zoran Tosic (Partizan, £5m), Ritchie De Laet (Stoke City, £200k).",
      "Adding Berbatov to a striker canon of Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Danny Welbeck was just plain greedy and speaks to a squad built to the point of not needing to sign anyone.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester United (2008/09)\nAntonio Valencia (Wigan, £16m), Michael Owen (Newcastle, free), Gabriel Obertan (Bordeaux, £3m), Mame Biram Diouf (Molde, undisclosed).",
      "A window saved by Valencia, who was an inspired addition.",
      "",
      "12) Arsenal (2001/02)\nGilberto Silva (Atletico Mineiro, £4.5m), Pascal Cygan (Lille, £2m).",
      "Gilberto was a lovely footballer; Cygan less so.",
      "",
      "11) Liverpool (2019/20)\nKostas Tsimikas (£11.7m, Olympiakos), Thiago (£20m, Bayern Munich), Diogo Jota (£41m, Wolves).",
      "Jota has largely been excellent when fit but Liverpool surely wouldn’t have signed him had they known he would miss 99 games though injury in five years at the club. The definitely wouldn’t have signed Thiago, who missed over 100 games in four years.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester City (2017/18)\nRiyad Mahrez (£60m, Leicester), Philippe Sandler (£2.25m, PEC Zwolle), Daniel Arzani (undisclosed, Melbourne City).",
      "We love Mahrez so, so much and will continue to bat for him being named among the Premier League’s greatest ever wingers. He makes our greatest 10 signings made by Premier League champions list.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea (2004/05)\nMichael Essien (Lyon, £24.5m), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City, £21m), Asier Del Horno (Athletic Club, £9m), Lassana Diarra (Le Havre, £3m).",
      "Essien proved himself well worth what was seen as a massive transfer fee for a midfielder. Wright-Phillips never quite made the grade and Del Horno is best only remembered for charging at a 19-year-old Lionel Messi and being sent off while both of them rolled around on the floor.",
      "",
      "8) Manchester United (2010/11)\nDavid De Gea (Atletico Madrid, £17.8m), Phil Jones (Blackburn, £16.5m), Ashley Young (Aston Villa, £16m).",
      "Four Player of the Year awards makes De Gea arguably one of the best indicators of United’s demise – you don’t want a goalkeeper to be your best player – but it also obviously means he was a successful signing, as was Young, and Jones too, despite a career of wholly unfair p*ss-taking.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea (2005/06)\nAndriy Shevchenko (AC Milan, £31m), John Obi Mikel (Lyn, £16m), Khalid Boulahrouz (Hamburg, £9m), Ashley Cole (Arsenal, £5m), Salomon Kalou (Feyenoord, £1.5m), Michael Ballack (Bayern Munich, free), Hilario (Nacional, free).",
      "Cole and Ballack for a combined £5m is very good going and Kalou was a snip too. Plus we had the whole Mikel in a Manchester United shirt before signing for Chelsea story arc, which was a joy.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal (2003/04)\nManuel Almunia (Celta Vigo, £3.5m), Robin van Persie (Feyenoord, £2.75m), Mathieu Flamini (Marseille, £400k), Arturo Lupoli (Parma, £200k).",
      "Incredible that Almunia cost more than Van Persie. Flamini for less than half a million isn’t bad going either.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United (2000/01)\nJuan Sebastian Veron (Lazio, £28m), Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV, £19m), Roy Carroll, (Wigan, £1.5m), Luke Steele (Peterborough, £400k), Laurent Blanc (Inter, free), Kieran Richardson (West Ham, free).",
      "Veron was the British record transfer at the time and didn’t work out, but they recouped a decent wedge of that fee by duping Chelsea into signing him two years later. Van Nistelrooy entirely made up for that misstep and then some.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United (2002/03)\nCristiano Ronaldo (Sporting, £12m), Kleberson (Atletico Paranaense, £6.5m), Eric Djemba Djemba (Nantes, £3.5m), Tim Howard (MetroStars, £2.5m), David Bellion (Sunderland, £2m).",
      "Quite possibly the worst transfer window of any club ever without the 936-goal elephant in the room.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City (2018/19)\nZach Steffen (£7.2m, Columbus Crew), Angelino (£5.3m, PSV), Rodri (£62.8m, Atletico Madrid), Joao Cancelo (£60m, Juventus), Scott Carson (loan, Derby), Pedro Porro (£11m, Girona), Ryotaro Meshino (£900,000, Gama Osaka).",
      "A middling window without the signing of the current best footballer on the planet as they made a tidy profit on Angelino and, before the Guardiola fallout, Cancelo was arguably the best full-back in the Premier League. But Rodri makes it brilliant, particularly given all the doubts as to how they would ever replace Fernandinho.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United (2006/07)\nAnderson (Porto, £27m), Nani (Sporting, £25m), Owen Hargeaves (Bayern Munich, £17m), Carlos Tevez (West Ham, loan), Tomasz Kuszczak (West Brom, £4m).",
      "Not at all surprising that United won the Premier League three times in four years after this window.",
      "",
      "1) Manchester City (2021/22)\nErling Haaland (£51m, Borussia Dortmund), Stefan Ortega (free, Arminia Bielefeld), Kalvin Phillips (£45m, Leeds), Sergio Gomez (£11m, Anderlecht), Manuel Akanji (£16.7m, Borussia Dortmund).",
      "They could have signed a team of Phillips’ and this still would have been one of the best. Haaland and Akanji from Dortmund is surely among the best double transfer window swoops in history."

      "Liverpool will hope Florian Wirtz can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging.",
      "And no, we don’t mean that time they signed Michael Owen.",
      "",
      "10) Erling Haaland\n“We cannot replace him, we cannot,” said Pep Guardiola through tears induced by Sergio Aguero’s farewell match, in which the Argentinean inevitably scored twice from the bench.",
      "The Manchester City manager had lied equally absurdly a month or so before, stating that “because of the economic situation in the world right now, we are not going to sign a striker next season”.",
      "Haaland arrived in a £200m package soon after and is now within five places of Aguero on the club’s all-time top scorer list after just three seasons. Although it somehow remains unclear whether Manchester City are better without a Proper Striker or not.",
      "READ: Liverpool can easily make top five first transfer windows for Premier League champions this century",
      "",
      "9) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nNot even a mess of medicals could prevent Manchester United from eventually pushing through the British record capture of Van Nistelrooy, the player Sir Alex Ferguson believed would help translate domestic dominance into consistency on the European front.",
      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",
      "Yet Van Nistelrooy left with just one Premier League title, an FA Cup and a League Cup, matched with the solitary Golden Boot he managed to snatch away from arch-nemesis Thierry Henry.",
      "",
      "8) Freddie Ljungberg\nArsene Wenger felt compelled to make an exception for Ljungberg, a player he had never seen in person before sanctioning his purchase from Halmstad in 1998.",
      "“I saw Freddie Ljungberg giving a hell of a lot of problems to Martin Keown while watching him on television as he played for Sweden against England. I decided to buy him then,” the legendary Arsenal manager once said of a Euro 2000 qualifier in which Keown categorically did not feature.",
      "Whoever was tormented by a prodigious Ljungberg, it was to Arsenal’s ultimate benefit. The forward became an Invincible, the club’s second-highest Champions League appearance maker, a winner of five trophies and a wearer of lovely pants.",
      "",
      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",
      "An inability to replace his productivity and knack for stepping up in the biggest games has played a significant role in Manchester City’s recent plight. Jeremy Doku wishes he was as good as peak gloves Mahrez.",
      "",
      "6) Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOne Irish newspaper at the time of a transformative summer for Manchester United wrote that ‘along with Karel Poborsky and Jordi Cruyff, Scandinavian duo Ronny Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Sloksjar signed for a combined fee of £2.7 million’ to ‘make up Fergie’s team of flash continentals’.",
      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",
      "",
      "5) Ashley Cole\nBy the time Cole left Chelsea for Roma after winning seven trophies in eight years, the pawn in the controversial move which saw him swap a fading force for one just establishing itself was retiring from the game completely.",
      "Arsenal wanted £25m for their starting left-back at the start of summer 2006; they eventually relented and settled for £5m plus William Gallas.",
      "It was preposterously good business for Chelsea, who had been routinely rinsed in the market as selling clubs formed an ordinarily queue to see their exploitable riches coming a mile off. They certainly benefited from a situation of their own making with Cole, whose bridges back to Arsenal had been summarily torched, but still.",
      "MORE TRANSFER FEATURES FROM F365\n👉 Florian Wirtz to Liverpool next? Van Dijk tops ranking of all 17 £70m-plus Premier League signings\n👉 Liverpool have moved on from The Coutinho Money to fund transfer masterplan through bank of Brentford",
      "",
      "4) David de Gea\nIt might not be entirely accurate but it does feel as though De Gea single-handedly prevented Manchester United from enduring as catastrophic a season as their most recent on multiple occasions over a 12-year tenure.",
      "He was the original Bruno Fernandes, a tangibly better player than most if not all his teammates yet bizarrely keen to sacrifice the best years of his career to a failing institution. Once that fax machine faltered in 2015 it seemed as though De Gea just accepted his fate as a Manchester United lifer.",
      "The club never was going to show that same loyalty as soon as the Spaniard became dispensable and their handling of his exit was amateurish. But there was a time – after a rough initiation period – when Manchester United almost accidentally possessed the finest keeper in the world.",
      "",
      "3) Rodri\nWith all things being even, it remains the case that a fit, available and peak Rodri guarantees a title win for Manchester City.",
      "The hope is that theory can be properly tested next season, but four Premier League trophies in a row have been sandwiched by a chastening first year spent learning how to foul, and a campaign entirely ruined by a knee injury.",
      "Manchester City collapsed without Rodri in 2024/25 and ongoing negotiations over a substantial pay rise suggest they know precisely how important a role he plays.",
      "",
      "2) Roy Keane\nIt takes a certain type of character to jump from Brian Clough to Alex Ferguson while infuriating Kenny Dalglish in between, but as Keane himself would say, he was just doing his job as the most sought-after midfielder of a generation.",
      "If Blackburn had filed their paperwork properly and Dalglish not taken a sunny July weekend off in 1993, the first Premier League crown under Ferguson might have been marked by no Manchester United incomings whatsoever. But it opened the door to a record-breaking hijack which shaped the club’s future and heralded a glittering and often contemptuous spell.",
      "Keane won a dozen trophies and two Player of the Year awards at Old Trafford, committing to history one of the most iconic individual performances the sport has seen, inspiring the introduction of the prawn sandwich brigade to the game’s lexicon and forlornly challenging the ego of Rio Ferdinand.",
      "",
      "1) Cristiano Ronaldo\nArsene Wenger basically refused to do business with Jorge Mendes again over a perceived betrayal. Liverpool management duo Gerard Houllier and Phil Thompson “almost choked on our food” when the £4m deal they had put in place was obliterated by the announcement of a £12.2m hijack by a bitter rival.",
      "They had finished second and fifth respectively to champions Manchester United, who swooped in late but decisively for the next big thing.",
      "Ronaldo was likely destined for greatness wherever he landed but only a fool could claim his biggest development period would have been better served elsewhere. Ferguson and Old Trafford was the perfect post for the Portuguese to learn; within six stunning years he became the sport’s best and most expensive player.",
      "READ NEXT: Man Utd, Man City and Arsenal fell so far short of every single target",
      "Saudi club Al Nassr are preparing to present a contract ‘plan’ to Cristiano Ronaldo and have added a Liverpool player to their summer shortlist.",

      "Manchester United are set ‘to open talks’ with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo, who ‘has decided he wants to join’ the Red Devils, according to David Ornstein.",
      "The United chiefs are working hard to bolster Amorim’s ailing squad that finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to secure European football after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s £62.5m move from Wolves is imminent, but there is far more work to do this summer amid rumours of several high-profile exits.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told by Amorim that he has no future at the club, while Fernandes is in talks over a big-money move to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal having offered to fall on his sword at the end of the season.",
      "A report on Monday claimed United are ‘lining up’ Sporting’s Pedro Goncalves to play in one of the No.10 spots in Amorim’s system alongside Cunha, but Ornstein has revealed a massive boost in their bid to sign Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "It was claimed last month that United were planning to test the Premier League club’s resolve by putting in a £50m bid for the winger, who got 20 goals and eight assists this season, with Brentford “open” to selling the 25-year-old, who is entering the last 12 months of his contract.",
      "Meanwhile, United are also ‘in talks’  with Udinese over a deal for centre-back Oumar Solet, who moved to the Serie A side in January after four seasons with RB Salzburg.",
      "According to Italian outlet Messaggero Veneto (via The Sun), Solet is ‘likely to leave Udinese’ and will cost United around £34m should they push for his signing this summer.",
      "In an interview with Messaggero Veneto, respected Italian football agent Claudio Pasqualin was asked about Udinese potentially selling Solet quickly.",
      "He replied: “I would say yes, even if they (the owners) have never sold in a hurry. Haste, in this case, could make potential buyers procrastinate, influencing the negotiations, so I believe that the objective (a sale) will be achieved, even if not easily and in a short time.”",
      "The future of academy star Mainoo is also up in the air as he is yet to extend his contract amid interest from Chelsea.",
      "The England international was used sparingly by Amorim in the second half of the season, leading to suggestions he could push for the exit, with United reportedly open to his ‘pure profit’ sale.",
      "But a report on Monday claimed Mainoo ‘will be given the chance to return to his favoured central midfield role even though Amorim previously had trust issues if he is persuaded to sign on the dotted line in the coming months’.",
      "It’s claimed he’s ‘on course to be one of the first names on the teamsheet’ if he extends his contract, with Amorim planning to use him in one of the two central midfield positions in his 3-4-3 despite deploying him further forward in his debut season in charge.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly have to pay more for Bryan Mbeumo this summer after Brentford have become ‘irritated’ by their Premier League rivals.",

      "Manchester United have ‘presented an offer’ of £55m to sign the ‘fantastic’ winger and the Premier League club are ‘open’ to his sale this summer.",
      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",

      "‘GMS sources have been told that Manchester United are eager to make Mainoo faster, stronger and more combative as a central midfielder as it has been acknowledged that upgrading his talent would solve a problem after they have been struggling to find the cash to spend on Atalanta’s Ederson.’",
      "It’s claimed the Red Devils aren’t actively looking to sell him, even if their £70m valuation is met, and will only agree to his departure if Mainoo himself ‘agitates for a move’ to Chelsea – who ‘wait in the wings’ – or to another interested suitor.",

      "Is there a curse on Premier League transfers above £70million? Arsenal’s record signing Declan Rice has helped to buck the trend and the improvement of Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez has improved this list – but it’s still pretty grim.",
      "Including an alarming number of flops, we have ranked the 17 Premier League signings who cost £70million or more.",
      "",
      "17) Romelu Lukaku to Chelsea\nChelsea bought Romelu Lukaku for the second time in 2021, splashing out £97.5m on the Belgian, who was handed another chance to make his mark at Stamford Bridge. He had spent time on loan at West Brom and Everton during his first spell, playing the best football of his Premier League career for the latter.",
      "After a successful permanent move to the Toffees, Lukaku joined Manchester United for big money (more on that soon), before moving to Inter and then returning to Chelsea. Many – F365 included – expected him to be the signing of the season, but he flopped disastrously, digging his own grave by publicly begging Inter to re-sign him.",
      "An ill-advised interview with Sky Italia effectively ended his Chelsea career. He at least earned a loan back to Inter in 2022/23, spent 2023/24 at Roma, and finally departed for good last summer when he signed for Napoli for around £20m.",
      "",
      "16) Jadon Sancho to Manchester United\nManchester United have made some absolute howlers in the transfer market, and Sancho is among the worst. The Red Devils chased the England winger for over a year while he was at Borussia Dortmund before eventually landing him for £73m in 2021.",
      "Fast forward four years and Sancho is finished at Old Trafford. After a productive loan spell back at Dortmund, he joined Conference League winners Chelsea on loan for 2024/25. United stand to make around £25m from a sale.",
      "Arguably the most costly example of ‘Bundesliga tax’, Sancho never found his rhythm for United and any hope of revival disappeared after a public fallout with Erik ten Hag.",
      "MORE: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Alexis, Antony in bottom two, Solskjaer buy top",
      "",
      "15) Antony to Manchester United\nAntony cost a ridiculous £80m during Ten Hag’s first summer at United, with Ajax pocketing a huge fee after the Red Devilsleft it late in the 2022 window.",
      "Known for his flair and his wand of a left foot, Antony scored on his debut against Arsenal, but it was downhill from there. He has more yellow cards (14) than goals (12) or assists (5) in 96 appearances for the Red Devils. Even without the numbers, he’s looked nowhere near a £70m+ player.",
      "His value has crashed to £16.6m on Transfermarkt, and United would’ve been lucky to get even that before his successful loan at Real Betis. Nine goals and five assists in 26 games have raised his stock, but United will still make a massive loss when he inevitably moves on this summer.",
      "",
      "14) Darwin Nunez to Liverpool\nDarwin Nunez is definitely at the right club in terms of fanbase. Liverpool supporters embraced him from day one, making him one of their own. On the pitch, though, he has often looked lost.",
      "Roberto Firmino wasn’t a prolific scorer but made Jurgen Klopp’s side tick – something Darwin has not done. At 26, time is still on his side, but he remains frustratingly raw. Arne Slot appears to have run out of patience, and a summer exit beckons.",
      "",
      "13) Kepa Arrizabalaga to Chelsea\nStill the most expensive goalkeeper of all time, Kepa joined Chelsea for a staggering £72m in 2018.",
      "Since then, he’s lost his Spain place, been replaced by Edouard Mendy – who was signed for around £56m less – and briefly regained his spot, only to lose it again. At one point, it looked like his Chelsea career was over.",
      "Somehow, he found himself as Real Madrid’s No.1 for part of 2023/24 and then shone at Bournemouth this term. He’ll likely join the south coast club permanently. He never justified his fee, but he has at least salvaged his reputation.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe to Arsenal\nPepe cost Arsenal £72m in 2019. There was talk that Unai Emery preferred Wilfried Zaha, but was handed Pepe instead. This Arsenal fan was thrilled at the time. Poor, yet devilishly handsome, sod.",
      "Pepe is widely seen as a flop, but he did have moments. He was crucial in the 2020 FA Cup win, contributing in the semi-final and final. Eighteen goal contributions in his debut season wasn’t awful, just not what you’d want from a big-money signing.",
      "In 2020/21, he hit 21 goal involvements – including 10 league goals – and came second in Arsenal’s Player of the Year vote. But the Gunners finished eighth, so, yeah. He returned to France with Nice, and his contract was terminated in 2023 after no Saudi takers emerged.",
      "",
      "11) Harry Maguire to Manchester United\nSigned for £80m from Leicester in 2019, Maguire did well enough under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to be handed the captaincy – which only added to the pressure already weighing him down.",
      "That pressure might explain his struggles. His resurgence in 2023/24, after being stripped of the armband, suggests as much. £80m was clearly too much, but he hasn’t been that bad.",
      "",
      "10) Paul Pogba to Manchester United\nWhat a player on his day. Pogba returned to United in 2016 for a world-record £89m after being released by the club four years earlier.",
      "His first season was actually very good – nine goals, six assists, and two trophies under Jose Mourinho. He scored in the Europa League final win over Ajax. But that was as good as it got.",
      "He posted decent numbers in 17/18 and 18/19 but injuries and inconsistency plagued his second stint. He left again for free in 2022 and is currently a free agent due to a doping ban. A strange, often frustrating career.",
      "",
      "9) Wesley Fofana to Chelsea\nChelsea chased Fofana for a while before finally coughing up around £70m. There was even talk of him breaking Maguire’s record fee for a defender.",
      "He made just 17 Premier League appearances in 2022/23 and missed all of last season with yet another serious injury. After a promising start to 2024/25, he got injured and dropped down the pecking order behind Trevoh Chalobah and Levi Colwill.",
      "He hasn’t played since March and has only featured twice in 2025. Injuries are absolutely ruining his career.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United\nBetween Chelsea stints, Lukaku found himself at Old Trafford after United paid £75m following his prolific Everton spell (87 goals in 166 games).",
      "He never looked a good fit, but 55 goal contributions in 96 games isn’t terrible. And being sold for just £8m less than he cost keeps this spell off the disaster list.",
      "",
      "7) Kai Havertz to Chelsea\nChelsea paid £72m for Havertz and got a Champions League-winning goal out of it. That’s enough to secure his legacy, but the rest of his time in blue was underwhelming.",
      "They somehow sold him to Arsenal for £65m – a miracle, given his numbers. He’s found form again as a striker under Mikel Arteta, but in terms of Chelsea value for money, he just about breaks even.",
      "",
      "6) Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea\nBritish record signing Enzo Fernandez joined in January 2023 for a reported £107m. He didn’t do much wrong – but didn’t do much, full stop – until Enzo Maresca arrived.",
      "After starring at the 2022 World Cup, Fernandez struggled under multiple managers, but 2024/25 saw him thrive. He’s still not quite justified the fee, but he’s well on the way.",
      "READ: Top 10 Premier League transfer overpays of all time includes two Man Utd players",
      "",
      "5) Josko Gvardiol to Manchester City\nCity usually nail transfers, especially big ones. Josko Gvardiol arrived as one of the best young defenders in the world, though early struggles led some to believe Nathan Ake was still first choice.",
      "But the Croatian adapted quickly and was arguably the Premier League’s best defender in the second half of 2023/24. He dipped slightly after that, but so did all of City. No cause for concern.",
      "",
      "4) Jack Grealish to Manchester City\nCity paid £100m for Grealish, which is still eye-watering. He took time to adapt to Pep Guardiola’s system, and goal numbers remained modest – but he was vital in their Treble-winning season.",
      "Sixteen goal contributions in 2022/23 doesn’t tell the full story; he was key. However, after a disappointing 2024/25, a summer exit feels likely.",
      "",
      "3) Moises Caicedo to Chelsea\nCaicedo’s debut performance against West Ham could be described as catastrophic and it set the tone for an uncertain first few months.",
      "But slowly, Caicedo grew into the role. By the end of the 2023/24 season, he was a dependable, all-action midfield presence – and under Enzo Maresca, he’s been a revelation. His energy, tactical awareness and ball-winning ability make Chelsea tick, and while £115m still looks wild on paper, he’s been brilliant this season. Easily one of the best midfielders in the league.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice to Arsenal\nDeclan Rice has been sensational since joining Arsenal for £105m in the summer of 2023. Signed as a statement of intent, the England international has done more than justify the fee – he’s become the heartbeat of Arteta’s side.",
      "Whether deployed as a deep-lying six or a box-to-box eight, Rice has delivered elite performances. He reads the game superbly, breaks up play, leads by example and chips in with big goals – including a few belting free-kicks. His consistency and mentality have lifted Arsenal a level.",
      "This is the kind of transfer clubs dream of. No drama, no adaptation period, no regrets. Just class.",
      "",
      "1) Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool\nThis was never in doubt. Liverpool spent £76m on Virgil van Dijk in January 2018 and got one of the greatest defenders the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "His impact was instant. Liverpool went from leaky and flaky to serious contenders overnight. Within 18 months, they’d won the Champions League. Then came the Premier League title. Van Dijk became PFA Player of the Year, UEFA Men’s Player of the Year and finished second in the Ballon d’Or.",
      "More than the trophies or individual accolades, it’s the sheer authority he brought to Liverpool’s backline that stands out. Calm, dominant, and impossibly consistent – he remains the gold standard for defensive signings.",
      "READ NOW: Man Utd, Man City and Arsenal fell so far short of every single target",

      "",
      "19) Roony Bardghji (FC Copenhagen)\nHe’s been injured for almost as long as he has been linked with Tottenham.",

      "",
      "17) Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)\nWolves, Fulham and Sporting Lisbon have all been interested in the pocket rocket.",
      "",
      "16) Alex Meret (Napoli)\nWon Serie A as Napoli’s first-choice goalkeeper and so the smart money is on a two-year extension.",
      "",
      "15) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr)\nRonaldo reportedly wants the club to sack their manager, director and presumably half the players; he’s the Saudi Pro League top scorer but he has only one trophy to show for two-and-a-half years in the desert. He is hot property ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Mario Pasalic (Atalanta)\nSpent six years at Chelsea without playing a single game but has played almost 300 matches for Atalanta. Neither club nor player is likely to call an end to that in the summer; an extension is very likely.",
      "",
      "13) Kenny Tete (Fulham)\nAfter a one-year extension was triggered last summer, there is talk of the can being kicked even further down the road.",

      "",
      "10) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026. The problem? He is perma-injured.",
      "",
      "9) Kyle Walker-Peters (Southampton)\nHe has more than served his dues and a whole host of mid-table Premier League sides should be interested after he exits the club following a second relegation.",
      "",
      "8) CG Egan-Riley (Burnley)\nA mainstay of one of the meanest defences in Championship history, and it looks like it might earn him a move to Strasbourg.",

      "4) Olivier Boscagli (PSV)\nThe ball-playing centre-half looks bound for Brighton despite some interest from Inter.",

      "3) Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\nThe departure has already been announced for perhaps Manchester City’s greatest player. MLS seems a likely next career move, though there is some cheeky talk of Liverpool, which we absolutely love.",
      "",
      "2) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nThe talk from Munich was that Bayern would not make Sane a new contract offer until March/April because his performances lacked consistency. And he’s since been named Bayern Player of the Month for March. But the two parties are far enough apart to apparently alert Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham.",
      "",
      "1) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool? Tottenham Hotspur, Juventus, Napoli, Newcastle United and Aston Villa have all been linked and it seems that Napoli may emerge top of the pile.",
      "Including an alarming number of flops, Virgil van Dijk and Declan Rice, we have ranked the 17 Premier League signings who cost £70m or more.",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold has finally been confirmed as a Real Madrid player, but the fee they will pay to land him for the Club World Cup has been disputed.",

      "I say let him return home and bring in Benitez. United can not shore up the defence, that is a Rafa specially. United need to punch above their current financial might, that is another Rafa specially. I don’t even think the United fans could hate him after the shitshow of finish 2 places above relegation and losing the worst European final in living memory to “Lads, it’s Spurs”.",

Look at what he achieved at Chelsea with the fans booing him every game… Imagine what he could achieve with the squad United have, the support they have and the Stadium they play in. It’s a stone cold fact.",

      "The chilling lesson that we should all be pondering is that, given City’s all conquering exploits from last year, the clear message is that this type of success is going to become the domain of fewer and fewer clubs, run by nation states or billionaires with unlimited funds, just like the NFL, with the obvious end game being a super league.",

When you are spending huge amounts of money on players like James Mannequin and Dominic ‘W**ky’ Solanke you aren’t going to challenge consistently in the league. Their better players are on the wane anyway, and I wouldn’t take anyone they have on a free transfer, let alone pay a fee, if I was a Premier League team in the top half of the table.",

      "Ronaldo is out of contract in Saudi Arabia at the end of June, and he recently hinted that his Al Nassr journey is coming to an end.",
      "He wrote on social media: “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”",

      "Transfer journalist Jorge Nicola reported that the 40-year-old has been offered “a percentage of shares”, with Textor eager to sign the Manchester United legend ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "“This offer includes the possibility of becoming a partner with John Textor in his clubs,” Nicola said.",
      "“Ronaldo continues to play at a very high level and Al-Nassr has suggested an extension there worth €16.5 million a month [£88m].",

      "“Ronaldo has not yet responded but there is an enormous expectation of seeing him become a Botafogo player for the Club World Cup.”",

      "What the hell were Manchester United doing in Malaysia? Are they mad? They should all be lying down in a dark room, trying to forget how bad they’ve been. It’s like they’re just pretending everything is normal when it’s an absolute bin fire. This is no way to run a business and certainly not a football club.",
      "It doesn’t take the wisdom of Solomon to realise a) earning £7.8million from a trip to Malaysia is peanuts which they routinely fritter away on poor players and which they could surely drum up through a commercial deal for United-endorsed pressed duck feet or something, b) they’ll ruin the brand further by losing games and playing poorly, c) the players will be exhausted and humiliated by being beaten, which means they’ll not be rested or inspired for a new season, meaning more failure, and d) there’s a limit to how much you can charge to see such a terrible team, putting off more fans than they can attract, making them feel resentful towards the club. Things are going downhill and fast, aided by Airhead Jim’s lack of basic business acumen.",
      "The club clearly sees the players like donkeys at the beach, forgetting that they are actually human. Does anyone think the best way to get over an appalling season is to get booed off in Malaysia? Actually booed off in Kuala Lumpur by people who had paid up to £260 to witness these sweating bodies being hopeless. These have been loyal followers, prepared to pay to see the club, even in the knowledge it likely won’t be the first team.",
      "That is no way to enhance your brand, to say the least. Do you think they’ll keep buying merchandise in these circumstances? You do, don’t you, Ratcliffe, you fool.",
      "Only a mean, insensitive cretin like thick-as-a-brick Jim would think this is a good idea. The manager obviously doesn’t have any confidence, saying, “We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game – that is what happened. I always feel guilty for the performance of the team since the first game I was here,” as he continues his ‘please sack me’ campaign in earnest.",
      "This sort of overseas tour fails to see that every season is just one part of every year; what you do in the summer influences what happens in the new campaign. Players don’t just reboot in mid-August and start fresh again and I really don’t think this is appreciated. Given that pre-season will start in mid-July and internationals are in the second week of June, they’ve all got about four weeks’ rest, unless Stupid Wurzel has got another trip planned, probably to the Arctic to play Eskimos.",
      "They obviously need a good rest and a re-set, not flogging even harder. They’re no good and don’t play well together, but it’s not a lack of games to blame. The football matters. It should be at the core but it seems almost incidental. Losing to sides you should easily beat just makes everything, on all levels, worse. Just playing terribly in more games isn’t going to make them improve. Even winning occasionally has proved to be nothing but a blip in a long-term trend.",
      "Failure is endemic and needs correcting from the boardroom to the pitch. And to do all this just after the season ended seems more akin to punishment. And don’t forget, players need to be sold and desperately. Given how mediocre they are, exposing their inadequacy is probably a bad idea if you want to get rid of them (and why wouldn’t you?) and want to get a decent price for them.",
      "They already have little or no leverage as it is; getting beaten in Malaysia just makes it easier for buyers to drive down the price, giving them less money to replace them with. How did this stupid actually become a billionaire?",
      "These things don’t take a degree in Business Studies to work out. It seems there is no limit to some people’s ability to see black as white as they go about their business, doubtless wondering who broke all the china in the shop and sh*t up the walls, completely unaware it’s them.",
      "It’s clear the people involved in driving this juggernaut don’t know where they’re going, haven’t even got a driving licence and are wearing a blindfold. Put more prosaically, they’re sh*te. The trouble is, they don’t realise, even as they plough the juggernaut into the sea. They think they’re great and can do no wrong, even as the once-great edifice crumbles to dust at their feet. Their delusion is total. But you can’t tell stupid people they’re stupid because they’re too stupid to understand.",
      "Their obsession with generating money is making them worse and effectively crippling them. I repeat, £7.8 million, that’s all they’re generating by doing this. That’s 10% of an Antony. It’ll pay a player’s wages for approximately four months. In return they get a knackered, demoralised squad and a devalued, reviled brand. Is it worth it? Only a fool would say yes. But that’s exactly who is in charge. Shambolic."

      "The 25-year-old is a player United have admired for a while and he is seen as a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system.",
      "They will face competition for his signature with a number of Premier League clubs keen on the player.",
      "With doubts over the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes, United are looking to act quickly in the market to give Amorim as much time with his players ahead of the new season.",

      "Brentford will listen to offers for Mbeumo, and Yoane Wissa, but they are not under any pressure to sell any of their players.",
      "There is a feeling within the club that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "The feeling is he still has plenty to offer top level European football.",
      "United do not want to sell their captain, despite a potential lucrative offer from Al Hilal, which could be worth up to £100m. He has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year.",

      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 08:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is reportedly open to the project too.",
      "There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "Monday 2 June 2025 07:39, UK",
      "Manchester United have announced an agreement for the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Cunha will become Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer as he looks to rebuild a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League - and the club have moved swiftly to seal the transfer on the opening day of the window.",
      "The 26-year-old is set to sign a five-year deal at United with the option for a further year.",
      "Cunha leaves Wolves as a club-record sale after United met his £62.5m release clause, agreeing to a structure of payment over two years. His signing is subject to visa and registration, say United.",
      "Cunha, who is set to play as a No 10 for United, scored 17 goals and provided six assists for Wolves last season.",
      "Wolves are happy Cunha's move has gone through as quickly as possible. The release clause which was inserted in his new contract in January has protected their position.",
      "Nobody at Wolves wanted a long drawn out saga involving the player during the summer. They will receive the full release clause in the terms set out in the contract - in three instalments payable by the summer of 2027. United were initially offering to pay in five instalments.",
      "Wolves expect to be busy this summer to build on the progress made under Vitor Pereira last season. They proved they were not a one-man team with their results and performances when Cunha was suspended.",
      "United have been keeping an eye on Cunha's development since his impressive display for Wolves at Old Trafford in the opening match of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Despite interest from other teams, Cunha wanted to play for United. He thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and was not deterred by them missing out on Champions League football following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United are understood to have been impressed with Cunha's desire to join, whether they had European football or not.",
      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among those who held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "\"Day one of this mini transfer window and Manchester United have confirmed their first signing.",
      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",
      "\"So Manchester United will have to pay a third of that transfer fee now and then the other two will come at the end of the next two seasons.",
      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I'm sure that United will hope that now they've got someone like Cunha coming to the club, it might pave the way for way for other players.",
      "\"United still have that pulling power and the Cunha signing demonstrates that.",
      "\"This summer transfer window is going to be really important for United, particularly because it is Amorim's first summer transfer window.",

      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."

      "Monday 2 June 2025 12:20, UK",
      "Speaking to Matheus Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."

      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 09:47, UK",
      "Al Hilal are willing to make Bruno Fernandes one of the best-paid players in the world and pay £100m to sign the Manchester United captain.",
      "Fernandes' agent Miguel Pinho has been in Riyadh for talks with senior Al Hilal executives.",
      "Saudi Pro League insiders believe it is a positive sign for Al Hilal that Pinho has travelled to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al Hilal are willing to almost treble Fernandes' £250,000-a-week wages at Old Trafford.",
      "It is up to the player now to decide what he wants to do, although head coach Ruben Amorim believes his skipper wants to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "When asked if Fernandes had played his last game for United in their 3-1 friendly win over Hong Kong, Amorim replied: \"I do not think so. I do not know for sure, nobody knows, but I do not think so.",
      "\"I think he wants to stay, he is saying 'no' to a lot of things, but it shows that he wants to win and he is really good and needs to be in the best league in the world.",
      "\"Yes [we can turn down a £100m bid], we can find another way to earn money.",
      "\"Of course I am the manager, the coach, but sometimes it is the decision of the player, but of course I talk with him, I explain things and I just have that feeling. When you talk to someone, you have that feeling if he wants to stay.",
      "\"Of course in a lot of games this season he was so frustrated, but he knows what we are doing. The feeling that I have every time I speak to him is he wants to continue for sure at Man Utd. But you never know.\"",

      "Al Hilal expect to have at least one big-name signing and a new head coach when they play in the Club World Cup in the United States in June.",
      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is staying.",
      "\"I just watched Ruben Amorim there and he would have been told by his media handlers that 'you're going to be asked about this story, it's a massive story - just play it with a straight bat and say he's a Manchester United player and he's got two years left on his contract, I'm not going to talk about media speculation'.",
      "\"He didn't do that, he came out and he gave us quite a lot.",
      "\"You could tell he's spoken to Bruno Fernandes and Fernandes has said to him, 'I've got this incredible offer, it's like I've won EuroMillions, £200m over three years This is life-changing money boss but you know I'm not motivated by money. I love football, I love Manchester United'.",
      "\"I think he's sat down and spoken to Ruben Amorim and he's told him he is an integral part of the rebuild at Manchester United. I think he's happy to stay.",
      "\"The clock is ticking for Al Hilal because they are playing in the Club World Cup.",
      "\"They don't have a head coach, they've been trying to sign (Cristiano) Ronaldo, they've been trying to sign Bruno Fernandes, they're trying to get Simone Inzaghi out of Inter.",
      "\"There is a lot going on at Al Hilal because they are flying the flag for Saudi Arabia at the Club World Cup. But looking at Ruben Amorim today I think it's pretty clear and final that Bruno Fernandes is going to stay.\"",
