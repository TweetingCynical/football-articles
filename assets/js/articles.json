      "Alejandro Garnacho appeared seething at being dropped to the bench for Manchester United's Europa League final with Tottenham. Ruben Amorim opted to leave the Argentine winger out of his starting line-up - and the star was late joining his fellow substitutes in warming up on the pitch.",
      "Garnacho spent at least 15 minutes chatting to Tottenham defender Sergio Reguilon, who has a spell on loan at United last season, on the pitch, still wearing his suit, while the rest of United's squad were getting changed and preparing to go out for the warm-up.",
      "But Garnacho was the last to emerge, joining the rest of the subs a good 10 minutes after they had started their warm-up. He also posted an Instagram picture seven hours before kick-off, which featured snaps of him scoring against Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final triumph.",
      "That social media post has led to suggestions that Garnacho was already aware of his snub for the big occasion. That is despite the Argentine stepping up in the last final United played in, helping to deliver their most recent trophy.",
      "He's by no means a regular for the Red Devils and was linked with the exit door back in January. His latest snub though looks to have particularly stung given the magnitude of the occasion. Garnacho was previously on an upward curve in Manchester, but Amorim has cited issues with his game and has chosen to name him among the subs.",
      "Whilst the Argentine has lost out Mason Mount looks to have gained with the ex-Chelsea man enjoying a renaissance after a spell out injured. He's got the nod with Amorim citing the added dynamic he gives the XI",
      "Garnacho previously frustrated Amorim with his reaction to being substituted back in February. He was hauled off in a win over Ipswich but stormed straight down the tunnel. Amorim has clearly chosen to back experience at the San Mames with a number of his starters accustomed to such occasions.",
      "He said: \"If you look at the team Casemiro is used to playing these kind of games, Bruno [Fernandes] is always there, Maguire has played in European games for his national team.\""

      "Paul Scholes admits the \"lads, it's Tottenham\" expression is \"derogatory\" - but concedes he and Manchester United always felt confident when they came up against the north London outfit.",
      "The two teams will square off in an all-Premier League Europa League final with Tottenham eyeing a fourth win over the Manchester outfit this season, but it is the Red Devils who go in as favourites with Champions League football on the line for the winner.",
      "Throughout Scholes' time in red United were the dominant side in England and Tottenham were never a threat, albeit they were building towards the end. Sir Alex Ferguson famously came into the United dressing room before a clash with the London side.",
      "Rather than giving a big speech he simply said 'Lads, it's Tottenham' with those three words standing the test of time. It has been used to belittle Tottenham's stature and mentality with Scholes opening up on their approach to games against them.",
      "Spurs legend Glenn Hoddle responded and said: \"Maybe in that dressing room Ange is saying, 'Listen lads, it's only Man Utd.'\"",
      "Tottenham go into the Europa League final wanting to end a trophy drought that dates back to 2008. Since then they've suffered several near misses, losing out in semi-finals and finals as the narrative around them continues.",
      "Ange Postecoglou is looking to succeed where the likes of Jose Mourinho, Antonio Conte and Mauricio Pochettino failed and is 90 minutes away from delivering a trophy - which the Australian has placed above the potential riches of making the Champions League.",
      "He said: \"It's a great prize and you know the significance of Champions League qualification, and what it means for every football club. There are obvious benefits, you also get the opportunity to play against the best on the continent. But, the club has been in the Champions League before. We haven't won a trophy for a long time, so that's most important.\"",
      "Micky van de Ven admits he was mocked when he joined Tottenham with their lack of success often bought up. He said: “It will be a big thing, of course, because everybody knows that when you join Tottenham, you get the words through of: ‘Ah, you’re not going to win a trophy, you will be trophyless for the rest of your career. All the guys that came up here were like: ‘We’re going to change something about this club'.\""

      "Some eight members of the Glazer family are in attendance in Bilbao for Manchester United's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Despite recently celebrating 20 years in charge of the Red Devils, the Glazers are still deeply unpopular in Manchester due to the debt that has been heaped upon the club during their time in charge, as well as a lack of progress in redeveloping Old Trafford.",
      "The family very rarely attend home matches due to security concerns, but they are out in force in the Basque Country where they will hope to see United win the second Europa League title of their time in charge, and third European trophy.",
      "According to a VIP list seen by the Daily Mail, co-owner Joel Glazer and co-chairman Avram Glazer are enjoying the plush surroundings of the VIP suite, where they can enjoy food prepared by Michelin star chefs, along with six other members of their family - Aerin, Ed, Shari, Kendall, Jill and Libby.",
      "Minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is also unsurprisingly seated in the VIP section, along with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy who will be desperate to see Spurs end their 17-year trophy drought in Bilbao.",
      "Other names on the list include the former United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, and forward Dimitar Berbatov who also played for Spurs.",
      "Ex-Spurs stars Ledley King and Gary Mabbutt are also in the VIP section, as well as Liverpool's 2005 Champions League winning manager Rafael Benitez and ex-Nottingham Forest and Leicester boss Steve Cooper.",
      "Portugal legend Luis Figo is also on the list, while the English FA are represented by president Debbie Hewitt and chief executive Mark Bullingham, and Premier League chief Richard Masters and PFA CEO Maheta Molango are also at the game.",
      "Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor is also in attendance fresh from seeing the Eagles win the FA Cup and qualify for next season's Europa League, while former Ireland goalkeeper Packie Bonner is also on the VIP list."

      "Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur have plenty on the line when they face off in Bilbao. The Europa League trophy is enough of an incentive itself, while Champions League qualification will be a welcome bonus, but the prize money isn't too bad either.",
      "Both teams navigated the new league phase, finishing in the top eight to avoid an extra play-off round. Both were also put to the test during the knockout rounds, but reached the final after home-and-away victories against Athletic Club and Bodo/Glimt respectively in the semis.",
      "According to official UEFA figures, the two finalists are each guaranteed a little over £5.9million just for making it to Bilbao. They'll nearly double it with a win, though, with an extra £5.06m going to whoever comes out on top at San Mames.",
      "That's about half of what the Champions League winners will earn. Whichever of Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain wins that tournament will receive £21.1m, compared to just shy of £11m for the Europa League winners.",
      "Those numbers are just for the knockout runs, with all 36 teams in the Europa League's league phase entitled to £3.63m as well as further payouts based on results. A reward of around £380,000 per win and £126,500 per draw means both United and Spurs earned seven-figure sums for their league phase performances.",
      "That's only part of the story, though. Due to the two teams' lowly Premier League positions, neither will be in Europe next season unless they win at San Mames.",
      "The winners will scoop an estimated £100m for making it into the Champions League, with a chance to boost that total even more by reaching the latter stages of that tournament next season. And United boss Ruben Amorim has sent a message to the fans and to his players ahead of the game.",
      "“It’s hard. It’s not enough, winning the Europa League. It’s not enough for all the support the fans gave us this season,\" Amorim said. “But we’re really excited for the final. It's really important, massive for us, and we want to give that to our fans.",
      "“I feel it's a mixed feeling. I'm really excited but, at the same time, I know my responsibility as Manchester United coach. I have always that feeling of frustration for the season, so I want really badly to help the team win this final. We've got to give something to the club, to the fans, to the staff, to everybody.”"

      "The two sets of Premier League fans have descended on the Spanish city ahead of the Europa League final on Wednesday night. It is estimated more than 80,000 fans have travelled despite the stadium itself only holding 50,000. Thousands of Tottenham fans gathered along two major avenues in the centre of Bilbao which bought traffic to a halt as they drank beer and sang late into Tuesday night.",
      "Fans climbed lampposts, destroyed traffic lights and vandalised other property as shocked residents looked on. Izaro Laka, 65, who lives close to where they had gathered told the Daily Mail: \"I’ve never seen people so drunk and behaving so badly. The English are yobs and all they want to do when they come to Spain is drink and cause trouble.",

      "United fans also took over the Plaza Neuva, situated in the heart of Bilbao’s old town. It was soon draped with the team's colours as fans let off red flares and clambered onto tables and chairs with alcohol consumption continuing to rack up.",
      "Another individual who is a regular at the Sorginzulo bar in Plaza Nueva, considered one of the finest in the city, said: \"We love our football in Bilbao, but the conduct of these people disgusts me. I don’t understand why they behave like this, they should be ashamed of themselves.",
      "\"This part of Bilbao is very beautiful and historic, tourists love coming here. But we don’t want people like this, our lives have been disrupted and I can’t wait for them to go home.\"",
      "It was also reported that the two sets of fans clashed in San Sebastian and Santander, which is some 50 miles away from Bilbao, but is where where many supporters have chosen to stay due to the hotel prices around the San Mames.",
      "One 80-year-old resident in Bilbao said: \"It's only the English that do this. They get very drunk, that's the main problem. I'm sure a lot of them are very nice when they're sober but once they've had a drink they become hooligans.\""

      "Canada striker Jonathan David will be a wanted man this summer as he prepares to leave Lille on a free transfer. Manchester United are among the clubs in the mix for the Ligue 1 hotshot, but his international boss Jesse Marsch doesn't expect him to go anywhere without a guarantee of first team football.",
      "David will be one of the leading men for Canada as they look to get out of the group stage at a men's World Cup for the first time. They picked up just one point in Qatar in 2022, but enter the 2026 edition as co-hosts along with the United States and Mexico.",
      "25-year-old striker David is already his country's all-time top scorer, but enters this summer with a big decision to make. And it's one with former Leeds boss Marsch - who led Canada to third place in the CONCACAF Nations League in March - has shed some light on what the frontman will think about ahead of his upcoming move.",
      "“Knowing Johnny, he is going to want to play,” Marsch told reporters as Canada named a preliminary squad ahead of this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup. “He’s going to want to go to the best club he can be at. And I think achieve the most in terms of what it would mean to compete for trophies in Europe.",
      "\"But he’s going to want to play as well. And I think that’s important. I think the most important thing for him is, it’s not good if he goes somewhere and then he has to play on the bench a lot and not get minutes to keep himself sharp and fit and ready to go, especially with the World Cup being a year away.”",
      "United are among a number of sides keen on David, who scored 109 goals across 232 games for Lille. Napoli are also reported to have held talks with a view to a swoop, while Inter Milan have also been linked.",
      "If the forward joins Inter, Marsch wouldn't expect him to feature in the Gold Cup. That tournament overlaps with the Club World Cup, where Inter have been drawn in a group with River Plate, Urawa Red Diamonds and Monterrey.",
      "Lille finished fifth in Ligue 1 this season, securing Europa League football next term. However, ahead of the final game of the season, David confirmed it would be his last.",
      "\"I wanted you to hear from me that after five years at the club, it's time to say goodbye,\" he said on Instagram. \"I've spent five amazing years in Lille.I know it hasn't been the easiest, but I hope that my goals and celebrations have brought you joy and happiness. It's been a long and fun ride, and especially with those two titles that we won together, I think [that] makes the story even better.\"",
      "He also shared a message to his team-mates, coaches and club staff, before addressing the fans once more and saying: \"I know the beginning wasn't the easiest, we had some hard moments, but I think that with your support and your help it has helped me flourish throughout all these years and make me the player I am today.\""

      "Donny van de Beek has claimed his injury struggles date back to his time warming the bench at Manchester United. The Dutchman was signed in 2020 but was unable to ever make himself a regular.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer spent £35million to land the versatile attacker, but only made us of him sporadically as Van de Beek's frustration mounted. He scored on his debut but was rarely preferred to Bruno Fernandes with his minutes very much at a premium.",
      "He's since left, joining Girona in Spain, but has continued to battle an Achilles issue. The Dutchman has enjoyed far more minutes than he did at Old Trafford but clearly still has a chip on his shoulder when it comes to his underwhelming stint in Manchester.",
      "Solskjaer continued to defend his lack of use of the player, but in the years since Van de Beek's health has been a battle. He confessed that the time he spent as a sub means his body was less accustomed to the intensity of playing regularly.",
      "He told SportBible: \"It’s difficult to build rhythm and confidence when you’re constantly being sidelined. It’s hard to be at your best when you're in and out of the team, and I think when you're not playing regularly. Your body isn’t used to the intensity and you become more prone to injuries. The lack of consistent minutes didn’t help either.\"",
      "Van de Beek's goal on his debut did little to aid his cause and even when he would impress he was quickly returned to his bench role. He also admits the random cameos did nothing for his case with bit part minutes not helping him become a regular.",
      "He said: \"I think I deserved more chances, especially in my first year. I didn’t play all the time, but when I did, I had some good games. I was convinced I would get more opportunities. I felt good, and thought, ‘Okay, my time will come’ but for some reason, it didn’t happen. After a year or two, it gets harder because if you don’t get a longer run of games then it’s difficult to prove yourself.\"",
      "Van de Beek would score the last goal of the Solskjaer era as he came off the bench to score what would be a consolation during a 4-1 loss at Watford. The Norwegian was forced to defend his use of the player on several occasions and claimed leaving him on the bench spoke to the quality of the squad.",
      "\"I think it says a lot about our depth of quality in the squad that we don't have to use him every single game,\" he said.",
      "Despite that claim Van de Beek would make just four starts in his only full season under Solskjaer and things didn't change when Erik ten Hag, who coached him at Ajax, came on board before he eventually left Manchester."

      "He has gone on to become one of the club's key players, if not their most important. However, it's evident that Fernandes still holds a major soft spot for Leões, as evidenced by a call with João Reis that left him crying tears of joy.",
      "Sporting were crowned Liga Portugal winners on Saturday after beating Vitória Guimarães 2-0 on home soil, finishing two points clear of rivals Benfica. And it appears as though the club which put Fernandes on the world stage hasn't forgot about him, with Reis - who is described by his professional LinkedIn account as the club's U16 strength and conditioning coach - quick to call the 30-year-old in jubilation.",
      "Speaking about the call, Fernandes told Sport TV: \"Much happiness and gratitude for everything I lived in Sporting.",
      "\"It is a club for which I have enormous affection, a huge passion. I was as happy or happier than all those who were celebrating. Unfortunately, I could not be there, but I will still celebrate many titles in Marquês.",
      "\"I would have liked to have been there to congratulate the players, coaches and staff. I was able to do it with those who are here [Ruben Amorim and company] and who were part of this, congratulate them.",

With 63 goals and 50 assists across 137 games, Fernandes lifted a Taca de Portugal with the side, as well as two Taca da Ligas - with the Primeira Liga that the club achieved this year coming as one of the very few titles that evaded him during his own three-year stint.",
      "Another United figure who will undoubtedly be celebrating Sporting's recent success is manager Ruben Amorim, who left the Portuguese outfit in November to join the Red Devils. While Amorim and Fernandes never crossed paths together in their homeland's capital, the two have forged a formidable partnership at Old Trafford, despite a lacklustre string of results for United in the Premier League this season.",
      "The Red Devils currently sit 16th in the league with just one game remaining to play, with Amorim having managed just seven victories since succeeding Erik ten Hag. However, the side's fortunes could change on Wednesday night when they face a Spurs side - who are also struggling domestically - in the final of the Europa League.",

      "Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou have been told that even victory in the Europa League final might not be enough to save their jobs. The two under-pressure managers lead Manchester United and Tottenham in the high stakes match in Bilbao on Wednesday evening knowing the game will define their seasons.",
      "Both teams have endured a miserable season in the Premier League, with United 16th and Spurs 17th, making victory in the Basque Country vital. As well as giving their fans something to cheer, a win would automatically guarantee a place in the 2025/26 Champions League – a significant factor financially and in terms of attracting new players this summer.",
      "Spurs have not lifted a trophy since the League Cup in 2008, while Amorim knows victory would significantly alter the perception of his debut campaign, having failed to make an impact since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "It is an intriguing backdrop to the match at the San Mames Stadium, but former Tottenham midfielder Steffen Freund thinks the result may be a moot point. The German believes that, realistically, the decisions of those in power won’t be swayed by 90 minutes.",
      "“So I think maybe both coaches will go after the game. I don’t like that, but think about Man United: most of the coaches have been sacked – [Louis] van Gaal after an FA Cup win, [Erik] ten Hag after an FA Cup win – so that’s how it is in the football business. And as a coach, I would love to see both coaches keep going.”",
      "There have been widespread reports that Postecoglou could be sacked by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, regardless of whether he comes good on his promise to win silverware in his second season. The Australian was combative in his pre-match press conference, pushing back against a journalist who suggested that he would be perceived as a “clown” if he loses.",
      "He has tried to play down the importance of the occasion, but Spurs veteran Son Heung-min knows what victory would mean. “It’s going to be a huge, huge moment for both of us and also for the boys if we win it,” the Spurs skipper said.",
      "“As we always say, the first step is going to be really hard, but if you win that trophy, we can change the mentality, we can change the history and hopefully we can continue to compete for another trophy.”"

      "Manchester United have identified four players who are off the table for any potential sales in the upcoming summer transfer window as Ruben Amorim plans to overhaul his squad. United have endured a disappointing season under new boss Amorim, who took over following Erik ten Hag's dismissal in October.",
      "Currently, the Red Devils languish 16th in the Premier League with a mere 10 victories in the entire 2024/25 campaign - three of which were secured under Ten Hag. With the Europa League final against Tottenham being the club's last chance for silverware this season, significant changes may be required over the summer if Amorim hopes to restore United's former glory.",
      "The reality is that the 40-year-old strategist has found it challenging to adapt the squad he inherited from Ten Hag's reign to his distinctive style of play, with pundits like Gary Neville suggesting that at least six new faces are needed in the first team ahead of next season. However, the board may need to sell stars before they can bring in new talent, as demonstrated by their modest business in January, which saw them spend just £26million on Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu.",
      "It's believed that minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe is looking to boost United's transfer budget this summer with the permanent departures of three stars currently out on loan. Marcus Rashford has been showcasing his skills at Aston Villa since January after it became clear he didn't fit into Amorim's plans, while Antony is currently enjoying a stint with Real Betis, and Jadon Sancho is at Chelsea.",
      "There's a notion that United could pocket as much as £100m for the trio; however, offloading the players may prove a bit tricky. Chelsea might opt to pay a £5m penalty instead of purchasing Sancho for the £25m they agreed as an obligation for finishing within the top 14 of the league this season, given his lacklustre performances in west London.",
      "Meanwhile, Villa are yet to agree to the £40m asking price that United have set for Rashford, and although Antony has become one of Betis' standout performers recently, they're under no obligation to buy him at the end of his loan spell. Four players who are considered indispensable for United might also cause Amorim some headaches when it comes to his summer plans.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Bruno Fernandes, Amad, Leny Yoro, and Harry Maguire are seen as essential assets at United for the 2025/26 season, meaning that Amorim might be forced to incorporate them into his future plans and build around them – despite Fernandes turning 30 in September, and Maguire just celebrating his 32nd birthday in March. This represents a significant reversal in terms of the players considered indispensable at United going into last year's summer transfer window.",
      "According to the same source in April 2024, Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund were the three players that United needed to retain. However, lacklustre performances throughout 2024/25 have seemingly shifted opinion at Old Trafford.",
      "While Garnacho has contributed six goals and two assists in the Premier League this season, he has recently found himself relegated to the bench in favour of Mason Mount.",
      "Hojlund, on the other hand, has only managed to score four times this term in the Premier League, a far cry from the prolific striker that United currently crave. Meanwhile, Mainoo has also failed to deliver from midfield – both stars are goalless and without an assist in 24 league games this season. Only time will tell how things unfold for United this summer, with pressure expected to increase on Amorim in 2025/26.",
      "The board has been remarkably patient with the mastermind's lack of results this term, but that could soon change if he fails to deliver after having a full transfer window and pre-season to adjust his team. However, the forthcoming transfer window will not be the primary concern for United's top brass on Wednesday night.",
      "The Red Devils are setting their sights on clinching their first Europa League title in eight years as they square off against Ange Postecoglou's Spurs. The two teams have only ever clashed once before in Europe, with Matt Busby's United triumphing over Spurs 4-3 on aggregate across two legs during the last 16 of the 1963/64 Cup Winners' Cup.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games in the 2025/26 season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has joked that he could play on until he’s FIFTY after his ‘biological age’ was revealed. The former Manchester United forward is still going strong at 40.",
      "He has netted 33 goals for Saudi side Al-Nassr this season - that form coming after 64 goals across his first 18 months in the Middle East. Naturally, Ronaldo would usually be putting a little bit of thought into hanging his boots up having reached the twilight of his career.",
      "But it appears that new data might have convinced the Portuguese forward to carry on even longer. Ronaldo has had a long-running partnership with fitness watch manufacturers WHOOP.",
      "And part of the technology has revealed that his ‘biological age’ is over a decade younger than he actually is. Speaking on the WHOOP podcast, he said: \"I can't believe it's so good. 28.9.\"",
      "And after learning that, Ronaldo joked that he could potentially prolong his career well into the 2030s. He added: \"This means I'll play football for another 10 years.\"",
      "Ronaldo has already spoken about potentially stepping away from the pitch. While he confirmed that there wasn’t a specific plan, he did admit that it was something on the horizon.",
      "He said: \"I just want to enjoy. Plan for retirement... if it has to happen, in one or two years... I don't know. I'm turning 40 soon... I really want to enjoy, as long as I feel motivated I keep going.",
      "“The day I don't feel motivated, I will retire. When I decide to leave the national team, I'll do it spontaneously but thoughtfully. There won't be any advance announcements.",
      "“I don't see myself managing a team; that's not in my plans. My future lies in other areas outside of football, although time will tell what happens.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has also given his verdict on Ronaldo’s future. And the ex-Chelsea man suggested he could call it a day when long-term rival Lionel Messi does.",
      "He said: \"We all know as footballers, and I know this really, really well from my playing time, there's a time when you come and there's a time where you need to go. I think his time had come a while ago, and he needs to give somebody else the opportunity.",
      "\"I don't think that he is at the moment better than the other options that Portugal have. Some games you need to press, some games you need to do different things, and I don't think that he can do that anymore. There’s no shame in that. For him to even be playing at 40 is a landmark in itself.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to hang the boots up. I think that time will come when Messi stops. I think when Messi decides to call it a day, so will Ronaldo.\""

The San Mames Stadium, home of Athletic Bilbao and the venue for much-anticipated showpiece, has banned e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products, with strict penalties for those who flout the rules.",
      "United and Spurs are both hoping to turn dismal seasons into memorable ones by not only landing a major piece of silverware, but also booking an unlikely ticket to next season's Champions League. Up to 80,000 supporters are expected to descend on Bilbao, a city with a population of around 350,000.",
      "Those with match tickets will need to be on guard, as spectators caught vaping could face ejection from the stadium, a fine, and even a report to the police. While vaping is legal in Spain, the rules inside San Mamés are far stricter for the Europa League final.",
      "Ahead of the game, Dan Marchant, director of Vape Club and a founding member of the UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA), urged fans to respect the rules. \"If vaping is banned in the venue you're travelling to, it's best not to risk a fine or worse,\" he said.",
      "\"Fans heading to Bilbao for the Europa League final need to be especially careful. Those attempting to enter with prohibited items could face eviction and be reported to the police.\"",
      "Marchant added: \"Vaping within the stadium is prohibited, though there may be a designated smoking area. Check ahead of time, and don't risk using your vape in non-designated areas.\"",
      "The list of banned items at San Mamés is extensive. Alongside vaping products and e-liquids, fans are prohibited from bringing photo and video cameras without permission, helmets, balaclavas, ski masks, drones, oversized flags or banners (larger than 2m), food, drugs, alcohol, weapons, laser pointers, megaphones, fireworks, flares, smoke powder, glass or plastic bottles, backpacks and large bags.",
      "United and Tottenham enter the Europa League final with far more at stake than just silverware. Both clubs have suffered dismal domestic campaigns, sitting 16th and 17th respectively in the Premier League - perilously close to relegation. Ravaged by injuries and plagued by inconsistency, the game represents not just a shot at redemption, but a springboard back into Champions League football.",
      "Ruben Amorim's United reached the final with a 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Bilbao, while Tottenham secured their final spot with a 3-1 semi-final win over Bodo/Glimt.",
      "For the Red Devils, a win would mark a third consecutive season with silverware, following their FA Cup triumph in 2024 and League Cup success in 2023. Tottenham, by contrast, are chasing an end to a 17-year trophy drought - their last coming in the 2008 League Cup.",
      "While Amorim appears secure in his role, having only taken charge mid-season, Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou's future remains uncertain, with reports suggesting that even a Europa League title may not be enough to save his job."

      "We will be with you from Bilbao throughout the day as we bring you all of the latest build-up, updates, analysis and reaction from the Europa League final.",
      "What time does the Europa League final kick off? Kick-off is 8pm.",
      "Manchester United line-up today: Onana, Yoro, Maguire, Shaw, Mazraoui, Dorgu, Casemiro, Fernandes, Amad, Mount, Hojlund",
      "Spurs line-up today: Vicario, Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie, Bissouma, Bentancur, Sarr, Johnson, Solanke, Richarlison",
      "That’s twice that Shaw has been sluggish. He is fortunate to be starting and Maguire has already given him a pointer on his play.",
      "Spurs had not looked particularly assured until that cross from Porro that was superbly dealt with by Mazraoui. Onana was unnerved there.",
      "Another thing that would have counted against Garnacho is pressing. Mount and Amad are more urgent and effective pressers. Amad got a goal against Spurs through intense pressing, admittedly against a goalkeeper who should have been sent to the knackers’ yard years ago.",
      "Porro played a wonderful ball into the box and Mazroaui cleared the danger with a good header.",
      "It’s been very stop-start already. We’re more in the United half than the Spurs half and the United fans are belting out the Amorim chant louder than ever. United look the more assured on the ball in the early minutes and there is a lot of whistling from the Spurs contingent, a sure sign of nerves.",
      "Romero tried to impose himself on Hojlund then but was not particularly canny. For a World Cup-winning defender, he is not a wholly convincing centre back though ordinary centre backs have had the measure of Hojlund this season.",
      "Incredible atmosphere inside this place. United fans have been belting out the Amorim song since the first minute. Hojlund was offside inside 40 seconds but Spurs’ defensive line was on halfway. He was a yard the wrong side but the crazy high line is something he should want to exploit. Winning a free-kick then should be chalked up as an early win for him.",
      "Tottenham won a corner that shouldn't have been given, but Maguire was fouled from the set-piece.",
      "United are wearing black shorts and socks to prevent a clash with Tottenham's white.",
      "We're under way in Bilbao, so stick with the blog for live updates throughout the 90 minutes.",
      "This should be a cracking game - let's hope United can win another European trophy.",
      "Some kidology must have gone on with the coin toss. The United players had gathered in the end of their supporters for a huddle and Fernandes ushered them into the other half.",
      "Spurs, who also assemble for a huddle (another similarity between two bad domestic teams), walked back into the half they initially occupied to do it nearer their supporters.",
      "The pre-match pageantry is - thankfully - almost over. There’s no escaping the reality that this is a final and a very different match even from the semi-finals a couple of weeks ago. It’s easy for the nerves to build given the scenes outside the stadium and build-up inside San Mames. Once the football starts the players might settle but there’s a lot of youth in both sides. You look to your experienced players early on and Casemiro should set the tone for United. A five-time Champions League winner should stamp his class all over this.",
      "The time for talking is over - it is now time for the players to perform.",
      "The new tifo has been unveiled in the packed United section.",
      "Hopefully you're sat close to a TV, but we'll have every angle covered in this live blog.",

      "Ruben Amorim has looked incredibly relaxed in just about every interview he has done over the last few days ahead of tonight's game. That can only be a good thing.",
      "United are, of course, under pressure this evening, but Ange Postecoglou is under greater pressure than Amorim is. Spurs last won a trophy in 2008, meaning that is arguably bigger for them than getting into the Champions League for next season.",
      "Amorim is at the beginning of a long-term project at Old Trafford, whereas Postecoglou is quite possibly nearing the end of his time in north London. The Spurs chief knows this could be last chance saloon for him to save his job.",
      "Mason Mount is often one of the last United players to stop with the ball work in the pre-match drills. While the rest of the outfield starters had gone to the side for a final sprint, Mount couldn’t resist one more shot. He wrapped his right-foot around the ball and drilled it into the corner past a motionless Tom Heaton, who nodded in Mount’s direction in a show of respect for the shot. United No. 7s should always be front and centre in a European final. Could this be Mount’s night?",
      "One of the worst things about finals is the partisan neutrality of it. Both stadium comperes get to address their fans with some scripted guff that is, bizarrely, lapped up. That is down to the merriment of reaching a final and the determination to enjoy the day, no matter what the final score.",
      "The loudest cheer was reserved for Bruno Fernandes. It is Rasmus Hojlund’s misfortune that he was next numerically and the cheer was somewhat muted.",
      "United have got two Champions League winners in their starting XI tonight. Mason Mount started in Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 triumph over Manchester City in 2021 and Casemiro lined up in four final victories for Real Madrid, scoring against Juventus in 2017. Casemiro has been an automatic pick in Europe for the knockout rounds but Mount’s final experience (he has lost two FA Cup finals, a League Cup final and a European Championship final) must have influenced Amorim’s decision. He also “loves” Mount and he is a specialist for this system. Garnacho isn’t.",
      "One’s mind goes back to that chance Garnacho missed when one-on-one against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg when United were 1-0 down. If he scored that he would probably be starting tonight.",
      "Fans are gathering at the AO Arena to watch the game on the big screen.",
      "He said: \"I feel Mason Mount, in this moment, gives us a different balance because he's really good attacking, but also the way he compacts the team - he is one extra midfielder and you know Tottenham put all the full-backs and midfielders inside with a lot of people overloading that space.",
      "\"So my thinking was that, to have possession and to have a right foot in that position is really important, to also have speed on the bench because we have Amad on the other side. We need legs to change the game.",
      "\"If you look at the team, Casemiro is used to playing these types of games, Bruno is always there, Harry Maguire has played in European games for his national team and knows the pressure.",
      "\"The final is a different context, a different game. The beginning of the game is really important - to feel the game - and I think we're getting better on that.\"",
      "Postecoglou got a rapturous ovation from the Spurs fans as he conducted his media duties. He’s opted for a bit of a siege mentality in the build-up to the game, or the months leading up to the game. If it works, it will be justified. If it doesn’t work, he will be pilloried (again). Though dubbing him a “clown” was excessive.",
      "It's all about winning tonight.",
      "What a time for Mason Mount to make his first Europa League start since late-November. His last and only start in the competition this season was when United beat Bodo/Glimt 3-2 in their first home game under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim has not disguised his love for the England international and his two-goal haul off the bench in the second leg of the semi-final triumph over Athletic Bilbao earlier this month did him the world of good.",
      "He also has big-match experience, playing in a Champions League final for Chelsea and a European Championship final for England. This is a massive night for him.",
      "The absence of Son is the proper team news ‘shock’. His presence at the press conference and recent playing time seemed to ensure he would be starting tonight yet he is on the bench. The Spurs side is otherwise as predicted.",
      "It is a weak Spurs front three. Johnson is a decent player but far from irrepressible. Solanke is a good striker but will never be great. Richarlison is not good enough. United’s advantage is they have matchwinners. Spurs don’t.",
      "Garnacho’s goose seemed cooked on Friday when he didn’t start against Chelsea. That was the first time since January he had started on the bench two games in a row.",
      "It is a tad harsh on him. He merits a start more than Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund. But it doesn’t work out like that and Amorim has erred on the side of pragmatism with his team selection.",
      "Ugarte has played his way out of the team in recent weeks. He has not been good and Fernandes has been good in midfield. Yet Casemiro-Fernandes did not work at Spurs in February. It’s one of a number of team news picks that are polarising and could as easily backfire as pay off.",
      "Amorim has got it right not picking Victor Lindelof but Luke Shaw is so fortunate to be starting this final. It is not deserved.",
      "The legendary former United manager has a big smile at the game.",
      "What is noticeable about this final compared to the FA Cup final 12 months ago is that the heroes from that day are now on the bench and it isn’t a surprise. Mainoo and Garnacho were untouchable last summer and looked to be the future that day at Wembley. Maybe they still will be, but it’s been a sub-plot of the Amorim era that their status has changed and what happens next will be fascinating. Garnacho is the only United squad member still out on the pitch and his Instagram post of his goal and celebration at Wembley last season now looks telling.",
      "I’m pretty sure that’s the team I went for yesterday and the one that probably felt most likely. What good fortune that Yoro is fit. That didn’t look likely when he limped off against West Ham just 10 days ago. Dalot and Zirkzee could be primed for roles on the bench as well. Ugarte and Garnacho are the unlucky ones. It felt two or three weeks ago they would be certain starters but circumstances have conspired against them.",
      "Here's how Tottenham line up tonight.",
      "XI | Onana, Yoro, Maguire, Shaw, Mazraoui, Dorgu, Casemiro, Fernandes, Amad, Mount, Hojlund.",
      "Subs | Bayindor, Amass, Dalot, Evans, Heaven, Lindelof, Collyer, Eriksen, Mainoo, Ugarte, Garnacho, Zirkzee.",
      "Ratcliffe is speaking to the Glazers before kick-off.",
      "At the risk of reading too much into it, Garnacho is one of a handful of players on the pitch and posted on his Instagram Story an image of his final goal against City last season. Is that his way of hinting that he is on the bench tonight when he should be starting? The only other United player who has been out on the pitch is De Ligt, who is out injured."

      "Ruben Amorim has picked Mason Mount to start for Manchester United against Tottenham in the Europa League final because he provides a \"different balance\" and \"compacts the team.\"",
      "Amorim has made just one change to the starting team that faced Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last week, with Victor Lindelof coming out of the side to make room for Leny Yoro in defence.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been named on the bench again. Garnacho did not start against Chelsea, which suggested he could miss out in the Europa League final, and the youngster will be hopeful of making an impact at some stage.",
      "Bruno Fernandes will partner Casemiro in the midfield pivot, which means Manuel Ugarte is on the bench, and Mount and Amad will support Rasmus Hojlund from the No.10 roles.",
      "Amorim discussed his selection, saying: \"I feel Mason Mount, in this moment, gives us a different balance because he's really good attacking, but also the way he compacts the team - he is one extra midfielder and you know Tottenham put all the full-backs and midfielders inside with a lot of people overloading that space.",
      "\"So my thinking was that, to have possession and to have a right foot in that position is really important, to also have speed on the bench because we have Amad on the other side. We need legs to change the game.",
      "\"If you look at the team, Casemiro is used to playing these types of games, Bruno is always there, Harry Maguire has played in European games for his national team and knows the pressure.",
      "\"The final is a different context, a different game. The beginning of the game is really important - to feel the game - and I think we're getting better on that.\"",
      "When asked about the importance of winning the Europa League, Amorim responded: \"It's not going to change so much [in relation to transfers]. It can be a little help to add more if we need, but it's not going to change so much. I think the most important thing is the feeling of winning.",
      "\"It's going to help everybody. If you look at Carrington with all the changes, we had staff with us who are no longer there, we need to deliver that feeling in order to give something to everybody.",
      "\"I'm not thinking about the money. I'm not worried about the money because we're a big brand, but it's the feeling. We need that feeling, we need to have a connection with people and without trophies, it's really hard to get that connection.\""

      "It's approaching 4pm in Bilbao on Tuesday. The sun is shining, and the noise is growing. But the noise has a distinctively cockney twang. In pockets on different streets approaching San Mames, Tottenham fans are cranking up the volume.",
      "As Spurs fans spill out onto the streets from one small bar near the ground, they start to wonder out loud where the United fans are. \"Where the f**k are Man United?\" is their Bilbao reworking of a song they often sing.",
      "A day before the Europa League final, it did feel like there were more Tottenham fans in the streets and bars of Bilbao, with a suggestion last week that they were expected to outnumber United fans on the money.",
      "But then it's also the case that the two sets of fans do things differently. While Spurs fans were gathering in numbers, smaller groups of Mancunians were seated around tables in different bars across this wonderful city.",
      "There were dads and lads in the main fanzone, trying to kick footballs into boats on the Nervion River and queuing to have their photo taken with the Europa League trophy. There were groups of five or six, bucket hats on, still singing 'For United are going to Bilbao' while knocking back pints in temperatures that will feel familiar after the spring that Manchester has enjoyed.",
      "There was no mass gathering, though - at least not yet. There might have been more substantial sing-alongs on Tuesday night, and the atmosphere will be cranked up a notch on the day of the final.",
      "There is room for 20,000 fans at United's fanzone in Etxebarria Parkea, with a musical line-up that could sell out Heaton Park, but for many of United's regular European away-dayers, such substantial shows of force and numbers are to be avoided. It's also true that Etxebarria Parkea is at the top of a hill in Bilbao, and as beautiful as the views are, the walk to get there isn't all that much fun.",
      "A group of United fans were scouting it out on Tuesday, climbing the steps to see the ring of steel around it. The big screen is up, and the bars and toilets are ready to go. \"It's f**king miles away,\" didn't suggest they would be going back on game day.",
      "The journey to Bilbao - and the wider Basque Country - has also been challenging. John and John, father and son United fans, were reunited in the city on Tuesday. Dad flew in from Manchester via Amsterdam, but his son was here via Hong Kong.",
      "\"I moved to Hong Kong for work, I don't get back for games often, but I had to be at this one,\" said the younger John.",
      "\"It took 20 hours to get from Hong Kong to Bilbao, but it's nice to be in the sun now. It's a really nice city, it's very friendly and seems like a nice place.",
      "\"I'm not that confident, I think it's going to be dull, 1-0 to United with a Fernandes penalty.\"",
      "They weren't the only father and son. Jonathan Law, from Worsley, stopped for a chat with his son Leo, and they will be hoping Leo's teachers aren't MEN readers after he admitted his son was skipping school to get a different kind of education this week.",
      "\"We just had to be here. We paid too much for the tickets, too much for the hotel, too much for the flights, but we're glad we're here. It's better than being at school,\" said Jonathan, with Leo nodding at that last comment.",
      "\"I'm confident, the closer it gets, the more confident I'm getting. It's United, isn't it? We can turn it on in certain games.\"",
      "Another Mancunian, Paul, was walking around the city with his son Jake. Although tempted, he decided against a chat as his son was also swapping school for watching United in a European final.",
      "One supporter who didn't pay too much for this journey was Nate, who was in Bilbao from Torbay in Devon. A stroke of good fortune had brought him to the city.",
      "\"I've been in Spain in my motor home for a month, I'm sailing back from Santander to Plymouth on Thursday. I booked the crossing six months ago, not realising United were going to get to the final,\" he said.",
      "\"When we booked it, I never booked it with this in mind, but as they progressed through the rounds, I realised there was a possibility they were going to get to the final. Bilbao in the semi-final was the big one to get over.\"",
      "He is also one of the many United fans who have made the journey without a ticket, but he did the same in Stockholm for the Europa League final against Ajax in 2017 and plans to try the same approach to getting inside San Mames.",
      "\"I don't have a ticket, but everyone says leave it as long as possible, that's what I did in Stockholm,\" he said. \"I left it until five minutes before kick-off and got two tickets for face value, so the longer you hold the nerve, the better you have of getting good value.\"",
      "Although United fans seemed outnumbered on Tuesday, that might not be the case on matchday. Thousands are staying around the Basque Country after refusing to pay the price of accommodation in Bilbao.",
      "The MEN are holed up in San Sebastian, and a few groups of United fans were in the city on Monday night. More arrived on Tuesday, and others are on the other side of Bilbao in Santander.",
      "Andrew Houten and his dad flew from Manchester to Nantes in the west of France on Monday. They then took the train further south to Bordeaux before getting a coach to Bilbao. They are staying in Zaramillo, a small village about 20 minutes outside of Bilbao.",
      "Richard, a United fan from Blackpool, found another way to beat the exorbitant flight prices. Just come earlier.",
      "\"I went via Berlin,\" he said. “The flights were difficult, and I'm going back via Mallorca. I saw quite a few United fans on the route out, and it's a Sunday night to Friday trip. I had to square it with the wife, although I made sure I booked it first!",
      "\"The atmosphere has been fairly tame so far, but we found a couple of bars on Monday that were quite lively. There was a good mix of United and Spurs. It's been very friendly so far.",
      "\"I can't say I'm feeling confident, I think it's going to finish about 1 in the morning.\"",
      "For those fans staying outside of Bilbao, the challenge of getting back to their accommodation will begin then. For now, they have the excitement of a matchday to come. And today, the Spurs fans might see a little more red in Bilbao."

      "Even while the question was being asked, Ruben Amorim was struggling to stifle a laugh. In fact, he found it so difficult to keep his composure that he had to reach for the glass of water in front of him. His chuckling started to set off Bruno Fernandes in the seat next to him.",
      "The subject of their fun sat on the other side of the United head coach. Harry Maguire has, in many ways, been the hero of this Europa League campaign. An injury-time equaliser at Porto and then that unforgettable winner in extra-time against Lyon that sent Old Trafford into a frenzy.",
      "There was also the twisting, turning dribble down the wing in this very stadium three weeks ago. He went one way, then the other, and then he whipped in a cross that ended with Casemiro setting United on their way to a Europa League semi-final cruise against Athletic Club.",
      "Manuel Ugarte flicked that cross on to Casemiro, so Maguire didn't actually get the assist, which is perhaps Exhibit A as to why these starts can be so worthless. Everyone knows the 32-year-old was the real hero of that goal.",
      "So it was that a journalist asked him if these \"inspirational moments\" in attack were all part of a new tactical plan. Amorim's laughter would suggest not, but Maguire played along.",

Another question asked him how it felt to now be so important to this team when, for so long, the noise around him had been \"toxic.\" He swerved that one, but his recovery is one of the feel-good stories out of Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "It's easy to forget now, but the build-up to the Europa League final in Gdansk in 2021 focused on Maguire's fitness. He was nowhere near being fit, but United took him along and had him pictured in training to keep up the suspense.",
      "The next time United reached a cup final, he was a figure of fun, routinely jeered on pre-season tours and captain in name only. He was on the bench for the Carabao Cup final success in 2023 and came on for the final two minutes, sharing the trophy lift with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Maguire stopped to speak to reporters in the mixed zone at Wembley that day and insisted he was happy to be part of a trophy-winning United side after six years without silverware, but he must have been hurting at seeing his role reduced.",
      "\"I don’t have any mixed emotions, it’s been so long since the club won a trophy, it’s a really good day for the club and the fans,\" he said that day.",

Obviously, listen, I am a footballer who wants to play games and I want to lead the boys out of the tunnel at the start of the game but also like I said I understand this is part and parcel of football when you play at the top level and you have got huge competition for places.",

      "United were in an FA Cup final later this season, and Maguire didn't get off the bench in the defeat to Manchester City. A year later, he was injured for the Wembley win against Manchester City.",
      "So in four cup finals since his £80million move from Leicester City in 2019, Maguire has missed two through injury and played a combined two minutes in the other. It sums up his fortunes at United.",
      "But over the last couple of years, the narrative has turned again. For all of those cup final disappointments, the winner against Lyon felt like his moment at United.",
      "“I've had some amazing moments at this club, been here six years now and I've had some great times and some bad times as well,\" he said.",
      "\"I think that game pretty much summed up my time at this club, to be honest! It was an incredible feeling to score that winner in such an important game, in a game that was full of emotion and the strangest, maddest game I've ever played in or witnessed.\"",
      "Now, finally, Maguire will get to play in a cup final. He's no longer captain, but he's more of a leader now than when he wore the armband. He's had to wait for this moment, but few players deserve this final more than Maguire."

      "Manchester United's biggest fan is hoping to watch his side win another European trophy.",
      "The MEN's former sport editor, Peter Spencer, visited Thomas to present him with his prize and 19 years later, Steven Railston was invited to his home to look at the revamped 'Red Room'.",
      "Thomas' house is like United heaven and he travelled to Bilbao on Monday afternoon to attend the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur, along with his son and grandson.",
      "The dedicated Red had been to every cup final, including Europeans, until recently when a friend who was responsible for sorting their tickets made an error, but Thomas will be present at the Estadio de San Mames on Wednesday night and he can't wait to take his seat in the stadium.",
      "\"My other grandson is going with his mates and they're flying via Tenerife,\" Thomas laughed. \"He's been to the quarter-finals and semi-finals away in Lyon and Bilbao, and he booked his flights for the final early.",
      "\"The Lyon match at Old Trafford was crazy. We had to make a dash to the toilet and the equaliser was scored, so we darted back in at the bottom and we were right where Maguire scored.",
      "\"It was amazing, something like '99 [Champions League final at Camp Nou] because they scored three goals in just a few minutes. It has to go down as one of my favourite games anyway.\"",
      "Thomas continued: \"They're the only unbeaten team in Europe, so I fancy them with how we've been. It's been a ride when you compare it to the Premier League, which has been terrible.",
      "\"Because they can't get relegated, I don't think they've been bothered, so that's not a good thing. But I'll be phoning you up if they win the trophy! We've beaten Tottenham lots down the years.\"",
      "Thomas admitted he wasn't sure how he would celebrate in Bilbao if United beat Tottenham, but his wife, Christine, interrupted to say: \"A couple of drinks? You'll be having lots of them!\"",
      "Thomas' first season at Old Trafford was in 1957 and he's seen dozens of United legends in the flesh, but he believes Bruno Fernandes should be remembered as one of the greats.",
      "Fernandes scored a brace in the Europa League semi-final first leg and has continued to be a driving force in a struggling team. \"He's everything, he pushes, he assists and scores goals,\" said Thomas.",
      "\"He's my hero in this team and I hope he doesn't leave in the summer. We need to keep him for next season, see who we buy in the summer, because you can't replace a player like him.",
      "\"He's the one who sticks out. We've always had good midfield players who are leaders. He just falls short of Bryan Robson for me, who was Captain Fantastic, but he probably comes close.\"",
      "Thomas will be cheering on Fernandes to write another chapter of history in Bilbao."

Varane came to Manchester following a highly successful period in Spain, but did not live up to the high expectations many had for the World Cup winner in a United kit.",

      "Varane subsequently moved to Italian Serie A team Como at the end of last term, but injuries ultimately overcame him, resulting in his retirement from professional football in September.",
      "The ex-United centre-back has sent a message of support to his former teammates on X, having made the trip to watch the final. Varane posted a picture of himself at the San Mames Stadium alongside the caption: \"Come on @ManUtd!!!\" followed by two red emojis.",
      "The Frenchman was a mainstay in defence when United won the League Cup in 2023 and FA Cup in 2024, but was not offered a new deal by then Reds boss Erik ten Hag and left as a free agent earlier this summer.",
      "Sending a farewell message to supporters earlier this year, the 31-year-old said: \"To you guys, supporters of Manchester United, it has been an amazing few years to play for this special club and wear that shirt.",
      "\"The first time I went to Old Trafford as a Man United player was insane. The atmosphere was amazing. I fell in love with the club, with the fans. You have to play for Manchester United to understand what that represents. For my kids, it's home here. It is going to be a special place for me for life.",
      "\"When the fans go to Wembley it's something they remember for life,\" he added, ahead of our latest trip to the national stadium on 25 May, to face Manchester City in the Emirates FA Cup final. To share that moment with them [winning the Carabao Cup last season] was absolutely amazing.",
      "\"Despite the fact we have had a difficult season, I am very positive for the future. The new owners are coming with a clear plan and a great strategy. I will see you at Old Trafford to say goodbye in the last home game this season. And it's going to be a very emotional day for me, for sure.\""

      "His three assists were crucial to beating Lyon in the second leg of the quarters, while he scored a goal in both legs of the semi-finals against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "The first leg of the Bilbao tie also saw the Brazilian, who joined United in a £60million deal in August 2022, run more than any other player (10.5km). That was something Amorim relayed to the club’s minority owner, Ratcliffe, after the match.",
      "According to The Times, Amorim and Ratcliffe speak every week by phone and occasionally communicate in a WhatsApp group that includes other senior club figures.",
      "The Portuguese head coach is understood to share his thoughts after each game in a mini-match report, while data is fed into the group chat too.",

      "Despite dropping Casemiro for the best part of two months, the two Portuguese speakers are on close terms now.",
      "That was clear to see when the former Real Madrid star embraced his manager after being substituted with nine minutes left of the second leg against Bilbao.",

      "Casemiro is expected to remain at Old Trafford beyond this season with just a year left on his contract.",
      "His form has led to some speculation over where he will be offered a new deal. And the MEN understands a return to Champions League football would increase Casemiro's salary back up to £300,000-a-week."

      "Before the match, in a fans' Q&A for the club website, Fernandes spoke of his wish to have a heart-to-heart with Ferguson. He said: “That is one of my biggest regrets in the club until now. I met him already but never had the chance to speak with him like I would like to do.",
      "“I think everyone who watched Manchester United in the past remembers Sir Alex. [That is true] for me, growing up and seeing the club, being a fan of the club and seeing the development of the team.",

      "Sadly, the discussion didn’t have the desired effect. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side turned in a poor display against the Spanish side before losing a drawn-out penalty shootout following a 1-1 draw. David de Gea’s saved spot-kick was decisive after all 20 outfield players had converted theirs.",

The Dutchman has been out of action since the defeat to Newcastle on April 13 and even though he recently claimed it would not be \"impossible\" for him to recover in time for the final, it seemed very unlikely after Amorim had previously ruled him out for the season.",

      "Yoro's availability must be tempting head coach Ruben Amorim to throw him straight into the starting XI. He was in excellent form prior to being forced off against West Ham United just over a week ago, meaning if he is deemed fit enough to start, Amorim might take the gamble for a game of such importance.",

      "Manchester United have got “a real baller” on their hands in Joshua Zirkzee, who’s been tipped to become a “superstar” under Ruben Amorim by a former Red Devil despite being ‘up for sale’.",
      "Zirkzee joined United from Bologna for £36.5m last summer and has managed just seven goals and three assists in a debut season which featured him being jeered off by his own fans during a defeat to Newcastle in December.",
      "His performances before suffering injury in mid-April were more positive though, certainly better than those of fellow striker Rasmus Hojlund, and Lee Sharpe reckons with a consistent run in the side the “real baller” can become a “superstar” at Old Trafford.",
      "“I like Zirkzee – he was unfortunate to get injured when he did, but he’s a real baller and I think he can be a superstar for Manchester United if he can get games under his belt,” Sharpe told Metro via Coin Poker.",
      "“He needs a regular run. I don’t think he’s had a 10-game stint where he has actually played week in, week out.",
      "“There were reports that he wasn’t quite fit when he signed, so it took him a bit of time to get up to speed. I think he was just finding his feet when he got injured but I think he’s going to prove a real key player next season.”",
      "Zirkzee made a shock return to training this week but the Europa League final clash with Spurs may have come too early for the Dutchman.",
      "Football Insider claim United have put both Zirkzee and Hojlund are ‘up for sale’ ahead of the summer transfer window in order ‘to make way for top striker target Liam Delap’.",
      "The report states that the Ipswich striker is ‘set to arrive at Old Trafford in a £30million deal with United in pole position to secure his signature ahead of Chelsea and Everton’.",
      "It is understood that at least one of Zirkzee or Hojlund will need to be sold ‘to free up space in the squad and raise funds for further summer business’.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s arrival at Old Trafford in a £62.5m transfer from Wolves looks to have been sewn up and Sharpe believes both he and Delap will be good additions to Amorim’s squad.",
      "“I think both players look like good acquisitions,” Sharpe added.",
      "“I’ve seen Delap a few times this season and he’s a good, big strong typical number nine. He holds the balls up well, which is what you need in any team but he also knows where the goal is and puts defenders under pressure.",
      "“He’s still young enough to improve and for the position United are in – not quite challenging for the league but looking towards that top six – and I think he would be an ideal signing.",
      "“Cunha speaks for himself. In a team like Wolves, which have struggled at points this season, he’s been the standout player.",
      "“He’s a little bit like Kobbie Mainoo in that he can beat players, create a chance and score a goal. I’d like him to calm his temperament down at times – you don’t want him getting sent off and costing his team games just because he’s losing his rag – but ability-wise I think he’s really good and a great addition to the squad.”",
      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a shock boost ahead of their Europa League final with Spurs, as some key players were pictured in training on Tuesday.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘willing’ to offload one ‘recent signing’ after ‘just one season’ at Old Trafford.",
      "Serie A giants Inter Milan are ready to propose a loan move with an option to buy for Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee will be out for the rest of “this season” after picking up an injury of late.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘re-evaluated’ his attacking options, and has decided to ‘keep’ one striker and ‘listen to offers’ for another."

      "But history could still be made this summer as most of the supposed ‘Big Six’ chase world-class strikers, so here’s a look at the current and five previous British transfer record-holders.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo to Chelsea (£115m – August 2023)\nEnzo Maresca’s suggestion that Caicedo is the “best defensive midfielder in the world” after a 1-0 win against *checks notes* Tottenham Hotspur was a bit of a stretch, but the 23-year-old has fared much better post-£100m transfer than most of his counterparts.",
      "The former Liverpool target’s second season at Stamford Bridge has been far stronger than his first and he’s one of the few huge Todd Boehly-era signings to pay off. He’s not quite justified the £100m player tag yet, but he’s getting there. He is Chelsea’s player of a poor season.",
      "",
      "Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea (£106m – January 2023)\nThis has comfortably been Fernandez’s best season to date at Chelsea, but that is not saying much. Like Caicedo, he needs to produce the goods more consistently if he’s to be considered an elite midfielder instead of one who’s purely very good on his day.",
      "Fernandez has found himself at the centre of transfer speculation concerning a deal that won’t come to fruition, with it incredibly difficult to see what he would add to what is already a well-stocked Real Madrid midfield.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish to Manchester City (£100m – August 2021)\nWe love Grealish, and you should too. He’s clearly a brilliant bloke and a gifted footballer, but even we have to admit that his time at Man City is coming to an end.",
      "Grealish’s immense form heavily contributed to Man City’s historic Treble season in 2022/23, but he’s not come close to matching this overwhelming peak in prior or subsequent campaigns.",
      "Pep Guardiola’s new favourite toy – Omar Marmoush – is the third attack-minded signing to outshine the England international after Jeremy Doku and Savinho and he desperately needs a new home to rediscover the magical performances he produced in his second season and for Aston Villa.",
      "MORE TRANSFER NONSENSE ON F365…\n👉 What Viktor Gyokeres has told team-mates after claims Arsenal transfer ‘will become official next week’\n👉 Liverpool transfer ‘vetoed’ by Barcelona ‘dressing room’ in ‘disagreement’ on £71m Reds star\n👉 Premier League net spend table: Liverpool below West Ham over last five years!",
      "",
      "Paul Pogba to Manchester United (£89m – August 2016)\nEven with Man Utd’s woeful downfall this season, you are hard-pressed to find a former Red Devils player-cum-pundit desperate enough to call for Pogba to be given a “third chance” at Old Trafford, with Dwight Yorke one exception.",
      "Pogba is arguably the most talented footballer on this list, so the massive investment of £89m to re-sign him from Juventus could have been justified at the time. But the story of his second stint at Man Utd – marred by manager fallouts and a stinking attitude – should give him no hope of another chance, even with Sir Jim Ratcliffe supposedly ‘betting on’ free agents this summer.",
      "",
      "Angel Di Maria to Manchester United (£59.7m – August 2014)\nAnother contender for being Man Utd’s worst signing post-Sir Alex Ferguson, Di Maria is a fine example of an individual who proves the club has become a “graveyard for coaches and players”.",
      "Di Maria joined Man Utd riding the crest of a wave after shining in the previous season’s Champions League final, but he flopped at Old Trafford and could not leave quickly enough, joining PSG after a single season in the Premier League.",
      "His success after exiting Man Utd suggests the club were the problem, not him, as there are only two Old Trafford departees post-Ferguson who have done better.",
      "",
      "Fernando Torres to Chelsea (£50m – January 2011)\n“This was the no-brainer. This was the banker, this was the one that couldn’t fail, this was the one that’s never failed.” Well, it did…",
      "Chelsea appeared to pull off a major coup when they snatched Liverpool’s goal machine from their arch-rivals, but it turned out his legs had gone as he only scored 20 goals in 110 Premier League games for the Blues. He at least has that Champions League semi-final goal to lean on, though.",
      "Man City have an ageing squad and are facing a summer rebuild – both to convince Pep Guardiola to stay and to mount a Premier League title challenge.",
      "Former Premier League striker Alan Shearer insists Jack Grealish “has to leave” Man City after Pep Guardiola left him on the bench during the FA Cup final.",
      "Serie A side Napoli are likely to struggle in their attempts to tie up a deal to sign Man City winger Jack Grealish in the summer, according to reports.",

      "Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold is off to Real Madrid. Naturally, we have picked the biggest free transfer departure for each Premier League club.",

      "Now, a report from The Times claims Man Utd ‘will have £100m to spend even if Spurs win the final’, though club chiefs believe this budget could reach £200m via selling Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "The report deems this viewpoint a ‘tad optimisic’, with Chelsea and Aston Villa not guaranteed to sign Sancho and Rashford permanently. Regarding Sancho, it’s noted that Chelsea ‘could prefer to pay a £5million penalty’ instead of investing £25m to make his deal permanent.",
      "Cunha is said to be Man Utd’s ‘primary’ target, with Man Utd ‘confident that Amorim can tame his temper’.",
      "Delap is another named target, while United are planning three more signings.",
      "‘The striker Liam Delap, who is available for £30million after Ipswich Town’s relegation, is a target while the wingback positions need strengthening and Bayindir is likely to be sold to make way for another goalkeeper to rival Onana for the No1 jersey.’",
      "It is also revealed that Man Utd’s summer transfer window ‘will be led by the technical director Jason Wilcox’, with INEOS ‘happy with his work so there are no plans to recruit a director of football’.",
      "Man Utd could also raise funds by sanctioning pure profit exits for Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, but they ‘will only leave if a club makes a substantial bid for either’. While the latter is ‘most likely to depart’, the Red Devils ‘would like to keep both players’.",

      "A new report has revealed Manchester United’s ‘main reason’ for their decision on whether to sack Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim replaced former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag towards the end of 2024 and has endured a turbulent few months at the Premier League giants.",
      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss was initially keen to wait until this summer to make the move, but he decided to join early after being given an ultimatum by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and United‘s board.",
      "The 40-year-old has struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation as Man Utd’s current squad is not suited to this set-up and performances in the Premier League have been shambolic.",
      "Man Utd’s results under Amorim have been worse than they were under Ten Hag in the league, as they are at risk of finishing 17th in the Premier League with one game remaining.",
      "READ: Man Utd losing Europa League will lead to ‘relegation and even bankruptcy’",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd’s best performances have come in the Europa League as they have reached the final.",
      "The Red Devils face Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Wednesday night and this is a massive game, with a trophy, Champions League football and much-needed prize money at stake.",
      "A loss would be disastrous for either side, but a report from The Times claims ‘the noises coming out of United are that Amorim will be in charge next season, regardless of the result of the Europa League final against Tottenham’.",
      "This is partly to do with Amorim’s strong relationship with Ratcliffe, as the co-owner ‘would try to talk him out of walking’ if it came to it ‘because he rates him so highly’.",
      "The report has also lifted the lid on Amorim’s relationship with Ratcliffe, who ‘speak every week by phone’.",
      "It is also noted that they ‘occasionally communicate in a WhatsApp group that contains other senior figures’, with ‘Amorim sharing his thoughts on games in a mini-match report and data is fed into the group too’.",
      "One such message was about Casemiro, who Amorim praised for ‘running 10.5km in the first leg of the semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao, more than any other player’.",
      "Amorim’s ‘man-mangement skills’ are ‘admired’ by United’s hierarchy, with Casemiro going from being an outcast to being ‘close’ to the head coach.",
      "The report also reveals Man Utd’s ‘main reason’ for standing by Amorim. They explain:",
      "‘The main reason why Ineos have so far refused to pull the trigger on Amorim’s reign is because they truly believe that with a full pre-season under their belts, and a revamp of the squad, he will have the tools he needs to start making United successful again.\nManchester United player in team uniform.",
      "‘There is an acceptance that he has had to spend much of the season placing square pegs in round holes. Noussair Mazraoui, for example, spent most of his career playing as an orthodox right back, but there is a chance the Moroccan will be asked to continue at wingback against Spurs, although Diogo Dalot — along with Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee — returned to training on the eve of the final.’",
      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a shock boost ahead of their Europa League final with Spurs, as some key players were pictured in training on Tuesday.",
      "One Man Utd player is getting frustrated that INEOS and Ruben Amorim are not playing him in order to get him to leave the club, according to reports.",
      "A report reveals how Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim was ‘talked out’ of handing in his resignation after a 3-1 home defeat to Brighton in January.",
      "Neville insists it’s too early to judge Amorim and Ratcliffe at Man Utd and picked the ‘six players minimum’ required in a Red Devils rebuild this summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has done nothing to suggest he can turn Man Utd around, while there is some laughter and anger about Man City."

      "The true nonsense here is that McEvoy’s article is broadly fine, hoping that Gary Lineker’s departure doesn’t signal an unnecessary and damaging broader shift in Match of the Day’s overall style and focus.",
      "And unlike other Daily Mail fears, this one is not entirely unfounded. There has been talk from BBC suits of the need for the show to feature ‘more chat’ and Mediawatch finds itself in broad agreement with McEvoy’s central thrust that this would be a bad idea, that people want to watch the highlights and a bit of analysis and not just the analysis. But also not just the action. There are plenty of other options for those who want those things. As McEvoy puts it, Match of the Day should be…",
      "… the amalgam of both, the action dominating with the reassuring-as-old-slippers insight of the pundits as an accompaniment. This diet is distinct from both the protracted analysis of Sky’s ‘main event’ and the unvarnished 10-second video clip trotting across personal smartphones.",
      "But after several hundred words of reasonableness, McEvoy makes his fatal error – or Machiavellian click-generating move, choose your fighter – that presumably made a sub-editor punch the air in delight.",
      "Nobody, even among the small ‘c’ conservative Saturday night audience, is opposed to innovation and judicious tinkering. But the great hope is that change for its own sake, such as box ticking and wokery, or indeed a bellyful of laddishness, is left at the studio door.",

Of course we are role models and we have to act like this. But I think sometimes you also should bring out your emotions. In this case it was to protect Joao Pedro because it was a hard tackle on him.

In a normal game when a player is blocked when the ball is not near from him, it’s always a foul, so I don’t understand why it’s not a foul, they have to find an answer. It can be part of the game, but it should be a clear rule as to what is allowed and what isn’t.

I said to Ibou Konate, ‘This is a f**king joke.’ The fourth official thought I said to him: ‘You are a f**king joke.’ That’s definitely not what I said.

There is an ongoing process and I will respect that. Many things happened in extra time that led to me being quite emotional. There was a VAR review for two minutes and I thought, maybe the only thing that could happen is he looks back at the foul, or maybe it’s offside. Of course then, after 10 minutes you hear there fans cheering and you [realise] it’s not offside. It is an emotional sport and sometimes individuals with emotions make the wrong decisions.

      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have had a nightmare season with Ruben Amorim’s side now guaranteed to go down as the worst Man Utd side in the Premier League era.",
      "Man Utd are currently 16th in the Premier League with only ten wins to their name all season as they get set to play their final match of the season at the weekend.",
      "But first they will face Tottenham in the Europa League final on Wednesday night in Bilbao with the winners getting a place in the Champions League next season.",
      "Only four Premier League sides have scored fewer goals than Man Utd this season with Zirkzeen and Hojlund coming in for lots of criticism.",
      "The two strikers have only scored seven goals between them in the Premier League this season and now Man Utd are looking for a new centre-forward in the summer.",
      "And now Football Insider claims that Man Utd have put both Zirkzee and Hojlund ‘up for sale’ ahead of the summer transfer window in order ‘to make way for top striker target Liam Delap’.",
      "The Ipswich Town striker is ‘set to arrive at Old Trafford in a £30million deal with United in pole position to secure his signature ahead of Chelsea and Everton’.",
      "READ: Man Utd and Ruben Amorim face a massive sliding doors moment in Bilbao",
      "It is understood that at least one of Zirkzee or Hojlund will need to be sold ‘to free up space in the squad and raise funds for further summer business’.",
      "Solhekol said: “Yeah, that release clause is £30million because Ipswich have been relegated.",
      "“What we’re hearing this afternoon is that Manchester United are in pole position to sign him. One source has even told us that he believes the deal is very close and that the player would be happy to move to Manchester United, even though United aren’t having a great season. He still feels they’re a big, big club.",
      "“We’ve heard something similar about Matheus Cunha, the Wolves forward, who may also be moving to United.",
      "“I know, looking from the outside, people may think United aren’t doing very well — so why would players want to move there? But you’ve got to remember, Manchester United are still one of the biggest clubs in the world, and a lot of players want to play for them.",
      "“Obviously, the top, top players have other options, but lots of clubs are interested in signing Liam Delap — Chelsea, for example. Potentially Nottingham Forest as well.",
      "“But I think it’s interesting that United are currently in pole position, and we believe the player would be happy to move there. Although, I think maybe we should wait and see what happens in the Europa League final next week.",
      "“I think United will be able to pay his release clause anyway. It’s £30million, which, in the grand scheme of things for top clubs — even in the PSR era, even if you’re not in the Champions League — United should be able to afford.",
      "“But I think from a player’s perspective, it might be wise to wait and see what happens over the next few days. For instance, whether Chelsea are going to be in the Champions League, and whether Manchester United will be. But I think, regardless of that, I get the feeling the player would be up for moving to United, even if they don’t make the Champions League.”",
      "But Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher doesn’t think Man Utd would be the right move for Delap as he thinks it’s a “big step” for the Ipswich man.",
      "“What happened to [Rasmus] Hojlund, sometimes when you’re going from a team who have been relegated – I know Man United are 16th, but they are one of the biggest teams in the world, with the eyes and ears on them.",
      "“I think that’s such a big step. I know people might say it’s not in terms of league position, but Man United are a monster.",
      "“I do [think he’s an upgrade on Hojlund], but I almost think that next step should be Everton or something.”",
      "Carragher added: “You know you’re going to play every week, you’re going to be the main man, you’re going to feel like one of the best players in the team.",
      "“He’s the best player in the team at Ipswich, everything goes through him, so go to another club where you’re that for two years, then go to Man United or wherever. A team playing in the Champions League or trying to compete at that sort of level.”",
      "Man Utd have got “a real baller” who’s been tipped to become a “superstar” under Ruben Amorim by a former Red Devil despite being ‘up for sale’.",

      "“With Fernandes playing as a false centre-forward, you could also start with Casemiro and Ugarte in central midfield. There are plenty of selection dilemmas for Amorim, but I just hope he gets it right. The problem is the manager doesn’t know what he’s going to get from most of his players on the day.”",

      "Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer – and even the Premier League champions could let one go.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Ollie Watkins and Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Your guess is as good as ours.",
      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Liam Delap (Ipswich Town)\nEvery Premier League club – except Arsenal – is chasing Liam Delap, hopefully resulting in an exciting transfer saga that ends at the right time instead of dragging on and on and on.",
      "Despite attracting interest from several competent football clubs, it’s reportedly Manchester United (or Chelsea… or United again) leading the race. Delap is open to the move, which should be enough of a red flag for everyone else to back off and let United crack on.",
      "Twelve goals in 36 matches in a debut Premier League season is a very solid return for the 22-year-old. Not long ago it was 12 in 30, which looked even better and explains the hype.",
      "Ipswich’s relegation and his loss of form won’t stop the vultures circling, and £30million still feels like a bargain. Especially for a striker who is, by all accounts, a slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "8) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that. As could Florian Wirtz, Alejandro Grimaldo, Jonathan Tah, Piero Hincapie and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. Chelsea seem very keen – him and Delap fit their ‘project signing’ blueprint. This is why Arsenal prefer Gyokeres, who is more of a ready-made title winner.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Liverpool, though Man United and Arsenal are obviously in the picture.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea now seem to prefer Sesko and Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but that would open him up to ridicule after calling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s agent a “dumb f**k” for saying he was moving there.",
      "Clubs seem to be oblivious to Osimhen’s availability but it’s guaranteed that the Nigerian will leave Napoli this summer after spending the season on loan at Galatasaray. His bridges in Naples have been burned to the ground.",
      "READ NOW: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",
      "Liverpool are stepping up their interest in RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko with Darwin Nunez expected to leave this summer, according to reports.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has told his Sporting CP team-mates that he’s “not a fortune teller” amid rumours he is close to a move to Arsenal.",
      "Manchester United will reportedly ‘accelerate to try to sign’ Arsenal-linked Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres after Wednesday’s Europa League final.",
      "Premier League side Arsenal are set to seal a deal for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres next week after a long-running saga, according to reports.",
      "12 of the top 100 most valuable footballers are almost certain to leave their current clubs this summer and we’ve predicted where they’ll end up.",

    "body": [
      "Of the many areas Manchester United need to strengthen this summer, goalkeeper is the position they will most resent having to address.",
      "Andre Onana should have been United’s No. 1 for a decade; that was the plan when the Red Devils spent £43.7million on the Cameroonian in 2023 to replace David De Gea and, to be fair to the recruitment ‘brains trust’ at Old Trafford at the time, there was very little dissent over their pick.",
      "Onana was viewed as a safe set of hands with two feet that would help United play the Ten Hag way, a concept that remains a mystery. The ex-Ajax keeper had just helped Inter Milan get to the Champions League final and the decision to give him De Gea’s gloves was overwhelmingly well-received by everyone bar De Gea.",
      "The recent revisionism around De Gea highlights how far short Onana has come to matching those early expectations. Despite the Spaniard’s success at Fiorentina – after a season’s sabbatical – the decision to replace De Gea was absolutely correct. Their choice of replacement – in glorious hindsight – was not.",
      "We’ll give him a pass on the fact he hasn’t improved United in possession. Sometimes, a goalkeeper building out from the back is only as good as the players he’s passing to. As we know, many of his team-mates just aren’t up to receiving the ball under pressure, from either high-pressing opponents or the millions scrutinising them across the globe.",
      "That doesn’t excuse some of Onana’s clumsiness, especially when playing longer. But his real failings are rooted in the more traditional expectation of an elite goalkeeper: be hard to beat. Save the shots you’re expected to save, and some that you’re not.",
      "His two seasons in the United goal have been riddled with mistakes. Not just basic handling errors, but some inexplicable decision-making and highly-questionable techniques. One example: his approach to one-on-ones – stay deep, sit down – can’t be one that any of the Carrington goalkeeping coaches and analysts endorse. And, assuming they have identified it, they haven’t corrected his habit of parrying into poor areas.",
      "The fact that United are in Bilbao right now, hoping to rescue a generationally-bad season with a trophy and a route into the Champions League via the back door, is in spite of Onana’s performances.",
      "As is the case with many of their failing players that need upgrading, getting Onana out of Old Trafford won’t be easy for United without almost giving him away. Really, they need to hope a sheikh in Saudi is blinded by his profile enough to ignore his flaws.",
      "With that comes another attempt at finding a goalkeeper capable, composed and confident enough to keep United’s goal.",
      "Recent days have seen the Red Devils linked with Emiliano Martinez. At first sight, it appears to be a solid match.",
      "Martinez, not long ago viewed by some as the best on the planet largely because of his role in making Argentina kings of the world, appears to possess the requisite confidence. Outwardly at least, he presents as a character big enough to handle the pressure of defending even United’s goal.",
      "But perhaps we shouldn’t be fooled by his bravado. It is entirely likely that Martinez is more sensitive and self-aware than Onana. The Argentina No.1 has spoken about how he has worked on portraying an image of infallibility; much of the arrogance is an act. Which is absolutely fine – goalkeepers do need to fake it if they aren’t feeling it. But we ought not to believe that Martinez is the outstanding candidate based purely on the character he plays.",
      "But you could argue that type of personality is not what United need at this stage of whatever trauma it is they are currently going through. An attention-seeking egomaniac impatient with others’ imperfections would not lead a happy existence behind Ruben’s reds right now.",

      "The game doesn’t produce many goalkeepers with those traits anymore. Modern keepers tend to carry a calmer authority, more in the mould of Alisson than Schmeichel or Kahn.",
      "Plenty still skirt close to the edge, but the likes of Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale have worked hard to train their chimp rather than allow it to fling faeces while swinging from the goalposts.",
      "Martinez too has tweaked his mindset and persona on the way to becoming one of the Premier League’s best, channelling the frustration of being overlooked at Arsenal towards oozing the confidence that helped Argentina to a third star. It worked for him then. But that doesn’t mean it will work at Old Trafford.",
      "He doesn’t have to act the d*ck now. The chip on his shoulder from being binned by Arsenal ought to have been smoothed by a World Cup winner’s medal and various individual honours thrusted from his groin that vindicate him from whatever doubts plagued him. It’s a matter of opinion whether Martinez is the best in the Premier League/Europe/world, but he’s rightly in all those conversations. That should be enough to facilitate the evolution from manufactured arrogance to supreme and justified confidence.",
      "United need much more of the latter than the former. Of course, Villa will have plenty to say about Martinez’s next steps. Shipping to Saudi is a very different prospect to selling to a domestic rival, if United can still be labelled that. Without making it worth their while, there is certainly more in a move for United than Villa.",
      "Which leads us to believe it perhaps won’t happen, especially if United are turned over by Tottenham in the Battle of the Banter Clubs. Regardless of the outcome in Bilbao, persisting with Onana is not an option for a serious club if United are hoping to be viewed as one again in the near future. The Cameroonian must be replaced, by an experienced, proven stopper. And Martinez ticks most of their boxes.",
      "Manchester United have been told why they need to “look beyond their rift” with Liverpool and sign £64m flop Darwin Nunez this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "Man Utd’s Andre Onana features twice, but one Brighton player has a hat-trick of shame in this ranking of the worst performances in this season’s Premier League.",
      "It’s probably Matz Sels on the eye test, but the stats say that Ederson has been tested more than Alisson and come out well on top.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly made an offer for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez after Unai Emery offered no assurances over his future at the club.",
      "A weekend of emotional farewells had us say goodbye to Goodison Park, Jamie Vardy, Emiliano Martinez, the old Arsenal and very possibly West Ham soon."

      "Ruben Amorim has been consistent in his message that not even winning the Europa League can save Manchester United’s season.",
      "Maybe he’s right. The fact they sit 16th in the league, with scope to slump further, remains a mind-melter when you actually stop and think about it. This is, after all, Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And unlike with Spurs, whose own league efforts are somehow even worse, there is not the same sense at United that a trophy – any trophy – makes everything worth it. United don’t need another season where the cracks of wretched league form are papered over with a trophy. They had one of those last season, and have spent this season paying for it.",
      "But what beating Tottenham in Bilbao might do for Man United is far more significant than the outcome of a single season. This, really, feels like where the divergence exists between these two finalists who sit next to each other so miserably back at home.",
      "Both can point to a vast discrepancy between their Premier League and Europa League form. Both have, correctly and inevitably, prioritised this competition at further cost to already ruined domestic campaigns.",
      "Both have made it abundantly clear where their priorities have been for months now.",
      "But with Spurs this feels like an opportunistic chance for catharsis, to cast off a banter albatross at long, long last and move on with their lives. On its own, the Europa League final perhaps means more for them, but as part of a wider plan it is United who face the bigger sliding doors moment in Bilbao.",
      "Win or lose, Spurs will reset and relaunch yet again under a new manager, who will be given some of the signings he needs yet by no means all. They will spend a year or two in transition, lose their nerve, and start the whole process again. It is the history of the Tottenham.",
      "United’s case is slightly different. They are in the early stages of one of their own frequent post-Fergie resets, one that involved bringing in a manager whose style of play is almost entirely at odds with the squad that’s been left at his disposal.",
      "While Ange Postecoglou will surely leave Spurs win or lose, Amorim surely stays. What alters with victory here is the potential speed and scope of the rebuild he badly needs this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s move to Old Trafford is welcome, and shows that even in their current reduced and sorry state United remain a draw for players with what are, on paper, better choices.",
      "But there is no doubt that the financial and footballing benefits of being able to offer Champions League football will make United’s other wooing missions this summer that bit easier.",
      "Bluntly, even as wretched as they are now, United in the gutter are still looking at the stars. Given the right tools and opportunity, Amorim remains a manager capable of restoring them to something like their rightful place in English football even after his unnecessarily chaotic and poorly-timed arrival.",
      "For Spurs, Wednesday night in Bilbao is a destination in itself. A release of emotion and frustration akin to that we’ve already seen this season for Newcastle and Crystal Palace.",
      "For United, though, it represents more of a stepping stone. They’ll enjoy the night if it goes their way, of course, but it won’t even be the first time they’ve won this trophy in the post-Fergie wilderness years.",
      "The flipside, of course, is that defeat comes with dread consequences and further erosion of an already significantly depleted aura.",
      "While victory represents a potentially transformative springboard for Amorim and the club, defeat will leave them as not only the Manchester United team that finished 16th – or maybe even worse – in the Premier League but also the one that handed a trophy to Tottenham.",
      "This one game comes to early in Amorim’s reign to definitively make or break him right now, but it still feels like when his United career comes to be judged, the result of this one game will be a pivotal moment in setting its overall course."

      "Nine Man Utd players who should leave this summer\nFollowing the season United have had, where it’s honestly been such a drag watching some games, it makes you think how United have somehow gone from 8th place last year in the league with Ten Hag at the helm (which was deemed as disastrous), to 16th in the league this year. It proves some players are just rubbish and there for the paycheck. There isn’t really an excuse for it to be finishing not only in the lower half of the table, but to be finishing below 15th place, is brutally shite.",
      "I have no idea how the team are somehow the only unbeaten side in Europe this season, but it looks like Amorim does have a few tricks up his sleeve in European competition, but has to improve drastically in the Premier League next season otherwise he will probably get sacked. Truth be told, I wish the whole board would just get sacked, with former United players and those who understand the standards of the club to take their place, but Ratcliffe and the Glazers are the ones in charge and it doesn’t look like that will change any time soon…",
      "If the owners actually had some sense of responsibility and courage, and the manager must communicate this as well, they need to have a serious conversation with some of the players at the club and insist on putting them on the transfer list. And if United can’t sell them due to the ridiculous salaries they are on, at least loan them and agree a deal with another club to pay for 40-50% of their wage. The players who need to leave are the following.",
      "Luke Shaw: This player is honestly so lucky to have been at United for the last 11 years. Yes its unfortunate how his leg injury ruined his potential and his fitness, but United should have gotten rid of Shaw years ago. Not reliable or good enough and did have a few good years, but it’s time to go.",
      "Jonny Evans: Did we seriously just sign him to keep Tom Heaton some company? Pointless signing.",
      "Victor Lindelof: Actually rate him quite a lot as a defender and player, and built a somewhat solid partnership with Maguire over the years, but should try and head back to somewhere like Benfica or a mid-table club in Italy/Spain.",
      "Diogo Dalot: I think he had a great year last season, but very big downfall this year. If United can get 35-40 million for him, sell him as he isn’t good enough defensively, has headless chicken vibes.",
      "Christian Eriksen: I thought he was excellent in his first year at United and was just as good as Casemiro in that first year under Ten Hag, but time for him to leave on a free and enjoy last few years at another club.",
      "Jadon Sancho: No explanation needed, came for money and incredibly overrated. Loan him again if necessary.",
      "Marcus Rashford: Looks like he needs a new start, and if United can sell him for a reasonable amount of money, they should sell him and it’s a big salary amount off the books too.",
      "Antony: Has proven that United really were the problem, need to convince Real Betis to sign him for around 30 million and looks to suit La Liga much more than the Premier League.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund: I do think the criticism of him has been somewhat unfair, but is he good enough to score 15-20 goals a season? He just looks so uncomfortable up front and should head back to Italy where the game seemed to suit him more. Would make a big loss on him given the price paid for, but should cash in and sign another striker.",
      "I would arguably include Mason Mount as part of this list due to his injury issues, but only came in two seasons ago. Knowing United, they won’t even sell half of the players listed here, and it will be the same vicious circle of an ‘Average’ summer of transfers. 8-9 players must be sold/loaned out this summer, a large chunk of players need to leave the club before bringing in new blood. If the owners don’t realise that, then Amorim will eventually pay the price and the same thing will happen to United where they bring in a manager for 2 years max and change it up when the owners feel like it/are bored.",

      "",
      "There are some positives though…\nSo here we stand on the precipice of glory or failure. Win and the season will be marginally acceptable, lose and it will be confirmed a disastrous campaign. This goes for both teams, and the fact Spurs have got the better of us thrice this season makes me incredibly nervous (albeit the two under RA were close affairs). Which United will turn up – Ruby’s Euro diamonds or Ruben’s relegation-hunting rejects?",
      "The league season was a write-off a good couple of months ago, so I can understand some sluggish league performances. We haven’t won since March but, Newcastle aside, most matches have been fairly evenly contested. But this doesn’t make it acceptable, and Ruben has said as much.",
      "Of course the manager has to take some flak, that comes with the territory, but we have known for some time that the squad isn’t good enough regardless of what system is being played – this doesn’t necessarily mean they are all “bad” players individually, just as a collective it hasn’t worked, and changes were and are needed.",
      "I like Hojlund, but he isn’t ready to lead the line for us every week and is still learning the game and how to deal with the pressure of being at one of the world’s biggest clubs – he needs to be a 1 in 2 striker, and it remains to be seen if he can hit those numbers.",
      "Garnacho will be a fine player, but he isn’t a wingback or a #10, so doesn’t suit the system; he has improved but, again, is not ready to play there week in week out. I don’t want us to sell him but might be necessary.",
      "Our wingbacks, key positions in this system, have not delivered consistently – injuries explain some of this but, regardless, we need players there who can defend, attack and stay fit! Dorgu looks a good buy but is still raw, not sure Amass will make it with us but we’ll see. Malacia who? Dalot gives 100% but isn’t consistent in attack, he should stick to the edge of the box cutbacks as they are his most effective deliveries, and Mazraoui looks more at home as the right CB. Most of our quality in MF is aging and our GK loves a mistake. So other than that, it’s all good.",
      "It’s not all doom and gloom, Maguire continues to look good in a 3, Yoro looks a player, Diallo has come back as sharp, Zirkzee has shown some flashes and Bruno is Bruno. Mount has even stayed fit for longer than 3 matches. We will add to the squad in the summer (Cunha would be perfect, would love Mbeumo but can’t see it), there are some promising youth players to come through and the players we keep will have more of an idea of what is expected of them.",
      "The point being, talk of getting rid of Amorim at this stage is madness. He will know that next season brings less patience, and his methods have to be seen to be working in the league as that is our bread and butter. A trophy and CL place would, however, be a start and buy him some further support.\nGarey (come on United!!) Vance, MUFC",

      "Is Frimpong that odd of a potential signing?\nYouth development is never linear; as good as Bradley has been, he isn’t consistent. Defensively he was excellent against Mbappe and bloody terrible against Martinelli. He’s been Cafu incarnate going forward, whilst also showing the inadequacies of Abel Xavier in some moments.",
      "For every youth prospect that excels, like a Gravenberch, there’s a youth prospect that excels and then stalls, like Bajcetic. Both may well thrive, but relying on one was foolhardy and didn’t work and relying on the other did work – though entirely out of luck rather than judgement.",
      "There is a difference between giving youth a chance with an opportunity that’s still safe to fail, and relying on youth and then their struggles hamper the whole team, the compounding pressure of that then destroys their career.",
      "Gravenberch saved the day this season but it was a forced gamble, rather than a plan that should be scaled. Beyond that, perpetually play a kid in every game, and you’ll break them as LFC did with Owen and Arteta may well do with Saka.",
      "The interesting thing about Frimpong is, if he is signed, it’d obviously provide competition for Connor Bradley, but given his attacking output, it’d not be out of the question for both to play on the right hand side. Frimpong strikes me as another potential Riise, who can play on the wing or as full back.",
      "And to that end, Salah has rightly earned a new contract, but this season has indicated a degree of burnout by April. If a season is 50+ games long, with minutes available at right wing and right back, then 40+ starts for Frimpong across both roles, and 20 + sub appearances for Connor at full back is still good squad management, and that’s discounting injuries. I’m likely mis-remembering but I recall Arsenal playing Eboue as a winger, and didn’t Saka start out as a full back before moving forward? I’m sure it’s been done before, it’s just my memory is failing me.",
      "Not everyone’s career ends up like Gareth Bale’s but the prospect of playing an attacking full back further forward isn’t entirely new, and not entirely unsuccessful. Riise was instrumental in Istanbul after all.",
      "Final thing would be that at circa thirty million, in today’s world of utterly ludicrous prices, that’s not too extravagant, and albeit losing Trent for buttons is a huge dropped-bollock, having two people replace him for an all-in cost of 30 million does repair that damage somewhat.",
      "I can empathise with the argument F365 are making about saving your transfer kitty till you know if a target is available. The inverse to that logic though is your main target’s price tag could/would swell to fill your entire budget if you wait forever, as your negotiating position is reduced: folks will know how much money you have.",
      "If LFC kept their powder dry, then Newcastle could argue they want the whole fee for Isaak up front. If LFC bring in two fullbacks relatively quickly, they could make the case to Newcastle that they’d be ‘happy’ adding extra onto the fee, but need to defer the installments across 18 months or longer etc – basically negotiating. (notwithstanding that i don’t think Isaak will move this window, just using him as an example as you did).",
      "I’d hope that with the sales of Darwin, Chiesa, Tsimikas, Kellegher, and Jota, and the departure of Trent, and the rumours of an exit for Endo and Elliot, that the club would have budget and wage bill capacity to do what they need to. If the signing of an ‘extra’ full back negates that, then as much as I really can’t be arsed with the manic fringe of the FSG-out brigade, some questions would realistically need to be asked as to where the money is. And Frimpong looks a decent buy if the club can get it sorted.\nTom",

      "On Joel Ward. Or why Palace are 12th\nYes, I’m still overwhelmed by the FA Cup Final. Details keep coming back to me, like seeing Paddy McCarthy from the 2010 survival side squaring up to one of Manchester City’s medical team, or the fact that victory was secured with two important players (Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton) requiring substitution due to head injuries.",
      "However, the dominant memory at the moment is what happened immediately before the cup presentation. Last week it was announced that Joel Ward, the longest-serving member of the current Crystal Palace squad, would be leaving the club when he contract expires in the summer.",
      "Clearly we all missed a memo because we didn’t plaster Selhurst with posters calling him a Judas, forcing him to pick “loyalty or lolly”, sending death threats to him and his family on social media and demanding the Joel Ward mural be painted over – that’s what you’re supposed to do when a long-serving right-back announces they’re leaving at the end of their contract, isn’t it?",
      "Ward joined the club from Portsmouth in 2012, leaving a side that had been relegated from the Championship for one that had finished 17th, for a fee of £400,000. The following season he made 25 appearances as Palace were promoted to the Premier League, and prior to this campaign made that many or more appearances in nine out of eleven seasons. Arguably the dictionary definition of a reliable if unspectacular full back, there is no denying that he has been one of the best value for money signings of the past 15 years – particularly as his arrival, with Palace just a year or so out of administration, meant they had to sell players in order to fund his acquisition.",
      "In a way, he’s a good example of why Palace finish roughly 12th every year. A more ruthless club would have cut Ward loose a long time ago, replaced him with someone younger, cheaper and with personal ambition in abundance that can be translated into ambition for the team. And yet, he’s still here, because as Steve Parish has said in interviews about other players, he wants to do right by the person behind the player; he knows that Ward, like Paddy McCarthy or Damien Delaney before him, still has leadership and experience to contribute to the group and its younger members even if he isn’t playing every week.",
      "Some clubs, or at least the very online people among their supporters, will see this as excessive sentimentality that holds Palace back, but it isn’t, it’s just humans being considerate to each other.",
      "And then we get to Saturday, when Ward and Guehi get to lift the FA Cup together, the first people to ever do that in Crystal Palace colours. It was a fantastic moment and something so richly deserved for someone who has done so much for the club for so long. Not being someone to actively seek the spotlight made it all the better that he got to be front and centre at the greatest moment in the club’s history – the greatest moment in the club’s history so far. Go well, Wardy.\nEd Quoththeraven",
      "",
      "Giving the promoted clubs a chance\nSimple solution, currently Premier League teams can only loan two Premier League players, what if say newly promoted sides were allowed up to 6 (then 4 in their second season and back to the default 2 in their third)? On the face of it wouldn’t it be a win-win? Newly promoted clubs get access to more Premier League level talent without the cost of transfer fees or locking in long-term expensive contracts, bigger clubs have more scope to give league minutes to players who need them (so currently all the promoted teams can only lend 6 between them, under this system you’d open up 24 more slots).",
      "You’d be less likely to end up with scenarios where players who desperately need the minutes, like Evan Ferguson end up going on loan to clubs who are taking them on as a spare rather than as a core part of their starting line up. I also would have an option for special appeal, wherein a club could make a case for exception circumstance on going over the set limit, this would leave the door open to late window options that turn up (like say a scenario where a player gets dramatically left out of the squad after a huge falling out and has nowhere to go).",
      "I’m aware that the sight of a team taking the field with majority players they don’t ‘own’ might be weird at first (and of course they don’t have to fill all their slots either), but surely it’d be preferable to the predictable churn of promoted sides in giving them a better fighting chance, and with more league teams in Europe than ever before and so needing deeper squads i can see how something like this could serve as a halfway house for players on the verge of the first team of higher tier sides to bridge the gap.",

      "Gyokeres has been strongly linked with a transfer to Arsenal this summer, but could be tempted by a move to Man United, where his former Sporting boss, Ruben Amorim, is now in charge.",

      "Amorim’s side face Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday, with a place in next season’s Champions League and around £100million on the line.",
      "That income would help United rebuild their squad to suit Amorim’s style of play, with defeat expected to hit them hard and possibly result in the exit of one or two young stars such as Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho.",

      "United downed tools in the Premier League some time ago and currently sit 16th, so their season will essentially end on Wednesday night in Bilbao, with summer transfer business immediately taking centre stage.",
      "According to French outlet L’Equipe, the Manchester giants have ‘a clear idea of the avenues to explore for each targeted position’ in the summer window and ‘have already completed the signing of’ Matheus Cunha. Reports suggest the Wolves forward will cost United £67million.",

      "French champions Paris Saint-Germain have previously been linked with Gyokeres, but the report says they ‘no longer seem to be in the race’. Luis Enrique apparently does not want to sign a new striker, ‘and even less so an expensive player’, it’s said.",

      "Manchester United have once again been handed a two-star food hygiene rating after mouse droppings were found in several hospitality areas at Old Trafford, despite months of efforts to clean up the stadium’s catering operations.",
      "The latest inspection, carried out by environmental health officers in mid-April, revealed evidence of mice in ‘seven areas across the stadium’, including high-end suites such as the Ambassador Lounge, the Manchester Suite, and the Number 7 Suite, as per the Daily Mail, who ‘has seen the inspection report from environmental health experts’.",
      "In some instances, droppings were discovered ‘under the buffet bar’, raising serious concerns about hygiene in spaces that serve food to thousands of supporters.",
      "The Number 7 Suite, described by the club as ‘one of the most stylish spaces’ in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, starts at £550 per person. The Manchester Suite, where a ‘large number of droppings’ were reportedly found, typically costs around £600 per head.",
      "This marks the continuation of a worrying trend, after United’s rating dropped from four to two stars back in November, prompting a series of internal measures to improve cleanliness and pest control.",
      "In response to the latest findings, a Manchester United spokesperson said the club ‘implements a robust pest-control system’ and carries out ‘multiple weekly checks’ across all catering zones.",
      "They added: ‘Stringent measures are taken to ensure levels of hygiene and cleanliness are high wherever food is stored, prepared and served,’ and that ‘immediate and appropriate action’ is taken if any incidents occur.",
      "Old Trafford’s ageing infrastructure and high footfall – with more than 250,000 people dining at the stadium each season – have contributed to what inspectors labelled a significant challenge.",

      "The stadium houses 29 kitchens and catering facilities, meaning problems in any area can affect the overall rating.",
      "Inspectors also highlighted other hygiene concerns, including ‘dirty’ areas and improper food labelling.",
      "One cited case involved a container of pesto labelled for use over a month, despite the manufacturer stating it should be consumed within eight days. These issues are reportedly being ‘addressed immediately’.",
      "Despite the renewed two-star rating, the inspection report acknowledged that ‘significant work has taken place to control the mice activity’, but urged United to ‘persevere with the measures being implemented to eradicate activity within food areas.’",
      "A Manchester United spokesperson said: ‘Manchester United implements a robust pest-control system throughout Old Trafford.",
      "‘Multiple weekly checks are made in all catering areas and stringent measures are taken to ensure levels of hygiene and cleanliness are high wherever food is stored, prepared and served.",

      "United fan Andy Goldstein was even more direct. “I think he’s a really good player, I don’t think he’s the finished article just yet,” he said. “And we’ve got a Liam Delap [in Hojlund], and it’s not working at the minute. We’ve got a Liam Delap. I think two of them is not the answer.”",
      "The comments echoed Jamie Carragher’s warning earlier this week, when he suggested Delap would be better served taking an intermediate step, such as Everton, before joining a top-six club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",
      "Jamie Carragher has warned a Premier League striker to steer clear of a move to Man Utd, naming Everton as a more suitable destination.",
      "Liam Delap would rather join Man United than Chelsea, or he would rather join Chelsea than Man United. It all depends whether you believe The Sun or… The Sun.",
      "Liam Delap to Manchester United is “very close” despite interest from Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United, according to reports.",
      "Ex-Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs has picked out two ideal signings for his former club, who need “ten” additions to get back on track."

      "A bullish Ange Postecoglou said he will \"never be a clown\" and insisted his work at Spurs is not done - even if they beat Manchester United in Wednesday's Europa League final.",
      "In an explosive press conference ahead of the game in Bilbao, the 59-year-old hit out at a newspaper headline which described him as \"teetering between hero and clown\" amid speculation over his future as the club's head coach.",
      "Spurs' poor Premier League campaign, which has seen them slump to 17th place on 38 points, having lost a club-record 21 games, has led to suggestions that he could leave even if he guides them to their first trophy in 17 years in the Europa League.",
      "But Postecoglou insisted his future is not a distraction and urged his team to seize their chance to make history by winning a trophy which would also earn Spurs a Champions League spot.",
      "\"I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and I never will be, mate,\" he told a reporter in reference to the article relating to his Spurs legacy.",
      "\"I'm really disappointed you'd use such terminology about a person who, for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he's leading out a club in a European major competition.",
      "\"For you to suggest that, somehow, us not being successful means that I'm a clown... I'm not really sure how to answer that question.\"",
      "Postecoglou has faced repeated questions relating to his future in recent months but insisted his sole focus is on ensuring his players are ready to take their opportunity to win silverware.",
      "\"Does it matter, really?\" he said when asked about his future. \"It doesn't matter because the reality of it is the opportunity is the same for me and, more importantly, for the club.",
      "Postecoglou said the injured Lucas Bergvall is not available to play against Manchester United despite having travelled with the squad to Bilbao. Pape Sarr is fit, however, despite having been taken off with back pain during Friday's 2-0 loss to Aston Villa.\n\n\nJames Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also missing due to injury but like Bergvall, have travelled with the squad to Bilbao to support their team-mates.",
      "\"I've said before, whatever happens beyond tomorrow is kind of irrelevant when you think about the opportunity that exists right now and that is to provide something special for this football club, for the supporters, for everyone who's worked so hard, not just this year, but for the last 15, 16 years since we last won a trophy and 41 years since a European trophy.",
      "\"If I were worried about my tenure at this football club, it's fair to say we wouldn't be in this position as I would've been distracted long ago. I'm pretty good at making sure all my focus is on giving this football club the best opportunity to do something special.",
      "\"Whatever happens after that, I'm very comfortable that I'll continue on trying to win trophies wherever I am.\"",
      "The Spurs boss insisted he has not spoken to his players about his future ahead of the final, adding: \"Again, that would not really be helpful in what is before us right now.",
      "\"I've said to the lads from day one, nothing is guaranteed in life, nothing is guaranteed in sport, so you've got to make sure you take every opportunity before you.",
      "\"That's what I've done my whole career. I've been in this position before where the big game was the last game I managed, so it's not unusual territory for me and I've always navigated that pretty well.",
      "\"For me, nothing is more important than my responsibility at this football club and to its fans tomorrow. Me and the players' minds are on one thing and that's trying to create something special.\"",
      "Pressed again on his future, Postecoglou insisted: \"I wouldn't be the first person who changes jobs. We all change jobs.",
      "\"My future's assured. I've got a beautiful family, I've got a great life, I'll keep on winning trophies until I finish, wherever that is, so don't worry about my future.",
      "\"My future is not entwined with anything. Provided, God willing, my health remains and my beautiful family and friends are beside me... there's nothing wrong with my future.",
      "\"Don't stress. Sleep easy at night. I'll be OK.",
      "\"I don't think my job is done here. I really feel like we're building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.",
      "\"I still think there's a lot of work to be done, that's quite obvious with the challenges we've had this year, which are well chronicled. There's some reasoning in the context of that, but also there's been some growth that I'd like to see through.",
      "\"Whether that happens or not is not that important right now. I don't think this job's finished and I certainly feel like there's some growth there that we can take this club to where it needs to be.\"",
      "Spurs captain Heung-Min Son insisted he is ready to make history by winning his first trophy at the club after admitting he was affected by nerves in the 2019 Champions League final loss to Liverpool.",
      "\"It would be very special,\" he said. \"It would be a historic moment, I stayed here 10 years. I just want to win the trophy, which nobody has done in 10 years.",
      "\"Tomorrow is going to be a massive day for the club and for the boys, and for me as well. It has been such a tough season but we have always been together and that's why we are here.\"",
      "Son, who also revealed he had chatted to Bundesliga winner Harry Kane ahead of Wednesday's game, continued: \"Six years ago I played my first final. It was a very nervous moment.",
      "\"It was exciting but I was very nervous. I couldn't believe I was in the Champions League final.",
      "\"Six years later I'm a grown man, I'm experienced and just want to prepare in my way, calm.",
      "\"So many players have changed, also my role has changed. I'm captain of this club and leader of the boys and I want to help lift the trophy together.",
      "\"That is my dream. Tomorrow, I hope we can make a historic day that I can never forget.\"",
      "Son only recently returned from injury but insisted he feels physically prepared for the challenge ahead as Spurs aim to change their history of falling short.",
      "\"If we win the trophy, we can change the mentality and the history of the club. Then hopefully we can compete for other trophies.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim reiterated his stance that winning the Europa League would not solve the club's issues but admitted it would help him build their future.",
      "Amorim's side sit only a point ahead of Postecoglou's in 16th place in the Premier League after a similarly difficult campaign but while the Spurs boss has preached optimism, Amorim has favoured brutal realism.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident, but we already know the problems,\" he said.",
      "Manchester United have been given a boost with Diogo Dalot, Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro all available to feature having recovered from injury.\n\n\n\"They recovered quite well,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we respect the feelings of the players, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to part of the team and that is a very good sign.\n\n\n\"They are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club; the way we do everything in the week at Carrington, the recruitment, the academy. I think we need to improve.",
      "\"It's hard to point at one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow will be important for us, for our fans. That feeling of winning can help us have strength to do every job we have to do.",
      "\"But nothing is going to change our season. We have a lot to do at our club, not just winning tomorrow. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build the future.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire insisted Manchester United have shown their quality in the Europa League, despite their domestic struggles.",
      "\"When you play for this club, you want to win every football match and this season we've been far too inconsistent, we haven't won enough in the Premier League. It's not been good enough, we know that.",
      "\"The Europa League has been different. We've performed at a high level and we have proven again this season we can beat anybody.",
      "\"I'm sure, next season, we will improve an awful amount, with a full pre-season and, as players, we're all looking forward to that, but we've got a big game tomorrow night, first and foremost.",
      "\"It's a special night, a special occasion. We've prepared well and it's one we're looking forward to.\"",
      "Maguire has earned plaudits for some of his attacking contributions during United's run to the final, including scoring the winner in their comeback win over Lyon in the quarters, but hopes he won't be needed up front on Wednesday night.",
      "\"The manager has me dribbling every day in training, running up and down the wing,\" he joked.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao, managed to put a good cross in and Casemiro scored the goal.",
      "\"I've gone up front in the later minutes of games; hopefully tomorrow night I'm not going up front.",
      "\"I don't want to go up front chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "\"I'm always there to help, always there to do my best, but I'm more than happy playing in my favoured position.\""

      "\"Every game has its history…\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said these words when asked about the prospect of playing Tottenham in the Europa League final - a team that has beaten the Red Devils three times already this season.",
      "But the question is, will their recent history matter when it comes to who wins the trophy - and that crucial Champions League place?",
      "Perhaps the performance Spurs will take the most encouragement from is their first of the season against United, an utterly dominant 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September to put even more pressure on United's former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The game is evidence of why Ange Postecoglou is wrapping Micky van de Ven in cotton wool ahead of the final.",
      "Van de Ven was not just defensively impressive in this game, as he typically is, he also carried the ball over half the length of the Old Trafford pitch to set up Brennan Johnson for their opening goal in the third minute.",
      "The game then was seemingly over at the end of the first half when Bruno Fernandes was sent off - a red card that was later overturned through appeal.",
      "But this is a different United side. Although you cannot suggest their position in the Premier League of 16th is evidence they have moved forward under Ruben Amorim, they do look better defensively, they concede fewer chances, and have shown in these big European nights that they can be a threat going forward, more so anyway, then under Ten Hag.",
      "The second time these two sides met was in the Carabao Cup quarter finals in December - a fun encounter that Postecoglou's Spurs won once again, this time 4-3, with Amorim having taken over from Ten Hag.",
      "But when you look at lessons both sides could take to the final, it is challenging when you consider the context around it.",
      "First of all you look at the make-up of both sides. Spurs had Archie Gray and Radu Dragusin making up their centre-back partnership, with Fraser Forster in goal. Spurs' main three at the back of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario and defenders Van de Ven and Cristian Romero were all injured.",
      "For United, again, a side that will be much changed for the final with Altay Bayindir starting in goal, Lisandro Martinez, who is out for the remainder of the season, as well as Antony, who is now starring for Real Betis in Spain, also featured.",
      "On this occasion, although Spurs were injury-hit and did well to progress, Amorim also took a calculated risk to heavily rotate many of his first-team players. It did not work out as they lost their next three games in the Premier League as well.",
      "February was the last time these two sides met and Spurs won 1-0 but I don't think Amorim will look back at this game too closely.",
      "That's partly because the goal United conceded was a poor one. Andre Onana should have done much better to palm away a Lucas Bergvall shot, which ended up leaving James Maddison with a comfortable finish right in front of goal.",
      "Amorim had very limited opportunities to change the game when you look at the squad he had to pick from at that moment. It was an injury-ravaged United side. Victor Lindelof was the only substitute who had any sort of Premier League experience.",
      "Spurs had injuries too, with Kevin Danso and Ben Davies their centre-back pairing, two players who again are not likely to start in the final, while Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski also started but will play no part on Wednesday due to injury.",
      "Not much, really!",
      "Spurs will take confidence despite the circumstances. When they have taken on Untied this season, they have been able to pull out performances and perhaps more importantly, results.",
      "Dominic Solanke has three goals in three meetings against United too, which may give him that extra edge against their opponents in the final.",
      "Asked about facing a side who have beaten United three times, Amorim said: \"If you look at the odds, we are closer to winning than losing. Both teams will play like all or nothing.\"",
      "Those last three words perfectly describe Manchester United in Europe this season: all or nothing.",
      "United looked like they'd be out of the competition when they were 4-2 down at Old Trafford against Lyon in the quarter-finals but they miraculously came back.",
      "In the semi-finals, as I travelled to Bilbao for their tie against Athletic Club, most pundits and fans alike would have thought a draw away to a team who had lost just once in LaLiga since August at home would have been sufficient",
      "Man Utd won 3-0 in San Mames and 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "We also have to consider the tactical tweaks Amorim has made since the two sides last met in February.",
      "In the most important games, he has now settled on a midfield duo of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Brazilian especially has become revitalised under Amorim in recent months.",
      "Amorim told me this has been mainly down to Casemiro working on his own fitness as well as the United boss tweaking the way they press, more so with their wing-backs going high, enabling Casemiro to stay in front of the defence and not be caught out on transition.",
      "Amorim and the players have spoken about how the physicality levels of European opponents are more suited to the players, which does pose the question of how they will deal with a physical Spurs side who will look to impose themselves as they have done in this season's previous meetings.",
      "But United have been illogical and unpredictable when it comes to the Europa League this season. When you consider all of the circumstances of their previous meetings with Spurs, it is clear that they won't have much relevance.",
      "Wednesday's game is a different proposition for both sides."

      "Matheus Cunha is set to join Manchester United after the season ends this weekend.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11. The 90-minute odds have United at 7/4 and Spurs at 29/20.",
      "It's a 50-50 spin of the Roulette wheel. White or red. Heads or tails.",
      "I'm very confused about this game from a betting perspective.",
      "These two teams have been completely different in the Europa League compared to their Premier League form. And usually you'd put more weight in the domestic form to gauge a true ability of a team, especially in this spot as this is an all-Premier League final. But I'm very torn.",
      "United can't score in the Premier League, averaging just 1.14 goals per 90 minutes and have scored just five goals in their last eight games. But look at their Europa League form.",
      "They have averaged 2.5 goals per game this season, scoring a whopping 19 goals in their six games with Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Club in the knockouts.",
      "And then we have Spurs, who are equally as confusing to analyse. As they are a completely different team to their overall form of this Premier League season when their first-choice back five plays under Ange Postecoglou. The difference is simply huge.",
      "When Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie all play under Postecoglou, they have won 18 of those 30 games, losing just six times.",
      "If you were converting that to points per game - that's two per game. If you translate that over the course of a Premier League season of 38 games, you get 76 points, which would be enough to finish a clear second in the Premier League this season. There is a really good side lurking there.",
      "It's a game where backing teams both not to win is actually quite attractive, so the draw in 90 minutes at 23/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play the outright market.",
      "Three of the last four Europa League finals have ended in a stalemate. It's a result which is always a runner in finals of this nature where two big clubs meet with lots on the line.",
      "Much better opportunities are found in the props market for Wednesday's clash in Bilbao, notably in the fouls markets.",
      "The Europa League final has a rich tradition of being a foul-heavy occasion - it makes sense with such riches on the line.",
      "The last 15 Europa League finals have averaged 31.2 fouls per 90 minutes.",
      "That's a huge number.",
      "For context, Premier League matches have averaged 22.5 fouls per 90 this season, so the added jeopardy of a final using those numbers, there could be almost 10 more fouls in this type of game that a run-of-the-mill Premier League game. And when you throw in so much being on the line for these clubs and how evenly matched they are in the betting, I think this game could be very foul-heavy and potentially go way above the number the market is expecting.",
      "Sky Bet has the line set at 24+ match fouls at 5/6 which looks a great starting point for those looking to exploit these total fouls angles. I'd advise laddering the prices on offer with Sky Bet right up to the 10/1 on offer for 32+ match fouls, which has a chance of landing based on the historic averages.",
      "And it's worth noting that Spurs are a foul-heavy team under Postecoglou - he likes to play expansive and man-for-man which creates lots of one-on-one situations in space that therefore lend itself to fouls being made. Since he was appointed, no team in the Premier League has seen more fouls in their matches than Tottenham - that average is 24.5 fouls per 90 over a 75-game sample size in the Premier League.",
      "On the biggest stage, with so much on the line, I'd expect this Spurs game to hit those foul averages so those odds look very generous to me."

      "Crueller observers might speculate that 'tough to watch' is a fitting preview of the forthcoming final between two of Berbatov's former clubs, Manchester United and Tottenham. Both have endured particularly miserable Premier League seasons.",
      "Incredibly, since the two teams met in London in mid-February, neither has managed to beat an opponent that will be competing in next season's Premier League - their only victories coming against the relegated trio. In Bilbao, it will be 16th against 17th.",
      "\"Some will say maybe it is not fair when one of them wins and goes to the Champions because they did not earn it or qualify in the proper way. But it is what it is and it is going to be an interesting game now because their backs are against the wall,\" says Berbatov.",
      "\"Finals are about concentration, about not making silly mistakes, because you could be punished and there is no rematch. Maybe we will be surprised and it will be an open game but I expect caution, nobody wanting to take risks. Their seasons are on the line.",
      "\"The only thing that can justify either season now is lifting that trophy. Who needs it more? That is the question. United have been going backwards while others gone forwards. Spurs have not won a trophy in 17 years. So in a way, both managers need it.",
      "\"Ange Postecoglou, he can say, 'I told you, I always win something in my second season. Now shut up.' Or Ruben Amorim can say, 'Trust me, this is the system that we are going to play and now we can build for United's next season with that trophy'.\"",
      "It was Berbatov himself who scored the goal when Tottenham won the 2008 League Cup final - their last piece of silverware. They came from behind that day at Wembley to beat a strong Chelsea side. \"We were the underdogs, we had nothing to lose,\" he remembers.",
      "\"That was the Chelsea of Didier Drogba, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Petr Cech, some great players. But we knew that we would have our chances to score because we scored a lot of goals, that team, especially up front with me and Keano (Robbie Keane).",
      "\"Everybody expected Chelsea to win. Drogba scored a great free-kick but we kept going.\" Berbatov equalised from the penalty spot and Jonathan Woodgate won the cup in extra-time. \"Sometimes that is all you need, a penalty or a corner kick or whatever.\"",
      "Berbatov has had his own frustrations in finals, of course. In the 2002 Champions League final, his Bayer Leverkusen team were edged out by Real Madrid's superstars in an even game at Hampden Park. A moment of magic from Zinedine Zidane decided it.",
      "\"It was probably the greatest ever goal in a Champions League final. There was nothing you could do. The ball just landed at the feet of the one player you do not want the ball to land to. In football, sometimes even your best is not good enough. It is a cruel game.\"",
      "It was cruel in 2011 too. Despite being the joint-top scorer in the Premier League that season, sharing the Golden Boot with Carlos Tevez, Berbatov was surprisingly omitted not just from the United team for the Champions League final but the entire squad.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has since apologised for the move - he started Javier Hernandez, with Michael Owen preferred on the bench. Does Berbatov understand the call yet? \"Not personally but Sir Alex obviously admitted that he probably made a mistake,\" he says.",
      "\"My confidence was sky high. You are king of the world or that is how I felt. In every game, you think you are going to score. But even if I did play, I do not know if it would have made any difference because at that time Barcelona had prime Lionel Messi!\"",
      "Berbatov left United for Fulham at the end of the following season, with Ferguson calling time on his long reign at Old Trafford just one year after that. The Scottish legend bowed out with yet another Premier League title but United have been in decline ever since.",
      "\"United remain massive around the world, but it is a long time since that last Premier League and that way of thinking, that mentality of going to win every game, it has faded away,\" says Berbatov, speaking in his role as a LiveScore European brand ambassador.",
      "\"United have been struggling for years and that is painful, of course. Everybody knows that - the fans, the management, the coaches and the players as well. That is why this game is so important, so they can say, 'Look, we are struggling but we still won a trophy'.",
      "\"In the past few years, it has always been about how next season is going to be ours - and the next season. Again, we are in that position where next season, let us hope that the new manager can do it. As cliched as it sounds, you always have to keep the faith.",
      "\"Keep that faith and hope Ruben, with a pre-season behind him, will not start over, but maybe bring in the players he wants because he is not going to change, he loves that system. So you need players specifically to fit that system and hope the results come.\"",
      "Is there a suspicion that United just seem to find a way? Berbatov talks of them having \"a DNA that they need to win trophies\" while Spurs' wait goes on. But he is conflicted. \"I do not think it is that Spurs do not have belief. It is a tough question to answer,\" he says.",
      "\"On the one hand, there is the DNA of the club, the history, everything you have won before, and you know that the expectation from everybody is that you will win in the end. On the other hand, maybe if you are not expected to win then there is nothing to lose.",
      "\"Sometimes football can be a cruel game and there is just no explanation for it. You just go out there with your best intentions, you are fully concentrated, you are all ready to go, all your first-team players are ready and they play and then it just does not happen.\"",
      "Either way, Berbatov will be watching. Just do not ask him who he wants to win. \"I will sympathise with the loser because I have been there, winning finals and losing finals. Football will remind me again that there is so much joy but so much pain as well.\"",
