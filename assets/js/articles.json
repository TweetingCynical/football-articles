      "Manchester United have endured a dismal season, with Erik ten Hag's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season fading fast as they prepare to face Chelsea",
      "Jeff Stelling has insisted only Alejandro Garnacho and Diogo Dalot can emerge from Manchester United's dismal season with any credit.",
      "United have endured a miserable campaign in what is Erik ten Hag's second year in charge at Old Trafford. They look set to miss out on a place in the Champions League for next season, with fourth-place Aston Villa 11 points ahead heading into the final nine games.",
      "The manner of United's performances in recent weeks has also sparked concern, with Ten Hag's side lucky to escape relegation-threatened Brentford with a draw last week. But Stelling does believe some players have impressed.",
      "He picked out young winger Garnacho and fullback Dalot as the two who can look back on the season with positivity. The veteran broadcaster believes Garnacho has carried United's main threat for much of the campaign.",
      "He told talkSPORT: “If I were to say to you ‘Which Man United players have had good seasons this season?’, it wouldn’t be a long list. Dalot has had a really good season. I think Garnacho, who was subbed the other night, has been their main threat.”",
      "Boss Ten Hag has picked out Garnacho's connection with Dalot as a key reason for their success. The Argentine scored a goal of the season contender in the win over Everton earlier this season, with his manager delighted with how well the partnership with Dalot is going.",
      "\"Sometimes, we have to adjust this but, lately, it has worked out very well, and we want to keep that consistency with Diogo and Garnacho, over the right side, because they have their connection,\" he said.",
      "\"Also, Diogo, I know, has a very good connection with Antony. So, most of the time, we want to keep such routines and that is why I chose lately for this partnership. Keep Diogo more on the right side.\"",
      "Dalot has praised Ten Hag for his management, having made 39 appearances this term. The fullback's career has been revitalised under the Dutchman, having fallen out of favour under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "“Sometimes you just click with managers and players or team-mates and I think as soon as he came, that happened. The way that he sees football, the way that he sees the full-back position, I think it suits really well to what I see and what I like as well,\" he said in January.",
      "\"I think it was a good match; him, me and other players. You could see that we had many players that started really well since he came. I like to say that it is a good match and I'm hoping that it keeps like that.”",
      "“I look at the small wins. Sometimes you look at winning by just winning trophies or achievements with the team, but for me, it’s been the small things, looking back and seeing the way that I fought to stay at this club, getting a position in the team, and that for me has been the biggest achievement so far.\"",

      "Manchester United have endured a lacklustre campaign so far and former defender Rio Ferdinand has criticised the current squad, questioning where the real leaders are",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has delivered a scathing assessment of the current team, claiming the players are too emotional and that they lack real leaders.",
      "United currently sit sixth in the Premier League, 11 points off the top four, and have struggled to build on what was a successful first year in charge for Erik ten Hag. The Dutchman is now under huge pressure heading into the business end of his second season, with his future in doubt now that Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken charge of football operations.",
      "And Ferdinand has been critical of United's performances this season, suggesting they lack \"rigidness\" and \"just go gung-ho at times\". Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, Ferdinand said: \"You need leaders to be talking and pulling people about in games.",
      "\"How many times would you say to someone 'For the next few minutes, just sit and stay tight, be hard to play against.' I think emotion comes into this [ Manchester United ] team a lot. They are quite emotional players; they just go gung-ho at times – there's no rigidness to this team.\"",
      "Ferdinand also highlighted the recent emergence of Kobbie Mainoo, questioning why the 18-year-old has not been protected more by the senior players. \"You look at Kobbie Mainoo, who everyone is raving about and rightly so – he's been magnificent since he's come into the team,\" he added.",
      "\"But I don't see anyone trying to protect him. He's a kid – imagine if a young kid came into one of our teams, you try and protect that kid. There's only the odd one, like Wayne Rooney, you don't have to protect, but in the main you want to make sure there's bodies around, don't leave him exposed.",
      "‌\"How many games do you see him being left exposed? Imagine that feeling, being exposed in that midfield, it's a lonely place in there if there's big spaces. There's got to be older players and coaches in that team that make sure they tighten it up for that player, especially for the game at the weekend [against Liverpool ].\"",
      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher delivered a similar assessment of United and placed the blame firmly at Ten Hag's door. \"I look at Manchester United, and it's like it's two separate teams in one,\" he said.",
      "\"You have the front five, almost trying to press, and leaving this massive space. Any competent coach would look at that and go 'We're either all up here or all up there' – surely it isn't that difficult.\"",

      "Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani lodged a bid for Manchester United- through his Nine Two Foundation, but lost out to British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe",
      "Legal representatives for Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani have sent legal letters to Manchester United lawyers over \"false\" statements they allege were made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, it has been claimed.",
      "Sheikh Jassim launched a bid to buy the Premier League club after owners the Glazer family confirmed they were exploring investment options. The Qatari banker was unsuccessful in his efforts, though, with United confirming a 25 percent investment from rival bidder Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Ratcliffe took aim at Sheikh Jassim in February, asking whether he even exists. The Qatari has fired back, though, with legal letters alleging \"a pattern of demonstrably false and defamatory\" statements, according to The Athletic.",
      "The same report indicates Sheikh Jassim has demanded “immediate corrective action” to the club's SEC filings, and also alleges Ratcliffe breached a confidentiality agreement with his comments in a February interview. Mirror Football has contacted Manchester United for comment.",
      "\"Still nobody's ever seen him, actually,\" Ratcliffe said of Sheikh Jassim when making public statements in February. \"The Glazers never met him. I'm not sure he exists!\" he added, seemingly in jest.",
      "\"I don't know (if he was the only bidder). They were obviously there and there was a whole host of people on the team and in the squad. I didn't ever meet them. But it was it was a very odd affair.\"",
      "Ratcliffe himself initially made efforts to secure a 69 percent stake in United in a move which would have seen him take the Glazers' holding. Ultimately, though, the lower holding of 25 percent was agreed, as a cost of around £1.3billion to the INEOS chief.",
      "According to The Athletic, the Qataris have taken action following an SEC filing from United in January. This filing alleged the bid failed to provide “customary financing commitment letters”, something which Sheikh Jassim's party argue created a \"misleading\" impression.",
      "The same report indicates Sheikh Jassim's lawyers have contested the comments from Ratcliffe about him never having met the Glazers. They make reference to a July 2023 meeting with Joel and Avram Glazer, while Joe Ravitch of Raine Group - who oversaw the sale - also recalled a meeting with the banker.",
      "“We met Jassim. He was in New York. He’s a lovely guy; a very smart guy,\" Ravitch told The Times. \"The Qataris were very real. They were very smart guys, very thoughtful. I don’t know why they didn’t appreciate the value (of the club) but we were not their adviser.",
      "“We tried as the seller to explain the value to them, and they put what they thought was a series of very serious bids on the table.”",

      "The Manchester United forward has endured a miserable campaign this term. He’s scored just eight goals in all competitions - that downturn coming after a sensational 30-goal season last year.",
      "Keane has now given his verdict on Rashford’s poor form. The former Red Devils captain believes he needs someone in his ear giving him some harsh truths.",
      "Speaking on the Stick To Football podcast, Keane said: “There’s no question mark about his [Marcus Rashford’s] ability, he’s outstanding – but there’s something amiss with him. We’ve had these conversations every few months – a player can have an off-spell or a dip, but he’s certainly not enjoying his football.",
      "“I wouldn’t say I’m worried about him, but you look at him and there’s something amiss. The people around him, whether it be family or his manager, who’s on his case every day. Who is giving him an old-fashioned kick up the arse and saying ‘Come on, we need more from you’. If you want to be this leader, and you’re on the big contracts, then there is that responsibility.",
      "‌“I don’t think that is happening, I don’t think there is anybody on his case. That doesn’t mean to say he still can’t produce and start running a bit more. He’s been at the club a long time, since he was a kid.”",

      "He said: “I mean, we are talking about Manchester United currently and the reason that I think Marcus Rashford is the continual element of focus is because he’s a huge player at the club. You know, he’s the biggest player at the club, along with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“So, they are the two that will always gain the most headlines. But through this period, obviously when the boss left it’s been talked about now for, I don’t know how long – 10 / 11 years ago – you [Rio Ferdinand] were there at the very beginning, when obviously it went from the boss leaving to this new era, which has been a struggle.”",

      "Hjulmand quickly became a key player in Ruben Amorim's side and has made 42 appearances in all competitions. In fact, he has missed just two games since his arrival, one for a suspension and the other because he was an unused substitute.",
      "While he is predominantly a defensive midfielder, the Dane has chipped in with four goals and four assists. That has helped Sporting to surge to the top of the Primeira Liga and into the final of the Taca de Portugal.",
      "His performances have seen him draw interest from the likes of United, who were heavily linked with making a January move. The Red Devils are believed to remain admirers of the midfielder.",
      "That could lead to a bid in the summer from Erik ten Hag's side, though Hjulmand has already moved to shut talk of a potential departure down. Instead he has made it clear that is focus is on Sporting.",
      "\"Estadio Jose Alvalade is a very special place to play. I feel at home. I knew the importance of the club in Portugal, and also in Europe, as Sporting has played in the Champions League and the Europa League many times,\" Hjulmand told Betano.",

      "United have made signing a new centre-back a priority as part of their summer rebuild. Everton star Jarrad Branthwaite had already been identified as a potential recruit - albeit the Red Devils are waiting to see what price the Toffees set for the 21-year-old.",
      "According to The Times, Wolves star Kilman has now emerged as an option. It is suggested that the 26-year-old has been scouted on a number of occasions this term.",
      "There has been no contact between the two clubs regarding a deal but Wolves are apparently not keen on letting him leave. Kilman is under contract until 2028 having penned a new deal last summer.",
      "He was previously the subject of interest from Italian side Napoli. The reigning Serie A champions bid £30million for Kilman, an offer that Wolves rebuffed.",
      "Speaking after tying the defender down to his new contract, Wolves sporting director, Matt Hobbs said: “This is what Max deserves. We’ve been talking to Max since the end of last season and his evolution, not just through the club, but through his role in the first-team, has built a strong foundation for him.",
      "“There was lots of interest in Max, we had several offers, but we haven’t shifted in wanting him to stay. We believe he’s the soul of the team, having been here for a long time now, so he was never a player we considered selling.”",
      "Last summer was also a milestone for Kilman after being named Wolves captain. He has gone on to make 36 appearances in all competitions this season for the side since.",
      "A move for Kilman would fit into Ratcliffe’s new approach when it comes to transfers. It was previously suggested that the INEOS chief was set to instruct the club’s recruitment team to target homegrown talents.",
      "He is keen for more of a British core within the side at Old Trafford. There have been a distinct lack of homegrown signings at the club over recent years.",
      "Kilman would fit into that description. The defender commenced his development in the Fulham academy before a move to Gillingham. He moved to Welling United and Maidenhead before a bargain switch to Molineux in August 2018.",

      "Klopp's team beat United 7-0 in the corresponding fixture last season but were unable to repeat the trick this time around. They racked up 34 shots against Erik ten Hag's side, who had Diogo Dalot sent off late on, but couldn't find that crucial goal.",
      "Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by United in mid-March, but have a chance for revenge at Old Trafford on Sunday. Victory over Sheffield United on Thursday would ensure Klopp's side go into the weekend top of the table, and a win against United would keep them there.",
      "The three-way battle at the top remains very much alive, with Arsenal and Manchester City putting the pressure on Liverpool with Wednesday night wins. According to Klopp, though, his team has that stalemate against United to thank for maintaining their challenge.",
      "\"I loved the Manchester United game,\" Klopp said. \"We didn't win: it was 0-0, but that was the day our full counter-press mentality kicked in again.",
      "\"It was something I asked for before that game. I said everything is good so far, we are new together, we have to find a way, you cannot ask for counter-press when you play with ten men or nine men. You have to get through games in different ways, but before United we spoke specifically about that.",
      "\"You cannot just take the ball and fire direct at goal. But if you win it back high up the pitch, then it's pretty likely you will find a finish. That is definitely the explanation and since then, for me, the season changed into the way we wanted to play.\"",
      "Reflecting on the draw with United, Klopp recalled how previous games had brought wins but unconvincing ones. Liverpool had been unbeaten in nine before hosting Erik ten Hag's side, but needed late winners against Fulham and Crystal Palace as well as a last-gasp equaliser against Luton during that run.",
      "After the draw, Klopp's team took 13 points from a possible 15, only failing to win against Arsenal. The run included a 4-2 victory oer Newcastle in which the Reds set a new single-game xG record in the Premier League, as well as further four-goal hauls against Bournemouth and Chelsea.",
      "\"It was a really strange part of the season,\" Klopp added. \"We got results but I heard it once or twice that \"Liverpool get results but it is not fully convincing\" but I remember United like it was yesterday. That was the meeting before the game and the boys delivered. Since then we have done it again.\"",

That is the last time we saw him because the doctor and the medical staff removed from his knee a lot of fluid.",
      "\"That was the situation after he arrived from the national team and then on Saturday he got ill and wasn't here on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and today. He is at home trying to recover. Robert is training, we will see if he can be on the squad list or not.\"",

In the backline, we have a lack of options but the good thing is, this afternoon, back in training are Rapha Varane and Jonny Evans, and Harry Maguire was already back in training yesterday.\"",

      "The Red Devils are expected to be busy in the summer transfer window, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe targeting an overhaul of the playing squad at Old Trafford. A number of positions have been earmarked for additions. That includes at right-back and at striker. Another position that Ratcliffe wants to strengthen is at centre-back, with at least one central defender being targeted.",
      "Everton star Branthwaite has already been identified as a prime target for the Red Devils, however Man United are biding their time. According to MailOnline, they are waiting for the Toffees to set a price for the 21-year-old.",
      "Previous reports claimed that the Toffees wanted to receive around £75m for their star defender. Branthwaite is under contract at Goodison Park until 2027 having penned a new deal last October.",
      "Speaking at the time, he said: “The stature of the club, how much of a family it is at Everton and how I just love playing here in front of the fans were key reasons for me signing. To sign this new contract was to show the commitment I have for the club and show how much it means to me to play for Everton.",
      "“Since I joined, I’ve felt a connection with the club. The fans have been really good with me. For the first game I played, the cheer I got when my name was read out just gave me massive confidence to go out there and play my best game.",
      "“Since I got in the team, the fans have shown me real support and that gives me confidence, especially for a young player. I can’t thank them enough.”",
      "Elsewhere, Sean Dyche has already warned any interested clubs away from the defender. He said: “We don’t want to sell any good players. It’s as simple as that and he’s proven to be a very good player. We’re not in the business of trying to sell players.",
      "“You only sell players if you have to sell players or there’s a problem. There’s no problem, therefore I’m just hoping we don’t need to sell players. At the minute, we certainly don’t so we will see.”",
      "Away from Branthwaite, the Red Devils also have a couple of other defensive targets. Man United have also asked about how much it would take to sign Boca Juniors star Aaron Anselmino, 18, and Barcelona B youngster Mikayil Faye.",

They've already landed Omar Berrada, who will come in as CEO in the summer, from rivals Manchester City as they bolster their quality off the pitch.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Kieran McKenna is performing miracles at Ipswich and has got them on track to earn a second successive promotion back to the Premier League",
      "Kieran McKenna is a dark horse to become the next Liverpool boss.",
      "That is according to Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony, who believes McKenna is destined to manage a so-called 'Big Six' side after guiding Ipswich to the top of the Championship. McKenna spent over three years as a first-team coach at Manchester United before joining the Tractor Boys in December 2021.",
      "He kept Ipswich in League One before guiding them to promotion last season. The Suffolk club are riding a crest of a wave right now and have a serious chance of returning to the Premier League for the first time in 22 years. During his time at Portman Road, McKenna has won 73 of his 125 matches so far.",
      "And now, MacAnthony has backed McKenna to become a Premier League boss in the future, pointing out the vacancy available at Liverpool when Jurgen Klopp leaves in the summer. The Reds are considering their options to replace the German and could look at the work McKenna is doing at Ipswich.",
      "Asked if McKenna is destined to manage in the top flight, MacAntony told talkSPORT: \"Yeah, I was being laughed out of the studio by [producer] Luke – a Liverpool fan - this morning, as an outside dark horse (to succeed Klopp).",
      "\"I love his brand of football. I've been watching him since last year in League One and what he's done. You can say that Ipswich are a big club, but they didn't go out and spend mega-millions in the summer.",
      "\"They kept a large part of the squad and the team from League One and they're top of the Championship with five or six games to go, it's incredible really. It's not just his coaching and managing, it's his style as well. It's great to watch. If you watched that game yesterday, it was a great advert for the industry. It was just non-stop. Russell [Martin] does a great job with Southampton and his style.",
      "\"Then you've got Ipswich with their style and it was just an enthralling game to watch and that's what you want to see. I think he's destined for the top. I think he wins promotion with Ipswich this year and he'll surprise people with what he'll do with them in the Premier League and within five or six years, he'll be managing a top-six club.",
      "\"That's with due respect to Ipswich. I respect everything they've done there, but I don't think you can keep a guy like that down forever.\"",
      "Liverpool are still searching for their new manager after Klopp confirmed back in January he will be stepping down at the end of the season. Xabi Alonso was the red-hot favourite to succeed Klopp but has ruled out a departure and will stay at Bayer Leverkusen for at least one more season.",
      "Meanwhile, it has been reported that Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi is not on their shortlist and they are looking at alternative targets. Ruben Amorim and Julian Nagelsmann are among the new leading candidates to replace Klopp as the Reds embark on a new adventure, eight years since Brendan Rodgers was sacked.",

      "United produced a dismal performance at Brentford on Saturday and were fortunate to come away with a point. After being dominated throughout, Mason Mount thought he had won it for the Red Devils in the 96th minute, only for Kristoffer Ajer to score moments after to salvage a deserved draw.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea failed to beat 10-man Burnley at Stamford Bridge in their first game after the international break. Dara O'Shea netted a late equaliser for the Clarets, shortly after Cole Palmer had put the Blues back in front for his second of the afternoon, with Josh Cullen scoring the other goal.",

      "Merson told Sportskeeda: \"Manchester United are a million miles away from the likes of Liverpool at the moment. Liverpool have kids playing at times, and United are still so far behind them.",
      "\"Their performance against Brentford was very worrying, and they're going to have to make a decision at the end of the season. Are they going to give Ten Hag another chance? I'm not sure.",
      "\"It's very difficult to predict this game. It's not even a big game, is it? This used to be a mouthwatering fixture. Now, one of these teams got ripped to shreds by Brentford, and the other wasn't able to dominate a ten-man Burnley side.",
      "\"This is a manager's game, if I'm being honest. Neither team would want to lose this football match. If Ten Hag loses this game and suffers another defeat against Liverpool next week, he'll be under massive pressure.",
      "\"Chelsea have the home advantage, but they're not really dominant. It'll be a big worry if they don't beat Man United, because Chelsea fans will remember what Brentford did to United. This won't be an easy encounter, but Chelsea should be able to win this game. I'm going for 2-1.\"",
      "United have endured a difficult campaign which has seen the pressure rise for Ten Hag. The Red Devils have lost 11 of their 29 Premier League matches and finished rock bottom of their Champions League group. Although United are into the FA Cup semi final, it has not papered over the cracks.",
      "As for Chelsea, they have struggled despite spending over £1billion on transfers since Todd Boehly took over from Roman Abramovich in May 2022. The Blues have impressed in domestic cup competitions but their Premier League form has flattered to deceive, winning just 11 of 28 so far.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville believes a player such as Virgil van Dijk would help transform the squad at Old Trafford with Raphael Varane unable to have the same impact",
      "Gary Neville believes that Raphael Varane is not able to exert the same influence on Manchester United as Virgil van Dijk does on Liverpool.",
      "The former United defender selected the Reds' star as the player he would take from Jurgen Klopp to most improve Erik ten Hag's side. Neville suggested that the Dutch international would improve the players around him, something he does not think Varane is capable of in United's backline.",
      "The 30-year-old arrived at Old Trafford in 2021 in a deal worth £42million from Real Madrid. The Frenchman won four Champions League trophies and three La Liga titles in 10 years with Los Blancos but has endured a more tumultuous time with the Red Devils.",
      "Varane has made 92 appearances for Man United but has seen injuries interrupt his progress with the club. Regardless, Neville had plenty of praise for the World Cup winner but simply does not reckon his talents include managing his teammates.",
      "\"I would take Van Dijk,\" said the Overlap pundit. \"I don’t think he’ll [Varane] ever be that player.",
      "\"For me, when I watch Varane, he actually defends his part of the pitch very well and the box very well – he heads out a lot of balls and is quite dominant in the air. I just think he’s that kind of centre half who will always do – and to be fair he might have been at Real Madrid when he was alongside [Sergio] Ramos – his own job really well but I don’t think he’ll impact the players around him.",
      "\"And that’s not a criticism by the way, because to be fair there are many great centre halves who do their own job very well but don’t actually manage a back four. A great centre half who can manage a back four is your Van Dijks, your [John] Terrys – great players of all time – but he’s just one of those great centre halves that does his own job really well, I think.\"",
      "Neville went on to explain the presence that Van Dijk would bring would supersede any impact that Mo Salah could offer. The ex-England international suggested that the gap was closer between United's forwards and the Egyptian, while Van Dijk would transform the culture at Manchester United.",
      "He said: \"I just think that Van Dijk would bring dominance to the team and a presence in the team that we haven’t got. We haven’t got a forward as good as Mo Salah, but we’ve got talented forwards.",
      "\"I always think if you’ve got a spine of strength and presence… We always say, don’t we, 'Oh, there’s no Roy Keanes anymore, there’s no Vincent Kompanys anymore, there’s no John Terrys’ – there actually is one now at Liverpool, when you think about how he’s performed this season, Van Dijk. He’s a massive presence on that pitch.",
      "\"He’s not the same character as some of those that I’ve mentioned, but he actually is quite dominant on the pitch, he speaks a lot more than people might think and he actually is someone you can see that’s got an aura about him.",
      "\"And I think that if you want to change Manchester United ’s complete and utter culture, then they need that dominant person who holds them together. And I think Van Dijk would control [Kobbie] Mainoo, even someone like Antony or [Marcus] Rashford. I think he would build them, not break them.\"",

      "Mastantuono signed a new deal with River Plate in March, with a release clause reported at around £38.5m. The new deal could allow River to recoup a significant fee for another young talent after selling Claudio Echeverri to Manchester City for a little under £22m earlier this season.",

      "Rashford has endured one of his worst individual seasons for the Reds this year and was involved in a controversial fall-out earlier this year after a trip to Belfast. In 36 games this campaign, the England international has scored just eight goals and assisted a further six. His numbers are wide of the mark of what he produced last term, where he contributed to 41 goals in 56 games.",
      "Rashford's form has left his place in England's European Championship squad in doubt. Many have called for the 26-year-old to leave United in the summer for a fresh start, with Paris Saint-Germain reportedly interested in replacing Kylian Mbappe with him.",
      "Ferdinand has claimed that Rashford must look at the people around him when deciding on his future at the end of the season. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, he said: “It’s a pivotal moment in his [Marcus Rashford’s] career now. He’s not a kid anymore.",
      "\"A lot of people look at potential and talent. He’s 26 - what were you [the panel] doing at 26? We were still making mistakes, don’t get me wrong, but on the football pitch you had it locked down, you knew what you were doing, you knew what you were about, who you were.",

Are they the right people, are they enabling him to make excuses for himself behind closed doors, or are they saying, ‘Look at yourself, and be accountable for what you are doing’? He needs to look at that and own that and make big decisions.",

      "The Premier League is set to abandon Profit and Sustainability Rules in favour of a move to a version of UEFA's squad cost ratio rule - and Man United are well placed to take advantage",
      "The task for Sir Jim Ratcliffe at Manchester United is how to turn around the fortunes on the field of a football club that has suffered from years of neglectful ownership.",
      "As far as minority owners go, it’s hard to think of too many who have had held the kind of sway that Ratcliffe does at Old Trafford. The deal to acquire 28 per cent of the club from the Glazer family in January handed the British billionaire and INEOS founder oversight over football matters and the direction of the club when it comes to stadium redevelopment.",
      "United have been heavy spenders over the past decade, and any notions of not being financially supported to compete are hokum. However, what they haven’t had is any kind of football strategy, played out in a stadium that has been allowed to decline, almost as if representative of the way that the club has been run under the Glazers.",
      "Whether or not United choose to redevelop Old Trafford or build a new stadium on the land adjacent will be cause for discussion for some time yet, but for Ratcliffe part of the plan to return the club, which hasn’t won a Premier League title since 2013, to the summit of the English game has already started.",
      "The landscape is different now, however. It is no longer a case of who can spend the most; it is about who can be smarter with what they have and how they use it.",
      "The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have come into sharp focus over the past 12 months, with Everton (twice), Nottingham Forest, and Leicester City all landed with charges for being in breach of PSR, which limits clubs to £105m worth of losses over a three-year period, with deductions allowed for such things as infrastructure investment, academy, the women’s game, and community initiatives.",
      "But even though the charges thus far have been levelled at clubs outside the so-called ‘Big Six’, the ever-increasing cost of being competitive through bumper transfer fees and wage bills meant that even the likes of United and Arsenal had to be mindful when January came in order to remain compliant.",
      "United’s huge revenue streams have continued to grow over the years despite a lack of success, with the club remaining a commercial juggernaut. For the 2022/23 financial year the club saw an 11% rise in revenue, from £583m to £648m, with pre-tax losses reduced from £150m to £33m.",
      "Part of the Ratcliffe plan at United is to address sizeable club costs and work smarter, and his desire to make these changes arrives at a time when Premier League clubs are likely to vote around a new set of financial controls - potentially in time for next season - that will replace PSR, a model that is now deemed unfit for purpose. It is likely that the Premier League adopt a model in line with what UEFA already has, which is a squad cost ratio.",
      "Sign up to our new weekly newsletter, the Bottom Line, which will bring you exclusive reporting on the financial issues affecting the future of football.",
      "From the happenings at the biggest clubs, at home and abroad, interviews with the people who make the big decisions behind the scenes - Dave Powell, Chief Business of Football Writer for Reach Plc, will be keeping newsletter subscribers informed and doing deep dives into the business of Premier League clubs, the EFL pyramid, US sports and more.",
      "The Bottom Line is currently offering 50% off annual subscriptions.",
      "So, for the latest news on the finances of Premier League clubs from Dave Powell, subscribe here.",
      "UEFA’s current model works towards a 70% squad cost ratio limit, with the calculations made by taking wages, plus amortisation costs (the way transfer fees are accounted for), severance costs, and intermediary fees, and offsetting them against operating revenue and player trading profit (the best year of the last three to take into account the volatility of the transfer market).",
      "Nothing concrete has yet been presented, although various reports have suggested that the Premier League may impose a 70% threshold on clubs in regular European competition, with those outside of that revenue stream allowed an 85% squad cost ratio.",
      "But what might the adoption of squad cost ratio by the Premier League look like for United?",
      "Using the 2022/23 financials, United’s wage bill stood at £331m after wage drops resulting from a lack of Champions League qualification kicked in. When assessing squad cost ratio, UEFA uses relevant wages, which are the wages attributed to playing staff and the head coach. According to figures presented by football finance expert Swiss Ramble, the relevant wage for United for squad cost ratio assessment purposes was £282m.",
      "Then comes amortisation costs. Amortisation is the guaranteed sum of a transfer fee to acquire a player divided by the years of the contract. Regardless of the payment schedule for the transfer, it is how transfers are accounted for by football clubs. For United, this amortisation figure stood at £170m for 2022/23, with that figure being the remaining book value of players.",
      "Adding together the £282m in relevant wages, and the £170m in amortised costs, acknowledging that the club had no severance payments to make for the sacking of managers during the financial year in question, gives a sum of £452m. Now, that £452m is then assessed against operating revenue and player trading performance.",
      "United’s revenue growth to £648m, allied with reduction in payroll, helps the squad cost ratio considerably. In terms of player trading, a sum of £21m has been achieved by United. The player trading profit is the profit that clubs have made on the sale of a player over and above their remaining book value.",
      "Adding together the operating revenue and player trading profit delivers a figure of £669m, with additional relevant income from player trading, such as loan fees, bringing in another £1m-plus to take the sum to around £671m. That £671m, against wage costs, amortisation costs, severance and intermediary fees, would see United at a 67% squad cost ratio; the fifth best in the Premier League, ahead of Liverpool (68%) and Arsenal (74%), but trailing Manchester City’s 60%.",
      "That gives United a 3% head-start on being compliant with any new regulation. But with wages likely to increase when Champions League qualification does, and the requirement to keep adding in the transfer market, there is an obvious reason why Ratcliffe wants to get a firmer grip on costs now.",
      "United have the benefit of being a part of the 'Big Six', where revenues far outstrip the rest thanks to regular European competition and increasing commercial revenues through the global stature of the brand. The greater headroom that can be created ahead of new regulation through stricter cost control and spending money in the transfer market more wisely, the greater freedom United will have to act appropriately in the market when the time is right.",

      "A number of players left in the summer with Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba all ending their spells at Old Trafford. Over £200m was spent bolstering Ten Hag's squad as a rebuild started.",
      "Lisandro Martinez joined Ten Hag in switching Amsterdam for Manchester in a deal worth up to £57m with left-back Tyrell Malacia also moving from the Eredivisie for £14.7m. Serial Champions League winner Casemiro arrived from Real Madrid late in the window but it was the marquee arrival of Antony that turned heads.",
      "The Brazilian cost United £86m - making him the club's most expensive arrival since Paul Pogba in 2016 - after proving his worth under Ten Hag at Ajax. After arriving from Sao Paulo, the forward scored 24 times and provided a further 22 assists for the Dutch giants over two seasons.",
      "Antony signed a five-year contract with the Reds and was tipped to be a key figure in Ten Hag's project. However, the 24-year-old has struggled to adapt to English football and his price tag is constantly brought up whenever he fails to deliver.",
      "In his debut season, the Brazilian scored eight goals and assisted just three. This year has continued to be a struggle, with him starting just 17 games in all competitions and managing only two FA Cup goals.",
      "The £86m price tag has been a big topic of discussion since the deal was completed, though more concerns emerged when it was revealed that United scouts valued Antony cheaper than what they paid for him. During Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure at Old Trafford, a £25m valuation was placed on the attacker's head - the club paid more than triple that.",
      "Although United aren't expected to cut-ties with Antony and sell him any time soon, if or when that time does come they could face a huge loss. According to Transfermarkt, the left-footed attacker's market value has continued to plummet during his time in England.",
      "At the end of last season, he was valued at £51.3m. That figure has halved since June 2023 with him now valued at £23.9m. Ironically, that figure is closer to the initial valuation of United's scouts two years ago.",

      "Injury: Muscular.",
      "Possible return date: May",
      "What Ten Hag has said: \"You can't prevent, it's not only us who've had this, the standards of the Premier League from an intensity perspective are so high, the overload of the schedule, international football is so huge, we have internationals in our squad. City, Liverpool and Newcastle have problems, many other teams. In this moment, especially the defensive department but the midfield and frontline the players are available.\"",

      "Man United defender Martinez has been sidelined for another month with a fresh injury, despite returning from the sidelines last weekend.",
      "Lisandro Martinez became an immediate Manchester United fan favourite last season.",
      "Martinez was outstanding at the heart of the defence as United won a trophy and qualified for the Champions League, a new chant was coined and a banner of an Argentina flag with a meat cleaver was unfurled over the Stretford End, which the player described as 'incredible'.",
      "The defender enjoyed a dream 12 months in Manchester after leaving Amsterdam, but his second season hasn't gone to plan and he's been restricted to just seven league starts.",
      "Although Martinez was the most successful signing Erik ten Hag had made, his injuries have had a detrimental effect on that status and he's set to be sidelined for another month.",
      "Martinez has made just 11 appearances in all competitions and he's played 760 minutes, which means he's averaged just over 90 minutes during each month of the campaign.",
      "He was absent in the latter stage of last season due to a fractured metatarsal which required surgery. Martinez featured in pre-season, but that problem was aggravated in the autumn and he took painkillers to play against Bayern Munich and Brighton in September.",
      "Struggling to play through the pain, Martinez didn't look himself and it was announced that he'd be unavailable for three months after undergoing another round of surgery.",
      "\"The squad will miss him,\" said Erik ten Hag. \"As you know, we have more injuries, so we always have to deal with it as a squad. He has to be strong. He will fight back, he is a character.\"",
      "United have been porous this season. Martinez's prolonged absence has been a factor in the team's regression and Ten Hag was correct when saying he'd be missed.",
      "His ability to pass through the lines and his spirit, determination and character on the pitch make him unique in United's dressing room and his return was highly anticipated.",
      "By the time Martinez returned in January, United were out of the Champions League and the Carabao Cup, and struggling in the race for top four in the Premier League.",
      "In an interview with club media, the 26-year-old vowed to help achieve a strong end to the season, but he played against Tottenham, Wolves and Newport County before sustaining a serious-looking knee injury against West Ham in his fourth appearance after his lay-off.",
      "The worst was feared when Martinez went to the ground clutching his knee, however, it was confirmed he'd sustained a medial collateral ligament injury and didn't require surgery.",
      "A timeline of around eight weeks was given for Martinez to return from that issue, which meant he would be absent for crucial games against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Liverpool, although preparing for fixtures without him certainly wasn't anything new at that stage.",
      "Martinez was pencilled in to make another comeback after the international break and it was surprising to see United allow him to join up with his nation's squad.",
      "\"Lisandro Martinez is not yet ready to return from a knee injury but is joining up with the Argentina squad in the United States,\" a statement from the club read.",
      "\"He will continue the final steps in his rehabilitation with the squad but will not feature in matches against El Salvador and Costa Rica. It has been decided that Lisandro will benefit from training with his international colleagues as he regains fitness, rather than staying at Carrington.\"",
      "Martinez travelling to the States to finish his rehabilitation now looks questionable after he returned against Brentford last weekend, only to be ruled out for another month.",
      "The centre-back replaced Victor Lindelof with 20 minutes remaining against Brentford and he looked to have come through that appearance unscathed, but it was announced on Tuesday night he'd picked up a calf strain in training, which represented a fresh injury.",
      "While Martinez should return before the end of the season, he'll be unavailable for more key fixtures and it means he's had foot, knee and calf injuries in the space of months.",
      "Availability is the best quality a footballer can have and Martinez's campaign has been a disaster, almost reminiscent of how the fragile Anthony Martial would fare.",
      "United fans still adore the likeable Martinez, but it's probably fair to suggest that he can no longer be considered as a successful signing due to his injuries this season.",
      "Martial has made eight more appearances than Martinez and that says it all.",

      "The 28-year-old Brentford striker has scored four goals in 11 Premier League games since returning from an eight-month ban for breaching the Football Association's gambling laws. Since firing the Bees to promotion in May 2021, Toney has scored 36 goals in 77 Premier League outings.",
      "Toney, who has less than 18 months remaining on his current deal at Brentford, has been linked with moves to Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool and West Ham in recent weeks. However, Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony believes Toney could turn Erik ten Hag's side into title challenges should he make the move to Old Trafford and would prove value for money, even at £100m.",
      "Speaking on Sky Sports, MacAnthony, who signed Toney for the Posh from Newcastle United in 2018, said: \"Put him in an Arsenal team, put him in a Liverpool or a Man United team, he scores 30 Premier League goals in a season. I think anyone who disagrees with that hasn't been watching the last two-and-a-half years.",
      "\"I think there are five clubs in the world who could probably end up buying him and he will improve any of those clubs by a mile. He turns Manchester United into challengers for the Premier League.\"",
      "Toney was a thorn in United's side at the Gtech Community Stadium last Saturday as he laid on a stoppage-time assist for Kristoffer Ajer to equalise against the Reds, and MacAnthony believes the two-cap England international will only get better in the years ahead.",
      "\"Having scouted players not just for their technical ability but their personality and their growth for 18 years, I think he's not even in his prime even though he's turning 28,\" added the 48-year-old. \"Whoever buys him, £100m will be well spent because he's coming into his prime. You're going to get five or six years of his best.",
      "\"He's scored a goal every other game in the Premier League for Brentford. Put Ivan in an Aston Villa team under [Unai] Emery and see how many goals he scores in the Premier League. He'd probably be up there for the Golden Boot.\"",
      "Ten Hag's side have struggled for goals this season, with only Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Burnley, Everton and Sheffield United managing fewer than United's 40 in the Premier League.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Scott McTominay are the club's leading scorers in the Premier League this season (7), while Champions League rivals Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur are able to boast the prolificacy of Ollie Watkins (16) and Son Heung-Min (15).",

      "Manchester United face another summer rebuild amid a disappointing campaign under Erik ten Hag which has seen the club go backwards.",
      "There is optimism that new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos group can overhaul United's footballing operations and provide a strategy which will see the club compete for major honours again. This summer will be the new regime's first opportunity to enact changes to the playing squad at Old Trafford as United face a vital transfer window.",
      "There does however remain uncertainty over which European competition United will be involved in next season, with Champions League football the main priority to earn greater revenue and attract better quality talent. And the rumour mill is in full swing as United look ahead to a summer rebuild which could see a huge number of changes",
      "The Evening Standard reports that United are interested in Nice left-back Melvin Bard. They claim that the 23-year-old is being discussed as a summer transfer target amid the injury woes of Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia this season.",
      "Bard has made 28 appearances for the Ligue 1 side this season with Nice owned by United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos group. The Frenchman's current contract expires in June 2026.",
      "Elsewhere, reports in Il Matino have claimed that United are also interested in Napoli right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo. It is claimed that the Red Devils and Aston Villa have ‘tabled offers’ of personal terms for the Italy international, which will be ‘evaluated’ by the player.",
      "It is said that United have taken confidence from Di Lorenzo considering leaving Napoli. The report claims that the former Empoli star is yet to make a concrete decision on his future, and is waiting to see who his current side appoints as their manager over the summer before making a decision.",

      "Man Utd were battered again at the weekend but despite Brentford having 31 shots they conceded only once at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "When a goalkeeper moves to a new club he will always be keen to make an impression and to have some work to do, but even Andre Onana must be getting a bit sick of this.",
      "In his last 11 games for his club, he has faced 237 shots, at an average of 21.5 a game. It is a monstrous workload for a goalkeeper and one more akin to a team battling relegation than one trying to get back into the Champions League.",
      "Manchester United's hopes are fading on that front but that they are still alive at all is due in large part to Onana, who has grown into his role as the club's new No.1 this season and is now one of the best players in Erik ten Hag's team. Like Lisandro Martinez, this is a deal to sign one of his former players that looks well-judged.",
      "That wasn't the widely held view at the start of the season, when Onana looked hesitant and nervous in the United goal, making a string of mistakes in a disastrous Champions League group campaign. But he has recovered his poise admirably and as a shot-stopper, he has proven his worth since his £47million move from Inter Milan.",
      "In those previous 11 games, Onana has faced 66 shots on target but only 16 have beaten him. United's Premier League discrepancy between the number of goals they have conceded (40) and their xG of 53 is the highest such gap in the league. Only Thomas Kaminski and Alphonse Areola have made more saves than Onana's 108 in the league this season.",
      "His fine form was on display again on Saturday night, keeping Brentford at bay despite seeing his goal peppered with a barely believable 31 shots. That United didn't leave West London having lost the game was mostly down to their goalkeeper.",
      "Onana's form has silenced those doubts over whether the right call was made to jettison David de Gea last season, ending his 12-year stay at the club. The Spaniard was a reliable No.1 for most of his time at the club, but his standards had dipped. He was making more and more errors and his work in possession was always going to be an issue for a manager keen to build from the back.",
      "That is an area Onana excels in and we still haven't seen the best out of it at United. The changing cast of defenders in front of him has made it difficult to develop patterns of play and work on build-up play. If the goalkeeper can get regular game time with an injury-free Martinez and Luke Shaw then United's work in possession would improve considerably.",
      "Pep Guardiola believes Onana is one of the best goalkeepers in the world when it comes to helping with the build-up and the Catalan places great importance on 'keepers who can use their feet, but Onana might not truly show what he can do in that department until next season, by which time he might have a new manager.",
      "Ten Hag is certainly fighting for his future at Old Trafford and while he will be delighted with the performances of the goalkeeper he pushed to sign in the summer, he will know he needs him to have a few quieter games if he's to prove to Ineos he is the man for the job.",
      "But even if he does depart this summer, he will leave his successor a few gems, in Martinez, in Kobbie Mainoo and it increasingly looks like in Onana too.",
      "The question when he signed was why United had spent £47m on a goalkeeper they could have had on a free transfer a year ago, but the doubts around De Gea only grew as the season went on. As it turns out, even at £47m, the 27-year-old is looking like a wise investment. He's been a bright spot in a season of disappointment.",

As a fan he's what you want to see, especially from such a young player, and I'm hoping we see a lot more of him. The energy and quality he can bring to the field in a game of high emotions and pressure against United's biggest rivals is such a big achievement for a player of his age.

He played on the right at times in the World Cup in Qatar. In what has been a difficult season, his form for England has held up pretty well.

There was a moment in the second half where [Jeremy] Doku went past him and he got back at Doku and took the ball off him and went and slid in. You can't do that unless you're… I used to think Owen Hargreaves could do that for United. Hargreaves was a great tackler in midfield, he would go and take the ball off people. He's got that about him, where he goes and takes the ball off people. If me and you were playing against Doku, once he's gone, we're not getting back at him. Also, we'd drop off him to make sure he'd pass it. He will go and think 'I'm going to take the ball off Doku' and there are very few players like that.\"",

      "The Manchester Evening News revealed last month that Mantato was generating interest and the youngster was in the process of considering his options and possible next steps. Impressively, Mantato scored four goals against Blackburn in a 5-2 win for the Under-18s and he was on the scoresheet again last weekend in a friendly for the Under-21s.",
      "United made an academy trip to France over the weekend to give youngsters an overseas experience and behind-closed-doors fixtures at AS Monaco and OGC Nice were arranged. The young Reds won 2-1 against Monaco and Mantato scored a late match-winner to win the friendly, with Amir Ibragimov, another highly-regarded talent, also scoring. Nice won 3-2 in their clash against United on Easter Monday and Mantato scored again in that defeat.",
      "The youngster, who has bundles of pace, has been in prolific form and it's thought his long-term future will be on the right wing due to the attacking quality he can provide. Mantato's superb goalscoring form - six in three games - has impressed clubs and he's continued to go from strength to strength after taking part in first-team training. His dribbling ability is a huge asset and he's been backed to have a bright future at Old Trafford.",

      "The Southampton chief has recently emerged as a target for the Reds, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe eager to appoint a director of football at Old Trafford. The Manchester Evening News understands that United have approached the Saints about Wilcox.",
      "It's said that the Reds have offered the Championship club the equivalent of a full year's salary as compensation, even though the 53-year-old only arrived at St Mary's in the summer. For now, it remains to be seen whether Ratcliffe can wrap up a deal for Wilcox, but it's clear why the British billionaire has been so keen to secure his signature.",
      "The Southampton director enjoyed 10 fruitful years at Manchester City and first made a name for himself as the club's under-18s manager in 2013. Three years later, he was promoted to head of academy coaching before becoming academy director in 2017, a position he remained in until January 2023.",
      "Over the years, Wilcox has worked with some brilliant young players who have gone on to become senior internationals. One of those players was Jadon Sancho, who is set to return to United in the summer following the expiration of his loan at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "When Sancho was just 15, he scored twice inside five minutes on his youth-team debut for Manchester City; his coach at the time was Wilcox, who was full of praise for the youngster after the game.",
      "\"For a young kid playing his first Under-18s football match, I thought he was sensational,\" Wilcox said. \"I'm really looking forward to working with him because he's a talented boy who works really hard.\"",
      "With Sancho set to return to Old Trafford at the end of the season, he could be given a new lease of life despite falling out of favour under Ten Hag. Nevertheless, in an exclusive interview with the Mirror in October 2016, Wilcox explained his role at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "He said: \"Our aim is to have a first-team squad packed with players from our Academy. Not only that, it would also be great to get some ­Mancunian blood into the team.\"",
      "He added: \"It gives the boys a real lift when Pep takes in a game or watches a training session because they know he is taking an interest in them. But we also try to harden players to the realities of the game.",
      "\"We take them to play in tournaments abroad – and I tell them that I expect them to go home with the trophy. We want them to be schooled in playing against different cultures, where they might be up against Juventus in front of 6,000 people, and they are being tripped, kicked and pulled by a cynical Italian defender.",
      "\"That’s a big part of their football education. We have to make it hard so that when they do step onto the big stage of the Champions League in front of 60,000 fans, they don’t just have the tactical and technical skills to cope, but also the temperament.\"",

      "Gary Neville and Roy Keane have previously outlined what needs to be the priority for Manchester United's hierarchy - in what could be Jason Wilcox's first job at the club.",
      "United are interested in appointing Wilcox as their new technical director. Wilcox is currently the director of football at Southampton, a position he has held since last summer when he left his previous role at Manchester City as academy director.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe are looking to complete an overhaul of the club's recruitment department and hierarchy following Ineos Group's 25 per cent takeover earlier this year. That has already seen the appointment of Omar Berrada as the club's new chief executive, while Dan Ashworth is wanted for an inaugural sporting director role, which he currently holds at Newcastle United.",
      "Should Wilcox be appointed at United, he would join the new recruitment team that is being assembled by Ratcliffe and Ineos. Neville and Keane have already outlined that area of the club behind the scenes that needs to be a priority under the new ownership, which could fall under Wilcox's responsibility if he is appointed.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, back in January, Neville explained why having the correct people in charge behind the scenes is vital to United achieving success in the future.",
      "Neville said in January: “Why should the manager be responsible for spending £80million and £20m in salary for four years on a player, when they could potentially only be there for a year or two – why should they be the one who signs the player?",
      "“What happens is you go into a window [with] all good intentions, all on the same page thinking, ‘we need four players’, and you pick the profile of the player that you want. He's got to be six foot, he's got to hold the ball up, he's got to score 10 to 15 goals – you're looking for that profile and then basically what you want is your head of recruitment, your sporting director and your team of scouts to go out there and bring back three or four really good options, and they bring back those three or four options to the table.",
      "“The problem is, if you don't get those three or four because they're not available of some kind, or the manager doesn't like them, that's when you end up in a spin.”",
      "Keane was alongside Neville on the podcast and agreed with his former United teammate. Keane did warn of the dangers that could happen from his own experience when the decision on a transfer is not made by the manager.",
      "“There is this idea that managers should call the shots, but it is difficult,” said Keane. “I’ve been a manager and bought players – I bought some decent ones, but I look back and think, ‘What was I thinking with some?’.",
      "“Of course, you have your staff and the chief of operations, but ultimately it would come down to the manager. But I’ve had it as well, when I’ve been at a club where the owner has pushed for a player, I’ve been reluctant, but the player has come in and not been very good.”",

      "It was during Wilcox's time as Under-18s coach at City that he explained what his priority is when working at clubs. In April 2016, City's Under-18s were preparing for the FA Youth Cup final, but Wilcox's priority was to create a pathway to the first team for the club's young stars.",

The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "Jadon Sancho's time at Man United is coming to an end after his public disagreement with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",

      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "The young defender's partnership with Rhys Bennett was crucial and he heavily contributed to the Youth Cup success, despite being cruelly denied the chance to lift the trophy.",
      "He signed his first professional contract with United shortly after the final and he was promoted to U21 level in the following season, while also training with the first team.",
      "Erik ten Hag named Fredricson on the bench for United's match against Real Sociedad in September 2022 and he was considered one of the most promising young talents at the club, but he only returned from a 16-month period on the sidelines a few weeks ago.",

      "United made an academy trip to France over the weekend to give youngsters an overseas experience and behind-closed-doors fixtures at AS Monaco and OGC Nice were arranged.",
      "The young Reds won 2-1 against Monaco and Bendito Mantato scored a late match-winner to win the friendly, with Amir Ibragimov, another highly-regarded talent, also scoring. Nice won 3-2 in their clash against United on Easter Monday and Mantato scored again in that defeat.",
      "“This is always an exciting time of the year for our young players as they get the chance to experience travelling to tournaments and fixtures together,” said academy director Nick Cox.",
      "“Each trip has different aims depending on the age group involved. Whether it is for cultural education, experiencing playing teams outside of our domestic games programme or learning how to represent the club abroad, our players enjoy a huge amount of personal and professional development from these opportunities.\"",

      "Gore joined United from Burnely at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield because he'd previously operated as a forward, and he was prolific.",
      "Remarkably, Gore scored over 100 goals each season while playing for Burney's academy and you can read his Under-10 report card below. Thanks again to Mike Hargreaves for sending it because little nuggets like that from a young player's path are rare to come across.",
      "Mantato's goalscoring form",
      "As mentioned, Mantato scored twice in friendlies over the weekend and he recently scored four goals in a 5-2 win over Blackburn when playing for the Under-18s in a league fixture.",
      "The 16-year-old has gone from strength to strength since training with the first team last month and his future looks set to be on the right wing due to his attacking quality.",
      "There's a crop of incredibly talented young players coming through again and Mantato is worth following.",
      "Hannibal frozen out at Sevilla",
      "United fought off interest from Tottenham, Barcelona and Bayern Munich to sign Hannibal from Monaco for an initial €5million when he was just a teenager in August 2019.",
      "He was one of the most exciting youth prospects in Europe and, four years later, he finally received the opportunities he'd dreamt of at United in September.",
      "Hannibal started successive games against Burnley and Crystal Palace, but he fell out of favour and joined Sevilla on loan for the remainder of the season in the January window.",
      "However, that move hasn't gone to plan and something drastic would have to change for Sevilla to trigger their option to sign the midfielder for £17m.",
      "Hannibal was absent from their squad last weekend and has made just four appearances.",

      "A second consecutive trip to west London awaits Chelsea on Thursday evening, with United being held to a 1-1 draw against Brentford in their last outing. Mason Mount thought he had snatched three points with his 96th-minute strike, but a 99th-minute equaliser saw the points shared, despite Brentford's domination.",

Recent history is on United's side, with Chelsea's last win in the league against United coming back in 2017. So, can United pick up a much-needed three points tonight? Let's take a look.",
      "To complete this simulation, we used EA FC 24 and updated the squads with the latest injuries and suspensions. We predict that the hosts could line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with their starting XI as follows:  Petrovic; Gusto, Disasi, Chalobah, Cucurella; Caicedo, Enzo; Palmer, Gallagher, Sterling; Jackson.",

      "Chelsea were fantastic in the opening stages as they dominated every aspect of the game, and they took a deserved lead in the ninth minute when Raheem Sterling's curling effort was pushed into the path of Conor Gallagher who fired into an empty net. The Blues pushed for a second and they took advantage of United's slow start to double their advantage 40 minutes in.",
      "A fantastic turn by Gallagher in midfield saw the Englishman skip away from Kobbie Mainoo on the halfway line, allowing Chelsea to hit United on the break. Gallagher slid Nicolas Jackson through on goal, and after beating Harry Maguire in a foot race to meet the pass, he placed his shot into the bottom corner for 2-0.",
      "The first half was all Chelsea but the game turned on its head after the restart with United taking full control. In the 54th minute, Ten Hag's side halved the deficit when Rasmus Hojlund beat Axel Disasi in the box and rifled his shot into the roof of the net from a narrow angle.",
      "A high press from the resulting kick-off saw United almost equalise immediately but Rashford's long-range effort rattled the post. Ten Hag's side continued to impress and with nine minutes to go they levelled the score.",
      "A one-two between Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho allowed the latter to burst past Marc Cucurella down the wing and surge towards the box. Garnacho fired a cross into the path of Hojlund and the striker's glancing header beat Djordje Petrovic at the near post to make it 2-2.",

      "Man United transfer news as attention turns to the EFL for bargain transfers and unexpected wonderkids in search of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's answer to Kylian Mbappe",
      "Of the many soundbites that Sir Jim Ratcliffe has offered up publicly since his stake in Manchester United was confirmed earlier this year, claims of seeking to acquire the next Kylian Mbappe are certainly up there with the most interesting.",
      "Having spent recklessly and largely aimlessly across the past decade without much success, the Red Devils are stepping into a brave new world. Away from even the well-documented marginal gains, United are looking to transform their football operations and the market tactics will certainly be part of that.",
      "A far cry from the long-term attempts by the Glazer family and their structure to sign readymade players, throwing them into a team with a big-name head coach, Ratcliffe promises to be different.",
      "\"What I would rather do is find the next Mbappe, rather than spend a fortune just trying to buy success,\" he told the Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast last month. \"It's not that clever, is it, buying Mbappe, in a way?",
      "\"Anybody could figure that one out. But what's much more challenging is to to find the next Mbappe, the next [Jude] Bellingham or the next Roy Keane.\"",
      "With reports suggesting that United are now looking to land Port Vale starlet Baylee Dipepa,Manchester Evening News has taken a look at some of the other prospects that the club could turn to in order to unearth gems for the future. Given that players such as Bellingham, Jarrod Bowen, Ollie Watkins, Jamie Vardy, Harry Maguire, Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze, and Jack Grealish have all come from EFL backgrounds, it's certainly a goldmine to be attacked.",
      "The logical place to start, Dipepa has been linked with a move to Old Trafford. The Sun reports that the 17-year-old is already a player that United are keen to do business with and that they are leading the race for his signature.",
      "Dipepa made his senior breakthrough earlier this season, only turning 17 in January, and has slowly risen to become a regular in Darren Moore's squad despite their struggles in League One. That such trust has been placed in a player only making their Under-17s debut last month is a testament to the talent available.",
      "Dipepa has scored twice for Vale's senior side this season as well as getting two assists from his 21 games. He is certainly someone now being monitored at the top level.",
      "It's hard to be the next Mbappe as a centre-back, but as far as young defenders go, this guy is right up there. Already linked with a move to Chelsea amongst other sides, the 21-year-old has stacks of EFL experience for his age.",
      "Edwards has already racked up 134 appearances for Peterborough and has started every single game this term so far in League One. Posh are challenging to get back to the Championship, where Edwards has already played most of a full season, and his stock only continues to rise.",
      "As an England Under-20 international, the right-footed, right-sided centre-half, Edwards one of the best in the division. It is worth remembering at this stage that John Stones spent time coming through the EFL as a young defender, as did Joe Gomez.",
      "United have spent big to try and solve their problems at the back, including on another EFL graduate in Maguire, and Edwards at this stage of his career would represent an exciting shift for the club. His contract expires in the summer of 2025 and a bargain could be on the cards.",
      "If United fancy trying to get one back on their old rivals Leeds then this is certainly one to be on top of. Gray is hardly an unknown to the world of football at this stage but then again neither were Olise or Eze and they still left for pennies compared to some of the moves United have made.",
      "Gray is sure to attract plenty of attention in the coming years and should Leeds go up then the moment he kicks a ball in the top flight next season his price will rocket, but it's still the type of deal that Ratcliffe can look at. Gray is a Leeds academy prospect capable of playing right-back or midfield and frankly, he's the real deal.",
      "It doesn't quite have the allure of picking up a more unknown talent and taking them to the top, but it would still represent a great acquisition.",
      "This one is slightly different. Clarke was once the wizz-kid that Dipepa, Gray, and Edwards are currently being touted as, but has seen things stagnate. Now 23, the former Leeds youngster has come into his own.",
      "Since moving to Sunderland he has found a lease of life, something Amad can also attest to, and is having comfortably his best season to date. Following up an impressive nine goals and 12 assists for the Black Cats in the Championship last year, Clarke now has 15 goals and four assists this term despite the team dropping off.",
      "Given he's older than most that are deemed ready to step up to the Premier League in a move like this it represents even more of an unsuspecting deal. Tottenham only sold him in July 2022 and he has had several struggles along the way, but for what would be a small price, Clarke is showing he's ready for the step-up.",
      "Another player that has had an up and down time, Dewsbury-Hall has excelled as perhaps the Championship's MVP this year. From an untroubling, unsuspecting deeper option for Leicester in the top flight between 2021 and 2023, dropping down a level has seen him develop significantly.",
      "Dewsbury-Hall now has 11 goals and 13 assists in a Foxes side vying for promotion. Given their financial struggles he will be one of the main assets clubs look at over the summer should they go up or not.",
      "As a versatile midfield option, Dewsbury-Hall may well provide value for money despite being another older option on this list. At 25 he is not a wonderkid but a solid piece of business instead. He is the type of player it wouldn't be surprising to see play in the Premier League next year, stand out for whoever he is representing, and be linked with a quick move up the table.",
      "United can get ahead of the game by risking him now.",
      "Looking for the next Bellingham? This is quite literally it.",
      "Jokes aside - and bad ones at that - Jude's brother is also making waves. Still a teenager, Jobe is another combative midfielder from Birmingham.",
      "Coming through the Birmingham academy like Jude, Jobe joined Sunderland in the summer and has gone from strength to strength. He has already played 3,000 minutes in the Championship with seven goals and an assist coming.",
      "There's something in the name and United would be well advised to get themselves in the pack for signing the next Bellingham if the chance opens up.",

      "After a progressive few weeks, the next natural step for Mason Mount is to make his first Premier League start in almost five months.",
      "The original version of the chant from the Old Trafford away end was first belted out about Carlos Tevez by those in the home section. Manchester United fans tweaked it from the \"who's that man we all adore\" to \"that money-grabbing w---e\" when his billboard graced Deansgate in the summer of 2009.",
      "Mason Mount was subjected to the latter lyrics by Chelsea fans in December. Mount often sits in the directors' box when he is injured but he kept his distance for the reunion.",
      "If Mount was in the stadium, he would have been in the hospitality box he shares with Luke Shaw in the Stretford End. The Chelsea fans' noise may not have carried that far.",
      "On Thursday, Mount will arrive at Stamford Bridge as a visitor for the first time in his career. It is not uncommon for visiting players to high five waiting fans as they walk towards the entrance but Mount could get a cold reception.",
      "According to a well-placed United source, Mount spoke with Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp in January last year and Mikel Arteta felt a deal was all but done. That Mount had the courtesy to record a farewell message the day before his unveiling by United did little to assuage Chelsea's followers who now refer to him as the \"t--t from Portsmouth\".",
      "Mount's return is auspiciously timed for United. He has been energetic in both cameos since returning from a four-month absence with muscular problems and the second at Brentford was crowned with a first goal for the club.",
      "Mount was minutes away from his image gracing every back page in the country. Instead, his maiden United goal was not even mentioned in Erik ten Hag's press conference.",
      "Still, Mount has had a progressive build-up to what would be a first Premier League start in nearly five months. That was so long ago it was the reverse fixture against Brentford and Mount, moved to the right-hand side that day, was hooked in the 63rd minute.",
      "Mount was signed as a central midfielder and has started on the wing but it would be logical to move him to the middle back at Chelsea. Ten Hag did not sign Mount to solely occupy a central midfield berth and he deployed him as the No.10 in the pre-season friendly defeat to Real Madrid, with Bruno Fernandes shifted to the right.",
      "Substantial changes to the starting XI are warranted after the draw with Brentford, United's worst performance of a season already littered with 16 defeats. Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo is clearly United's most balanced midfield pair and Alejandro Garnacho will have five days to recover from a taxing week that began with a full debut for Argentina against Costa Rica in Los Angeles on Tuesday night.",
      "Garnacho headed straight down the tunnel when he was substituted and did not re-emerge. Mainoo was subdued having been unwell only two days earlier. The teenagers can be cut some slack.",
      "United matchgoers are almost always warm with returning players, which made the caustic reception for Angel Di Maria such a jolt in February 2019. Tevez was predictably booed and there were murmurs of disapproval when Romelu Lukaku emerged for Chelsea two years ago.",
      "A recent trend has been to turn on red-shirted scapegoats. Paul Pogba was repeatedly told to \"f--k off\" and promptly did after his final Old Trafford appearance against Norwich two years ago. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Anthony Martial have all got it in the neck from United fans home and away this term.",
      "With former Hammer Paul Ince on the United coach at the Boleyn Ground in 1995, the West Ham fans assembled for a scene out of Night of the Living Dead. Once Wayne Rooney's relationship with Evertonians started to thaw, his performances back at Goodison Park became gradually worse.",
      "Rooney's seven-game goalscoring run ended on the blue side of Stanley Park in October 2008 when the crowd got the better of him. Rooney was substituted in the 71st minute and he did not score at Everton again until 2015. Rooney bickered with a fan before kick-off on his first return in February 2005 and the repartee was reignited on Everton's visits to Old Trafford.",
      "In 2010, Sir Alex Ferguson omitted Rooney from the matchday squad to purportedly protect him from the Goodison crowd's barracking after his philandering was exposed. In truth, Rooney had been dropped after demanding to know why United had not signed Mesut Ozil. A \"stocky\" Rooney was dropped after the opening defeat at Everton in August 2012.",
      "Stamford Bridge is one of the unhappier grounds in the country. The denizens have jeered Raheem Sterling and have not warmed to Mauricio Pochettino amid his Tottenham allegiance and Chelsea's 11th-placed status. The Chelsea Supporters' Trust warned of \"irreversible toxicity\". It is bound to be toxic for Mount.",
      "Yet as a loanee at Derby County, he entered possibly the most bilious ground in England at Elland Road, scored and pressed his index finger against his lips as he passed the frothing Leeds fans in the Norman Hunter Stand.",
      "If Mount hears the Chelsea fans, he has doubtless heard worse.",

      "Jason Wilcox could help Sir Jim Ratcliffe transform Manchester United back into a Premier League winning team",
      "Jason Wilcox has recently emerged as a target for Manchester United as Sir Jim Ratcliffe looks to appoint a director of football. Since acquiring a stake and taking the reins at Old Trafford, the British billionaire has set out to take the Red Devils back to 'the very top of English, European and world football'.",
      "He's made great progress so far on his mission to rebuild the club, forking out millions on several boardroom appointments. The likes of Sir David Brailsford and Omar Berrada, who worked closely with Wilcox during a period at Manchester City, have been brought in to steer Manchester United in the right direction.",
      "Ratcliffe has shown no sign of slowing down either, with his next task reportedly being the appointment of a director of football. The Manchester Evening News understands that the Red Devils have approached Southampton about Wilcox.",
      "United have offered the Saints the equivalent of a full year's salary as compensation, even though the 53-year-old only arrived at St Mary's in the summer. Nevertheless, Wilcox has emerged as a target for the Red Devils – and it's clear why.",
      "Speaking to the Mirror in October 2016 – a year before becoming Manchester City academy director – he spoke of his desire to 'spoil' Pep Guardiola with academy graduates. Wilcox said: \"I’m not someone who gets carried away, but I have never seen anything like the talent we have at this Academy.",
      "\"We have got kids here who are at a level that is just ­mind-blowing. It makes me hope that I am working here for the next 10 years. We want Pep Guardiola to be spoilt for choice – and we are getting there.\"",
      "With Ratcliffe eager to produce the next Kylian Mbappe rather than splash the cash on the Paris Saint-Germain star, Wilcox certainly fits the bill. So, with that being said, the Manchester Evening News has taken a look at some of the best signings which Manchester City and Southampton made during the former Blackburn Rovers winger's respective tenures.",
      "Charles joined Southampton on four-year deal in the summer, becoming the second new signing at St Mary's this summer following the arrival of Ryan Manning. While the 20-year-old midfielder has struggled to have the desired impact on the south coast this term, he's been tipped to 'go to the top' by Russel Martin in an interview with FLW.",
      "Wilcox was the Manchester City academy director when the club signed Lavia from Anderlecht. After two years earning his stripes in the academy, the teenage midfielder joined Southampton where he quickly established himself as one of the most exiting young players in the Premier League.",
      "After catching the eye, Chelsea forked out millions to secure his signature. Unfortunately for Lavia, he's struggled to stay fit at Stamford Bridge, though he remains an excellent talent which Wilcox unearthed.",
      "Bobb has enjoyed a breakout campaign at Manchester City this season, featuring 20 times across all competitions. Following the departure of Riyad Mahrez and Cole Palmer, Wilcox had a ready-made replacement for Guardiola on the right-wing.",
      "Another player who's currently making a name for himself at the highest level. Rogers joined Manchester City from West Bromwich Albion in 2019 and, after handful of loan spells in the EFL, he joined Middlesbrough in July 2023. By January, the 21-year-old forward had earned himself a £15million move to Aston Villa.",
      "Delap signed his first professional contract just 12 months after becoming a scholar at Manchester City. The striker, who now plays for Hull City in the Championship, was once regarded as one of the best young players in Europe – which was a huge coup for Wilcox and the club at the time.",
      "But, due to little opportunity in the first-team, Delap struggled to establish himself in the top flight. Despite this, he is still only 21 and remains an exciting prospect with a fruitful future ahead of him.",
      "With Wilcox at the helm, there could be a significant power shift in Manchester. While not every new player will be a tremendous success, the Red Devils will certainly be heading in the right direction if they're signing the likes of Lavia and Bobb instead of splashing the cash at a later date. Not to mention incredible homegrown talent which Wilcox helped source too...",

      "Anthony Taylor will referee the upcoming Premier League showdown between Manchester United and Liverpool on Sunday afternoon (3.30pm).",
      "The 45-year-old will be assisted by Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn. John Brooks has been named as VAR with Richard West his assistant. However, it is the Taylor appointment which has raised eyebrows - on either side - due to his well-documented history with United and Liverpool.",
      "The fact that Taylor was born in Greater Manchester has prompted questions from Liverpool fans. But the man in the middle supports National League outfit Altrincham rather than either of the bigger hitters in Manchester.",
      "He has history with both clubs having controversially sent-off Casemiro in United's match against Southampton last season following VAR intervention. He previously irked United when placing their defensive wall 15 yards away - rather than 10 - before Aston Villa defender Lucas Digne netted from that very free-kick.",
      "United dropped five points in those two games. But Taylor is not the most popular choice for Liverpool either. He has referred four Liverpool games this season and the title contenders have only won one of those matches.",
      "He angered Jurgen Klopp with his call to dismiss Ibrahima Konate against Arsenal and the Merseysiders were beaten 3-1 in that title showdown. Taylor has officiated two previous top-flight meetings between United and Liverpool.",
      "He was in charge for a goalless draw at Anfield in October 2016 and for a 5-0 victory for Liverpool at Old Trafford in October 2021. Ex-United midfielder Paul Pogba was given his marching orders in that game for a foul on Naby Keita.",
      "Taylor is one of the most prominent referees in the Premier League. He has officiated more than 350 games since his first posting in February 2010, in addition to international matches at the World Cup and European Championships.",
      "Despite question marks from some fanbases about his affiliation, the Greater Manchester-born official is known to follow Altrincham and buys a season ticket there every season despite being unable to attend most matches due to his refereeing commitments. Under PGMOL rules, referees are not allowed to officiate on games that involve the team they support, or games which might affect the fortunes of their side.",

      "When the Brentford players returned to the home dressing room at the Gtech Community Stadium midway through Saturday's game with Manchester United, they probably felt their best chance of winning the match had been and gone.",
      "The Bees had 14 shots in the first half but went in at the break goalless. They would have been cursing those missed chances and expecting United to be much better after the break. This is what the very best teams do, they correct what is going wrong and they find solutions during the 15-minute pause.",
      "Brentford had already been on the receiving end of such a situation this year. They caused Manchester City problems in the first half of their home clash against the champions at the start of February, but City equalised just before half-time and improved after the break to win 3-1.",
      "But little did Thomas Frank's players realise that rather than improving for 15 minutes to reset and come up with a new plan, United would get worse. Brentford had another 17 shots after the break and although they ended up needing a Kristoffer Ajer equaliser in the 99th minute to get a point, this was a game they dominated and one they would win eight or nine times out of 10.",
      "It is the hosts who will be cursing their failure to win a game in which they had 31 shots and ended with an xG tally of 3.2, their second-highest total of the season. For Erik ten Hag, it was another chastening night and another occasion in which the impact he is now having on this team has to be questioned.",
      "He had the full length of the half-time interval on Saturday to work out what was wrong with his team and fix any problems. Ten Hag and his coaching staff should have had a solution ready to go, whether that involved tactical tweaks or a substitution. Something had to be done to deny Brentford the space they were exploiting in midfield and the joy they were having against a deep defence.",
      "But the pattern of the game didn't change. If anything Brentford's domination became even more complete in the second half and it was a travesty they didn't win the match.",
      "That failure to solve a persistent problem against a team who had lost 13 of their previous 15 Premier League games is a major issue for Ten Hag and at a time when he is fighting for his future at Old Trafford, it will surely have been noted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford. Not only could United not stem the tide coming towards them, but they were as blunt in attack in the second half as they had been in the first.",
      "For all that United have pulled a series of late winners out of the bag this season, including the reverse fixture against Brentford at Old Trafford, when Scott McTominay scored twice in injury time, their record in the second half isn't great.",
      "It will go down as a second-half draw in West London on Saturday, but United have now won the second half away from home in just three of their 15 matches in the league this season. The last time they won a second half on the road in the league was at Everton on November 26.",
      "It is a depressing and worrying trend and it is one that usually ends up with fingers being pointed at the coaching staff. Getting a game plan wrong from the start is never ideal, but there is always a chance to fix it. On Saturday, United were fortunate to be level at the break. They should have improved after half-time. That they didn't isn't good news for Ten Hag.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping closed tabs on Port Vale's 17-year-old prospect Baylee Dipepa as the Red Devils look to take a more long-term approach to the type of signings they are making under the Sir Jim Ratcliffe era.",
      "The teenager may not be well-known outside the lower-league scene but he is certainly causing a stir in League One right now with the relegation-threatened Valiants.",
      "Bringing United fans up to speed with Dipepa's progress is our very own veteran Port Vale reporter Mike Baggaley, who has profiled everything you need to know about the promising youngster.",
      "Who is he?",
      "Baylee Dipepa, aged 17, has been in the Vale youth system since under-nines level. The striker, from Blythe Bridge in North Staffordshire, has broken into the first team this season, making one league start and another 15 appearances off the bench in the league, up to and including Saturday’s win over Bristol Rovers.",
      "He became the second-youngest scorer in the club’s history when he came off the bench to score at home to Shrewsbury on March 9 with a poacher’s goal from close range after finding space in the area. He followed that with a much more spectacular goal on Saturday when he controlled the ball 35 yards out, turned and beat three players before beating the keeper with a low drive from the edge of the area.",
      "That was his fourth goal in nine days having been called up for England under-17 duty the previous week and scored three in three games at St George’s Park, including two after coming off the bench for his debut against Northern Ireland. What sort of player is he?",
      "A striker. Vale manager, Darren Moore, who was appointed at the start of February, said of Dipepa last month: “Since I have arrived at the club I have looked at him and thought he has all the characteristics of a number nine. He is really young and there are lots of parts of his game that he will develop.”",
      "The youngster, who is around 6ft, showed a turn of pace in his goal against Bristol Rovers but skill, determination and footwork to keep defenders guessing were just as important in the goal. His ability to control the ball, turn and drive up the pitch was also important in helping out the defence on a couple of occasions.",
      "In fact, two Rovers players were booked for bringing him down in the hour he was on the pitch after replacing former Manchester United academy graduate James Wilson who was injured.",
      "What to make of the speculation linking him with Manchester United?",
      "Vale fans are a little sceptical about reports linking their players with moves away. In recent months, the club admitted they were baffled by reports in the national media linking one of Dipepa’s youth team mates to a number of Europe’s top clubs, speculation they said was both out of the blue and unfair on a player still trying to earn a professional contract.",
      "Linking Dipepa to Manchester United is also putting a lot of pressure on a young player still making the transition from youth to first-team football in League One.",
      "That said, it would be surprising if bigger clubs than Vale weren’t watching him because, despite only turning 17 in January, he’s already reached 20 first-team appearances including 16 in the league, and represented his country at under-17 level.",
      "In fact, when Dipepa made his England debut, he was the only player from a League One club in the matchday 18. The rest of the starting XI and bench was made up of 13 players from the Premier League, three from the Championship and one from the MLS.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest Vale fans have been raving about Dipepa for months. In fact, when he made a series of appearances off the bench in league games, there was criticism of the club and the then-director of football David Flitcroft that failing to sign a striker in the January window had meant the club were having to call on a player who has only just turned 17.",
      "But his performance against Bristol Rovers suggests he has quickly adapted to the senior game and learned plenty from his experiences so far, as well as taken plenty of confidence from his flying start to international football with England under-17s. He also comes across as level-headed and, with the support of the club and his family, determined not to let up on the hard work and dedication that has taken him this far.",
      "When he signed his first professional contract with Vale in January, a deal that runs until the summer of 2026, his mum Laura told the club: “I cried, it was emotional and it took me a good few days to get my head around it all! We are proud beyond belief of everything that he has achieved, within the last six months especially, through his hard work and dedication.”",

      "Mason Mount returned from a four-month lay-off against Liverpool and scored his first Man United goal against Brentford.",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has suggested Mason Mount may have to wait for a first Premier League start in nearly five months.",
      "Mount returned from a four-month lay-off with a muscular injury against Liverpool last month and he scored his first United goal off the bench in the 1-1 draw with Brentford on Saturday.",
      "The 25-year-old is poised to return to former club Chelsea for United's next Premier League fixture on Thursday night and he last lined up in the league against Brentford on October 7.",
      "Ten Hag is conscious of easing Mount back into the team as he has played in only 14 of United's 41 games this season.",
      "\"He's a fantastic football player but it's important first that he is getting and keeping fit,\" Ten Hag stressed, \"because he has had three injuries.",
      "\"You see it now with Licha, another injury. So you want to avoid and we have to do this carefully. This is the first objective: to keep him fit. We want to use him [so] that he can benefit and contribute to the team like he did on Saturday when he had a big impact.\"",
      "Chelsea have only beaten United once in their last 14 encounters and have not beaten them in the league since November 2017.",
      "\"It's a tough competition,\" Ten Hag admitted. \"It's very tight and also a lot about which players are available and which players are not. When you are on the right side of the line you can have a successful season but in this competition, so competitive, it can be when you are on the wrong side you can have a much more difficult season.",
      "\"For the rest, they have a fantastic team, they have fantastic players and they also play very good football. They can beat anyone and they have already shown in this league.\"",

      "There have been 53 confirmed cases of injury and illness that have caused a Man United player to miss a game this season.",
      "When an injured Lisandro Martinez still linked up with the Argentina squad in September, the word from Manchester United was it would be beneficial for him to be surrounded by his compatriots.",
      "A penny for Sir Alex Ferguson’s thoughts. Paul Scholes was omitted from an England squad on the Friday due to an upcoming hernia operation and played for United on the Monday against Middlesbrough. If Ferguson was the manager, Argentina nor Martinez would have dared ask the question.",
      "Martinez returned from South America, played twice and United lost both games against Brighton and Bayern Munich, conceding seven goals. Martinez underwent corrective surgery on a metatarsal fracture and did not play again until January.",
      "Times have changed and United have changed. Not for the better. Clubs should be selfish over a player’s availability yet Martinez, sidelined for six weeks, flew to Los Angeles a fortnight ago to train with his international teammates.",
      "Granted, his second-half introduction at Brentford was enforced. Raphael Varane was substituted as a precaution at the interval and Victor Lindelof sustained a hamstring injury in the second half.",
      "Yet this is the problem at United. There have been 53 separate cases of injury or illness that have caused a player to miss a game this season. Martinez returned before the eight-week timescale he was ruled out for with medial collateral ligament damage. Now he is out for another month.",
      "Since he first fractured his metatarsal against Sevilla last April, Martinez has started eight club games. The lucklessness of two impact injuries preceded a calf injury on Tuesday.",
      "The unwritten rule in sport is impact injuries are rotten luck but muscular strains are avoidable. It has been reported by this correspondent and others that some United players are concerned by the intense training demands of manager Erik ten Hag. Casemiro partly blamed it for a recurrence of the hamstring injury that caused him to miss the FA Cup win over Liverpool. Another player is understood to be playing within himself to avoid injury.",
      "Ten Hag brought an assistant coach and an analyst with him from Ajax but not a fitness coach. Louis van Gaal did and so did Jose Mourinho, a big believer in playing through the pain barrier and dismissive behaviour of certain physiological methods. It seems a grave oversight by Ten Hag when sources at Carrington say he treats recovery days more seriously than any of his predecessors.",
      "Marcus Rashford felt Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ran him into the ground and Ten Hag is not negligent. Returning players seldom complete 90 minutes on their return and Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Rasmus Hojlund were both substituted in the victory over Liverpool with United 2-1 down.",
      "But Ten Hag has taken needless risks. Starting Christian Eriksen against Championship relegation fodder Reading in the FA Cup last season resulted in an ankle injury, a ten-week absence and an 11th-hour loan move for Marcel Sabitzer.",
      "The scrutiny also has to be trailed on club doctor Gary O'Driscoll and Charlie Owen, the United fitness coach since March 2019. Owen replaced Robin Thorpe and Gary Walker and that summer Solskjaer instructed the fitness coaches to ensure the squad was the fittest it had ever been.",
      "Before the end of August, the flies started dropping. Luke Shaw, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial were sidelined for the long term. O'Driscoll started at United in September after spending 14 years at Arsenal.",
      "Injury crises are nothing new at United. The physio’s room was crammed under Ferguson for the 2006-07 run-in and before Christmas in 2009 when United fielded a back three of Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Ritchie De Laet at Fulham. They lost 3-0.",
      "Ferguson hailed the opening of the Toshiba Medical Centre at Carrington in 2012 as “a big signing for us and probably the most important step forward we have taken in a long, long time”. United still started that season with Carrick at centre half away to Everton.",
      "Yet United remained competitive, winning the title in 2007 and 2013 and losing it by a point in 2010. Injuries have been rife at other elite clubs and players continue to reel from the backlog of fixtures since the Covid-19 pandemic. Nations League matches in mid-June 2022 and a senseless winter World Cup in Qatar have pushed players to the brink. A high-level source at United said earlier in the season Varane had told them “he can’t do it any more”.",
      "A depleted Liverpool still won the League Cup final, Tottenham schooled United at Old Trafford without five regulars and Manchester City are vying for a second Treble, having coped without Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland for prolonged periods. Ten Hag’s United have crumbled.",

      "Manchester United head to Chelsea on Thursday with several selection headaches for Erik ten Hag to deal with.",
      "The main dilemma comes in central defence with uncertainty over whether Raphael Varane should be risked after picking up a knock against Brentford. The Frenchman will be available against Mauricio Pochettino's side but starting him will be a risk, and with United's absentees in Varane's position, they can ill afford more injuries.",
      "With Victor Lindelof and Lisandro Martinez out for at least a month, Ten Hag may have little choice but to start Varane alongside Harry Maguire. Willy Kambwala is an option, but the 19-year-old remains untested at this level.",
      "READ MORE:Mount might get the chance to respond to his Chelsea chant",
      "Elsewhere, expect Casemiro to return in defensive midfield after starting on the bench against Brentford. The Brazilian may not offer the protection he provided last season, but he represents a more natural fit in that position alongside Kobbie Mainoo than Scott McTominay.",
      "Ten Hag may be tempted to rest 18-year-old Mainoo at some stage but the next two fixtures against Chelsea and Liverpool are vital when it comes to United's Champions League ambitions. Mason Mount may have scored his first United goal at the weekend but it is too soon to start the attacking midfielder after such a lengthy injury layoff.",
      "Despite creating next to nothing for much of the 90 minutes, United's best attack on paper remains Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund with Bruno Fernandes the creative force in midfield. Antony's performance as a substitute against Brentford did little to justify him starting against Chelsea.",

      "The Man United players slept in their own beds the night before the Brentford fixture and had a nap on the day of it. Then they sleepwalked through the game.",
      "Manchester United had two team meetings at their hotel in London before they were ferried to the Community Stadium on Saturday evening. Their performance suggested few players were listening.",
      "They also napped at their hotel. United then sleepwalked through 90-odd minutes until Mason Mount committed daylight robbery.",
      "Although United were minutes from victory yet drew, their performance warrants assessment through the prism of defeat. They were battered and bullied by a team that has won two of their last 18 games. There were also victories for Tottenham and Aston Villa, now so distant they are nearly a mirage.",
      "\"Don't lower the performances from Brentford,\" Erik ten Hag bristled. \"I have seen them against Man City and City was also lucky to win that game. And against Liverpool in the first 35 minutes Brentford should have taken the lead. So don't express this.\"",
      "It has been noticeable since Sir Jim Ratcliffe was the sole bidder left at the table that Ten Hag's rhetoric has changed. As critical as he was of United's lack of \"passion and desire in many moments\" at Brentford, he also opined it could be a \"big point\".",
      "The City revisionism was bizarre. Brentford went 1-0 up through the rarity that is a Neal Maupay goal but City were level by half-time and ahead within eight minutes of the restart. They racked up 15 attempts on target.",
      "Brentford were unmistakably Brentford against United: a back three, wing-backs, physical, primed to press and a nuisance at set-pieces. That was in spite of the absences of Ben Mee, Ethan Pinnock, Aaron Hickey, captain Christian Nørgaard and Rico Henry. They started with their third-choice left wing-back.",
      "United were recognisably unrecognisable. No style and still mired in an identity crisis. Ten Hag blindly named an unchanged team and blind faith is the only consistent thread with United's approach.",
      "The grin on Steve McClaren's face as Mount charged towards the away end was so broad he thought United had got away with it again. Once McClaren had calmed down, he turned to the pitch and pointed at his temples. That was another message that did not get across to the players.",
      "Emotion dictated Ten Hag's selections and that is another tell-tale sign his methods are failing. United's raucous victory over Liverpool was sparked by a substitute and won by another substitute. At Brentford, their scorer was also a substitute.",
      "Victor Lindelof is not quick, not durable and aerially vulnerable, so he was pitted against Ivan Toney. Raphael Varane was United's most accomplished performer in the first half, so Toney pulled onto Lindelof as Rodrigo Muniz did in Fulham's victory. Lindelof is a pushover for physical frontmen.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka seldom resembles a modern right back yet continued at left back. Ten Hag turned in disgust at his positioning after the ball was played in behind Wan-Bissaka. Rewatch Brentford's equaliser and United have a near-perfectly choreographed defensive line to trap Toney offside. Apart from Wan-Bissaka, who is two yards deeper.",
      "Scott McTominay is a moments squad player whose goalscoring impacts have come either off the bench or in charged atmospheres. Only his robustness can account for why he played more than 100 minutes at Brentford.",
      "Ten Hag berated Antony for pressing high, offered encouraging applause in response to Marcus Rashford's miscontrol and had to shout \"Bruno\" at least three times before Fernandes heard and was summoned to the touchline for a conflab. That was midway through the first half.",
      "\"I'm not happy with the performance,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"There is no misunderstanding, the players are also disappointed by the performance and we should be consistent in the game, go in the game, perform and show more aggressiveness.\"",
      "Ten Hag has repeatedly highlighted United's respectable performances against the top four (a narrow defeat to Arsenal, a creditable draw with Liverpool and wins against Aston Villa) in contrast to their level against those in the bottom half of the table. Fulham, Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest have all beaten United, who are away to Bournemouth and Palace in the coming weeks.",
      "As gutting as the equaliser will have been for the 1,725 supporters in the north-east corner, they have become accustomed to this. Wolves levelled in the 95th minute against United two months ago and Fulham prevailed through a winner in the same minute more recently.",
      "United have conceded 13 goals within 10 minutes of scoring this season and there have been 26 goals scored from the 80th minute onwards in their 90-minute matches. Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Wolves, Fulham and Brentford have struck in added time.",
      "The directive for officials to increase added time has predictably resulted in more goals beyond the 90th minute. This Premier League season is already a record for stoppage-time goals.",
      "Had Kristoffer Ajer not occupied the void where United's midfield ought to have been, Mount would have recorded a club-record fifth 'Fergie Time' victory in a single campaign. In the Treble season, United secured two wins of that vintage.",
      "Since Steve Bruce delivered the birth of Fergie Time against Sheffield Wednesday 31 years ago, United have scored 47 stoppage time goals and the four this season is the joint-highest. The only other campaign United forced rewrites in the press box was in 2018-19.",
      "Three of those four triumphs came with Jose Mourinho in the dugout during his final months. That in itself is a red flag with Ten Hag's own future in the balance.",
      "As laudable a hallmark as it is, frequent late wins are unsustainable. United have secured a meagre six victories by a margin of two goals or more since August. Two were against League One and League Two sides in the FA Cup and another was in the League Cup on a night Palace hit the eject button themselves.",

      "MEN Sport provides the lowdown on Manchester United-linked Baylee Dipepa who has shone for England U-17's and Port Vale",
      "Manchester United are reportedly interested in Port Vale forward Baylee Dipepa.",
      "United face a key summer amid a poor 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag with uncertainty over the manager and some players. One of the potential new additions being linked with a move to Old Trafford is Dipepa. Below is the lowdown on the striker which may signal a change in transfer strategy under new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos group...",
      "The 17-year-old has been in good form for League One side Port Vale this season, having only signed his first professional contract at the club in January. Dipepa has scored twice for them so far this season including a stunning solo goal in a 2-0 win over Bristol Rovers on Friday.",
      "He has also been shining for England's U-17 side during the international break, scoring twice as a substitute in a 5-1 win over Northern Ireland. The forward struck again against Hungary on his full debut, scoring the opening goal in a 5-0 win.",
      "Man United are interested amid their change in focus towards signing the brightest young talents according to the Sun. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has highlighted the need for United to look towards signing the next Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham., rather than signing established talent.",
      "It is claimed that United are keen to complete a deal soon for the young star. Dipepa's current deal with port Vale runs until 2026.",
      "Dipepa is a promising talent who is probably not ready for the Manchester United first-team at this stage. However, if he were to be signed this summer, expect him to be given game time on United's pre-season tour with the long-term view of slowly integrating him into the team in a similar fashion to Kobbie Mainoo.",

      "United were hopeless against Brentford and it would have gone down as one of the biggest robberies in Premier League history if Mason Mount's goal had won the game.",
      "The hosts had 31 attempts on goal, hit the woodwork four times and Thomas Frank said that he began to doubt the football God. \"He gave a bit back,\" he added about Brentford's deserved equaliser and United now require a Jesus-like resurrection to secure a top four finish.",
      "United don't look like a team worthy of competing in the Champions League and their performance on Easter Saturday was an insult to the travelling support in West London.",
      "Brentford were dominant and it was remarkable they didn't score in normal time. Their fans couldn't believe they weren't leading at the break and a supporter waiting for the toilet at the interval was overheard saying: \"How s*** are Man United? How aren't we winning?\"",
      "Only three teams have conceded more shots than United in the Premier League this season and two of those, Sheffield United and Luton Town, are in the relegation zone.",
      "United have faced more shots in the league (498) than Manchester City and Arsenal combined. Wherever you look, the unwanted records are stacking up, including United and Sheffield United being the only teams to concede 30+ shots in more than one league game this season.",
      "Brentford had 85 touches in United's penalty box and created 3.11 expected goals. The numbers make for grim reading and Ten Hag has continued to play the problem down.",
      "When asked after the Brentford game whether he was concerned by the number of shots United are conceding, Ten Hag said: “As long as we get results, no. I think our results are quite consistent from January on. We concede shots but we don’t concede many goals.\"",
      "Ten Hag has been asked that almost every week and his answer hasn't changed, but alarm bells should be ringing if he believes conceding a flurry of shots isn't a problem.",
      "Although the Dutchman has argued United are conceding low probability chances, they add up and allowing the opposition to create so many openings is asking for trouble.",
      "United should be a proactive side, they should control games and restrict the opposition's chances to score. Ten Hag has spent over £400million and his side is the antithesis of that, which adds weight to the argument there should be an amicable handshake in the summer.",
      "Ten Hag's denial of the problem is bizarre and it's even more concerning that he's been unable to fix it, with the same problem having been seen throughout the campaign.",
      "Some key players have been unavailable, but it's a structural issue, as the press is often dysfunctional and there are pockets of space between the defence and midfield.",
      "There's been enough time on the training ground to address the problem and, unfortunately, United will continue to be the kings of inconsistency until something changes.",
      "The 2021/22 season was the worst in the club's modern history and yet, United have fewer points, fewer goals and have conceded the same number of goals after 29 games this term.",
      "United have gone spectacularly backwards and there's been a noticeable shift in fan opinion over whether Ten Hag is the right manager for the Sir Jim Ratcliffe era.",

      "United academy director Nick Cox is the man behind a lot of great work and he shared photos this week of the newly created 'The Graduate Lounge' at Carrington.",
      "The space is a designated area for parents and families at the academy and it celebrates players from United's youth programme who have made a first-team debut.",
      "There is a buffet area, which will serve free hot food and refreshments, and a striking mural of academy greats, from Sir Bobby Charlton to Paul Scholes and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Names of every graduate can be found on the wall and it's another example of the academy doing things right. The small details matter and Cox understands that.",
      "The MEN's interview with Fish",
      "Last week, the MEN contacted Will Fish to speak about his loan with Hibernian, his development and what might come next for him. He's a local Manchester lad, born in Denton, and he's been on United's books since he joined the academy when he was just seven.",
      "Although Fish only celebrated his 21st birthday last month, he's started 39 of a possible 41 games in all competitions and, admirably, he's delivered week in, week out.",
      "It was enjoyable to speak to him and it was obvious from the conversation that he's hungry to continue playing regularly and that he won't go back to academy football.",
      "Fish has the quality and personality to forge a brilliant career, regardless of whether that's in Manchester or not, and you can read the exclusive interview by clicking here.",
      "Mainoo continues to dazzle",
      "As mentioned earlier, it's been an unforgettable four months for Mainoo and he shared a photo of himself as a little boy in an England shirt after his appearance on Tuesday.",
      "Mainoo was just one year old when England played at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, the tournament in which the Three Lions lost to Portugal in the quarter-finals.",
      "The youngster celebrates his 19th birthday next month and he'll certainly have reason to celebrate.",
      "Gore receives injury blow",
      "Last week's notebook highlighted that Gore had continued to be absent for Port Vale, despite the initial assessment of his injury suggesting he'd be out for a month.",
      "Unfortunately, following comments from Port Vale manager Darren Moore at the weekend, sources have now confirmed he could be out for the rest of the season with the issue.",
      "Moore said: \"With Dan Gore, that's an ongoing, persistent problem. Whether we feel he's going to be back for any part of this season, we're not too sure.",
      "\"It's not looking too good for him at the moment and it's a persistent one that we'll still monitor.\"",
      "Club sources have told the MEN the injury is not serious but have conceded it's a shame the issue has prevented Gore from making a mark during his first loan away.",
      "What's happening with McNeill?",
      "The MEN revealed in November that Charlie McNeill was set to be recalled from his loan with Stevenage due to his lack of game time. The club thought a temporary spell away would be of huge benefit to McNeill, but it didn't work as hoped and he returned to Carrington.",
      "McNeill won the 2021/22 FA Youth Cup and he's one of four players, alongside Mainoo, Gore and Alejandro Garnacho, to have made senior debuts from that team.",
      "The plan was always to keep him around the first team after his stint with Stevenage and he's made a handful of appearances for the Under-21s. McNeill is getting back up to speed, training with the first team and he should leave on loan again this summer.",
      "He enjoyed his previous loan stint with Newport County and a return could be on the cards.",

      "United's dismal campaign continued with a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad on Saturday afternoon",
      "With Manchester United a goal down at the Etihad, manager Marc Skinner turned frustratedly to his bench.",
      "\"Why aren't they keeping the ball?\" he asked his coaching staff as his players struggled to repel the sky-blue tidal wave that continued to make advances toward the United penalty area. His agitation, it seems, was entirely justified as, mere minutes later, his side were 2-0 down and staring down the barrel of their fifth Women's Super League (WSL) defeat of the season.",
      "\"The games that we have left, we will give everything,\" Skinner vowed to the media in his post-match press conference. \"That's what we'll always do, that's what this team is built on, it's what Manchester United is built on.\"",
      "In fairness, Skinner could hardly have been expected to say anything else. Saturday's 3-1 defeat in east Manchester means his team are now 15 points worse off than the league leaders - a fact that only becomes more sobering when you consider it is their city rivals who currently occupy that top spot.",
      "They are six points adrift of Europe, with that gap likely to widen when third-place Arsenal face off with Aston Villa tomorrow. In fact, should Liverpool avoid defeat in the Merseyside derby on Sunday afternoon, United will end the weekend in fifth place.",
      "It is quite the fall from grace for a side who missed out on the title by just two points last term and were only narrowly beaten by Chelsea in the FA Cup final. It is fair to say that if the Reds came into this season riding the crest of a wave sparked by their previous successes, then their tumultuous recent form means the club is now well and truly on the rocks.",
      "And perhaps the most frustrating thing about this weekend's defeat is that it was so predictable. Three times since the turn of the year, United have gone into a season-defining game needing to deliver. Three times they have failed to do so.",
      "Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Skinner's side found themselves two goals down inside 23 minutes. Hayley Ladd clawed one back on the stroke of half-time before Lauren James' third of the day made sure of the victory for the hosts.",
      "Against Arsenal at the Emirates, United went into the break 3-0 down, with Lucia Garcia's stoppage-time goal proving to be little more than a consolation. That the Reds lost again by the same scoreline at the Etihad is a damning indictment of their ability to step up to the plate when the occasion demands it the most.",
      "Maybe the biggest compliment you could pay City on Saturday afternoon, is that they didn't have to play particularly well to get their noses in front. It was United who shaded the first half-hour of the contest before Jess Park's volley gave the hosts the advantage.",
      "It must be said that any consternation in United's ranks would have been justified, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "\"I actually felt we played well in large parts of the game,\" Skinner said. \"The first goal shouldn't even exist as a goal, she's offside. The difference between smaller and big stadiums is when there are more fans momentum swings quicker. The second and third goal we've got to be better for.\"",
      "Certainly, it's hard to refute the United manager's assertion that the goal changed the game. And, just eight minutes later, Park had made it two, deftly prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box.",
      "On that occasion, Skinner and his players only had themselves to blame. That Park - who has proved herself to be one of the most capable players in the league in recent months - was afforded so much time and space in the penalty area will surely be one of the biggest talking points when the Reds begin their post-match post-mortem at Carrington on Monday morning.",
      "So too will the fact that City were able to carve United open so easily just seconds into the second half, with Park turning provider this time as Shaw finished coolly past a dejected Mary Earps.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. But, as they did against Arsenal and Chelsea, the Reds had left it too late and were left to rue yet another missed opportunity to take their stuttering season off life support.",
      "Of course, there are some mitigating factors for this underwhelming campaign. Any team in world football would struggle to seamlessly replace the considerable talents of Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo, who left the club last summer for Barcelona and Arsenal respectively. Injuries have also played their part, with summer signings Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa both having endured lengthy spells on the sidelines.",
      "But ultimately, United have just simply not been good enough. Fingers will rightly be pointed at the manager but the players must also take accountability ahead of a summer that will be crucial in shaping the club's future.",
      "Certainly, if the rest of the season is to be viewed as an audition for a long-term place in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's United regime, then Skinner and his squad must now hope for a flawless end to the campaign. \"Pressure makes you stronger,\" the Reds boss said. \"This club will rise to the levels we all want. I’m a fighter so I’m going to put myself in a position where I can make this team the best in the land. That’s my personal responsibility.\"",
      "In many ways, Skinner's defiance is admirable and speaks to a manager who has never shied away from the added pressures that come with presiding over a United team. But, no matter how valiantly he is battling to secure his future at the club, it very much feels like he is currently losing the fight.",

      "Jess Park scored a brace in Manchester City's 3-1 win over Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium",
      "If this is to be viewed as Jess Park's breakthrough season at Manchester City, then it was against Manchester United at the Etihad where she truly came of age.",
      "When big-money summer signing, Jill Roord, ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) back in January, it was hard not to fear that the Blues' title charge might start to veer drastically off course. But Park, who joined City as a winger in 2017, is relishing her newfound responsibility in the no. 10 role and has inspired Gareth Taylor's side to huge wins over Chelsea, Arsenal and now United.",
      "For the lifelong City fan, who grew up aiming to follow in the footsteps of Sergio Aguero, it simply doesn't get much better than this; netting a brace against your arch-rivals to send your club - at least temporarily - top of the Women's Super League (WSL) table. Boyhood City fan Phil Foden did the same for men's side against United earlier in March, winning at the Etihad by the same scoreline - and now it was Park's turn.",
      "It is worth noting that it was only a few short months ago that United took to the pitch at Old Trafford two points better off than their city rivals, hoping to maintain their unbeaten start to their league campaign and truly assert themselves in the title race.",
      "Perhaps that afternoon, which ended with the visitors celebrating in front of the East Stand, was the turning point; the moment where the gulf in quality between the two sides first became apparent and the significant chasm that now separates them in the table first began to forge.",
      "Certainly, the landscape heading into this weekend’s showdown at the Etihad was very different. This time, it was advantage City, with the Blues bidding to end the day three points clear of the indomitable Chelsea ahead of their clash with West Ham United on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United, meanwhile, travelled to east Manchester as the would-be disrupters. A win at the home of their noisy neighbours would not quite abate the simmering frustration sparked by what has been a largely underwhelming season, but stopping City from winning a first WSL title since 2016 would at least go some way to tempering the supporters’ angst.",
      "Indeed, even Blues boss Taylor couldn’t find a way to diminish the magnitude of the contest for his side. “Every game is so important because the margin for error is really tight,\" he said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Any kind of dropped point here or there can be quite damaging. We don't underestimate any game. But I probably have to agree (that this is) one of the biggest derbies.\"",
      "And maybe it was the high stakes that contributed to City's subpar start on Saturday afternoon, with United enjoying the best of the early chances in M11. First it was Nikita Parris who came close, drawing a fine save from Khiara Keating, before Brazil international Geyse drilled an effort just wide of the post.",
      "City, though, are always dangerous, even when they are not at their best. And it was Park who fired the first warning shot, taking aim from 25 yards out and forcing Mary Earps to smother the ball to safety.",
      "United still had their moments, most notably when Lucia Garcia's deflected effort had to be tipped over the crossbar by Keating. But City grew in stature with every passing second and took the lead in the 37th minute when Leila Ouhabi teased the ball into the path of Park, who volleyed brilliantly past Earps.",
      "There may have been some justifiable consternation in the United ranks, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "And so it proved, as - just minutes after Shaw saw her strike correctly ruled out for offside - Park had made it two, prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box. The England international was given a heroes reception as she made her way down the tunnel at half-time, while Taylor turned to give a triumphant fist pump to the crowd.",
      "But the job was not done yet and it quickly became clear City had no intention of taking their foot off the gas in the second half, with Shaw finding the back of the net mere seconds after the restart. The Jamaican, who finished coolly after a perfectly-weighted through ball from Park, had managed to cement herself as City's top-scorer before the VIPs in the Colin Bell stand had even had the time to finish their half-time pies and return to their padded seats.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. However, while Marc Skinner's side enjoyed the lion's share of possession in the final quarter, City's defensive fortitude won out, ensuring the hosts won the day in front of a 40,086-strong crowd.",
      "\"It's always felt like (this could be our year),\" Taylor said when quizzed on the possibility of his side winning the title this term. \"When we started the season, our first game at West Ham was very good and you start to see things the team.",
      "\"Obviously there's a long way from that point to where we are now and full credit to the players and the group behind the group to get us to this position. It's taken a lot of hard work, a lot of trust. The most important thing now... is not to worry too much about anything else and control what we need to control.\"",
      "On Park, the City boss added: \"The cherry on the cake we've been looking for with Jess has been goals and assists and she gave us that today on a big stage. Her performance was good, with and without the ball she drives really well and gives us a lot of energy and a lot of quality.",
      "\"Jess has stepped into the opportunity really well. When you think about how patient she had to be, she's done really well.\"",
      "Certainly, Park will have been delighted to have seen England manager Sarina Wiegman in the stands to take in her exceptional display. With the European Championships to come next summer, the 22-year-old is surely edging ever closer to a starting spot in the Lionesses team. But, if City can carry this momentum into the final run-in, Park and her teammates might just be celebrating a different trophy in a couple of months' time.",

      "Man United Women's boss Marc Skinner has yet to meet the Ineos chief but hopes his arrival could help propel the club to success",
      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner hopes the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be a \"springboard\" for the club's success but says he hasn't yet had the chance to meet the INEOS chief.",
      "Ratcliffe's purchase of a 27.7 per cent stake in United was officially completed last month and he has since outlined his ambitions to restore the Reds to their former glory. Speaking to the media last week, the 71-year-old did not go into any great detail about his plans for the women's team, but admitted, “if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.”",
      "It is a sentiment that was echoed by Skinner in his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, with the United boss fully aware the next few months will be hugely decisive in deciding his own future at the club. “We (he and Ratcliffe) have not managed to meet yet, I know it’s on the horizon very soon,” he said ahead of this weekend's trip to West Ham United.",
      "“But we have our constant kind of feed through our bosses anyway in terms of kind of how we want to go forwards, what’s going to work and there’s a lot to do. I see it as a real positive move. I think if you know me as a character, my energy is full in, I’m all in, so with my energy, coupled with the fantastic movement of the INEOS investment, I think it’s a real positive moment.",
      "“We have to capitalise on that, we’re going to try to do that, we’re going to put all our behaviours in place for that. It’s hopefully a springboard for everybody to find the success that everybody wants for Man United.”",
      "Ratcliffe first met Erik ten Hag nearly a year ago, while the pair were pictured together at Carrington in January following the completion of the Ineos chief's investment. Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos sporting director, is currently conducting an extensive audit of all levels at the club and has stepped away from his work with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team to concentrate on this task.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first orders of business as part-owner is to decide the best course of action for Old Trafford, with the fanbase currently divided on whether the iconic venue should be renovated or replaced with a brand new stadium. The INEOS boss suggested last week that, should the men's team relocate, Old Trafford could be used to house both the women's and academy teams, who currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village.",
      "But Skinner admitted such a move is unlikely to happen in the near future. “I’m sure that’s a little bit away,” he said. “We love playing at Leigh Sports Village, it’s become a fortress but obviously it’s a special occasion when you play at Old Trafford.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",

That’s our aim. If it comes down the line and that’s what happens, then I’m sure there will be some fantastic games at the stadium.”",
      "Skinner, who joined the Reds from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer and has been under scrutiny this term following a string of disappointing results. United, who finished second in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season and reached the FA Cup final, are currently in fourth place, seven points off a European spot.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a number of issues to resolve at Old Trafford for both the Men's and Women's sides, and Marc Skinner's team must not be left behind",
      "As the final whistle blew at an overcast Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, Erik ten Hag cut the figure of a man well-acquainted with the potential repercussions of Manchester United’s 10th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Head down, hands in pockets, the Dutchman headed for the tunnel, stopping briefly to offer a customary, consolatory round of applause for the supporters that remained inside the stadium. He wore an air of dejection that mirrored the despondency his counterpart, Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner, had exuded during his own commiseratory lap around the pitch at the Emirates Stadium just seven days prior.",
      "In north London, Skinner's side had been thoroughly beaten by title-chasing Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL), their hopes of European qualification this term left hanging precariously in the balance. \"I'm here to try and win for Manchester United and to continue to grow the team that's needed to win for Manchester United and I think that's really important,\" Skinner insisted after the game. It was a defiant, determined sentiment not too dissimilar to the one evoked by Ten Hag after Saturday's defeat to Fulham.",
      "\"When we get the injuries back we will be more in balance in the team,\" the Dutchman said. \"We also need to strengthen the squad in the transfer windows and then there are many good players, with high potential coming up. Definitely we are going in the right direction. So when everyone is available we have a very good team.\"",
      "In their respective post-match assessments, both Skinner and Ten Hag seemed to allude to a Manchester United of the future, to two projects still in their infancy and two teams that require patience and time to ensure their potential is fully realised. But, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now officially installed as the club’s part-owner, time does not appear to be the friend of either manager.",
      "Speaking to the media last week, Ratcliffe remained non-committal on Ten Hag’s future, telling reporters: “I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that.” It was not exactly a ringing endorsement of the Dutchman who, despite insisting he “doesn’t care” about the growing noise surrounding his United future, will be fully aware of the significance of the coming months and how they might shape the trajectory of his Old Trafford career.",
      "While Ten Hag was also keen to highlight he remains under contract at the club until 2025, Skinner does not have that same luxury. The 40-year-old, who joined United from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer.",
      "And though it is understood he is not in immediate danger of losing his job, it is clear the women’s team, too, is at a crossroads as Ratcliffe and co. seek to restore United to a footballing superpower. The INEOS chief did not go into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during his hour-long discussion with the press last week, but it is clear he harbours ambitions of the Reds one day earning a seat at Europe’s top table.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“The only thing I would say,” he told those in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, “is that if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.” It’s worth noting there has already been confirmation of one prominent departure on the Women’s side of operations, with head of Women’s football Polly Bancroft set to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town at the end of the current season.",
      "Bancroft was brought in from Brighton & Hove Albion, where she worked as general manager, in October 2022. In her newly-created role at United, Bancroft was tasked with implementing a cohesive strategy for the Women’s first team and academy, overseeing both day-to-day operations and long-term performance.",
      "But, though there have been some successes - chiefly her facilitating of a move to a new state-of-the-art training facility at Carrington - the past 16 months have not always been easy for Bancroft. She was, of course, charged with helping tie down first team stars Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new contracts last term.",
      "And, while she was by no means the only figure involved in the handling of those negotiations, the fact Russo and Batlle both left the club last summer - for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively - was viewed in some quarters as a damning indictment of her abilities. Certainly, United will be aware they run the risk of losing yet another of their big names on a free transfer this summer, with goalkeeper Mary Earps also out of contract in June.",
      "The England shot-stopper - who has been voted best goalkeeper in the world for two consecutive years - was the subject of a world-record bid from Arsenal last summer. As they did when the Gunners came calling for Russo in January 2023, United refused to sanction Earps’ exit, though there is every chance she joins her Lionesses teammate in north London in a few months' time, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona also being touted as other possible destinations for the 30-year-old.",
      "Then there are other behind-the-scenes matters to address, with United Women still in the market for a permanent head physio after the former incumbent Ibrahim Kerem moved over to Ten Hag’s side in November. There is also a growing sense the departure of Martin Ho, Skinner’s assistant, last summer has had a detrimental effect on the Women’s team's recent form.",
      "Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner on a two-year deal in July, guiding them to the group stages of the Women’s Champions League and thus making them the first Norwegian outfit in history to achieve that particular feat. And while there is an element of uncertainty about the futures of a number of key United personnel, recent discourse over the future of Old Trafford has also raised questions about the long-term home of the Women’s team.",
      "Skinner’s side currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village though, with Ratcliffe stating a preference to build a new industry-leading stadium for the men’s team, there seems to be scope for United Women to one day relocate to the club’s spiritual home. “If you use that as a centre of regeneration, a bit like the Olympic Village, then I think what you probably finish up doing is Old Trafford would finish up being reduced in size - in the same footprint but a smaller facility - which can be used for all sorts of community things, be it a concert or whatever,\" Ratcliffe said last week.",
      "\"The ladies teams could play there. The academy teams could play there. Some of the local teams could play there and Old Trafford could sort of become a community asset and then you'd have this world-class stadium next door to it.”",
      "With the 71-year-old's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in United having only been officially ratified by the Premier League and the FA earlier this month, it is clear that only time will bring clarity on several of the club’s myriad unresolved issues. However, with Skinner’s side having so far fallen short in their quest for domestic and European success this term, it is imperative the Women’s team is not left behind as United seek to emerge into Ratcliffe's brave new world.",

      "Sky Sports' Paul Merson on Man Utd: \"When I watch them, it reminds me of the second half of extra time in a cup game. It's wide open, the game is end-to-end and that's no good for Man Utd. They can't keep playing what I call hope football. That's not good enough for Man Utd.\"",
      "Thursday 4 April 2024 12:41, UK",
      "In his latest column for Sky Sports, Paul Merson says Erik ten Hag could be under severe pressure at Man Utd with poor results against Chelsea and Liverpool this week following a 'shocker' of a performance at Brentford.",
      "Man Utd's performance at Brentford was an absolute shocker. It was a real wake-up call.",
      "A few weeks ago they are beating Liverpool in the FA Cup, getting to semi-finals and everything is great.",
      "They just got destroyed by Brentford and were very lucky to escape with a draw. They made Thomas Frank's team look like Real Madrid.",
      "Now they have got Chelsea on Thursday, and despite Mauricio Pochettino's side's struggles, United could easily lose at Stamford Bridge. Then it's Liverpool at Old Trafford and if United get beat in that one there could be mayhem.",
      "It always goes back to the start with Manchester United. They win a game, they win another. Things look better but then they suffer a bad defeat or put in a horrific performance and we go back to the beginning.",
      "Erik ten Hag always just seems to be able to keep his head above the water with a positive result in among the poor ones. The pattern over the last year has been get beat, lose again, but then get a win against a lesser team at home to keep the critics quiet. It feels like that is what it has been like during Ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "However, this time around, there isn't a game for United to keep the manager's head above water. Chelsea and Liverpool are no free hits. They will have to produce much more than they did at Brentford to win at Stamford Bridge, and even more to beat Liverpool.",
      "Ten Hag hasn't got a gimme this week so the pressure is on.",
      "This is a worrying time for Man Utd.",
      "Ten Hag could be under severe pressure this time next week if they can't get a positive result against either Chelsea or Liverpool. On the other hand, he could be an absolute hero if he can get another result against Liverpool.",
      "I know United can probably point to a few injuries but it is hard to put your finger on what's wrong with them. You watch them sometimes and they can have a 10-15 minute spell in a game and you think, wow.",
      "But then you watch a performance like the one on Saturday and it's unbelievable. You can't believe what you are watching it is that bad.",
      "They are just too open at the back. There's no shape and also no patterns of play.",
      "Any football needs to start from somewhere and you need a base. You need to draw a line and say we'll go from here, but I don't see that from Man Utd. It's hard to see what they are trying to do week on week.",
      "Because it is Man Utd there are many that think of the United of 20 years ago and think they need to go out there and entertain, but this is not the same club at the moment.",
      "So I'd say they've got build from a base, keep it tight at the back and play counter-attacking football again. That's what I thought they were really good at. They were one of the better counter attacking teams around with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho hurting the opposition with their pace.",
      "At the moment, when I watch them, it reminds me of the second half of extra-time in a cup game. It's wide open, the game is end-to-end and that's no good for Man Utd. They can't keep playing what I call hope football. They are just hoping for the best and hoping they can grab a win.",
      "That's not good enough for Man Utd.",
      "When Ten Hag was manager at Ajax, he was in charge of the best team. He could just open the game up and say you have a shot, we have a shot. More often than not they had the quality to come through and win 90 per cent of the games.",
      "Is he trying to replicate that at Man Utd?",
      "This is not Ajax and he's not in the Eredivisie now. The Premier League is a different animal and Man Utd aren't a dominant team in the league right now like Ajax were.",
      "He's now got to take a step back and get this team back to where they were last season when they were superb on the counter.",
      "There are also the rumours about who could come in at Manchester United should Ten Hag leave with Gareth Southgate linked to Old Trafford.",
      "Those rumours generally don't come from nowhere. They are coming from somewhere and I didn't see much in the way of anyone denying it. No one seemed to nip it in the bud.",
      "Of course, Southgate is still with England for the Euros and they have a great chance to go a long way at the tournament. But the rumours make me worry for Ten Hag.",
      "However, football is a funny game. Things can change really quickly. A win against Liverpool on Sunday and all the pressure is gone again.",

      "Thursday 4 April 2024 12:43, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has hit back at suggestions his training methods may be behind the club's injury crisis, insisting they \"don't train too hard\".",
      "United have been besieged by injuries throughout a difficult second season for Ten Hag, with defenders Victor Lindelof and Lisandro Martinez the latest players to pick up issues.",
      "Lindelof is set to be out for at least a month with a hamstring injury picked up in the 1-1 draw at Brentford, while Martinez faces a similar time out after sustaining a calf complaint in training.",
      "The pair's setbacks have raised further questions about United's injury problems this season, with a report last month from the Manchester Evening News claiming a minority of Man Utd players are concerned about the running demands from Ten Hag.",
      "Asked whether his training sessions are too intense, the Dutchman responded: \"No, we don't train too hard. We need to be fit.",
      "\"The standards in this league, you need to be fit, otherwise you can't match the standards that are required in a game. We don't train too hard.\"",
      "Questioned about whether he should have employed a fitness coach, he replied: \"No, we have good departments.",
      "\"We have good people around with a lot of knowledge, based on data and we make our decisions.\"",
      "United have had 30 injuries that have led to one or more games being missed, with only Newcastle having more (32), according to Premier Injuries data.",
      "The Red Devils' ongoing injury crisis comes despite the club set to play fewer games than last season when they played 62 matches in all competitions.",
      "Asked if the injuries are more concerning considering the lighter schedule, Ten Hag replied: \"No, because I know it still has an effect.",
      "\"The huge number of games we had in the last 18 months still has an impact on our squad and the accumulation on the players.\"",
      "He added: \"You need very robust players - that is the requirement.",
      "\"When we were around Christmas with a lot of injuries and then you have to bring them back, but in the moment they are free from injury they are not going to be match fit. They are not straight back into the form, that also needs a couple of games before you get back in the rhythm.",
      "\"I think we have more players who are very robust, as Bruno [Fernandes] is, but that is the type of player you need.\"",
      "United have lost players for a combined 1,136 days this season, the seventh-most in the Premier League, according to Premier Injuries data.",
      "Questioned about his confidence that a similar injury crisis will not happen again next season, the 54-year-old said: \"You can't 100 per cent avoid this. It's impossible. It depends on certain effects.",
      "\"We have national teams five times a year - you give the players away and you don't have any impact. It's not completely true - with some national teams we have very good connections and we manage the programs. But there are others that do what they want and you don't have anything in hand on what they're doing there.\"",
      "Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans look set to bolster Manchester United's beleaguered backline at Chelsea on Thursday.",
      "Ten Hag is hopeful Varane - who went off at half-time in Saturday's draw at Brentford - and recently-injured Evans will be fit for the game at Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"No more issues - we don't need [any more]!\" the United manager said ahead of Thursday's match. \"On the frontline and in midfield we are OK, we have options there.",
      "\"But in the backline we have a lack of options, but the good thing is back in training this afternoon is Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans. And Harry Maguire was already yesterday back in training.\"",
      "Asked if they are any closer to knowing why they are getting so many issues, Ten Hag said: \"Yeah, we have an idea but we will work on that. I think internally we will deal with it.\"",
      "Ten Hag rejected the chance to expand on what that \"idea\" was but was more forthcoming about the strains on top teams right now.",
      "\"You can't prevent,\" the United boss said. \"You see it's not only us who've had this.",
      "\"The standards of the Premier League from an intensity perspective are so high, the overload in the schedule, also international football is so huge.",
      "\"We have all internationals in our squad and you see it's not only us - City, Liverpool and Newcastle have the problems, so there are many other teams.",

      "The market is expecting Liverpool to score at least three goals here so it doesn't really add up that Diaz is given a 42 per cent implied probability of scoring at least one of them - my figures have it closer to 55 per cent. It looks a cracking price.",
      "Two very untrustworthy teams.",

They played with the usual mis-shapen structure without the ball as per but they added a lack of work ethic to their output.

And I think that leaves Ten Hag very vulnerable over the summer based on their woeful underlying metrics.",

      "I think the Chelsea total corners line is a play with seven or more available at 11/10 with Sky Bet. But we can be greedy. I wouldn't put people off the bigger lines too with 10 or more ripe for a bet at 11/2."

      "Ivan Toney would turn Manchester United into Premier League title challengers, Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has claimed.",

      "Toney has recently been linked with moves to Arsenal and Chelsea and with his contract up at the end of next season, Brentford could be looking to cash in on the striker.",
      "\"Put him in an Arsenal team, put him in a Liverpool or a Man United team, he scores 30 Premier League goals in a season,\" MacAnthony told Sky Sports.",
      "\"I think anyone who disagrees with that hasn't been watching the last two-and-a-half years.",
      "\"I think there's five clubs in the world who could probably end up buying him and he will improve any of those clubs by a mile. He turns Manchester United into challengers for the Premier League.\"",
      "While MacAnthony has been at the helm, Peterborough United have become renowned for astute scouting with Toney a prime example of their success.",
      "The England striker was sold for a profit to Brentford after making 94 appearances and contributing 49 goals for the Posh.",
      "\"Having scouted players not just for their technical ability but their personality and their growth for 18 years, I think he's not even in his prime even though he's turning 28,\" said MacAnthony.",
      "\"Whoever buys him, £100m will be well spent because he's coming into his prime. You're going to get five or six years of his best.",

      "\"I would love him to stay forever, but the reality is he has one year left on his contract,\" said Frank.",
      "\"He's been pretty open about playing for a top club in the future, so there's a couple of scenarios. He leaves in the summer, he leaves in the winter, or he stays until the end.",

      "MacAnthony was adamant Toney must be on the plane to Germany for this summer's Euros.",
      "\"Are you kidding me? He's not only one of your best attackers, he's your best defender. You're one nil up late in a game, he's the type of player you bring on who defends from the front because, just on corners alone, he's your best defender,\" he said.",

      "Arsenal vs Luton - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Manchester City and Liverpool have the know-how, but Arsenal have the numbers in their favour. Having both the best attack and defence in the league means the Gunners have the best goal difference, which could be crucial come May 19.",
      "Should Arsenal keep their healthy tally over their two title rivals, then all they need at this stage is to better Liverpool and Man City's run-in by one positive result to claim the title.",
      "So while the visit of Luton may represent a game that Arsenal should win, the manner of which they pick up three points will sit in their minds, especially given Liverpool and City both have home games against Sheffield United and Aston Villa - the latter can be leaky at times with a high line.",
      "The omens look good for the Gunners too. Luton have conceded two or more goals in six out of their last eight away games in the league, while Arsenal have won five from five against the newly-promoted sides this term, scoring at least three goals in each of those games.",
      "The goal difference situation means winning ugly may not suffice anymore, it's about how you win. The tense crawling over the line in recent weeks against Brentford, Porto and Man City cannot become a regular occurrence for Arsenal.Sam Blitz",
      "Brentford vs Brighton - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "April signals a month of reckoning for a Brentford side that currently sit just five points clear of the relegation zone with only two wins in their last 18 matches.",
      "The west London side dominated against Manchester United on Saturday, striking the woodwork four times, but struggled to make their chances pay. It is a tale of Brentford's season, perennially unlucky with both injuries and results.",
      "Poor luck can only justify so much and despite the credit Thomas Frank has accrued he will need that luck to turn around in April with crucial games against Luton and Everton on the horizon.",
      "The first test comes from fellow Liverpool managerial candidate Roberto De Zerbi, whose Brighton side will expose whether Brentford's performance was the first sign of a spring rejuvenation or merely a reflection of United's struggles.Laura Howard",
      "Man City vs Aston Villa - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "Perfection is required of Manchester City now. Placed third on both points and goal difference following their scoreless draw against Arsenal on Sunday, all Pep Guardiola's side can do is deliver a faultless run-in and pray.",
      "That is easier said than done. Aston Villa presents the toughest test of the Citizens' mettle from the remaining games having come out on top at Villa Park in December. Leon Bailey made the difference on that occasion as City failed to score.",
      "The defending champions also struggled to convert chances on Sunday, and this time, Villa will be galvanised by the nearing prospect of Champions League qualification. They are also in search of an immaculate run-in of their own with Tottenham breathing down their necks in the race for fourth place.",
      "City so often find a way to turn it on when it matters, but Sunday could indicate that their late season perfection is wavering along with their title hopes.Laura Howard",
      "Liverpool vs Sheffield United - Thursday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "After Manchester City and Arsenal cancelled each other out with a 0-0 draw at the Etihad on Sunday, Liverpool have been put firmly in the Premier League title race driving seat. Guarding against unnecessary slip-ups now seems their greatest challenge.",
      "On the surface, Sheffield United seem an unthreatening foe. Having conceded 11 in their last three games, the fixture appears more of an opportunity to boost goal difference rather than a threat to Liverpool's title hopes.",
      "The league leaders must not rest on their laurels. Having conceded early to Brighton on Sunday, they have shown they are not infallible. As a clash at Old Trafford against Manchester United at the weekend awaits, Liverpool must maintain momentum to ensure there are no slip-ups along the way.",
      "The league leaders' hopes will be boosted by the imminent return of Curtis Jones, while the Blades continue to struggle with an extensive injury list.Laura Howard",

      "A mid-table battle might not have been how Mason Mount anticipated his Chelsea return to play out, but he will arrive at Stamford Bridge wanting to prove his own decision right.",
      "For all of three minutes on Saturday, Mount appeared to be belatedly living up to his billing as Manchester United's hero. That was until Kristoffer Ajer corked celebrations with a deserved 99th-minute equaliser.",
      "It was another underwhelming United performance in a season which has proved equally underwhelming for the Englishman. Ruled out through injury since November, Mount returned with a cameo in the FA Cup victory over Liverpool touted to kickstart a so far limp season for Erik Ten Hag's side.",
      "While United's boost has not materialised, Mount could be finding his stride. His goal against Brentford was his first of the season and a clash with his former club, who have conceded two in each of their last five matches, presents an opportunity for more.Laura Howard",

      "Thursday 4 April 2024 11:45, UK",
      "Manchester United's dismal display in their 1-1 draw with Brentford on Saturday night was \"very worrying\" says Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville.",
      "His former club were dominated by relegation-threatened Brentford for the majority of the contest and even when Mason Mount looked to have delivered a smash-and-grab win with an injury-time goal, United blew their chance of an unlikely victory by conceding in the 99th minute.",
      "The result and performance suggests they will have a huge task on their hands to overhaul Tottenham or Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification. They are currently eight points off fifth-placed Tottenham and 11 behind fourth-placed Villa, who have played a game more.",
      "\"I watched Man Utd at Brentford and like everyone else, I couldn't believe what I was watching,\" he said on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I thought they would put a bit of pressure on Tottenham and Aston Villa on the run-in.",
      "\"It's actually really difficult to play that badly. Usually, whatever team you play against, even if you are a top team, the other team will have five or 10 minutes of play or a period of domination.",
      "\"I can't remember any point in the game where Man Utd did anything well at all.",
      "\"It was a horrible performance.\"",
      "On the race for a Champions League spot, he added: \"[Aston Villa and Tottenham] will drop points but if you look at United's level of performance, you just think that not only will they struggle to get into that fifth or fourth spot, they don't deserve to at this moment in time with what we are seeing.\"",
      "Most concerning for Neville was the drop-off from United after the feelgood factor of their dramatic FA Cup quarter-final win over Liverpool at Old Trafford before the international break. There was no sign of the intensity that uplifting result may have given them in their performance in west London.",
      "Inconsistency has been a major issue for United throughout the season and Neville highlighted the team's approach out of possession as a big factor.",
      "\"I can't explain that performance. I have no idea where it comes from,\" said Neville. \"It's very worrying that you can go to that level of low.",
      "\"You know you can play badly in football, you know you can have players missing, you know you can miss chances and you know sometimes you don't feel quite right, but that was a dismal, dismal effort in an attempt to play football, in an attempt to work as hard as you possibly can.",
      "\"When Man Utd give the ball away their reaction to giving the ball away is non-existent compared to all the other teams I see. They really are one of the worst teams you can see out of possession in terms of making it difficult for the other team.",
      "\"What we saw from Arsenal at Man City, and you see the levels of defending, compactness and the work ethic of all the front players to be a cohesive unit and defend together, there's none of that at United.",
      "\"I'm not saying the defenders or the midfield players are blameless because they can do a lot better themselves as well, but there's not a unity at all. There's no idea of how to defend and how to play without the ball.",
      "\"It just wasn't very good and there are worrying signs that you can get to that level of low in their performance.",
      "\"You think about where Man Utd were at before the international break, they had one of the most incredible moments [against Liverpool]. They should've been absolutely bouncing into that game at Brentford and yet, we saw what we saw.\"",

      "Sunday 31 March 2024 14:02, UK",
      "Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp gave Man Utd's performance in the dramatic 1-1 draw at Brentford a scathing assessment and questioned the desire of Erik ten Hag's players.",
      "United looked like they had pulled off a stunning smash-and-grab when Mason Mount scored his first goal for the club six minutes into stoppage time. But Kristoffer Ajer deservedly hit back in the 99th minute to make sure the Bees took something from a game they had dominated.",
      "In all, Brentford had 31 shots, their most ever in a Premier League game. They were only two touches in the Man Utd box away from equalling a Premier League record (Man City's 87). And they hit the woodwork four times.",
      "It was a superb performance from Brentford - who were as good as Man Utd were bad.",
      "After United beat Liverpool in the FA Cup before the international break, this was a big drop off when many expected that Old Trafford victory to be a launchpad for the run-in.",
      "\"Before the game, Thomas Frank would have been a bit nervous thinking, 'We are now going to see a different United. We're going to see a United full of confidence after the result against Liverpool'. It was anything but that,\" said Redknapp.",
      "\"They gave up so much possession, there was a lack of energy with the ball, without the ball. They made Brentford look like Real Madrid!",
      "\"The way Man Utd were was so off it, the lack of desire to go into individual battles, letting them play... It was too easy for Brentford. It was like United at times only had nine men on the pitch.\"",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Ten Hag said he felt Brentford's players \"wanted it more\".",
      "\"Maybe we didn't deserve it [the point],\" he said. \"I thought Brentford wanted more in the whole course of the game.",
      "\"In the final third, we were not secure. We were slow. Second balls, defending, we were not good. They were more aggressive. They had more energy and it should be the other way around.\"",
      "Redknapp said that was a poor reflection on the players and Ten Hag.",
      "With speculation about the Dutchman's future rumbling, this was a worrying performance, said the Sky Sports pundit.",
      "\"Ten Hag said they wanted it more. Whenever you hear a manager say that, that's quite damning,\" said Redknapp.",
      "\"He says 'Our way of playing'. I don't know what their way of playing is.",
      "\"I don't know if they play out from the back. They try to do it sometimes and pass it to the keeper and he just lumps it up the pitch. I know they haven't had the back four they'd like [because of injuries] but I don't know what the Man Utd way of playing is.",
      "\"They had so many opportunities today, Brentford. They were better in every single department.",
      "\"There's lots of talk about the [United] manager, will he still be here next year? I think the way the players are playing right now and that kind of performance, they're going to decide.",
      "\"They're the sort of performances that get the manager the sack. There was a lack of effort. If they really like this manager and want to play for him they will do that.",
      "\"I saw so many players strolling around and not looking like they care. They're playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world.\"",
      "Redknapp felt United forward Marcus Rashford epitomised that attitude, saying at half-time he looked like he was \"walking around like it's a bit of fun out there\".",
      "\"Rashford is a player with so much talent,\" said Redknapp at full-time. \"He's got everything - he's got an incredible physique, he can run, he can dribble, he can shoot, he got 30 goals last year... I look at the player right now and he looks like he's not enjoying his football.",
      "\"For me it's quite heart-breaking because they've got so much talent. I want to see more.\"",
      "The result leaves United eight points off fifth-placed Tottenham and 11 off fourth-placed Aston Villa, who have played a game more. With just nine matches left for United, their prospects of grabbing a Champions League qualifying spot seem slim.",
      "\"It's so difficult to predict Man Utd because they're so inconsistent,\" said Redknapp. \"You just don't know what you're going to get.",

      "Manchester United were denied an undeserved victory at Brentford as Kristoffer Ajer's 99th-minute equaliser salvaged a 1-1 draw in a thrilling finale.",
      "Mason Mount thought he had won it for United in the 96th minute with his first goal for the club against the run of play but Brentford finally scored three minutes later with their 31st shot of the game through Ajer. United were woeful until the final moments.",
      "Brentford will wonder how they did not take any of their myriad of chances before United scored. They struck the frame of the goal four times and were denied by a fine Andre Onana double save. That was just the tip of the iceberg.",
      "Wins for Aston Villa and Tottenham mean United are eight points adrift of fifth after being played off the park by a side just five points above the relegation zone and without a win in their last seven. Brentford somehow, after 31 shots, did not win.",
      "Brentford:\n Flekken (7), Roerslev (7), Zanka (7), Ajer (8), Collins (7), Lewis-Potter (7), Jensen (7),Janelt (8), Yarmoliuk (7), Wissa (7), Toney (8).\n\nSubs: Ghoddos (6), Maupay (5), Damgaard (6), Mbuemo (6).\n\n\nMan Utd: \nOnana (8), Wan-Bissaka (5), Lindelof (5), Varane (5), Dalot (5), Mainoo (5), McTominay (5), Fernandes (5), Garnacho (5), Hojlund (5), Rashford (4).\n\n\nSubs: Mount (6), Maguire (5), Casemiro (5), Antony (5), Martinez (5).\n\n\nPlayer of the match:  Kristoffer Ajer.",
      "On United's last visit to Brentford they were 4-0 down at half-time and could have easily found themselves in a similar scenario this time around. The fight that earned them a seismic win over Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals was nowhere to be seen.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo produced two sublime moments early on but even he was chasing Brentford as they dominated the opening period. Ivan Toney saw an effort rebound off the inside of a post after Yoane Wissa nutmegged Raphael Varane with his through ball.",
      "The whole stadium thought he had scored but were left frustrated - an emotion that would persist for Brentford. Mathias Jorgensen headed onto the bar from a corner with Man Utd suspect at set pieces. Toney and Wissa also missed chances with their heads.",
      "Man Utd had to cling on for most of the second part of the half and were indebted to the last-ditch defending of Victor Lindelof, with Onana also saving a header from Keane-Lewis Potter. Sloppy passing in the final third left United looking blunt.",
      "\"They have been so bad [in the first half],\" said Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp. \"I cannot believe the lack of effort, spark, desire to win individual battles, to make things happen in that team. I'm watching Marcus Rashford walking around like it's a bit of fun out there.\"",
      "For all of Brentford's pressure, they only had one shot on target at the break. Ten Hag turned to Harry Maguire at half-time, bringing him on for Varane. The change did little to stem the tide of Brentford attacks.",
      "A rare moment of magic from Bruno Fernandes unlocked Brentford against the run of play as he slipped Rasmus Hojlund through on goal. The striker looked certain to score but was kept out by Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken at full stretch.",
      "The longer the game went on it felt inevitable that United would have a moment, but it was not forthcoming. Onana produced two stops in quick succession to keep out Yehor Yarmoliuk and Lewis-Potter with Brentford banging on the door.",
      "Wissa grazed the post with a powerful volley after Lindelof's poor clearance before Toney fired over after a moment of brilliance. It was his shot that ensured United have faced 20 shots in a league game for the 11th time this season.",
      "Substitute Antony came close with a curling effort, creating a sense of anxiety for the hosts. That was quickly dispelled when Toney put the ball in the back of the net a minute later. VAR came to United's rescue, though, with the striker marginally offside.",
      "Brentford's luck seemed to be out when they hit the frame of the goal for a fourth time through substitute Bryan Mbuemo. Errors from Onana and the returning Lisandro Martinez went unpunished and the game seemed destined to end goalless.",
      "Nine minutes were added on although that was extended due to a bang of heads between Diogo Dalot and Neal Muapay which set up this frantic finale.",
      "United, finally, deep in stoppage-time found some rhythm and scored what everyone thought was the winner in the 96th minute with Mount picking up a loose ball before burying it past Flekken. It felt like a goal that could launch his United career.",
      "But Brentford, having failed to score with their previous 30 shots, finally found the back of the net through Ajer three minutes later to ensure justice was served. Although, even a point was kind to United.",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag to Sky Sports:",
      "\"If you are winning you shouldn't give it away. We are a strong side and strong in certain situations and we have to get it over the line. That bit is disappointing.",
      "\"We made certain mistakes. We should act differently in a different occasion. The equaliser was absolutely unnecessary. Maybe we didn't deserve it, I thought Brentford wanted more in the whole course of the game.",
      "\"In the final third, we were not secure. We were slow. Second balls, defending, we were not good. They were more aggressive. They had more energy and it should be the other way around.",
      "\"I'm experienced, even when we don't play well, we win the game. It was almost. That's what disappointing the most.",
      "\"I know always after international break, there will always be this, the players are out of the rhythm, they are in different situations. When we don't play so good, we have to win. We almost won.",
      "\"We have many senior players, we should all stand up and take responsibility for this.",
      "\"From January on, we are very consistent with our performances.",
      "\"We will keep fighting, it could be a good point in the end. \"",
      "Brentford manager Thomas Frank to Sky Sports:",
      "\"There should only be one winner in that game, it can only be us. We went 1-0 down after 96 minutes and you're thinking football is brutal, I almost lost faith in the football gods. At least he gave us a little bit back.",
      "\"What a performance, honestly what a performance. We are facing Man Utd, a fully strength Manchester United. Our first-choice defence out, our No 6 is out and we completely dominated the game.",
      "\"We are a team with a tricky run and we played unbelievable. We went 1-0 down on 96 minutes and then came back on 99 minutes? These players deserve so much credit, they are an unbelievable group to work with.",
      "\"Someone told me we had 31 shots, the most we ever had in a Premier League game? How we didn't win that was unbelievable.",
      "\"There are so many fantastic characters in this team, people standing up when we need them. People coming in and roles, it was fantastic.",
      "\"That [the finishing] is disappointing but it dropped for the right players you wanted to drop for. Unfortunately that's football.",

      "\"They gave up so much possession, there was a lack of energy with the ball, without the ball. They made Brentford look like Real Madrid!",
      "\"The way Man Utd were was so off it. The lack of desire to go into individual battles, letting them play... It was too easy for Brentford. It was like United at times only had nine men on the pitch.\"",

      "\"[On his ruled out strike] The gaffer is always saying to me 'make sure you're not being a lazy striker, stay onside completely and then you give yourself half a chance' but I switched off for half a second and it's a tight call.",

      "United are understood not to have made a definitive decision over Ten Hag's future and are planning for next season with him, including potential recruitments and summer tour plans.",
      "But United's ambitious new co-owners Ineos are believed to admire Southgate, who has a good relationship with Sir Dave Brailsford as well as potential incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth.",
      "Ten Hag, however, says he is used to speculation about his job, claiming it is part and parcel of managing a big club.",
      "\"You know when you are working at Manchester United, there will always be noise and rumours around the club, team, manager, players, there will always be issues,\" he said in his press conference ahead of United's Premier League trip to struggling Brentford, live on Sky Sports on Saturday Night Football.",
      "\"You [the media] like it to talk about [speculation], but of course we have different interests, but we are not focusing on that. We are focusing on the process to make the team play better, to improve the way of playing.",
      "\"So yes, I do not care about it.",
