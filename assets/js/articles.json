      "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk is pals with LeBron James and watched a message from 'King James' when he modelled at the launch of his new fashion line 'LFC x LeBron'",
      "Virgil van Dijk is already one of the world’s best defenders - but says LeBron James is inspiring him to be even better.",
      "James is a part owner of Liverpool through his investment in owners Fenway Sports Group and Van Dijk modelled at the launch of his new fashion line ‘LFC x LeBron’ earlier this month. Liverpool posted a video of Van Dijk watching a message from James where ‘King James’ predicts he will do “amazing things” for the Reds and urged him to “strive for greatness”.",
      "Van Dijk is filmed saying “the King has spoken” and is determined to use his words as quadruple-chasing Liverpool face their fiercest rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup on Sunday.",
      "“That phrase he uses is perfect and it could be used for a lot of things,” said the Liverpool skipper. “For me personally, I definitely try and follow that because I want to achieve the most I can in life and get the maximum out of myself, the team and the position we’re in.",
      "“We’re in a good place to do that this season - again. Every season is always a challenge, but this season we’re in a special situation.” Van Dijk says he is learning from James - and the other top athletes in the world - on how to handle the negatives and positives.",
      "“I look at all the top athletes because I feel they all have a big role, either as a role model or for their team and community, and there are so many things you can learn,” he said.",
      "“There’s LeBron, Djokovic, Roger Federer, Tom Brady - I could name so many. I like to listen to these guys and learn how they dealt with being at the top and dealing with difficult moments, but also good moments.” Van Dijk has already copied one aspect of James’ lifestyle and he has his own physio and chef to help him recover and recharge after games.",
      "“Those two parts are very important,” he said. “I do my recovery stuff so I can be optimally prepared for the next challenge, especially when you’re having three games a week. It was already fine, but I want to be better and make the most out of it, and that hard work nobody sees is the key to success.”",
      "Van Dijk is back to his imperious best after last season’s difficult campaign for Liverpool and says everything has “just clicked” again. “I feel very comfortable in every aspect of the game,” he said. “Obviously confidence is a big driver, but I think I’ve made big steps in possession.",
      "“The manager said the other day it’s not just as simple as wearing the armband and I think a lot of things just clicked again.” That confidence is reflected in his view of Sunday's testing trip to Old Trafford.",
      "“It’s always difficult, it’s always intense,” he said. \"It’s the history of the games with the two biggest clubs in England and that brings extra expectation and pressure. But why not just go out there and enjoy it, play our game and hopefully go to the next round?”",

      "The Reds visit Manchester United in a highly-anticipated FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday afternoon fresh from completing an 11-2 aggregate trouncing of Sparta Prague - with star man Mohamed Salah looking sharp again after his recent lay-off.",
      "And their hopes of ending Klopp’s final campaign at Anfield with four trophies, having already secured the EFL Cup last month, have been boosted further with the expectation that three more important players are close to coming back.",

      "\"Curtis [has a chance after the international break] then Diogo and Trent the week after, they have a chance,” Klopp said.",
      "Midfielder Ryan Gravenberch has trained this week and is available for selection and Klopp also provided an update on teenage Spanish holding midfielder Stefan Bajcetic, adding: “He feels something but it's not injuries, it's intensity.",
      "\"We don't want to use him before he's really ready. His body was not really ready for the intensity. He is in a much better place now but we have to wait. [He will be] part of team training after the international break.\"",
      "However, Liverpool remain without a stack of regulars for the trip to face an inconsistent United. First-choice goalkeeper Alisson Becker, midfielder Thiago Alcantara, and defenders Ibrahima Konate and Joel Matip are all still absent owing to injuries.",
      "And with a tight turnaround from their European tie, Klopp said United’s full week to prepare may have an impact. “Again we have a situation where we have played Thursday and we handled it,” he added.",

Liverpool will look to him again in Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Old Trafford after he came through 90 minutes against Sparta Prague on Thursday, scoring one goal in the 6-1 romp and assisting for three others.",
      "Salah’s goal made him the first Liverpool player to score at least 20 times in seven successive seasons and Klopp claimed he is “pure quality”. \"The timing is super good,” said the Liverpool boss. “You saw that last night, how many goals did he set up first half? Then he was involved in everything else pretty much.",
      "“He was exceptional. It was a strange game in the second half, I would have loved to have taken him off, but that was not possible because of Bobby Clark’s injury situation, and he managed that pretty well.",
      "“Even then, he set up another goal which was offside. Mo is pure quality. Ask him what he likes most about Manchester United, but the more we talk about it, the less likely it will happen on Sunday.",
      "“That’s why I don’t like this subject too much. It’s just he’s an exceptional guy, a world-class player. How we dealt without him is unbelievable, the boys did really well.",

      "“I don’t know in the moment if we can play the same game again, it was a really good game,” he said. “I would call this game the start of when we reached the next level for the season.",
      "“Until then we were quite OK, we only lost one game, but it was still ‘Ah, sometimes really good, sometimes not so good’. It was difficult to judge us. We had so many things to overcome like red cards, being 1-0 down, so it was not clear how good we actually are.",
      "“That game, I first saw that was really us in the next gear. The result didn’t show that and I have no clue whether it will be the same game, I don’t expect it obviously as it’s a home game for them.",

      "Rashford, 26, has endured a difficult season like many of his United teammates and there've been frequent suggestions that all isn't well behind the scenes, as new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe prepares to overhaul the squad. In January, an unsanctioned night out in Belfast led to the England international missing training and he was dropped from the squad for one match.",
      "Despite his poor form after recording a career-best 30 goals last season, PSG are circling and harbour a long-standing interest. Ten Hag wants to keep him, though, having handed Rashford a new bumper five-year contract worth £250,000 per week last summer.",
      "\"We did not re-sign him last season for four [more] years with the intention to sell him now,\" the United manager affirmed ahead of Sunday's grudge FA Cup quarter-final clash with Liverpool. \"He should be part of this project.\"",
      "Mirror Football reported this week that PSG made a concerted effort to sign Rashford in 2022 following another disappointing season at Old Trafford. The French champions were prepared to hand the forward a deal worth a whopping £400,000-a-week and have now reignited their interest.",
      "With star man Kylian Mbappe all but certain to be joining Real Madrid this summer, the Parisians want Rashford to replace him.

His 11 starts this campaign has brought about just one goal, with only two of his outings coming this calendar year - the last of which was last month's shock 2-1 home defeat by Fulham.",
      "Kasper Hjulmand’s Denmark are gearing up for friendly fixtures against both Switzerland and the Faroe Islands, but former Real Madrid man Gravesen has torn into the decision to call Eriksen up. Speaking to Tipsbladet, the ex-Everton hardman did not hold back in his assessment of the squad selection.",
      "\"It is completely scandalous that he has not selected Nicolai Vallys. It’s a scandal of great proportions that we have a national coach who looks so little towards Denmark when there’s a player running around with those qualities,\" Gravesen claimed.",
      "\"When you look at the way he is playing football at the moment. And then they choose to take out a player who has sat on the bench at Manchester United, Christian Eriksen, just to maintain relations.\"",
      "Gravesen continued by tearing into Eriksen's demise on the pitch, adding: \"The Christian Eriksen we all know, he is no longer there. Christian Eriksen doesn’t play football anymore.",
      "\"Christian Eriksen sits on the bench and watches football. Christian Eriksen as we know him, he is no more. You must not fall back on the fact that you are only selected on merit. One must not single out Christian Eriksen only on his merits.\"",

He explained: \"It's not the best situation as it is right now. I really, really hope that changes. I'm pretty sure we'll see a fit Christian. I know he is.",
      "\"But of course, if it continues, it can become like it is with everyone else for Christian. There can be a concern about the level one can perform at if they don't get more playing time than what it is currently.",
      "\"I really hope it changes. A player as talented as Christian needs to play, and we certainly hope it changes at United. But it's not the best situation not to have played more.\"",
      "Eriksen's United contract expires next summer and it seems increasingly unlikely that the Red Devils will look to renew. Speculation has even suggested that the club could look to buy the Dane out of the rest of his deal to free up wages for a replacement as soon as the next transfer window.",

The United midfield has produced some stellar displays and scored a match winner at Wolves as he becomes the latest academy graduate to make an impact at Old Trafford.",
      "His performances have seen him compared to Seedorf - one of the greatest midfielders of his generation. The Dutchman claimed 87 caps for his country and, during a well-travelled trophy-laden career, won the Champions League with three times teams.",
      "Despite Mainoo's classy start to life in the United starting XI, Ten Hag is keen to have the 18-year-old build his own identity whilst taking the best and being influenced by players who've come before him.",
      "He said: \"So I think never ever compare players with another player. Never. Because Kobbie Mainoo, but also other players, they build their own identity. Don’t compare with anyone. His skillset, that is so typical. And it’s so Kobbie Mainoo, it’s nothing to do with other players.",
      "\"Of course, he can learn from other players, especially from great players as Clarence Seedorf was. But Kobbie Mainoo is Kobbie Mainoo. He has big potential and I’m quite sure he will have a big career.\"",

      "The likes of Jarrad Branthwaite have been included in the latest squad to take on Brazil and Belgium this month. Southgate is well aware of the quality shown by Mainoo, as well as other young Englishman, but claims his lack of appearances were a factor in him being overlooked.",

      "He also added: \"I think that he’s doing brilliantly for a young player, and we’re never slow to put a young payer into the seniors, but he’s only had a handful of games and you have to be very careful development-wise in making those decisions at the right time. We think ideally we should allow him that space to develop at his own speed.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is hoping to make an impact at Manchester United this summer but the billionaire could see the club shell out £158million in transfer-related add-ons",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe could be forced to watch Manchester United pay out £158million in transfer add-on fees this summer.",
      "The Ineos chief has just come on board and already made some shrewd off the pitch captures ahead of the summer, when he'll really get his first chance to make an impact on the Red Devils. Unfortunately for him though, he could see a major dent in the club's accounts.",
      "Recruitment will be a major part of his remit but the billionaire will have to honour fees that were already dictated by previous decisions. Mason Mount, for example, was signed last summer with potential add-ons, and he isn't the only player in the squad with those terms.",
      "As a result Ratcliffe could well see his transfer budget eaten into as United pay out on guarantees they made. The £158m is a hike of almost £55m from the previous season.",
      "The Times has reported a line in United's accounts, which read: “Under the terms of certain contracts with other football clubs and agents in respect of player transfers, additional amounts, in excess of the amounts included in the cost of registrations, would be payable by the Group if certain substantive performance conditions are met . . . The maximum additional amounts that could be payable is £158,040,000.”",
      "As well as players, off the pitch members of staff have received handy pay-offs. Richard Arnold has recently stood down as the club's chief executive and was given a pay off of £5.5m once he formally resigned his position on February 15. That is in addition to his salary of £2.56m - which already made him one of the highest paid people in his role in the Premier League.",
      "United last summer were already operating with serious financial parameters as Erik ten Hag fought to remain within the guidelines that every club must abide by. That ultimately influenced his recruitment, as it had done the previous year.",
      "The Dutchman, whose own future beyond this season is unclear, had to drive down the price of players like Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund to ensure he could fill gaps in his squad whilst sticking to the budget he was given.",
      "In his first year, after spending big in the summer on the likes of Antony and Casemiro, Ten Hag had to utilise the loan market in January due to having a lack of funds available. He signed the likes of Wout Weghorst as United sought a temporary replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo.",

      "Mohamed Salah warmed up for Manchester United by bagging yet another Liverpool goalscoring record.",
      "Salah netted as Liverpool banged in four goals in seven first-half minutes to become the first player in the club’s illustrious history to score 20 or more goals in seven successive seasons This was just what United did not need ahead of Sunday’s FA Cup showdown at Old Trafford and Salah is the top scorer in this fixture with 12 goals.",
      "Salah also marked his first Liverpool start since New Year’s Day by bagging a hat-trick of assists and he has had a hand in 33 goals this season. The Egyptian star was much sharper last night and he looked understandably rusty because of his lay-off for his hamstring injury when he came on against Manchester City last Sunday.",
      "It was too easy for Liverpool and in another notable moment, 19-year-old Bobby Clark scored his first senior goal to crown his impressive night.",
      "The demolition job began in the seventh minute when Clark fed Dominik Szoboszlai on the right and he centred for Darwin Nunez to score his 17th of the season and his fifth in Europe.",
      "Sparta conceded straight from the kick-off when Salah tackled the sleeping Ladislav Krejci on the edge of their box and Clark pounced on the loose ball to mark his 13th appearance with his first senior goal.",
      "Sparta blundered again in the 10th minute and this time Clark returned the compliment as he robbed Jaroslav Zeleny and fed Salah to sweep home his latest landmark goal.",
      "Sparta were like rabbits caught in the headlights and Salah turned provider again when he crossed for Cody Gakpo to score in the 14th minute.",
      "Nunez then provided another contender for miss of the season when he scooped Salah’s cross over the bar from just six yards out. He smiled, as did Klopp, and they could both afford to be generous.",
      "Sparta salvaged a smidgeon of pride when Veljko Birmancevic latched on to Angelo Preciado’s ball and held off Wataru Endo to score, although his sprint to retrieve the ball from the net was over-zealous.",
      "The goals kept coming for Liverpool and on 48 minutes, Salah fed Szoboszlai on the right and his angled shot went through the hapless Peter Vindahl in the Sparta goal.",
      "On 55 minutes, substitute Harvey Elliott’s 20-yard curler was touched home by Gakpo for the Dutchman’s second of the night.",
      "It was like a pantomime at times and the home crowd booed when Klopp was booked by referee Artur Dias for going nuts when he delayed Virgil van Dijk’s introduction from the bench.",

Speaking on March 8, Ten Hag appeared to suggest that the England international will be out for the rest of the season, alongside fellow left-back Tyrell Malacia, who has been missing with a knee injury.",

      "But now, after picking his England squad for two international friendlies against Brazil and Belgium later this month, Southgate revealed that Shaw could be back before the end of the campaign. The Three Lions boss is hoping Shaw will be fully fit for Euro 2024, which gets underway in mid-June.",
      "Southgate said in a press conference: \"We are all hoping - ourselves and Manchester United - that he could be back just before the end of the league season. But that is getting really tight to the Euros, and there is a reality about whether it’s possible to play seven games in the Euros.",
      "‌\"What we've learned from the two or three tournaments in which we have played seven matches, we’ve learned a lot of information about physically what a tournament takes.",
      "‌\"So there is getting fit to play, but there is also what that means about level of performance. You don't know what version of the player you're going to get.

      "The Red Devils ace, 33, turned from hero to villain as Wigan broke their hearts. He looked set to deliver his side a famous win - and put them top of the table. But after inspiring a brilliant comeback from 10-0 down to lead 12-10, Sneyd’s ill-advised short drop-out went badly wrong in the 75th minute.",
      "It only went as far as England centre Jake Wardle who went in untouched to protect leaders Wigan’s 100 percent winning start. To make matters worse, the World Club champions were down to 12 men at the time after England scrum-half Harry Smith was sin-binned for checking Ryan Brierley. But asked what he said to man-of-the-match Sneyd, Rowley said: “My words were ‘it happens.’",

Salford won at St Helens for the first time in 44 years six days earlier and looked set for a fourth straight win here. Wigan took a 10-0 lead after Smith converted Abbas Miski’s 46th minute try.",
      "But Sneyd’s perfect kicking set up tries for Sam Stone and Tim Lafai which he converted both times. However, Wigan gang-tackled Salford debutant David Nofoaluma to force him 10 yards back for that crucial drop-out. The depleted hosts were down to their last 17 fit and available players for this match but only trailed 4-0 at the break after Liam Marshall’s 39th minute try.",
      "They gave debuts to Ethan Ryan and new signing Gil Dudson but relieved Wigan boss Matt Peet admitted: “When Harry got binned I must admit I thought the game might get away from us. But those extra efforts, in the end they paid off. It was a big effort to force their guy back over the line for that drop-out.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has been a shining light in an otherwise miserable season for Manchester United this term, but hasn't done enough in the eyes of England boss Gareth Southgate.",
      "The 18-year-old made his full Premier League debut for the club back in November and hasn't looked back since. Since then, he's made 22 appearances across all competitions and shown that despite his age, he is more than comfortable operating in the middle of the park for a club as big as United.",
      "Therefore, many fans and pundits alike were hoping to see Mainoo's name on the Three Lions squad-list for the upcoming friendlies against Brazil and Belgium. However, the teenager hasn't made the cut and is instead expected to feature for the Under-21s.",
      "However, ex-England international and Liverpool legend John Barnes has explained that Mainoo's omission may not be a bad thing, given United's poor form means the Red Devils academy graduate will only be subject to more scrutiny at international level",
      "Barnes told bonuscodebets : \"Should Mainoo be playing for England? Why don’t we give him time to develop? He’s playing in a team that’s not even in the top five or four.",
      "\"United aren’t playing particularly well so why are we going to put pressure on him. If he was playing that well, wouldn’t United be in the top four or five and they’re not.”",
      "\"So I’m not going to get carried away because he’s playing well and having a good breakthrough season. And he is playing very well but as with all young players, let them develop slowly and he’ll get his rewards later on.\"",
      "Southgate actually shed light on his reasons for overlooking Mainoo on this occasion and his sentiment was similar to the one shared by Barnes. The England boss highlighted the fact that the talented teen simply hasn't played enough games.",
      "\"I think that he's doing brilliantly for a young player and we're never slow to put a young player into seniors,\" Southgate claimed. \"But he's only had a handful of games and you have to be very careful development-wise in making those decisions at the right time.",
      "\"So we think ideally, we should allow him that space to develop at his own speed. He's not at the point in terms of number of games that Jude (Bellingham) and Bukayo (Saka) were when they came in for the first time.",
      "\"But I repeat: he's doing really well for a young player. He's a good footballer - you can see that. And he's getting some fabulous experience with Manchester United at the moment. And he looks a really good character.\"",

      "Amongst the nine players listed in the forwards section, many of them do jobs in midfield so we should not take the categorisation too seriously. But surely there was midfield room for one of the most exciting prospects to emerge in that department this season?",
      "He has tried to explain but it remains hard to fathom why Southgate has decided not to take the chance to have a good close-up look at Kobbie Mainoo. Yes, he is relatively young and inexperienced but his club team-mate Marcus Rashford made his England debut at the age of 18 and Mainoo turns 19 next month.",
      "And in his 22 appearances for United - and there would have been more had he not suffered an injury in pre-season - one of the many qualities that have stood out is his maturity. It is clear Mainoo has a great temperament.",
      "While on the subject of midfielders, a resurgent Ross Barkley can also count himself unlucky not to be in this squad and the same can be said of Harvey Elliott, who was, arguably, the best player on the park in that titanic tussle between Liverpool and Manchester United on Sunday. But under Southgate’s and the FA’s demarcation lines, they might be considered attackers.",
      "What Mainoo would have given to Southgate is an alternative to Henderson and, boy, the England manager needs one. To the vast majority of England fans, what midfield three looks better?",

In his three tournament campaigns, Southgate’s approach has been underpinned by an insistence on giving his defence as much protection as possible.",
      "Rice and Kalvin Phillips, Rice and Henderson. That approach has taken England to a World Cup semi-final and quarter-final and a Euros final.",
      "But the players always repeat the mantra of taking the next step, taking the final step, winning trophies, and that is why Southgate should be duty-bound to keep searching for difference-makers. Mainoo, even at his young age, could be a difference-maker.",
      "He can offer the protection provided by Henderson but carry a more sophisticated attacking contribution. That may sound overly optimistic, that may sound over-the-top when Mainoo has played such a limited amount of top-flight games.",
      "That might well prove to be the case but would there have been any harm in Southgate having a closer inspection of Mainoo’s undoubted talents? The England manager’s retort to that sort of question is normally to ask who would you leave out to make room for someone such as Mainoo.",
      "Well, he has EIGHT defenders in this squad, so maybe one of those. Mainoo has big tests coming up in a Manchester United shirt and he clearly has a lot of developing to do.",
      "But you cannot help but feel that if he wants to dispel this idea he is a conservative coach, Southgate has missed a trick with Mainoo.",

      "After early exits from the Champions League and Carabao Cup, the FA Cup provides Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag with his last hope of silverware this season",
      "Manchester United's players must prove they want Erik ten Hag to stay - by knocking arch rivals Liverpool out of the FA Cup.",
      "Ten Hag's hopes of keeping his job hinge on the FA Cup and securing a Champions League spot, although with United eight points adrift of fourth place, that latter target seems unlikely. That leaves the FA Cup as Ten Hag's last shot at redemption, with United legend Lou Macari believing Sunday's Old Trafford clash could be a make-or-break encounter for the Dutchman.",
      "“People are saying it’s a huge game for Ten Hag,” said Macari, who played a key role as United beat Liverpool in the 1977 FA Cup final to deny their old foes the Treble. “But it’s a huge game for everybody - players, fans and the club itself. A convincing win against Liverpool could go a long way to persuading people Ten Hag is the right man to stay in charge. That's the crazy thing. The manager's position is always under threat, but all managers – including Ten Hag - rely on their players.",
      "“You'd like to think that those who like him – and I don't think there would be many who dislike him – will be out there on Sunday, playing for their futures and the manager's future. You have managers at a club, and everyone's got an opinion on them, but you look for decency and you look for honesty.",
      "“Ten Hag seems like a decent, honest fellow, who's got to live with the results week-in, week-out,which hasn't been easy. But now's the time to get a big win – with everything that's at stake.",
      "“We all know what it's like at United – a fully committed performance from everybody is accepted. If you haven't managed to win, you're disappointed, but most fans would look upon it and say 'they didn't leave anything behind and gave it their all'. That's what's required on Sunday – and I don't think they can afford to lose.”",
      "United are currently sixth in the Premier League, with failed assaults on the Champions League and EFL Cup leaving the FA Cup as their only remaining chance of a trophy. But Macari, 74, believes there is still time to rescue the season – by beating Jurgen Klopp's side and giving United supporters something to cheer after such a difficult campaign.",
      "“It's been a difficult season for everybody,” said Macari. “For the club, the manager, players and fans. “Thankfully it's not over yet and there is a chance to salvage something from it and I'm sure that's the main priority for everyone at United – to grab what's left.",
      "“What's left is the FA Cup. You've got difficult opponents, but getting to Wembley, as I experienced four times at United, is a great day out for the fans who follow the team through thick and thin.",
      "“I just hope the players realise that they can do it, because the history of the FA Cup – not just between the two biggest clubs in the country – is full of upsets. When we beat Liverpool in the 1977 FA Cup final, to stop them doing the Treble, they were favourites to win and we were the underdogs.",
      "“It’s the same on Sunday. Even though we’re home, at Old Trafford, we’re the underdogs. People say the team's not good enough, but I've seen United teams that are struggling, then suddenly they get a big scalp and things can change.”",

      "Lou Macari reckons some modern-day players have no idea how fortunate they are.",
      "When Macari joined Manchester United from Celtic in 1973, he was on £180-a-week, his salary having crept up to £420-a-week by the time he left Old Trafford in 1984. Macari and his contemporaries earned nothing like the multi-million pound salaries of today's stars, with some in the Premier League commanding wages in the region of £500,000-a-week.",
      "Against that backdrop, Macari said today's players have nothing to be unhappy about and should recognise what a privileged position they find themselves in – particularly those at United.",
      "“Nowadays, as we all know, the players are on sensational salaries,” said Macari. “They've got everything they could possibly want and they're playing for Manchester United.",
      "“There's nothing they're missing out on, they're not being hard done by, they're at the best club in the country – not in terms of results, obviously, but in terms of the best club to play for. For me, there's nothing to complain about.",
      "\"The only thing that's been lacking is those weekly results that means there's a real buzz about the place. But they're capable of doing that.",
      "“One thing I've often thought about is how the big money the players are on today would have affected, not just me, but any of the players I played with. There was never anything like that sort of money available to us. The money, the facilities available to the players now, so much has changed from when I played.”",
      "Macari, who has been running a centre for homeless people in Stoke for the past eight years, which he set up, added: “I was at United for 11 years because I wanted to be there.",
      "“I wanted to play for the club, I loved the place and I thought 'I can't better this' – and I was right.”",

      "Opposing Premier League clubs have stated that no such vote took place because a number of members believe it is important to know what the new financial regulations will look like",
      "Premier League clubs will take a vote on the ‘New Deal for Football’ when there is clarity over what the new financial restrictions in English football’s top tier will be.",
      "On Monday, the 20 Premier League member clubs met to discuss a £900million deal that would see more money flow from the top level into the EFL in the hope that an agreement over the long-running saga could be voted on ahead of the arrival of a new regulator in the game.",
      "However, that vote did not take place, with reports claiming that as many as 10 clubs were considering ditching the plans, and were even reportedly going as far as considering legal action should the government’s soon-to-be football regulator impose a deal upon them. The clubs in question were reported to be Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool, West Ham, Aston Villa, Wolves, Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth.",
      "Talks turned to focus on the requirement for new financial regulations to be agreed upon that would replace the current profit and sustainability (PSR) rules that have come under scrutiny, with the Premier League looking at leaning more towards a model in line with UEFA’s squad cost ratio, where spend on transfers and wages against revenue as a percentage is what is assessed.",
      "At present, PSR allows clubs to lose £105m over three years, although investment in infrastructure, the women’s game, community initiatives, and the academy can all be deducted. Over the past 12 months, Everton have been charged twice and Nottingham Forest once, with Everton having been handed a 10-point deduction for the 2021/22 charge that was reduced to six upon appeal. Both they and Forest face fresh independent commission hearings over the 2022/23 breaches.",
      "But Mirror Football has spoken to sources at clubs opposed to voting without the new framework to replace PSR in place. They have stated that no such vote took place because a number of member clubs believe it is important to know what the new financial regulations will look like before agreeing to any new deal, also rejecting the notion that any kind of legal action against potential government intervention was being considered.",
      "A number of the clubs are believed to be concerned at being asked to take a vote when not in possession of the relevant information, although sources stated that there remained a willingness to agree a deal and be ‘good citizens’.",
      "It was February 29 when Premier League clubs last met to discuss the issue, but with the desire to bring about changes to PSR having escalated in recent months, there is likely to be little tangible progress until that is resolved.",
      "After the UK government confirmed a new independent body for English football in February, with one of the main focuses being the fair distribution through the pyramid from the Premier League, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer recently warned that the new ombudsman would intervene if a deal was not agreed.",
      "It is likely that talks over what replaces PSR don’t reach a conclusion until the summer, by which time the clubs who declined to vote on a new deal until the new rules believe they will be in a position to do so, with one club source describing it as ‘essential’ that transparency over the new regulations is provided before a vote on the ‘New Deal’ takes place.",

      "Manchester United's wastefulness in the transfer market has been laid bare",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United, but quite how long it will be until some real green shoots of recovery will appear is an unknown.",
      "There hasn’t been too many cases of a minority stake in a football club being acquired as there has been with Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s purchase of 27.7% of the club, a deal that was ratified in January.",
      "The reason for that, of course, is that Ratcliffe and his INEOS team have been handed football oversight as a result of the deal, the absentee ownership of the Glazer family seemingly more than happy to pass over that particular baton.",
      "The last time that Manchester United won a Premier League title was in 2013, the final season of Sir Alex Ferguson’s illustrious reign.",
      "Since then the club has seen David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solksjaer, Ralf Rangnick, and now Erik ten Hag in the dugout. Aside from the odd bright spot here and there, it has been a case of rinse and repeat, where the club pivots from manager to manager and hopes for a different outcome without addressing the root cause of the problem why there has been such failure.",
      "Football has changed immeasurably even since when Ferguson was at the helm last. For many years now clubs have invested in putting the right people in the right places behind the scenes to focus on the underlying numbers and data when entering the transfer market. United have flirted with it, but it has never been the identity of the club or a thread that can be pulled through regardless of who is in the hot seat.",
      "A lack of a sporting director has been one of the many things that the Glazers have neglected to address. That is something that Ratcliffe has sought to do immediately, with the man who was key to Brighton & Hove Albion’s successful recruitment policy, Dan Ashworth, likely to arrive from Newcastle United once a deal is agreed. The hiring of one of the men who helped shape Manchester City's transfer strategy, Omar Berrada, as CEO is also a sign of what is to come.",
      "United’s recruitment policy has not moved with the times, and Ten Hag is proof of that.",
      "The Dutchman has leaned towards players that he knows, with three of those coming directly from the Eredivisie and several others having spent time playing in Dutch football’s top tier. It has been a case of the manager largely determining transfer policy, and that, while something that was commonplace some years ago, is no longer the path to success.",
      "Managers come and go, and when such churn occurs it forms a squad of players who were favoured by former bosses that have been foisted on a new one, and so the cycle continues ad nauseum.",
      "At the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London last month, where the MEN were present, data was presented that gave a breakdown of how much spend per minute the biggest clubs had in terms of the output of their squads, and it gave insight into United’s flawed approach.",
      "Transfer spend has long been used as a yardstick for social media to equate ambition. Liverpool’s transfer spend has been considerably lower than their rivals under Fenway Sports Group, and that is largely the biggest gripe of supporters towards the owners on Merseyside. But Manchester United have spent in the transfer market under the Glazers, and the wage bill has risen to huge levels also. The lack of success has continued, however.",
      "The FT data pointed to the clubs that had a defined strategy spending less per minute on their players, largely through better use of data to determine whether or not a player fits into a system as well as how injury-prone they are. In the case of someone like Mohamed Salah, he has rarely had to suffer a spell on the sidelines.",
      "Liverpool, the data showed, £4,524 per minute played, based on share of maximum minutes played by signings since 2015/16. The real successes were Salah, Alisson Becker, and Virgil van Dijk, while the misses were the likes of Naby Keita and Christian Benteke.",
      "Arsenal came in as having a £5,410 per minute played spend, while Manchester City’s stood at £6,927 per minute played. In the case of City, it is worth pointing out that the City strategy is to run with a large squad of world-class players across the positions.",
      "United came in at £7,624 per minute played, the second highest among the ‘Big Six’. The success stories in terms of players featuring, in terms of percentage, were the likes of Andre Onana and Bruno Fernandes, but there were several big-name players where price versus playing time fell well below the 50% mark.",
      "Of those to be below the 50% mark, Donny van de Beek, Antony, Mason Mount, Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Jadon Sancho, and Paul Pogba all featured prominently. Big ticket players who offered little value in relation to how often they found minutes on the pitch.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Chelsea’s £1bn splurge on players since they were taken over by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, has them at a £10,801 per minute played spend, a figure more than double that of the likes of Liverpool, a club they are seeking to chase down and overtake in years to come.",
      "For United, the figures show just why Ratcliffe is so keen to address the wastefulness of the club in the market, and why he wants to waste little time getting the people in place that can help achieve that goal.",

      "All the latest Man United transfer news concerning Marcus Rashford and a potential move to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer",
      "Marcus Rashford has been heavily linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain for a while now. The Manchester United ace first emerged as a target for the French giants a couple of years ago, but an exit from Old Trafford has never materialised.",
      "In the meantime, Rashford has remained a key player for the Red Devils. At just 26, the England international has already featured 393 times for Manchester United, scoring 130 goals and providing 74 assists.",
      "Despite some unimpressive performances this season, Rashford is still widely regarded as one of the most dangerous forwards in Europe and he's continued to court interest from the French capital. So, with that being said, the Manchester Evening News has taken a look at everything you need to know about the forward and a potential switch to PSG.",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of Manchester United's clash against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarterfinal, Erik ten Hag ruled out Rashford's departure. The Dutchman said: \"We did not sign him last season for four years with the intention to sell him now. He should be part of this project. It is not a subject we don't talk about.\"",
      "In July 2023, Rashford signed a new contract which keeps him at Manchester United until 2028. The 26-year-old earns around £325,000 a week, making him one of the club's highest earners.",
      "In December 2022, Nasser Al-Khelaifi admitted that PSG are long admirers of Marcus Rashford. The Parisians' president told Sky Sports News: \"He's another player that is really amazing. And for free?",
      "\"To have Rashford for free, every club would run after him, definitely. We're not hiding it, we spoke before and… interest. But the moment was not a good moment for both sides. Maybe, summer, why not?",
      "\"Today if he's a free agent of course we can talk to him directly but we are not going to talk to him now. Let him focus on the World Cup. Then after in January, hopefully, if we're interested we will talk to him.\"",
      "Back in December 2020, Rashford claimed he can only see himself playing for Manchester United. Upon winning the Sport for Social Change award at British Sports Awards for his campaign against child poverty, the Englishman insisted it 'wouldn't sit right' with him to wear another club's shirt.",
      "\"For me, I never look beyond Manchester United,\" he said. \"As a kid I've never looked beyond Manchester United in my mind, it wouldn't sit right for me to be pulling on another shirt. I just want to do the best I can for the club whilst I'm here, so hopefully I'm here for the long term.\"",
      "Last month he reaffirmed that commitment in an article for The Players Tribune.",
      "\"Listen, I’m not a perfect person. When I make a mistake, I’ll be the first one to put my hand up and say that I need to do better,\" he told The Players' Tribune. \"But if you ever question my commitment to Man United, that’s when I have to speak up. It’s like somebody questioning my entire identity, and everything I stand for as a man. I grew up here. I have played for this club since I was a boy. My family turned down life-changing money when I was a kid so I could wear this badge.\"",
      "He added: \"I promise you, the world has not seen the best of this United squad and these players. We want to be back playing in the Champions League, then we have a massive international tournament at the end of the season. We will be back where we belong. We just have to keep working, and that starts with me.",
      "\"If you back me, good. If you doubt me, even better.\"",
      "With Ten Hag's comments that Rashford 'should be part of this project', the forward may just get the chance to keep his promise of getting United 'back where they belong'.",

      "The huge FA Cup clash tie could be decided by key forwards and the best preparation",
      "Jurgen Klopp believes Manchester United's extra time to prepare for their FA Cup tie means they will present a different challenge for Liverpool.",
      "The two rivals meet on Sunday in a 3.30pm kick-off with the Anfield side coming off the back of a thumping Europa League win over Sparta Prague on Thursday night. United, meanwhile, will have had eight days between games, having beaten Everton 2-0 in their last encounter.",
      "Klopp says that Erik ten Hag's preparations will have been detailed, with extra time to work on a gameplan and the return of key men like Rasmus Hojlund, Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka. However, he believes the return of his own star player, Mo Salah, to form and fitness could be the deciding factor in front of a full house at Old Trafford.",
      "\"We can have 90,000 people, Manchester United, yeah, ask me after it if I enjoy,\" said Klopp. \"We will try to prepare. Again we have a situation where we have played Thursday and we handled it.",
      "\"United have had a full week to prepare. Ten Hag knows how to play so he will line-up some challenges but we have to be ready anyway. As much as it's possible, I enjoy [these games].",
      "\"I don't know much about their season but I saw some good games, a lot of quality and injury problems. Maybe Hojlund is available again? Wan-Bissaka is close. That obviously makes a difference, we will see on Sunday.",
      "\"It was always a tough place to go, it means everything to both fan groups, we know that. We try to show that on the pitch with the work rate but we never know. No guarantees, just opportunities, we will give it a try.\"",
      "For the first time since New Year's Day, Salah was named in the starting line-up on Thursday night for Klopp's side. The Egypt international made his first start since sustaining an injury while away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, having been brought off the bench against Man City on Sunday.",
      "He had an impact in midweek, netting Liverpool's third and playing the full 90 minutes. He now looks set to start against United and Klopp warned he is raring to go.",
      "“Mo is pure quality,” he said. “Ask him what he likes against Manchester United but the more we talk about it the less likely it is going to happen so I don't like to talk too much.",
      "\"An unbelievable player. The boys did well [without him] but it's better to have him around the pitch.",
      "\"Mo is definitely ready [for Sunday]. Konate hasn't trained today, we'll have to see if he can train tomorrow. A tight, tight race that we will probably lose. Bobby Clark has some swelling, Gravenberh trained today so he is ready. Others after the break.\"",

      "Euro 2024 will be the fourth major tournament Southgate has taken charge of as England boss and he is determined to minimise any potential distractions. He said: \"I have to deliver in the job I'm in, so there's no point in me thinking any further ahead than that.",

      "The report claims that Merino has a release clause in his contract, which is set to expire in 2025, worth €60 million (£51 million). It has been speculated that Sociedad are concerned about losing Merino on a free transfer when his contract expires, with United and other teams sending scouts to watch the midfielder in action in recent months.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has grand plans to build a 'Wembley of the north' at Old Trafford but the Man Utd owner is forgetting there are some excellent stadiums in the north, including the one Manchester City play in.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's plea for public funding to help him build a 'stadium for the north' has so far got little reaction from other football clubs in the region, but if it ever threatened to turn into a reality it's not hard to imagine one or two grumbles emerging.",
      "It's been a fairly cynical ploy from Ratcliffe to try and find funding to redevelop Old Trafford and as bold as he's been in trying to describe it as a 'Wembley of the north', the biggest and perhaps only beneficiary of such a project would be Manchester United.",
      "\"The north-west of England has a greater concentration of major football clubs than anywhere else in the world, yet we don’t have a stadium on the scale of Wembley, the Nou Camp or Bernabeu,\" said Ratcliffe last week.",
      "\"We will not be able to change that on our own, which is why this task force is so important to help us seize this once-in-a-century opportunity.\"",
      "Ignoring for a while the fact that in capacity terms, Old Trafford is already that stadium, it's just been neglected by the owners that Ratcliffe has now cosied up with, there is also the debate over whether it is really accurate.",
      "When Everton move into their new Bramley Moore home and when Manchester City's Etihad redevelopment is completed for the start of the 2025/26 season, Manchester and Liverpool will have four football stadiums with a capacity of more than 50,000 and three with a capacity of more than 60,000. Does it need public funding to build another? That is a question that doesn't need answering.",
      "Part of Ratcliffe's pitch is to give the north a stadium that can host a Champions League final or an FA Cup final. But Old Trafford hosted an England international last year and the FA Cup is never leaving Wembley.",
      "As for a Champions League final, the Etihad will be able to offer UEFA what they want before United when it comes to bringing the showpiece game back to Manchester after Old Trafford hosted the penalty shootout success for Juventus back in 2003.",
      "UEFA demands at least a 60,000-capacity stadium for a Champions League final and when City's North Stand redevelopment is complete, it will come in at more than 61,000. It will also be able to offer an on-site hotel and a sizeable fan zone, as well as outstanding transport links to the city centre.",
      "Since 2009 there have been finals held at stadiums offering an attendance of between 60,976 and 65,842 on six occasions - in Rome, Munich, Lisbon, Cardiff, Kyiv and Madrid. The Etihad would fit the bill.",
      "Perhaps the biggest thorn would be City's relations with UEFA, although that is a separate issue. The Etihad would be big enough, modern enough and with enough facilities on-site to host European finals, England games, even FA Cup semi-finals.",
      "There is no doubt United's home ground needs some major investment. That point was made forcefully by City fans when they won 3-0 there in October, with a chant that began with \"Old Trafford is falling down\" now plagiarised by visiting supporters on an almost weekly basis at Old Trafford.",
      "But it's not the case that it can be a flagship stadium for the north. The area already has some outstanding stadiums that are capable of hosting big events. Ratcliffe can glance across town to see that is the case.",

Upon Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival at United, he committed to improving Old Trafford and it was announced this month that the plan is to build a brand-new ground in the vicinity of the current Old Trafford.",

Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, brought to you by Sky Bet, he said: \"I think the Glazers have been negligent in the past 10 years in not appointing the right people.",

They’ve invested in other things that have made money around the ground and invested in the place.",

While a stalemate ensues, Ashworth remains on gardening leave, catching up on Netflix perhaps, or more likely dreaming up the ideas that he believes will take this club back to the top.",
      "You can see why running the football operations at Manchester United would appeal. It doesn't quite feel right to describe United as a sleeping giant, but this is a behemoth of a football club that is significantly underperforming, based on reputation, history, investment and potential. The rewards for those who finally get it right will be golden.",

      "Having held similar roles with West Brom, Brighton and Newcastle, as well as being the technical director at the Football Association, Ashworth's methods aren't entirely a mystery, even if some of his philosophies will have to change when he is in charge of a club of this size. One area he is always keen to focus on is a club's academy and at United it is a rich source of potential.",

For starters, they don't need to be replaced, while Ashworth's view, as laid out in a fascinating interview with the Training Ground Guru in December 2020, when he was at Brighton, is that Premier League clubs should look to youth more and avoid the temptation of using the financial resources they have compared to other European leagues.",
      "\"Of all my roles, the one I’m most passionate about is opening up pathways for young players. Sometimes I've seen clubs work in silos and the academy is working all hours god sends to try and develop players for the first team and the recruitment department is working all hours god sends to try and sign players,\" Ashworth said.",
      "\"In that scenario the recruitment department might be busy looking at a right-back from overseas when there's one right under their noses in the Academy.",
      "\"From a Premier League point of view - and I have been guilty of this - because you have so much money in relation to the majority of the other leagues in the world you can compete for most players in the world. That applies to Brighton too, even though we’re not a top six club.",
      "\"When you are trying to put together a squad that can survive and thrive in the Premier League, the temptation is to go with proven players that are able to come in and are ‘here and now ready.'\"",
      "United's academy will be confident of being able to supply players who can fill gaps in the squad. Willy Kambwala has had first-team experience this season and might be able to fill the role of fourth or fifth-choice centre-back next season, for example.",
      "Finding gems from the academy is even more valuable in an era of strict financial controls. United are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules at the moment, so promoting from within after a sale might be an area they can benefit from this summer.",
      "Ashworth won't be directly in charge of recruitment, but he will overseeing football operations at the club, which essentially means everyone will be reporting into him. He can set the tone for a club that should be focusing on signing star players and then bolstering the squad with the pipeline of talent that Manchester United has always produced.",

      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "Jadon Sancho's time at Man United is coming to an end after his public disagreement with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",

Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",

      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",

Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "The creator and scorer of Manchester United's first goal against Liverpool under Erik ten Hag are both long gone. Anthony Elanga was sold and Jadon Sancho exiled and then loaned.",
      "Marcus Rashford slotted in the winner on that balmy and uproarious evening in August 2022. It was the night of Ten Hag's first win as United manager and Liverpool's first domestic defeat that calendar year.",
      "Ten Hag said on live television afterwards: \"They (the players) can play f-----g football.\". Away from the cameras, he used the same expletive: \"F-----g hell.\" He used the same words nine days earlier when he was reeling from United's generational nadir at Brentford. The words now had a different meaning.",
      "United players were hauled in for training the day after the Brentford debacle and Ten Hag joined them on a punishing 13.8 kilometre run in 30-degree heat. An eyewitness said the players were \"ruined\".",
      "He then decisively settled on four changes to the team: Raphael Varane, Tyrell Malacia, Scott McTominay and Anthony Elanga in for Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Fred and Cristiano Ronaldo. The demotions of captain Maguire and talisman Ronaldo were especially significant. It marked the beginning of the end for Ronaldo at United and Maguire was stripped of the captaincy 11 months later.",
      "Sancho's goal elicited a roar unlike any other this correspondent has heard at Old Trafford. The online footage does not do it justice. One of the United analysts celebrated so wildly he punched a desk and sent a colleague's coffee cup flying.",
      "Casemiro was unveiled on the pitch that night and the £70million signing was an afterthought post-match. United fans taunted Jordan Henderson with a chorus of \"You're just a s--t Casemiro\".",
      "That defeat signalled the start of Liverpool's malaise last season. They return to Old Trafford on Sunday with their aura restored. One cup already sits atop a plinth in the Anfield museum and three more may be required as Jurgen Klopp continues his farewell tour.",
      "Scuppering a City treble, and safeguarding United's 1999 vintage, was an incentive for supporters at last year's FA Cup final. Kiboshing a Klopp quadruple is another in the first cup quarter-final between United and Liverpool.",
      "Ten Hag will not frame it that way. Returning to Wembley with a victory against United's nemesis would do wonders for his approval ratings. A successful season would still be possible with progress to the semi-finals.",
      "The brief exposure Ten Hag granted Toby Collyer, Habeeb Ogunneye and Dermot Mee is set to end as United should have a fuller squad again. Maguire, Mason Mount and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are back in training. Rasmus Hojlund could be before kick-off, too. United will still have 50 hours to assess Hojlund after Ten Hag's 1.15pm press conference ends today, should there still be a doubt over the Dane's fitness.",
      "With Hojlund, United are only two players short of their strongest XI. As much as some pseuds try to complicate football, it is an uncomplicated game. With their striker scoring, United embarked on a five-game winning streak, racking up 15 goals.",
      "Without Hojlund, they have lost two of their past four games and scraped five goals. A defender and a defensive midfielder have scored, Rashford hit the goal of his life at City and there were two penalty conversions against Everton.",
      "Lisandro Martinez, colossal in his breakthrough performance against Liverpool 19 months ago, is a loss. As are Luke Shaw and Jonny Evans, both disciplined in the goalless draw at Anfield in December.",
      "As staid as United were against Everton, the early kick-off time and anodyne opponents had a bearing on the performance. Liverpool at home in the FA Cup quarter-final is not a mere fixture or cup tie but an occasion. The United players have to rise to it.",
      "They did for 70-odd minutes at City the other week. United were compact and diligent against \"the best team in the world\", in the words of Ten Hag. After reticence against City United have to be relentless against Liverpool.",
      "Lose and United will have regressed to two years ago. Ejection from the Champions League by Atletico Madrid was the death knell for their campaign even though they were only three points off fourth place.",
      "The mood was corrosive at the time. A fan turned on technical director Darren Fletcher during United's listless home draw with Everton at the start of April and the month was marred by defeats on the blue and red sides of Stanley Park, as well as at Arsenal.",
      "United's sole win that month against Norwich was overshadowed by protests outside Old Trafford. Inside, Paul Pogba's final appearance at the stadium was soundtracked to 'F--k off Pogba' from the boisterous section of the Stretford End. A Ronaldo hat-trick did not take top billing.",
      "The day after the Atletico loss, this newspaper reported Ten Hag was United's preferred candidate to replace Ralf Rangnick. The March internationals are an ideal time for forward planning and the Ineos power brokers are assessing potential replacements for Ten Hag.",
      "A second United Dutch manager could feasibly finish outside the Premier League top four, lift the FA Cup and leave the club premises. Louis van Gaal barely celebrated United's last FA Cup in 2016 as it belatedly dawned on him he was about to be replaced. Van Gaal's departure was announced just over 48 hours after he paraded the cup in front of journalists in the Wembley press conference room.",
      "There is not an obvious successor waiting to ascend the throne as there was back then. Lose to Liverpool and the red-top headlines have an easy headline: 'Erik ten games' - in the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham and Aston Villa both play this weekend. If Spurs beat Fulham and Villa prevail at West Ham, United will be nine points adrift of fifth, a demeaning but potential route back into the Champions League. Sancho is likelier to be playing in it next season.",

      "After seven years in the French capital, the 25-year-old will leave the club at the end of the season and almost certainly join Real Madrid. He will leave a gaping hole in PSG's attack that they have somehow got to try and fill with a player of similar ilk.",
      "Not for the first time, Manchester United academy graduate Marcus Rashford is being linked with succeeding the French international. Reports elsewhere this week have suggested that PSG are 'preparing' a £75million offer to test United's resolve.",
      "The French club have been long-term admirers of Rashford, holding talks with his brother and agent Dwaine Maynard back in August 2021. PSG, however, never submitted an official offer for the England international. There was suspicion the rendezvous with PSG was a negotiating tactic to put pressure on United to offer Rashford a new contract, which he earned in July last year, keeping him at the club until 2028.",
      "Rashford was worthy of earning a new long-term deal last summer after plundering 30 goals. It was the first time he had reached such landmark in his career and he became the first United player since Robin van Persie a decade earlier to reach such an illustrious figure.",
      "This season, Rashford is running out of time to reach double figures. His penalty in last weekend's 2-0 win over Everton marked just his seventh goal of the campaign in all competitions.",
      "Like so many of his teammates, the 26-year-old has failed to perform at the peak of his powers this season, getting nowhere remotely close to the levels he hit last term. Erik ten Hag, somewhat ambitiously, said at the end of last season he felt Rashford was capable of scoring 40 goals a season.",
      "There is no doubt Rashford is an outstanding talent. His goal in the derby against Manchester City earlier this month was a reminder of his capabilities.",
      "That is why it is hard to make a firm judgement on whether or not United should cash-in this summer in the event of PSG knocking on their door with a lucrative offer. His contract situation means the Reds will be within their rights, as they should, to demand a big-money fee if PSG select him as their top target to replace Mbappe.",
      "However, as much as a big-money cash injection could be useful for United in the event of them missing out on Champions League qualification for next season, Rashford is still a player who has the capabilities to flourish at Old Trafford and continue with his quest to leave a lasting legacy at his boyhood club. Last season demonstrated what he is capable of producing.",
      "As United prepare to embark on a new era under Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos, Rashford should be thinking he can cement himself as one of the players the club can be rebuilt around. He is United through and through and, just like Ratcliffe, will want the very best for the club to enable it to move forward.",
      "At the same time, he is one of the most valuable players in the squad that will command a fee capable of assisting with balancing the books in relation to Financial Fair Play [FFP]. United need to cut their cloth this summer and outgoings are set to be more forthcoming than in previous years.",
      "Looking at Rashford's situation and his role at United in isolation, there is no right or wrong answer. There are huge benefits in keeping him, but there are also arguments to suggest a high profile sale has its pluses, provided United are presented with a good price.",
      "Rashford is better than both Jadon Sancho and Antony, who cost United north of £70m and £80m each respectively, meaning United could demand £100m plus. It could be a hard call to make and only time will tell what the best decision is.",

      "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk is anticipating a \"difficult\" test when he and his teammates travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United in the quarter-final of the FA Cup on Sunday.",
      "After squeezing past Nottingham Forest in the fifth round, United must now get the better of a Liverpool side who are still in with a chance of ending the season with four trophies. The Merseysiders have already scooped the Carabao Cup and are still in the conversation to win the Premier League title and the Europa League, in addition to the FA Cup.",
      "For United, the FA Cup represents their last hope of winning any silverware this season, meaning it is being dubbed as the biggest game of their season so far by some. With their top four hopes fading, winning the FA Cup may represent their only hope of this season being considered a success.",
      "United are unbeaten in two of their three matches against Liverpool under Erik ten Hag, drawing 0-0 at Anfield in the Premier League in December and beating them 2-1 at Old Trafford in the third game of last season, securing the Dutchman his first win as Reds manager. No doubt mindful of those previous meetings, Van Dijk is not underestimating United.",
      "Asked what type of game he is expecting, Van Dijk, as quoted by This Is Anfield, said: \"Intense. Not only the actual game but the whole build-up is a game on its own, but I like to be involved in these types of games.",
      "\"We always have difficult games against them and I expect a difficult one on Sunday as well. They are finding ways to win but I focus on what we have to do against them. It's always difficult, it's always intense.",
      "\"The history of the games with the two biggest clubs in England brings extra expectation and pressure but why not just go out there and enjoy it, play our game and hopefully go to the next round?\"",
      "United set up with a defensive-minded approach when they travelled to Anfield shortly before Christmas, no doubt mindful of the 7-0 drubbing they had experienced on their last visit to the red half of Merseyside. They shut up shop that afternoon, making it difficult for Liverpool to find a way through.",
      "Van Dijk does not believe they will be able to use the same approach on Sunday, adding: \"I think the game here was, I wouldn't say one-sided but we had a lot of the ball. They created a couple of dangerous moments on the break and we have to be aware of that but if they would do it exactly the same when they play at home, I have no idea.",
      "\"We have to focus on our game and make it as difficult as possible, press them as high as we want and play our football and hopefully we can get through.\"",

      "Manchester United prodigy Kobbie Mainoo is set to miss out on being handed his first senior call-up to the England national team this month, according to reports.",

      "Randy Abbey, a member of the Ghana FA, has previously gone on record to declare the nation's hopes of persuading Mainoo to represent them. \"The Ghana Football Association is interested in monitoring, attracting, and persuading all eligible talents for its various national teams,\" he told The Times.",

      "Man United manager Erik ten Hag could be forced into a really difficult selection decision in the FA Cup against Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "For all of Manchester United's injury problems this season, Diogo Dalot has been an almost ever-present figure for manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The Portuguese international has featured in all but two of United's 39 matches in all competitions so far this season, only failing to make the matchday squad once. That was as a result of a red card he received in the dying stages of December's goalless draw with Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "With the exception of the 2-0 defeat to West Ham United that followed the aforementioned stalemate with Liverpool, Dalot's name has always been visible on the teamsheet, either as a starter or as a substitute. Even when he has been named on the bench, he has only failed to step off it once - the opening weekend win over Wolves at Old Trafford in August.",
      "Dalot was beaten to the right-back spot against the Black Country outfit after Aaron Wan-Bissaka won the battle between the duo in pre-season. The duo fought tirelessly in the second half of last season and during pre-season to become Ten Hag's first-choice right-back.",
      "After Wan-Bissaka got the nod at the start of the season, Dalot soon reclaimed top spot in the pecking order. The former AC Milan loanee has, perhaps subtly, has been one of United's best players this season, often proving reliable and consistent without generating too much attention outside of those who do not watch the Reds religiously.",
      "Since January, a juncture which marked an admission to the treatment room for Wan-Bissaka, Dalot has made the right-back spot his own, producing a series of consistent performances that have been worthy of sevens or eights of ten. As a result, he has made the right-back spot his own, meaning United, when it comes to settling on future plans, may offload Wan-Bissaka to accommodate the addition of a new right-back.",
      "Wan-Bissaka has missed each of United's last nine matches, meaning Dalot has had a free run at right-back. He has not failed to disappoint, churning out consistent, solid performances. As per FotMob, Dalot's ratings have been consistent, earning a player rating north of seven in five of his last seven games, including a score of 8.3 in the 2-1 win at Aston Villa last month, where he provided the assist for Scott McTominay's late winner.",
      "His consistency at right-back, however, could be derailed against Liverpool this weekend. Wan-Bissaka is in contention to feature in the FA Cup quarter-final clash, meaning could be recalled to the starting line-up, forcing Dalot to switch to left-back.",
      "As a result of Luke Shaw's and Tyrell Malacia's ongoing absences, United are currently without a senior left-back, meaning Victor Lindelof and Sofyan Amrabat have deputised in recent weeks. Had Wan-Bissaka been fit, Dalot would have almost certainly picked up the baton from Shaw.",
      "Now that Wan-Bissaka is poised to make his comeback, it is very much possible that Dalot will fill the vacancy that Shaw has vacated. The Portuguese ace has played at left-back several times under Ten Hag, often carrying out the duty with minimal fuss. As per Transfermarkt, he has played on the left of the back-four eight times already this season.",
      "Despite not being left-footed, Dalot can provide more balance at left-back than Lindelof has, such is the way he is more equipped to make forward runs and support the attacking play. He has also scored from the left-back berth this season, albeit against League One side Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup.",
      "Dalot has previously admitted he is only too happy to play at left-back, meaning he is unlikely to kick up a fuss if Ten Hag requires him to switch flanks this weekend. He has earned the right to be trusted by Ten Hag after a string of impressive performances under his watch.",
      "Alternatively, Wan-Bissaka could also play at left-back, though that feels a lot less likely. The former Crystal Palace man started on the left in his last appearance, which was the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in January, and that was his very first time in that position in United colours.",
      "Given the calibre of the opposition United are up against this weekend, and Dalot's experience at left-back, he is far more likely to get the nod, provided Wan-Bissaka is fit enough to start at right-back. Should that come to fruition, United's back-four could have the most balanced look to it has had since Shaw was reassigned to the treatment room.",

      "Giggs is one of the co-owners of the League Two club, and recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Class of 92's takeover. PA news agency reports he took over the role of director of football this year, following Nicky Butt, who became Salford's chief executive in October after replacing fellow co-owner Gary Neville.",
      "This is Giggs' first role back in football after leaving his post as Wales manager in June 2022 due to an impending court hearing. After being cleared of accusations of domestic violence brought forward by an ex-partner last July, a source close to Giggs said that he had \"unfinished business in the game\".",

      "\"He has remained upbeat and positive throughout his rehabilitation,\" the United website cheerfully communicated. \"A diligent professional, Mount has worked closely with the club’s medical staff and displayed a work ethic that helped him to become one of the most decorated young players in the game.",
      "\"The England international’s return to fitness will bring great energy to the squad and the former Champions League winner cannot wait to get started again.\" United are playing all the hits. Whenever Mount returns, he needs to hit the ground running.",
      "READ MORE:Garnacho stats show Ronaldo chant isn't all he will inherit at United",

      "Seven starts, five substitute appearances, one 90-minute outing, no goals and one assist. That goal contribution was in the League Cup against Crystal Palace, happy to hit the eject button themselves.",
      "Mount lasted six starts in central midfield before he was relocated to the right-hand side. That stint against Brentford was even shorter: 63 minutes.",
      "Whenever Mount has started in the Premier League, he has made way with United drawing or losing. His last league start was against Brentford on October 7. Mount may assume the benchwarming role he was downgraded to in the autumn in the spring.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has usurped him, Bruno Fernandes is the captain, Alejandro Garnacho the new poster boy and Rasmus Hojlund the focal point. Casemiro complements Mainoo and Marcus Rashford is scoring again.",
      "Mount and United felt a mismatch before he kicked a ball for the club and he is effectively on trial. A source close to one of the United players claimed Mount's move to the club was not for football reasons. Mount has not spoken outside of his in-house media obligations when he joined United and it has been impossible to get a handle on how the boyhood Portsmouth fan and Chelsea-bred southerner has adapted to life in the north.",
      "United staff said Mount was sensitive about his Chelsea departure, hence the unwillingness to speak beyond their own channels. Chelsea fans subjected Mount to a caustic chant that refers to him as a \"t--t\" and a \"money-grabbing w---e\" during United's win at Old Trafford in December. Mount is poised to be available for the reverse fixture on April 4.",
      "John Terry, a dyed-in-the-wool blue, urged Chelsea fans to be understanding of Mount's move. \"There's another side to the story,\" Terry said. \"Let's not be too harsh on him when he comes back.\"",
      "Surreally for Mount, he could sit in the same dugout back at Chelsea. Mauricio Pochettino, like Erik ten Hag, has switched the home and away dugouts at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Mount had been on the pitch for less than two minutes against Fulham in November and his first attempted pass failed to find Garnacho. It warranted a rebuke and Garnacho smacked his thighs in frustration. Fernandes, usually the first to berate a teammate, applauded Mount's intent and offered a thumbs up.",
      "The perception of Mount is partly beyond his control. United parted with £55million up front for a player into the last year of his contract and he has already missed five months of this season.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal were both interested in Mount. Jurgen Klopp touched base with him in January last year and Mikel Arteta was reputedly telling confidants a deal was all but done. United are adamant they saved £10m on Mount.",
      "Handing Mount the number seven may have seemed minor but the curse has afflicted him as well. Angel Di Maria, Alexis Sanchez and Memphis Depay had better starts with the number affixed to their back.",
      "Antonio Valencia requested to revert to his previous squad number of 25 after a season as the '7' in 2012-13. He spent six more years at the club and was installed as captain in 2018. The modest Mount should consider switching to an alternative. Raphael Varane could vacate the '19' - Mount's number at Chelsea - if he is released.",
      "Mount stopped to speak to England assistant manager Steve Holland at the weekend. He has not played for the national team since their World Cup quarter-final defeat to France in December 2022 and a recall for the European Championship is improbable.",
      "Brailsford made a beeline for Hojlund in the directors' box last month and embraced him. Mount will hope for a similar greeting soon.",

Though they have not put a specific date on a potential return, manager Erik ten Hag last week pinpointed the clash with Brentford on March 30 as his comeback date.",

      "Despite often being renowned as an attacking-midfielder, Mount has admitted since joining United that he is more comfortable playing as a No.8, dictating proceedings from deep. Eriksen played the same role last season.",
      "It was obvious that Ten Hag wanted Mount to conduct the same task, playing alongside Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in a three-man midfield. However, Kobbie Mainoo, has established himself as United's main No.8, offering a blend of both defensive nous and forward-thinking passing.",
      "Saturday's 2-0 win over Everton marked the 18-year-old's 12th successive Premier League start and it is impossible to imagine him being dislodged from Ten Hag's first-choice starting XI anytime soon. He has stepped up and provided United with the composure on the ball more senior figures have failed to offer.",
      "Mount's impending return from injury means Mainoo could be impacted, but it's Casemiro who could be out of the XI. He was poor against Everton, frequently giving the ball away, and his regression this season means United will almost certainly have to shop for a replacement in the summer.",
      "Yet there is an argument for Mainoo to drop into the No.6 position. He has played as the sole defensive-midfielder at times this season and done well, providing the control and possession qualities Ten Hag wants from his midfielders.",
      "As far as his defensive capabilities are concerned, Mainoo has averaged 0.9 interceptions per 90 in the Premier League so far this term, in addition to 1.7 tackles per 90 and 3.3 ball recoveries per 90. Casemiro, by contrast, has averaged 0.7 interceptions per 90, 3.3 tackles per 90 and 4.9 ball recoveries per 90 in 15 Premier League games.",
      "In matches United head into as favourites, Ten Hag could experiment with Mainoo and Mount behind Fernandes with one eye on the future. It's something United need to look at in the long-term and it could provide short term benefits.",

      "It doesn't take much to get the blood boiling between Manchester United and Manchester City fans, with the latest issue causing contention coming after Sir Jim Ratcliffe's bold vision for Old Trafford.",
      "After purchasing a minority stake in United, Ratcliffe has a clear plan to turn their fortunes around, quickly identifying Old Trafford as in need of urgent redevelopment - or even a completely new rebuild. As City fans take great delight in signing, 'Old Trafford is falling down'.",
      "Redeveloping the 75,000-seater stadium has its complications. The infrastructure is old, and the trainline behind the main stand makes any expansion on the smaller of the four sides logistically difficult as well as very expensive. With the other three sides towering above it, that is the only realistic room to increase capacity.",
      "So that leaves a new build, likely next door to the current stadium on club land. Trafford Council have intentions to redevelop the area, and there is space for a modern, state of the art 80-90,000 seater stadium - but that comes with significant costs of its own.",
      "Ratcliffe is appealing to build a stadium that can be the 'Wembley of the North', able to hold FA Cup and UEFA Champions League finals. He is seeking some form of public funds to assist in building the potential new home for United, with a taskforce set up to investigate all options including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham.",
      "The notion of using public money to build a football stadium has been met with predictable scepticism from critics and in response, United fans are drawing comparisons to the deal that saw City move into the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003, which is owned by the council. City pay rent to the council, and there was public money used to convert the stadium from an athletics arena for the Commonwealth Games to a football-only stadium.",

      "\"The Glazers are just about the last people politicians are going to aid. That ship has definitely sailed. One in the Midlands or North East perhaps but another in the North West, especially for United, was never an option and I really don't understand why Ratcliffe even bothered mentioning it. It's up to Ineos and the Glazers to cough up else they will just attract further ridicule. Thats why on the face of it Sheikh Jassim's bid was preferable (albeit he had not verified that he did have the funding).\"",
      "City Blue thru n thru said: \"The [CO-op Live] Arena next door would have some pull for the Etihad area too. Ratcliffe is proposing this for another reason. At 71, it's his race against time to stamp his mark on the Salford area before he can't.",
      "\"There would be uproar from taxpayer's like me if the government offered financial support. The financial status of the nation is in a dreadful state from amateurish and self interest management by successive governments and councils over three decades so he must be deluded if he thinks the people will accept his request, not that I think we will have any say on the matter. We never do.\"",

It is also worth noting that many of those appointed to the panel are leaders of the organisations that United will need support from to get this project off the ground.",
      "A statement released by the CEO of the foundation, Kaushik Mistry, read: \"As CEO of an Anti-Racism organisation, I am disappointed but ultimately not surprised that a 'Task Force' has only white people appointed to it. Structurally and institutionally racist from its implementation.",

      "\"We want to hear from the full range of voices and perspectives as we build a shared plan to deliver those objectives.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe branded Newcastle \"silly\", \"stupid\" and \"absurd\" for reputedly demanding a fee as much as £20million for Ashworth. United sources said last month they would not pay £10m to recruit the 53-year-old.",
      "Although Ashworth's move from Brighton to Newcastle in 2022 was widely reported as £4m, a well-placed source said Newcastle paid \"significantly less\" than that figure for the former FA director of elite development.",
      "United do not believe it is realistic for Newcastle to demand an eight-figure fee for a member of staff who joined the club less than two years ago.",
      "\"I think Dan Ashworth is clearly one of the top sporting directors in the world, I've no doubt,\" Ratcliffe said last month. \"He's a very capable person. He's interested in the Manchester United job because it's probably the biggest sporting director job in the world just now, with the biggest challenge.",

I think he would be a very good addition to Manchester United but he needs to decide whether he's going to make that jump.",
      "\"We've obviously had words with Newcastle. They would clearly be disappointed to lose Dan. Newcastle have been very, very successful, they've done really well since the new ownership, they play some good football and it's transformed the club. I understand why they would be disappointed to lose Dan.",

      "Christian Eriksen has seen a sharp reduction in minutes at Man United this calendar year, playing only twice.",
      "Denmark head coach Kasper Hjulmand has admitted that Christian Eriksen's rapid reduction in game time at Manchester United is 'not the best situation' as the Danes prepare to step up their European Championship preparations.",
      "The 32-year-old, who joined United in July 2022, has featured in just one of the Reds' last seven Premier League matches, once again failing to make it off the bench against Everton on Saturday. He has made just two appearances in all competitions in 2024.",
      "Despite that, Eriksen, who last started for United on January 14, facing former club Tottenham Hotspur, has been included in the Denmark squad for their upcoming friendlies against Switzerland and the Faroe Islands later this month. Fellow United ace Rasmus Hojlund has also made the cut.",
      "Eriksen is still widely considered to be Denmark's star man and will be key to their hopes of enjoying a successful Euro 2024 campaign in Germany this summer. However, Hjulmand has admitted that his reduction in minutes at Old Trafford is not an ideal situation for the midfielder.",
      "\"It's not the best situation as it is right now,\" Hjulmand told Tipsbladet. \"I really, really hope that changes. I'm pretty sure we'll see a fit Christian. I know he is.",
      "\"But of course, if it continues, it can become like it is with everyone else for Christian. There can be a concern about the level one can perform at if they don't get more playing time than what it is currently.",
      "\"I really hope it changes. A player as talented as Christian needs to play, and we certainly hope it changes at United. But it's not the best situation not to have played more.\"",
      "Eriksen, who played a key role in United's third-place finish in the Premier League last term, has played 20 times so far this season, scoring one goal. Kobbie Mainoo has leapfrogged him in the pecking order and Mason Mount's impending return from injury could limit his opportunities even further.",

      "It was certainly a boost to see the 25-year-old back in training on Tuesday morning, but his return will strengthen the squad rather than the starting line-up.",
      "Mount has managed just four Premier League starts, with a further four substitute appearances this season. He has no goals or assists to his name. Regardless of his injury situation, it is simply not good enough.",
      "Erik ten Hag identified Mount as his top midfield target last summer, but even then, the £55million fee seemed excessive for a player who would have been available on a free this summer.",

      "LATEST NEWS: Amad clarifies transfer 'hint' as fresh Sheikh Jassim takeover claim made",
      "His prolonged injury absence has certainly made it look like an even worse deal, but irrespective of handy hindsight, he never had an obvious role to fill for this United side.",
      "Mount was at his best in a Chelsea shirt when operating as a No.10, the role monopolised by club captain Bruno Fernandes, and also played well as a makeshift right winger in games when they relied heavily on the counter-attack.",
      "It means a starting role was only likely in exceptional circumstances this season, and during his injury absence, the problems have piled up for Mount as well.",
      "Ten Hag had identified Mount as a candidate for the link role in midfield, tasked with connecting defence with attack and progressive play in the heart of the pitch.",
      "There was a train of thought that it could complement Mount's skillset very well. The problem for him is that Kobbie Mainoo has been doing that to an exceptional standard and is only getting better the more he plays.",
      "Mount has also been done no favours by Alejandro Garnacho's impressive development this season, particularly his recent success on the right wing.",
      "It still remains to be seen which position Garnacho will specialise in as his career continues, but for the foreseeable future, he will occupy the other position Mount was signed to play in.",
      "There is still a hypothetical argument that Mount could play alongside Mainoo as a midfield axis, or that Fernandes could even do so, with the former Chelsea man in the more advanced role. However, this still feels rather fanciful, given how open and exposed their midfield has been so far this season.",
      "It could well be an option in certain matches going forward, though given the obvious defensive concerns, it would most likely be an option they turn to in-game rather than set out to play from the start.",
      "This all leaves Mount in a rather uncertain situation as he prepares to make his long-awaited return to the United side. He is not expected to be involved against Liverpool this weekend but could feature for the trip to Brentford following the international break.",
      "Whether he features on the pitch or not remains to be seen. As does where he would play.",

Anthony Martial is currently recovering from a groin operation he had in January. Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes have both deputised in the centre of attack and Ten Hag has been forced into reshuffling his forward line on several occasions.",

      "Man United released their latest set of financial figures on Tuesday and it contained some good news as far as the reporting period was concerned.",
      "The Champions League is mentioned three times in the latest financial results released by Manchester United on Tuesday and it doesn't take long to realise the effect that Europe's premier club competition has on the balance sheet.",
      "These results cover the three months until December 31, 2023, when United were back in the group stage of the Champions League, having spent the same period last year in the anonymity of the Europa League groups. There is, of course, no mention of how they actually got on.",
      "These second-quarter results for this financial year are a paint-by-numbers exercise in detailing the value of Champions League football to a club like United. You won't need reminding that Erik ten Hag's side finished bottom of a group they should have made light work of.",
      "The three-monthly fiscal figures to follow later in the season might give us more detail on what crashing out of Europe entirely in December did to United's finances. The net profit of £20.4million they posted in these figures has eased concerns about failing to comply with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules, but it is the six months that will follow that will really hurt, with no European games at Old Trafford and no revenue from the Champions League or the Europa League.",
      "United's tight compliance with the Premier League's FFP rules was already likely to put a dent in this summer's transfer budget, but a full season outside of the Champions League could be even more damaging. In the report detailing these results, a significant uptick in broadcast and matchday revenue is put down \"primarily\" to the participation in the Champions League.",
      "On broadcasting revenue, it says: \"Broadcasting revenue for the quarter was £106.4 million, an increase of £47.6 million, or 81%, over the prior year quarter, primarily due to the men’s first team participating in the UEFA Champions League compared to the UEFA Europa League in the prior year.\"",
      "On matchday revenue, it says: \"Matchday revenue for the quarter was £47.6 million, an increase of £17.7 million, or 59.2%, over the prior year quarter, primarily due to playing two more home games in the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter and the men’s first team participating in the UEFA Champions League rather than the UEFA Europa League.\"",
      "Purely in terms of broadcast and matchday revenue, that is a £65.3million difference between the Champions League and the Europa League group stages. Add in a deep run in the competition and the significant difference in prize money and it's clear there is around a £100million dip in revenues for clubs who fail to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "That is the reality facing United at the moment. The win against Everton at the weekend kept their Champions League hopes alive and they are now eight points behind Aston Villa in fourth and six behind Tottenham in fifth, who have a game in hand.",
      "Ten Hag might need to close that gap over the final 10 games to keep himself in employment next season, but just as crucially Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be hoping that the club he now owns 25% of can somehow secure a return to the Champions League.",
      "At a time when a significant squad overhaul is required, missing out on Champions League revenue would be disastrous. Just how disastrous was made clear on Tuesday.",

      "There has been a changing of the guard on the Man United wing in the past couple of years and Alejandro Garnacho has assumed Cristiano Ronaldo's mantle.",
      "The word from Manchester United is Alejandro Garnacho is still nervous around the media. He did not look it when he conducted a post-match interview on the pitch on Saturday.",
      "Garnacho ended it by clutching the man of the match award, turning to the Stretford End and raising his hands to milk the acclaim of the crowd. He has been doing that for nearly two years.",
      "The Stretford End sang \"Viva Garnacho\" as United celebrated their FA Youth Cup triumph in May 2022. Cristiano Ronaldo was approaching the beginning of the end of his homecoming at United and the chant signalled a gradual changing of the guard.",
      "In the Old Trafford dressing room before the final against Nottingham Forest, a motivational message Ronaldo had recorded was played to the United youngsters. With the game deadlocked at 1-1, the 17-year-old Garnacho made it 2-1 and he killed the contest with a second goal.",
      "Hours before it emerged Ronaldo had conducted an unauthorised and incendiary interview with Talk TV, Garnacho cutely prodded in an added-time winner at Fulham in November 2022. It was at the same Putney End nearly 16 years earlier that Ronaldo secured a memorable victory.",
      "The parallels between the Iberians continue. As Ronaldo's old chant goes, Garnacho can play on the left and play on the right. He made Everton's defenders look \"s---e\" by procuring two penalties. Four Fulham players were booked for fouling Garnacho a fortnight earlier.",
      "Like a teenage Ronaldo, the 19-year-old Garnacho is poised to plant the Sir Matt Busby statue on display in his lounge. He has started in the past 25 United matches and avoided injury all season. Ronaldo earned 40 starts in his second season in Manchester and Garnacho could come in just short of that with 38.",
      "Garnacho has the character to match the quality. He never recovered from botching a breakaway on his first derby start at the Etihad, where he was tepid in the 3-1 loss. Six days later, he was United's de facto matchwinner against Everton.",
      "Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni dropped Garnacho in November, citing his form. In the first match after the internationals, Garnacho executed a bicycle kick to trump Wayne Rooney's. A recall beckons for the friendlies against El Salvador and Costa Rica later this month.",
      "A right-footed left winger was not a pressing area to target in 2020 but Garnacho has seen off Jadon Sancho, Anthony Elanga and Anthony Martial. He has done Marcus Rashford a favour by hitting the ground running on the right flank, where Garnacho has started in nine of the past 13 games.",
      "Garnacho's development at United is ahead of Ronaldo's as a teenager. The longest run a teenage Ronaldo had as a starter for United was eight games and the last fell on his 20th birthday against Birmingham City in February 2005. United have a minimum 11 games left this term and Garnacho is destined to start in all of them, provided he remains fit.",
      "He has played 73 times for United. Coincidentally, that is the same number of appearances Ronaldo managed as a teenager. Garnacho is on 12 goals and Ronaldo had 10, his tally boosted by an unforgettable double in United's last-ever victory at Highbury four days before his 20th birthday.",
      "One of the curious criticisms of Ronaldo during his early years at United was he struggled against the elite. Before his Highbury heroics, his coming-of-age came against the Arsenal 'invincibles' United vanquished in an uproarious FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park in 2004.",
      "David Walsh wrote in The Sunday Times: \"Ronaldo, especially, was terrific. He has pace, blinding skill and a precious ability to go past players.\"",
      "“Fantastic performance,” Sir Alex Ferguson beamed afterwards. “The boy is a marvellous player.\"",
      "Garnacho's Kryptonite is clear goalscoring opportunities and he wasted two more against Everton either side of the interval. That is forgivable at 19. Ronaldo hit the woodwork a luckless number of times before he developed into a prolific goalscorer and Garnacho's profligacy has seldom cost United. West Ham away two days before Christmas is the exception.",
      "Garnacho was on target in the Elland Road and Istanbul bear pits, he sparked the comeback against Aston Villa on Boxing Day and he already has two Fergie Time winners two his name. His dozen goals consist of winners, clinchers and equalisers.",
      "Ronaldo, at 19, had a starring role in the one-sided 2004 FA Cup final. He was initially more prolific for Portugal, his debut coming four days after his captivating bow for United against Bolton. Ronaldo started in five of Portugal's seven duels during the 2004 European Championship on home soil.",
      "Ronaldo already had a developmental season at Sporting Lisbon when he entered a dressing room of champions with personalities as forceful as Roy Keane, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville. Garnacho had Martial staring him down, vainly attempting to keep him in his lane.",
      "So at 19, the wingers whose United careers began 19 years apart have won a domestic cup in their first season and have the '7' affixed to their shirt. Erik ten Hag considered upgrading Garnacho to that number in the summer and the Argentinian deserves the seven outright next season.",
      "One suspects Garnacho would not be nervous about inheriting it.",

      "Erik ten Hag has handed debuts to Charlie McNeill, Kobbie Mainoo, Dan Gore, Willy Kambwala and Omari Forson during his time as manager and Mainoo is now a regular starter.",
      "Mantato can play at left-back and on the right wing, and his style has led to comparisons with Arsenal's Bukayo Saka, who started his career as a defender before moving forward.",
      "Youngsters from the academy have been visible in a number of first-team training sessions this season and they are included in sessions when extra numbers are required.",
      "The opportunity to train with senior players is considered an important part of their development and Mantato, 16, Harry Amass, 16, and Amir Ibragimov, 15, have taken part in first-team sessions over the last 18 months despite being at such an early stage of their careers.",
      "Mantato joined United's academy aged nine and has represented England in the youth system. He recently made his debut for the Three Lions' Under-16s team.",
      "He has made seven appearances for United's Under-18s this season and he's contributed a goal and two assists, while he also made an appearance in the UEFA Youth League. Mantato made his debut for the U18s in 2022 when he was just 14 years old.",

      "Whilst the club may be chasing down their rivals in order to secure a spot in next season's Champions League, the United manager's vision to build upon a base of young talent has come into fruition in recent months.",
      "Whereas last year success was heavily aided by the likes of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen - both signed in Ten Hag's first summer at the club - with existing members of the squad such as David de Gea and Raphael Varane, in the 2023/24 campaign Old Trafford has witnessed the changing of the guard.",
      "Whether signed from other clubs or growing them through the club's own academy, plenty of young players have been given their opportunity under the Dutchman. With the Premier League top four within reach, Ten Hag is excited not only for the coming months but for the long-term future of United as well.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, the Dutchman was asked about the anticipation surrounding Mainoo in particular.",
      "\"I think it is in the DNA of Manchester United that young players come through,\" he replied. \"I think about the Busby Babes, the Class of '92, and also we've worked hard to get this generation built in an environment that they are really competitive every day, to bring them through and when they get an opportunity to take them.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo is one of them. We, as Manchester United coaches, are very happy that a player of his skills is coming through.",
      "\"We have more young players like Garnacho, like Hojlund, like Omari Forson, like [Amad] Diallo. Antony is also young,\" the 54-year-old added.",
      "\"We have many good, young players and we have to develop their skillset, being in the team feeling a stronger connection with Manchester United, a real winning attitude. That is a base to winning trophies.\"",
      "Of the names mentioned, winger Garnarcho (1605 minutes), striker Hojlund (1473 minutes) - who is currently injured - and midfielder Mainoo (953 minutes) have played the largest part in United's current Premier League campaign.",
      "Antony (931 minutes) has also been involved though has only made 11 starts this season, coming under fire for his performances.",
      "19-year-old Forson has broken into Ten Hag's plans after rising through the club's Under-18 and Under-21 ranks, whilst finally Amad has been hampered from injury in what was meant to be his true breakout campaign at Old Trafford.",

      "Man United Women's boss Marc Skinner has yet to meet the Ineos chief but hopes his arrival could help propel the club to success",
      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner hopes the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be a \"springboard\" for the club's success but says he hasn't yet had the chance to meet the INEOS chief.",
      "Ratcliffe's purchase of a 27.7 per cent stake in United was officially completed last month and he has since outlined his ambitions to restore the Reds to their former glory. Speaking to the media last week, the 71-year-old did not go into any great detail about his plans for the women's team, but admitted, “if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.”",
      "It is a sentiment that was echoed by Skinner in his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, with the United boss fully aware the next few months will be hugely decisive in deciding his own future at the club. “We (he and Ratcliffe) have not managed to meet yet, I know it’s on the horizon very soon,” he said ahead of this weekend's trip to West Ham United.",
      "“But we have our constant kind of feed through our bosses anyway in terms of kind of how we want to go forwards, what’s going to work and there’s a lot to do. I see it as a real positive move. I think if you know me as a character, my energy is full in, I’m all in, so with my energy, coupled with the fantastic movement of the INEOS investment, I think it’s a real positive moment.",
      "“We have to capitalise on that, we’re going to try to do that, we’re going to put all our behaviours in place for that. It’s hopefully a springboard for everybody to find the success that everybody wants for Man United.”",
      "Ratcliffe first met Erik ten Hag nearly a year ago, while the pair were pictured together at Carrington in January following the completion of the Ineos chief's investment. Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos sporting director, is currently conducting an extensive audit of all levels at the club and has stepped away from his work with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team to concentrate on this task.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first orders of business as part-owner is to decide the best course of action for Old Trafford, with the fanbase currently divided on whether the iconic venue should be renovated or replaced with a brand new stadium. The INEOS boss suggested last week that, should the men's team relocate, Old Trafford could be used to house both the women's and academy teams, who currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village.",
      "But Skinner admitted such a move is unlikely to happen in the near future. “I’m sure that’s a little bit away,” he said. “We love playing at Leigh Sports Village, it’s become a fortress but obviously it’s a special occasion when you play at Old Trafford.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“We’re excited about any of the plans that come. It feels like a real positive movement. Whatever the plans may be, we have to continue to align our positive energy towards that movement. That’s our aim. If it comes down the line and that’s what happens, then I’m sure there will be some fantastic games at the stadium.”",
      "Skinner, who joined the Reds from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer and has been under scrutiny this term following a string of disappointing results. United, who finished second in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season and reached the FA Cup final, are currently in fourth place, seven points off a European spot.",
      "However, they will hope to return to winning ways when they travel to the Chigwell Construction Stadium to take on 10th-place West Ham on Sunday.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a number of issues to resolve at Old Trafford for both the Men's and Women's sides, and Marc Skinner's team must not be left behind",
      "As the final whistle blew at an overcast Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, Erik ten Hag cut the figure of a man well-acquainted with the potential repercussions of Manchester United’s 10th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Head down, hands in pockets, the Dutchman headed for the tunnel, stopping briefly to offer a customary, consolatory round of applause for the supporters that remained inside the stadium. He wore an air of dejection that mirrored the despondency his counterpart, Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner, had exuded during his own commiseratory lap around the pitch at the Emirates Stadium just seven days prior.",
      "In north London, Skinner's side had been thoroughly beaten by title-chasing Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL), their hopes of European qualification this term left hanging precariously in the balance. \"I'm here to try and win for Manchester United and to continue to grow the team that's needed to win for Manchester United and I think that's really important,\" Skinner insisted after the game. It was a defiant, determined sentiment not too dissimilar to the one evoked by Ten Hag after Saturday's defeat to Fulham.",
      "\"When we get the injuries back we will be more in balance in the team,\" the Dutchman said. \"We also need to strengthen the squad in the transfer windows and then there are many good players, with high potential coming up. Definitely we are going in the right direction. So when everyone is available we have a very good team.\"",
      "In their respective post-match assessments, both Skinner and Ten Hag seemed to allude to a Manchester United of the future, to two projects still in their infancy and two teams that require patience and time to ensure their potential is fully realised. But, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now officially installed as the club’s part-owner, time does not appear to be the friend of either manager.",
      "Speaking to the media last week, Ratcliffe remained non-committal on Ten Hag’s future, telling reporters: “I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that.” It was not exactly a ringing endorsement of the Dutchman who, despite insisting he “doesn’t care” about the growing noise surrounding his United future, will be fully aware of the significance of the coming months and how they might shape the trajectory of his Old Trafford career.",
      "While Ten Hag was also keen to highlight he remains under contract at the club until 2025, Skinner does not have that same luxury. The 40-year-old, who joined United from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer.",
      "And though it is understood he is not in immediate danger of losing his job, it is clear the women’s team, too, is at a crossroads as Ratcliffe and co. seek to restore United to a footballing superpower. The INEOS chief did not go into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during his hour-long discussion with the press last week, but it is clear he harbours ambitions of the Reds one day earning a seat at Europe’s top table.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“The only thing I would say,” he told those in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, “is that if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.” It’s worth noting there has already been confirmation of one prominent departure on the Women’s side of operations, with head of Women’s football Polly Bancroft set to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town at the end of the current season.",
      "Bancroft was brought in from Brighton & Hove Albion, where she worked as general manager, in October 2022. In her newly-created role at United, Bancroft was tasked with implementing a cohesive strategy for the Women’s first team and academy, overseeing both day-to-day operations and long-term performance.",
      "But, though there have been some successes - chiefly her facilitating of a move to a new state-of-the-art training facility at Carrington - the past 16 months have not always been easy for Bancroft. She was, of course, charged with helping tie down first team stars Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new contracts last term.",
      "And, while she was by no means the only figure involved in the handling of those negotiations, the fact Russo and Batlle both left the club last summer - for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively - was viewed in some quarters as a damning indictment of her abilities. Certainly, United will be aware they run the risk of losing yet another of their big names on a free transfer this summer, with goalkeeper Mary Earps also out of contract in June.",
      "The England shot-stopper - who has been voted best goalkeeper in the world for two consecutive years - was the subject of a world-record bid from Arsenal last summer. As they did when the Gunners came calling for Russo in January 2023, United refused to sanction Earps’ exit, though there is every chance she joins her Lionesses teammate in north London in a few months' time, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona also being touted as other possible destinations for the 30-year-old.",
      "Then there are other behind-the-scenes matters to address, with United Women still in the market for a permanent head physio after the former incumbent Ibrahim Kerem moved over to Ten Hag’s side in November. There is also a growing sense the departure of Martin Ho, Skinner’s assistant, last summer has had a detrimental effect on the Women’s team's recent form.",
      "Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner on a two-year deal in July, guiding them to the group stages of the Women’s Champions League and thus making them the first Norwegian outfit in history to achieve that particular feat. And while there is an element of uncertainty about the futures of a number of key United personnel, recent discourse over the future of Old Trafford has also raised questions about the long-term home of the Women’s team.",
      "Skinner’s side currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village though, with Ratcliffe stating a preference to build a new industry-leading stadium for the men’s team, there seems to be scope for United Women to one day relocate to the club’s spiritual home. “If you use that as a centre of regeneration, a bit like the Olympic Village, then I think what you probably finish up doing is Old Trafford would finish up being reduced in size - in the same footprint but a smaller facility - which can be used for all sorts of community things, be it a concert or whatever,\" Ratcliffe said last week.",
      "\"The ladies teams could play there. The academy teams could play there. Some of the local teams could play there and Old Trafford could sort of become a community asset and then you'd have this world-class stadium next door to it.”",
      "With the 71-year-old's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in United having only been officially ratified by the Premier League and the FA earlier this month, it is clear that only time will bring clarity on several of the club’s myriad unresolved issues. However, with Skinner’s side having so far fallen short in their quest for domestic and European success this term, it is imperative the Women’s team is not left behind as United seek to emerge into Ratcliffe's brave new world.",

      "Manchester United were beaten 3-1 by Arsenal in the Women's Super League at a sold-old Emirates Stadium in what could prove to be a huge blow to the Reds' Champions League hopes",
      "If last season's triumph at the Emirates was evidence of Manchester United's burgeoning Women's Super League (WSL) pedigree, then it was on the same stage that all of the Reds' deficiencies this term were brought into sharp focus.",
      "It was back in November 2022 that Alessia Russo's late strike helped Marc Skinner's side come from behind to claim all three points against the Gunners. But, on Saturday afternoon, the England forward was a second-half substitute for the hosts as they romped to a 3-1 victory in North London, putting United's hopes of European qualification this season of life support.",
      "In truth, the damage was done long before Russo entered the pitch, as a Geyse own goal and efforts from Cloe Lacasse and Kim Little had Arsenal in firm control of the contest before the break. \"We have to be the one to get under the skin and we have to be the team that doesn’t just try and win one way,\" Skinner asserted pre-match.",
      "But from the moment the Gunners got their noses in front at a sold-out Emirates, it was United who looked unnerved by their opponents' intensity. The Reds had started well enough, with Nikita Parris seizing upon a fumbled clearance from Sabrina D'Angelo and flashing an effort just wide of the post.",
      "READ MORE:I wanted to buy United but now I've got a $20bn offer to make to Ratcliffe",
      "But Skinner's side were made to pay for the spurned opportunity when Katie McCabe's low corner deflected off their no.23 and into the back of the net to give Arsenal the lead inside 10 minutes. The hosts nearly doubled their advantage when Beth Mead's curling shot deflected narrowly wide of Mary Earps' far post, and again when Stina Blackstenius was played through on goal by Cloe Lacasse but, on both occasions, the interventions of Millie Turner proved decisive.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, United came close to restoring parity when Ella Toone's strike ricocheted off the leg of Laia Codina and bobbled just off target. But it wasn't long before the Gunners were back on the front foot; Lacasse nodding home after Katie Zelem's miscued clearance arced straight into her path.",
      "The hosts' grip on the contest was further strengthened on the stroke of half-time, when captain Kim Little coolly dispatched the penalty after Beth Mead was upended by Gemma Evans inside the area. With Eidevall's side threatening to run away with it, Skinner unsurprisingly made an attacking change at the break, as Leah Galton was brought on in place of Gemma Evans.",
      "But it was Arsenal who looked the likeliest to find the back of the net; Blackstenius drawing a smart stop from Earps before Mead's strike cannoned off the post. The look of despondency on the face of Parris after she was, for what must have felt like the hundredth time on Saturday afternoon, called offside, spoke volumes about the meekness of United's showing in the capital.",
      "Lucia Garcia's instinctive finish in the final minute of stoppage time proved to be nothing more than a scant consolation prize for the visitors, who will know that only a flawless end to the season will be enough to keep their hopes of winning a Champions League spot alive.",
      "\"I don't think the word 'damaging' is the conversation,\" Skinner reflected post-match when queried on the potential repercussions of the result. \"We're still chasing. We're seven points behind Arsenal. We have to chase and that's what our team are resilient enough to do.\"",
      "On the criticism coming from some quarters of the United fanbase, Skinner added: \"It's part and parcel of the job. Some people love what you do, some people hate what you do. But we would never stop people from having an opinion. That's not what I'm here for.\"",
      "Though Skinner was keen to stress otherwise, Saturday's defeat is hugely detrimental to United's European ambitions. Of course, it is not just the manager who should be held accountable for the result: the Reds failed to perform to their full capacity and the players will know much more is required if they are to prevent this season from going out with a whimper.",
      "For the United boss, though, it is a defeat that raises further question marks around his own future ahead of the expiration of his contract this summer. Certainly, the voices crying for Skinner's removal will continue to grow louder in the days ahead and, at a time where the club as a whole is at the start of a brand new era, it feels like a period of change for the women's team, too, is inevitable.",

      "Friday 15 March 2024 14:52, UK",
      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag has rubbished reports suggesting Marcus Rashford could be sold to Paris St-Germain this summer.",
      "The Daily Mirror wrote on Friday that PSG have an interest in the England forward, following speculation this week the French club could be preparing a £75m bid.",
      "PSG are looking for replacement attacking options with star striker Kylian Mbappe heading to Real Madrid - but United boss Ten Hag says Rashford is part of his club's long-term plans after signing a new contract last summer, which runs until 2028.",
      "\"We didn't re-sign him last season for four years [to a new contract] with the intention to sell him. No,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"He should be part of this project. It's not a subject we talk about.\"",
      "Rashford has scored just seven Premier League goals this season, 10 fewer than he managed in an impressive 2022/23 campaign.",
      "However, with strikes in each of his last two appearances, Ten Hag and United supporters will hope to see Rashford deliver again on Sunday, when United host Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. His pace could be a key asset for United, who Ten Hag says will try to get in behind Liverpool's backline.",
      "\"We are very good when there is space in the back of the defending line,\" said Ten Hag. \"That will be also our intention for Sunday, we will go and be brave and go forward where it's possible. We know when there is space in the back of their defending line we can exploit it - but we have to get to that point, to outplay them, get the balls there and that demands good strategy in the key moments.\"",
      "United's attacking options could also be boosted by the return of Rasmus Hojlund. The Denmark international has been out for the past four games with a muscle injury but Ten Hag says Hojlund, along with Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Mason Mount, is now back in full training.",
      "\"We had a good week, [Hojlund, Maguire, Wan-Bissaka] returned on the pitch. Partly at the start of this week and [on Friday] we had a session and they were all training.",
      "\"I think [they're available] we have one session [on Saturday] and we have to see how they recover from this. It looks good.",
      "\"Tom Heaton is back as well. Mason Mount trained all week with us. Some full sessions with us. So it's looking good.\"",
      "Follow Man Utd vs Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday with our live coverage across the Sky Sports website and App, kick-off 3.30pm.",
      "Ten Hag says victory in this cup tie could turn around Man Utd's season.",
      "\"We never got turned around so far [in terms of form],\" he said. \"We had our opportunities but we missed our opportunities. Sunday we have another good opportunity to get the momentum. The players showed lately, from January on, we are in a very good [run] of games, a lot of wins. They have to believe they can do it. Now we have to take the momentum.",
      "\"That is what I feel when I train with them around the games, they have belief, good confidence and good spirit to go and play and get the turnaround.\"",
      "While United could welcome striker Hojlund back to their line-up, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has confirmed Mohamed Salah is fit and ready to play at Old Trafford, where he'll be hoping to improve a remarkable record against Liverpool's rivals.",
      "Salah has scored 12 goals in 13 matches against United and looks in the mood to extend that streak, after scoring one and setting up three more when he made his first start since New Year's Day in Liverpool's 6-1 demolition of Sparta Prague in the Europa League on Thursday night.",
      "Salah played the full 90 minutes in that match, despite only recently returning from a hamstring problem, but Klopp is convinced the Egypt star can go again on Sunday.",
      "\"Mo is definitely ready,\" said Klopp. \"Ibou [Konate] did not train [on Friday], we have to see if he can train [on Saturday], so it will be a tight race, which we may lose.",
      "\"Bobby [Clark] felt much better, a little swelling, he is fine and Ryan [Gravenberch] trained again so he is ready.\"",
      "On Salah's record against United, he said: \"Mo is pure quality. Ask him what he likes about Manchester United, but the more we talk about it the less likely it is going to happen again, so that is why I don't like to talk too much!",
      "\"He is just an exceptional guy, a world-class player and how we dealt without him was just unbelievable. The boys did well, but it's better to have him around and on the pitch rather than just in the dressing room.",
      "\"So good, we could build it now with minutes and he is ready for Sunday.\"",

      "Wolves host Coventry on Saturday lunchtime, before Newcastle make the daunting trip to the Etihad looking to end Man City's dreams of a double Treble; on Sunday, Championship pacesetters Leicester visit Chelsea, before Man Utd entertain old foes Liverpool",
      "By Sky Sports Football",
      "Friday 15 March 2024 12:56, UK",
      "For many teams, the FA Cup is a welcome distraction from the pressures of the league season, an opportunity to rotate and play with a bit of freedom. It has not really worked out that way for Gary O'Neil's Wolves - but that seems to have worked in their favour.",
      "Having scrapped their way to a third-round replay with Brentford after securing a draw with 10 players in the initial tie, there was huge pressure to win the second match at Molineux given that a Black Country derby with West Brom awaited Wolves in the fourth round.",
      "That match at the Hawthorns was a must-win for the supporters. And by the time they kicked off their fifth-round fixture at home to Brighton, it was already known that Championship side Coventry stood between Wolves and a Wembley semi-final.",
      "Despite injuries to all three first-choice forwards, the expectation will be that O'Neil's team find a way past the Sky Blues. They would finally be underdogs in the last four and could enjoy the occasion. Before that, there is another high-pressure occasion to negotiate.",
      "If Wolves can manage that, it would continue their surprising success this season. Improbably given their fraught start that had many tipping them for the drop, they still have two routes into Europe - and are just two wins away from a first FA Cup final in 64 years.Adam Bate",
      "A Coventry win at Molineux would make it the second time they have reached the FA Cup semi-finals, with the last time resulting in them going on to successfully lift the trophy in 1987.",
      "The competition also holds a special place in the heart of Sky Blues manager, Mark Robins. He scored the goal that is widely regarded as the one which saved Sir Alex Ferguson's job at Manchester United in 1990.",
      "Discontent was growing amongst supporters, with banners reading 'three years of excuses' at Old Trafford in their defeat to Crystal Palace in the previous month. But it was Robins who nodded the only goal away at Nottingham Forest to seal victory.",
      "United went on to lift the FA Cup that season, beating Crystal Palace 1-0 in a final replay. The rest, as we know it for Ferguson and the club, was history.Ella-Esrene Frederick",
      "Pep Guardiola insists that it is virtually improbable and yet as the season reaches its climax, Manchester City are the favourites to retain the Premier League trophy, favourites to retain the Champions League, and, yes, favourites to lift the FA Cup once again.",
      "This treble had only been achieved once before in the history of English football prior to last season's feat but City are well placed to manage it in back-to-back seasons. Newcastle United are the quarter-final opponents in this FA Cup quarter-final at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "That home draw feels significant because while Newcastle knocked City out of the Carabao Cup at St James' Park in September and it needed a late goal from Oscar Bobb to win the league fixture there, Guardiola's side are unbeaten in front of their own fans all season.",
      "If there is one intriguing aspect for City, it will be the performance of Stefan Ortega. In his role as Ederson's back-up goalkeeper over the past two seasons, the German has impressed - having supporters chant his name soon after his arrival. But this is different.",
      "Injury to the Brazilian means that Ortega could have a key role to play in the closing stages of the campaign. He is a more than capable player with the ball at his feet so should not necessitate any change in style. But eyes will be on him during such an important period.",
      "Ortega aside, with the international break to follow and having had a free week following the exertions against Liverpool last weekend, even an injury to Kevin De Bruyne is unlikely to prevent City from naming a very strong side. The double treble is on.Adam Bate",
      "Eddie Howe joked that he almost drove off the road in shock when he heard on the radio Newcastle had been drawn away to Manchester City in the FA Cup quarter-finals. The Magpies got the better of Pep Guardiola's men earlier this season in the Carabao Cup but a fourth meeting of the season with City is far from ideal.",
      "Especially away from home, where Newcastle are on a run of 18 league visits to City without success. They managed just one shot on target in a limp performance in August. But Newcastle's players need to put it all on the line this Saturday. This has become a defining game for their season.",
      "There is still the prospect of qualifying for the Europa League or Europa Conference League through their league position but a campaign which began with so much hope and excitement could end with something of a whimper if Newcastle's FA Cup run doesn't go beyond this weekend.",
      "A return to Wembley is within reach - and to do that in back-to-back seasons would be a significant achievement for Howe, particularly given the injury issues he and his players have had to battle this term. But they couldn't have a tougher task on their hands to make it there.Peter Smith",
      "It wasn't pretty and it wasn't convincing but Chelsea's 3-2 win over Leeds in the previous round of the FA Cup was celebrated enthusiastically by the home fans at Stamford Bridge. Part of that was down to the rivalry between the sides but perhaps more significantly, it was because the victory came just three days on from their extra-time Carabao Cup final defeat to Liverpool at Wembley. It kept Chelsea's season alive.",
      "The middle of the Premier League is a crowded place and with co-efficient calculations being made on a weekly basis, there is still the possibility Chelsea could secure European football for next season with their league finish. But silverware would give Mauricio Pochettino's project a shot in the arm - and perhaps win him some welcome admiration from the Chelsea fans who, he admits, have been underwhelmed by his output so far.",
      "His winless cup record in England weighs down his reputation but, just as in the Carabao Cup, Chelsea have been handed a favourable draw. Another trip to Wembley beckons. Chelsea can't afford to miss out.Peter Smith",
      "A welcome distraction? Leicester's trip to Chelsea will surely be that given their alarming recent run of results which has threatened to derail what a month ago looked like being a procession to the Championship title. One win in five and three defeats in that stretch - including a galling late collapse at promotion rivals Leeds - has left Enzo Maresca's Foxes reeling.",
      "With Leeds and Ipswich on their tails in the second tier, Leicester will be hoping for a confidence-boosting upset at Stamford Bridge. Evergreen Jamie Vardy, with 10 goals in his last 11 appearances, could be their key weapon but the 37-year-old has just four goals against Chelsea, a team he has played against more times than any other in his career (21).",
      "Can he and Leicester come up with something special this weekend? Regardless of form or standing, Vardy and this team should never be underestimated…Peter Smith",
      "Manchester United last won the FA Cup in 2016, Louis van Gaal plonking the trophy in front of him at the post-final press conference. It was not enough to keep him in a job, having missed out on qualification for the Champions League. But could it save Erik ten Hag?",
      "It has been a difficult Premier League campaign for the club. A fifth-place finish is likely to be enough to secure a spot in Europe's premier club competition next season, but even that appears beyond them. Out of Europe before Christmas, it all comes down to this.",
      "Liverpool, of all teams, are the visitors to Old Trafford on Sunday and though they have bigger prizes to play for, it will be a tough examination for a United team whose frailties have never been too far from the surface. It will need a big performance to progress.",
      "There are big-game players in the United group. This is the sort of occasion that they will hope Casemiro would relish. And how about Bruno Fernandes? One Carabao Cup is scant reward for his contributions in a United shirt. Can the captain seize the day?",
      "Defeat would confirm a trophyless season and accelerate discussions about the direction of travel under Ten Hag. Victory would take them to Wembley and eliminate one of the biggest remaining stumbling blocks to reclaiming the FA Cup. Massive for Manchester United.Adam Bate",
      "Jurgen Klopp takes his Liverpool side to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon with the Reds in red-hot form following Thursday's destruction of Sparta Prague in the Europa League last 16, but against opponents who would love nothing better than to derail their bid for an unprecedented Quadruple.",
      "This will be the Liverpool manager's penultimate visit to the 'Theatre of Dreams', with the Reds also scheduled to face United in the Premier League on April 7, but with some key players starting to return from injury, the visitors will be expected to field a strong-looking starting lineup this weekend.",
      "Both Mohamed Salah and Dominik Szoboszlai proved their return to fitness after recent hamstring injuries by playing the entire game against Sparta at Anfield, although it will still be intriguing to see what side Klopp fields against United.",
      "However, with Liverpool not playing again until they host Brighton and Hove Albion in the top flight after the international break on May 31, it would be a surprise were Klopp not to play his first-choice XI against their fierce rivals.",
      "Either way, Klopp would love nothing better than to triumph one last time at Old Trafford, a ground he has at times struggled to get results at during his time in charge of Liverpool, before departing the club this summer.Richard Morgan",

      "Friday 15 March 2024 10:29, UK",
      "Our tipster Jones Knows takes aim at the weekend action across the Premier League and FA Cup, offering up his insight and betting analysis.",
      "Backing both teams to score looks a great starting point for what should be a cracking cup tie. Coventry have scored in each of their last 13 away games in all competitions whilst 71 per cent of Wolves' home games this season have seen both teams score.",
      "Since the FA scrapped replays in the fifth round and quarter-finals for the 2019/20 season there have been just seven draws in 56 fifth-round or quarter-final matches - that's just a 12.5 per cent strike rate. I think the withdrawal of replays is making teams go all-out for the win with the thought of extra-time a bit of a hindrance. That's enough to put me off the draw for this encounter and there is a bet to be had to combine goals and no draw.",
      "Sky Bet do offer a special market where we can back both teams to score and the game not to end in a draw, which is coming out at 13/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "The market continues to get the goal line all wrong in these battles down at the bottom.",
      "There is a clear trend developing that these type of games between relegation rivals are producing more attacking intent than what the expected models are telling the bookmakers.",
      "Of the 28 games involving both Sheffield United, Luton, Burnley, Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Everton and Brentford this season, the overall goal average has been 3.03 per game - usually that is above the market expectation of edgy and cagey affairs. And 39 per cent of those 27 games have seen four or more goals scored.",
      "In a game Brentford simply have to try and win, it should result in a goal-heavy encounter, especially when you consider their recent defensive record which is spiralling out of control. It's now just one clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games. Burnley can get in on the act here, so both teams to score and over 2.5 goals looks a lovely bet to attack at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Big game.",
      "At half-time during Luton's clash with Bournemouth, I was ready to side with them at 6/4 with Sky Bet to beat Nottingham Forest. At full-time, I didn't want to be anywhere near that price following their collapse.",
      "Results like that can have a huge effect on confidence and general belief so even though I think they're still the most likely winners, I can swerve them and play the draw.",
      "Luton will cause problems from set pieces. Forest have conceded the most goals from set-pieces (18) in the Premier League this season - that's four more than any other team. And 10 of those have come since Nuno Espirito Santo took the job in December, so he's had no impact on improving the standards.",
      "We need to look at the Luton centre-backs in the goalscorer markets and I've come down on Reece Burke, who has had eight shots in last six games. One might be due and the 40/1 first goalscorer prices with Sky Bet are certainly worth a second look.",
      "For all Tottenham's swashbuckling attacking in the second half vs Aston Villa, they are becoming slow starters in matches. They had just one shot in the first half at Villa Park and failed to score, meaning they've failed to score in five of their last six first halves. And only had 25 shots in those six first halves, works out at just over four per game which is very low for a team chasing Europe.",
      "Now they are heading to a tricky away game to play a Fulham team that have conceded the fewest goals in the opening 15 minutes of matches this season, just one.",
      "I like the Evens available with Sky Bet on the second half to have more goals than the first. This means even if there's a first-half goal, the bet is still live as we just need the second half to outscore the first - it's a bit more of an enjoyable punting experience than just backing under first-half goals as that bet can be over within a few minutes.",
      "In 278 Premier League games this season, there's been 369 first-half goals and 531 second-half goals - so 162 more goals in the second half. That is leading to this bet of more second-half goals landing more frequently than what the market is suggesting with 52 per cent of games this season seeing this bet win, including in eight of Tottenham's last 11 games across all competitions. They can power away again in the second half.",
      "Newcastle's season might just be over come Saturday evening. It doesn't get much tougher than this.",
      "Upsets are rarely seen at this stage of the competition in the FA Cup. In the last 26 games involving Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool or Chelsea in the fifth round or quarter-finals, those teams have won 24 of those 26 games in 90 minutes. And those two defeats both were inflicted by Leicester who were a top-five club at the time and won the trophy in 2021.",
      "Manchester City to win in 90 minutes is the obvious starting point for a bet even at 2/9 with Sky Bet. This is a team that have won each of last 12 FA Cup games at home, scoring 52 goals and lost just one of their last 58 home matches in all competitions.",
      "Heading to the cards market may provide a slice of value though as the 25/1 about no cards being shown in the first player to be carded market looks good to me.",
      "In the last 56 FA Cup fifth-round and quarter-final matches, since replays were scrapped, the average yellow card count per match is just 2.07 - that's just 116 yellow cards in 56 matches. These types of one-sided games can be played out in a friendly environment and the referee can be a little more lenient than usual. There were no cards in Man City's fifth-round fixture at Luton and this one could go the same way.",
      "Chelsea's attack is purring right now. They are in trustworthy mood. In their last eight Premier League games, Chelsea have scored 2.1 goals per game, overperforming their expected goals by about 0.47 per game, which is a complete flip to the period between August and January where they regularly underperformed their xG in front of goal. It's starting to click for Maurico Pochettino and they could be in line to make another major cup final.",
      "Leicester head here in a strange spot - is this a game they really need? They are wobbling slightly in the Championship, winning just one of their last five and conceding two goals in four of those matches. Ipswich and Leeds are hunting them down, so I'm not sure this is a helpful game for them. Chelsea to win and over 3.5 goals at 2/1 with Sky Bet rates as a decent wager.",
      "Ollie Watkins remains a player of interest in the goalscorer markets against teams outside the \"big six\" - it was no surprise he drew a blank vs Tottenham last week as his record against elite opposition is now just six goals in 17 appearances.",
      "However, he is a killer when it comes to scoring against non \"big six\" teams where his record of 23 goals in 35 games under Unai Emery is fantastic. That works out at a goal every 132 minutes and he is a massive runner to find the net in this one at the odds we can play at. I'd advise a close look at both the 5/1 with Sky Bet on him scoring first and the 6/4 on offer for him to score anytime.",
      "Regular readers will know all about the sustainable edge we've been exploiting this season regarding Manchester United's ability to ship corners. The market still hasn't noticed, which is great news here where the Liverpool corner line is very backable.",
      "United's 10-game Premier League average of corners conceded now stands at 8.3 per 90 minutes after Everton surpassed the market's expected line and won eight at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "But that corner-conceded average rises to a completely bonkers 11.5 corners conceded in the last seven games against the top five in the Premier League.",
      "They shipped 10 away at Villa, 13 at home to Spurs, six at home to Villa, 12 away at Liverpool, 12 at home to Man City, 12 at Arsenal and a staggering 15 in the recent league game with Man City - 12 coming in the first half.",
      "United do have a tendency under Erik ten Hag to stay in matches despite giving up so much territory and possession, so I can see Liverpool racking up plenty of corners as they hunt a way through. Jurgen Klopp's men are averaging 6.9 corners per 90 this season, and have won seven or more corners in 25 of their 44 matches, so a 55 per cent strike. When you factor in the opposition and their woeful corners against record averages, getting 5/4 with Sky Bet on Liverpool winning seven or more corners is a real gift.",

      "Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite and Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon receive first England senior call-ups; Brentford striker Ivan Toney recalled; West Ham midfielder Kalvin Phillips misses out; England face Brazil and Belgium in friendlies at Wembley this month ahead of Euro 2024",
      "Thursday 14 March 2024 22:03, UK",
      "Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite and Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon have received their first England senior call-ups for this month's friendlies against Brazil and Belgium, while Brentford striker Ivan Toney has been recalled.",
      "Toney's recall comes after returning to action in January following the completion of his eight-month Football Association ban for breaching betting rules. The 27-year-old has scored four goals in nine appearances for Brentford since his comeback.",
      "But West Ham midfielder Kalvin Phillips has been left out of the 25-man squad by England boss Gareth Southgate after a torrid run of form since joining the Hammers on loan in January.",
      "Goalkeepers:  Sam Johnstone (Crystal Palace), Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal).\n\nDefenders: Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton), Ben Chilwell (Chelsea), Lewis Dunk (Brighton), Joe Gomez (Liverpool), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Harry Maguire (Man Utd), John Stones (Man City), Kyle Walker (Man City).\n\nMidfielders: Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Conor Gallagher (Chelsea), Jordan Henderson (Ajax), James Maddison (Tottenham), Declan Rice (Arsenal).\n\nForwards: Jarrod Bowen (West Ham), Phil Foden (Man City), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Marcus Rashford (Man United), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Ivan Toney (Brentford), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa).",
      "The Manchester City loanee was at fault for a goal on his debut against Bournemouth before he was sent off at Nottingham Forest last month and hooked at half-time of Sunday's 2-2 draw at home to Burnley.",
      "Southgate said: \"I think he knows exactly what we think of him. A good version of him is an important player for us and that's why we've supported him as we have.",
      "\"Unfortunately his form hasn't been good enough and I've spoken to him about that. He understands.",
      "\"He has all the attributes to force his way back in. He just needs to find that rhythm and confidence because there is an outstanding player in there.\"",
      "Phillips' West Ham team-mate Jarrod Bowen has been recalled following his recent fine form, while Liverpool defender Joe Gomez is named in an England squad for the first time in four years.",
      "But Southgate revealed Arsenal defender Ben White, who signed a new four-year contract with the Premier League leaders on Thursday, did not want to be considered for England squads \"at the moment\".",
      "White left England's 2022 World Cup squad mid-tournament to return home for personal reasons and reports later emerged of an alleged bust-up with England assistant Steve Holland.",
      "Southgate said: \"He [White] is not available to us and there is no issue between us at all and I also should say there is never any issue with (coach) Steve Holland because that has been mentioned in articles and I don't like that.",
      "\"I want that door wide open. He would be in this squad but he's not available to us and I have to focus on who can help us.\"",
      "Chelsea left-back Ben Chilwell has been called up despite a knee issue, but Blues team-mate Raheem Sterling was once again absent from the squad.",
      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire has been included despite his muscle problem, but Manchester City's Jack Grealish misses out due to a groin injury.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea forward Cole Palmer and Aston Villa duo Ollie Watkins and Ezri Konsa retain their places in the squad.",
      "Branthwaite's maiden England call-up comes after a fine breakthrough season with Everton.",
      "Southgate said: \"He's good with the ball, shows good composure, good mentality. He's a left-footer and we don't have many left-footed defenders.",
      "\"He's in on merit and we're keen to find out more about him.\"",
      "Gordon was another to earn a first call-up to Southgate's squad after scoring 10 times for Newcastle this season in all competitions.",
      "\"Consistently good performances. He was very close in November and he's continued his form,\" Southgate explained.",
      "\"He is scoring, his work for the team is excellent and he competes, so I really like his attitude.\"",
      "With just three months to go until their Euro 2024 tournament opener against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen, England face a pair of high-profile warm-up friendlies at Wembley against Brazil on March 23 and Belgium on March 26.",
      "This is the last camp before Southgate names his provisional Euros squad just after the Premier League season concludes, with the final selection to be submitted to UEFA on June 8.",
      "Sky Sports News senior reporter Rob Dorsett:",
      "Until this England squad, Gareth Southgate had protected Kalvin Phillips.",
      "He continued to pick him through his leanest of spells and played him for England when he could not get in the Manchester City team.",
      "But now, Southgate made it clear that Phillips' form is simply too poor for him to justify his inclusion in an England squad.",
      "Southgate says Phillips is still in his thoughts for the Euros: he is a rare talent, his \"profile\" (as a diligent holding midfielder) is equally rare, and there is still time for him to force his way back into the England fold before the Euros squad is finalised in three months' time.",
      "But it is clear that it will need an extraordinary turnaround in form from Phillips for that to happen - particularly when Southgate can only name 23 players for Germany, compared with the 26 he was allowed in the Covid-affected tournament three years ago.",
      "With that in mind, Southgate admitted it might be difficult for him to fit three out-and-out strikers in his Euros squad.",
      "Ivan Toney is back in this squad at the first time of asking, since his eight-month suspension for breaching the FA's betting rules that cost him the possibility of eight England caps.",
      "But will Toney keep his place alongside Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins for the tournament? \"Maybe, maybe not,\" admitted Southgate.",
      "One of the big pluses for the England boss is Marcus Rashford, who can play as a number nine as well as a winger.",
      "Harry Kane, inevitably, will be first-choice striker, but Southgate may not have the luxury or the space to include two other strikers, when it's decision time in June.",
      "That is why this international break - with friendlies against the two sides ranked fourth and fifth in the world by FIFA - are so key for both Watkins and Toney to try to prove themselves.",

      "No winner of the Super 6 March Rollover so far means a massive £750,000 is on the line this weekend! Play for free.",
      "Super 6 is completely free to play - all you need to do is predict six scores for a chance to win and if you manage to do so correctly, the £750,000 jackpot is yours to take home.",
      "Throughout March and every Premier League Saturday across the month, the jackpot will roll over if it isn't won.",
      "A winner came close for the second consecutive rollover round, with 32 Super 6 players making it through to Sunday's two fixtures with their eyes firmly set on scooping the £500,000 jackpot.",
      "Ange Postecoglou's free-scoring Tottenham side ensured the half a million pounds wasn't claimed after their 4-0 win over Aston Villa, though it did mean the Super 6 rollover hit a massive £750,000 jackpot, which is on the line for players this weekend.",
      "Fear not - if the round isn't won by Sunday evening, there will be a whopping £1,000,000 round on Saturday March 30, how's that for a tasty return following the international break?",
      "The 32 players that made it through to Sky Sports Super Sunday's two fixtures is the most we have seen this season, however what was to come would have blown out the rest of the pack, never mind the remaining players in the hunt for £500,000.",
      "Remarkably, only 127 entrants correctly predicted Aston Villa 0-4 Tottenham at Villa Park, and that scoreline thwarted any hopes of a jackpot winner.",
      "Warren from Maidenhead did come closest to winning the £500,000 jackpot as he predicted FIVE correct scorelines. In the Aston Villa match, he was only two goals away from winning the jackpot, however stoppage time goals from Heung-Min Son and Timo Werner crushed his hopes.",
      "All was not lost, as Warren's outstanding predictions, earned him the Top Scorer prize of £6,000!",

      "Friday 15 March 2024 15:59, UK",
      "Ange Postecoglou is remaining grounded despite Tottenham basking in the afterglow of a significant victory in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "Last Sunday's clash at Villa Park pitted fourth against fifth, with hosts Aston Villa knowing victory would move them eight points clear in the last Premier League spot guaranteed a place at Europe's top table.",
      "Spurs have a game in hand against Villa - away to Chelsea - while a third straight win over Fulham this weekend, live on Sky Sports, would see them overtake Unai Emery's side.",
      "Put to Postecoglou that it was quite the swing avoiding an eight-point gap and instead cutting Villa's advantage to two, he said: \"I guess so. I said before the game that I still think there's a significant part of the season to go. There's still 11 games for us anyway.",
      "\"There's so many challenging games and every game will have meaning between now and the end of the year. Not just for us, for every team.",
      "\"There's a fight at the top, there's a fight down the bottom, there's a fight in the middle somewhere, so we're all fighting for something.",
      "\"If we had lost today, I don't think that would have discounted us from whatever other people put on as targets for us.",
      "\"I've been consistent saying what's important for me is our growth as a team and I thought we saw that today. It was another positive step forward.\"",
      "The quest to qualify for the Champions League is as tense as the three-way title race - further enhanced by the element of the unknown. For the first time, five Premier League teams could qualify through their league position.",
      "Jamie Carragher said: \"In the same way the race for the title could come down to goal difference, it could play a huge part in qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"We're not quite sure if it will be the 'top four' or the 'top five; but the eight-goal swing for Tottenham on Aston Villa at the weekend is huge.\"",
      "Roy Keane added: \"Tottenham have the confidence and the momentum. You've got people coming off the bench and scoring goals. Right now, there will be a feel-good factor around Spurs. It's a big result for them and a huge setback for Villa.\"",
      "United bounced back from two defeats on the spin with victory over Everton last weekend. Despite facing 23 shots, Andre Onana kept an eighth clean sheet of the season. Only David Raya has kept more.",
      "\"At the very least you have to finish in the top five so it's hard to tell right now,\" continued Keane when asked to assess United's Champions League chances. \"The main thing for Man Utd is to be consistent and to win football matches. They have to hope others slip up.",
      "\"I think it's bit of a stretch to catch Aston Villa in fourth so it'll come down to if that fifth place is available. They just have to keep their heads on and win matches.\"",

      "Micah Richards said: \"Villa have been excellent this season and can regroup. They've had a few dodgy results but Unai Emery is doing a great job there.",
      "\"Ollie Watkins was a little but off it [against Tottenham]. You have to adjust your system to whoever you're playing against and we know Spurs are good down the wings.\"",
      "Keane added: \"It looked like that European game had an affect on them. They were five or 10 per cent off and that was enough to cause a bad result.\"",
      "During Emery's first year as Arsenal boss, the Gunners lost out on the top four and were defeated in the Europa League final.",
      "Carragher is fearful that Villa could suffer the same fate if the manager tinkers with his personnel and system as he did towards the end of the 2018/19 season.",
      "\"We have loved them this season, but it takes me a little bit back to Arsenal during his first full season,\" Carragher told Sky Sports.",
      "\"He gets a lot of criticism for that season, but actually for a lot of it, he was doing well. But towards the end of the season, because they were in the Europa League, they were in a great position in terms of the top four.",
      "\"We can see that with seven games of the season to go, and they got into the quarter-finals, the semi-finals and then the final of the Europa League. And they just miss out because Unai Emery started changing his team with personnel, change in formation.",
      "\"He did a lot of back threes and back fours at Arsenal, and in the end he ended up with nothing. They missed out on the Champions League and they lost the final to Chelsea. He's got to be really careful.",
      "\"I hope for Aston Villa's sake, it's a one-off in doing something different because of Tottenham and the teams who were playing Tottenham, and get back to being what Aston Villa have been about this season.\"",
      "Manchester United have the slight upper hand when it comes to the average league position of their remaining opposition. The average current league position of United's remaining opponents is 11.3, compared to 10.9 for Spurs and 8.3 for Aston Villa.",
      "But in his latest column, Paul Merson believes Villa can wrestle back control ahead of a pivotal weekend.",
      "Merson wrote: \"That Tottenham game was one of Aston Villa's biggest games in years. And they got blown away.",
      "\"I've seen two teams destroy them in the last two weeks, Newcastle and Tottenham. All they did was press high and suffocate them. Under that sort of pressure they haven't had a clue or a different plan. That's worrying.",
      "\"But you'd take this situation if you were a Villa fan. It's amazing. They're dreaming but it's football and we're allowed to dream. They're still in it. Spurs still have to play Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City. If they get three points out of those games they've had a result. A Villa win at West Ham puts them back in a strong position.\"",
      "The challengers have similar run-ins, with four opponents - Aston Villa, Brighton, Tottenham and Wolves - common to all three. Liverpool have Villa away but Spurs and Brighton at home, the inverse of City and Arsenal's fixtures, while Wolves welcome Arsenal to Molineux but travel to City and Liverpool.",

      "Saturday 9 March 2024 17:15, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford scored first-half penalties as Manchester United bounced back from defeat to Manchester City with a 2-0 win over struggling Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho won both spot-kicks with Fernandes coolly converting the first of them before handing the second to Rashford, allowing the winger to find the net for a second successive game after his long-range stunner in last weekend's derby.",
      "Manchester United's performance was sloppy at times but Everton's wastefulness in front of goal ensured it was a comfortable victory for Erik ten Hag's side, putting them within three points of fifth-placed Tottenham, who have two games in hand.",
      "Sean Dyche's side finished the game with 23 shots to Manchester United's 15 - the most by an away side at Old Trafford all season - but once again demonstrated a glaring lack of cutting edge in front of goal as their Premier League winless run stretched to 11 games - equalling a club record set in 1994.",
      "The Toffees remain 16th, five points above the drop zone, but defeat gives their relegation rivals a chance to reduce the gap.",
      "Man Utd: Onana (7), Lindelof (6), Varane (7), Dalot (7), Evans (7), Casemiro (5), Mainoo (6), Fernandes (8), Garnacho (8), McTominay (6), Rashford (7).\n\n\nSubs: Amrabat (6), Kambwala (6), Antony (6).\n\n\nEverton: Pickford (7), Godfrey (5), Tarkowski (6), Branthwaite (7), Mykolenko (5), Harrison (6), Onana (6), Garner (6), McNeil (7), Doucoure (5), Beto (5).\n\n\nSubs: Calvert-Lewin (5), Gomes (6), Dobbin (6), Young (6), Chermiti (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Alejandro Garnacho",
      "The injury-hit hosts reached half-time two goals to the good but their first-half performance was beset by sloppiness as they repeatedly gifted possession to Everton in their own half.",
      "Dwight McNeil, Amadou Onana and Ben Godfrey were among those to spurn chances for the visitors, however, and, up at the other end, they were punished by the dangerous Garnacho.",
      "The first penalty was won when he shimmied away from James Tarkowski, drawing a clear foul from the Everton centre-back, with Fernandes putting the spot-kick out of Jordan Pickford's reach to notch his first Premier League goal since November.",
      "Garnacho was then clumsily brought down in the box for a second time, with Godfrey the culprit. Fernandes' unconventional decision to give the spot-kick to Rashford paid off as the 26-year-old sent Pickford the wrong way following a stuttering run-up.",
      "Pickford made a stunning save from a Fernandes free-kick in between the two penalties, with Manchester United becoming more threatening as the half went on.",
      "The hosts had more opportunities after the break, mostly on the counter-attack, with Garnacho not quite able to turn home a low cross by Fernandes from one of several chances and Victor Lindelof seeing a close-range effort repelled following a corner.",
      "Everton, meanwhile, continued to find space in the Manchester United half to no avail, with Abdoulaye Doucoure seeing a near-post effort saved by Andre Onana and Dominic Calvert-Lewin failing to turn home a cross-shot by fellow substitute Lewis Dobbin.",
      "Calvert-Lewin also sent a free header from a corner straight at Onana as Everton continued to pepper the United goal, but their bluntness was such that there was no real sense of jeopardy for the hosts as the second half meandered towards its conclusion.",
      "The win, much-needed after back-to-back Premier League defeats against Fulham and Manchester City, boosts Manchester United's European hopes. For winless Everton, meanwhile, at risk of getting sucked back into trouble, the picture looks increasingly bleak.",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag: \"I was very pleased with the pressing and also the defending of the box. The only thing that could be better is keeping more of the ball, be more calm on the ball, playing more give-and-gos.",
      "\"When you have a high press, you can't go all the time with long balls because you stretch the pitch and we don't actually want that. But all over, a good performance and good result.",
      "\"It was a team performance but especially our back four and our goalkeeper in the back and Casemiro in the front. They have done very well.",
      "\"The way we defended set-plays was very good, really well organised and focused and everyone did their job. From the second phase, they had some opportunities, but overall, I think we did quite well.\"",
      "On the second penalty: \"They decided on the pitch together. But we have more very good penalty takers in our squad, Bruno is one, Rashy is one, Casemiro and Christian Eriksen as well, plus others.",
      "\"That's very good when you have that in your squad. When you get [two] at such short notice, two different penalty takers makes it harder for the opposition and the goalkeeper.\"",
      "On Garnacho: \"It's about him and if he can keep the focus. If he puts the right effort in during a game and during the week, because sometimes for young players it's difficult because they are inexperienced.",
      "\"As a coaching staff, we have a job to do, but he is able to keep this focus and attitude and he will improve from game to game and that's what we see. We are very pleased with his performance.",
      "\"With young players, you always have to tell them [to keep focus in the week]. In the week, you win your game and there we have to work very well in training session and meetings, we have to be spot on to get the performance at the weekend.",
      "\"I love to work with him, just like the other players in the squad. He is a player who needs a challenge, likes a challenge, he's very brave and confident and our job is to push him to higher levels.",
      "\"But he is doing this. He has a high potential and now we have to get the potential out. You have to work day by day and when you are young, you don't know what it is to play in a high competitive leave, to perform every third day.",
      "\"You need that experience and you have to perform in every training session to get better because there are so many areas for them to improve.\"",
      "\"We know our position in the league and it's not enough for us. We want to try and get into the spots for the Champions League. We know it's going to be tough and difficult but we have to win these games.",
      "\"We didn't win against Fulham. That was not good enough. Then we go away to City and we don't win two games in a row. It gets tough. Aston Villa is doing really well, in moments Tottenham are being really good. It will be more difficult for us than them but we have to push.\"",
      "On handing the second penalty to Marcus Rashford: \"We both kick the penalties. I asked Marcus if he wanted to take and he said he was confident. He is one of the penalty takers that the manager chooses. I felt I had my one, Rashy could get his goal from the penalty.\"",
      "Everton boss Sean Dyche: \"With all due respect to the squads I've had, I've never been here and had that many chances or opportunities. It's very frustrating and we've had a run of that.",
      "\"We've been performing correctly in so many ways but the scoreline is the stat that's important. That's the bit we're getting on the wrong side of and we've got to continually work on it to change it.",
      "\"The two penalties are soft. They are penalties, but they're soft from our point of view, just not shuffling your feet quick enough and dealing with the moment, which we've done very well. It's a tough one for me. I'm not going to over question the defensive side of the team because I think it's been strong this season.",
      "\"I spoke to the players after the game and you've got to get hurt to score a goal sometimes, as Brian Clough used to say. It can't all be glorious goals, you've got to get hurt and that's what I'm not seeing.",
      "\"We're getting into areas that might be awkward goals or be hungry enough to get hurt to score a goal, and that's got to change. Once you start scoring those, you then start scoring the nice ones and that's the order it needs to be done in.",
      "\"I'm seeing a team that are committed, they're fit, some of the football today was very pleasing. So it's really frustrating to not see that come to fruition with scoring more goals because they're doing a lot right.",
      "\"You've got to score goals to finish it all off and that killer mentality is key.\"",
      "The Argentine winger made a decisive contribution with his two penalty wins, the first coming after clever footwork up against Tarkowski; the second after a dancing run into the box.",
      "He remained a threat on the break throughout the second half, his runs putting him in behind Everton's backline on numerous occasions, the only frustration being that he could not get his name on the scoresheet. Everton could not get to grips with him.",

      "Plus: Kai Havertz is finally embraced at Arsenal after Brentford heroics; Crystal Palace improving under new boss Oliver Glasner despite conceding late equaliser against Luton; Wolves full-backs step up for injured forwards to continue surprising season",
      "Saturday 9 March 2024 21:54, UK",
      "This was an important win for Manchester United. Alejandro Garnacho was impressive. Marcus Rashford scored for a second successive game. Bruno Fernandes, meanwhile, found the net in the Premier League for the first time since November.",
      "But, for all those positives, it is difficult to watch Erik ten Hag's side right now without wondering what has become of one of their most expensive additions. Casemiro continues to confound.",
      "The Brazilian was the main culprit in a bewilderingly sloppy first-half performance by the hosts, repeatedly squandering possession in his own half with errant passes, often under no pressure.",
      "At the interval, his completion rate was below 70 per cent. At full-time, it was not much better. In fact, at 76 per cent, it was the second-lowest of any United player, excluding their goalkeeper.",
      "Casemiro lost possession 17 times overall, a total exceeded by only Everton defender Ben Godfrey among all outfield players on show at Old Trafford - and one he has reached on four separate occasions over the course of the campaign.",
      "A high rate of possession losses can be excused for those players whose job it is to take risks in order to create chances. But that is not the responsibility of a holding midfielder and Casemiro - creator of only 11 opportunities this season - is no exception.",
      "In fairness, the 32-year-old has always been more adventurous than most with his passing from that position. But, in this Manchester United team, one which has major issues exerting control of games, it looks more of a hindrance than a help.",
      "On this occasion, of course, it did not matter. United's first-half penalties went unanswered thanks to the toothlessness of their opponents. But the Casemiro conundrum continues.Nick Wright",
      "Once again, a lack of goals cost Everton on Saturday. All the components were there, especially in the opening half an hour - great football, taking advantage of numerous Man Utd errors and some very good chances.",
      "But despite having 23 shots - the most by an away side at Old Trafford all season - there was nothing to show from it apart from two clumsy errors in the opposing box and another defeat.",
      "As the game's commentator contemplated - Everton are the boxer without the knockout punch. Perhaps a watch back of Anthony Joshua's second-round win against Francis Ngannou last night might be of some inspiration.",
      "And even manager Sean Dyche said: \"You've got to get hurt to score a goal sometimes.\"",
      "And that's not to say that Everton don't have the bravery, heart and talent - they do. But something is clearly not clicking up front for them at the moment - the Toffees have a shot conversion rate of just 7.3 per cent in the Premier League this season, scoring 29 goals from 397 shots - their lowest rate in a campaign on record in the competition (since 1997-98).",
      "With a three week break now ahead of them, and a working trip to Europe planned, Everton's priority must be goalscoring. It is the one missing piece of the puzzle to keep them from pushing up the table.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Not even Mikel Arteta could have seen this Kai Havertz story arc coming.",
      "\"If somebody told me after the first two or three months that the whole stadium would be singing his song with that passion, with that feeling, with that chemistry, I would have found it hard to believe,\" said Arteta after the win over Brentford.",
      "Havertz's early days at Arsenal were clouded by criticism that largely originated from online trolls but permeated into the terraces at the Emirates. No one was sure of his position while every error was clipped up and shared a thousand times over.",
      "This only served to feed the narrative that Arsenal had made a major error in paying Chelsea £65m for the once highly thought of prospect from Germany yet to truly convince in the Premier League.",
      "Havertz felt like he might be the next big name to see his performances drop in the face of widespread - and often unfair - criticism. His start to life in an Arsenal shirt was subdued, but not deserving of the treatment it received. Arteta always stood by the 24-year-old.",
      "The win over Brentford was the fourth league game running that Havertz has scored in playing as Arsenal's makeshift striker. That's the same number of goals he'd scored in his previous 32 games.",
      "Something has finally clicked for the forward in north London and Saturday's scenes of jubilation show he is now being embraced. \"That's what happens to good people,\" Arteta added.Zinny Boswell",
      "Crystal Palace had scored three goals in three of their previous four home games. But none of those performances saw them as dominant as they were in this 1-1 draw with Luton. You have to go back to the opening day of the season win at Sheffield United to find a match where they had more shots. Five big chances created, according to Opta, is a season-high, too.",
      "Yet some wasteful finishing from first-half goalscorer Jean-Philippe Mateta, and bad fortune for Eberechi Eze and Odsonne Edouard, who rattled the bar, combined to give Luton the opportunity for a last-gasp leveller. Selhurst Park was stunned when Cauley Woodrow's header went in off a post. They had already started celebrating a second home win for new boss Oliver Glasner.",
      "But it was perhaps a familiar feeling. The 10 Premier League goals Crystal Palace have conceded after the 90th-minute this season is unmatched by any other side. Glasner admitted there may be a mental issue for his players, such is the frequency of the late goals they've let in - but he also pointed out that his side were on the front foot for much of the six added minutes, just as they had been for the majority of the game.",
      "It's a painful blow to take into a three-week break in matches. But already, with limited training ground time, Glasner has made his mark on Palace's play. Now he has a good coaching window to further instil his methods. The aim will be for Palace to come out fighting after the international break and reclaim some of the points these late goals have cost them…Peter Smith",
      "Drawing at home with Sheffield United doesn't look good, especially when the opposition have just become the first team in English football history to lose three straight home games by five or more goals. But Bournemouth can take a lot of encouragement forward based on their performance, especially when chasing the game at 2-0 down.",
      "Before this game, Andoni Iraola's team were the only side in the Premier League this season yet to take any points when behind at the break. They rallied with great tenacity and quality when tasked with the challenge. In total they posted a whopping 32 shots - the third most racked up by a team in a Premier League game this season. It might just be one win in their last nine Premier League games now but Iraola's Bournemouth remain an exciting prospect.Lewis Jones",
      "Wolves have beaten Tottenham twice and Manchester City this season, but a home victory against bottom-half Fulham has made boss Gary O'Neil the proudest.",
      "\"It's the best win of the season,\" he said after losing Pedro Neto and Jean-Ricner Bellegarde to first-half injuries. \"Today surprised me.\"",
      "O'Neil was already without top scorers Hee-Chan Hwang and Matheus Cunha yet it was typical of the style he has implemented so quickly that his full-backs made the telling contributions.",
      "Rayan Ait-Nouri fired them ahead and then right-back Nelson Semedo saw his shot diverted in off Tom Cairney. Who needs forwards?",
      "O'Neil's Wolves are one of the season's stories and sitting one point off the top seven, there are still more chapters to be told.David Richardson",

      "Saturday 9 March 2024 17:16, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed why he let Marcus Rashford take Manchester United's second penalty against Everton, having scored the first one himself.",
      "The Man Utd captain - the usual penalty taker for the club - scored from the spot in the 12th minute after Alejandro Garnacho was clipped by James Tarkowski inside the area.",
      "Around 20 minutes later, Garnacho won another penalty, this time fouled by Ben Godfrey. This time, it was Rashford who took and scored the spot kick.",
      "When asked why he did so, Fernandes told TNT Sport: \"We both kick the penalties. I asked Marcus if he wanted to take and he said he was confident. He is one of the penalty takers that the manager chooses.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was the first player to win two penalties in a single Premier League game since Antonio Rudiger for Chelsea against Leeds in December 2021, and first ever to do so for Manchester United in the competition.",
      "\"I felt I had my one, Rashy could get his goal from the penalty.\"",

      "\"When you get [two] at such short notice, two different penalty takers makes it harder for the opposition and the goalkeeper.\"",
      "It is not the first time Fernandes has handed the ball to Rashford for a penalty this season either. He also did so against Everton in the reverse fixture in November, which the England forward scored in a 3-0 win.",
      "He said at the time: \"I felt Marcus needed a little bit of confidence. He needs his goal. Marcus is an excellent penalty taker too, I was 100 per cent sure he could score that penalty.",
      "\"It's not about who takes it, it's about scoring the penalty and Marcus did it perfectly.",
      "\"I think obviously strikers and wingers need to score goals, it is part of their game. Marcus was unstoppable and he could take on everybody.",

      "Friday 8 March 2024 17:26, UK",
      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville is part of a task force that will explore the regeneration of Old Trafford, with Sebastian Coe heading up the project which aims to develop a \"world-class football stadium\".",
      "Coe, the former head of the organising committee for the 2012 London Olympics, will chair the 'Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force' which also comprises Sky Sports pundit Neville, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, and the chief executive of Trafford Council, Sara Todd.",
      "The project comes after Man Utd's new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe outlined his plans last month to either redevelop Old Trafford or build a new stadium that could host England matches, FA Cup finals and Champions League finals.",
      "A statement from the task force said: \"A joint task force has been created to explore options for regenerating the Old Trafford area of Greater Manchester, with the development of a world-class football stadium at the heart of the project.",
      "\"The 'Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force' will bring together local leaders and national experts to examine how stadium development can support renewal of an area of the city with rich industrial history and huge potential for the future, and deliver social and economic benefits for the entire region.",
      "\"Chaired by Lord Sebastian Coe, the task force will assess the feasibility of a new stadium of national significance equipped to host international games and finals, as well as providing a modernised home for Manchester United.",
      "\"Working in synergy with Trafford Council's Trafford Wharfside Framework, the project aims to support revitalisation of the area between Trafford Park and the banks of Salford Quays, and support the 'levelling up' agenda to drive investment in the north of England. It would also reduce the over-concentration of major sporting venues and events in London and the south-east.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has put together a 10-strong task force to examine the possibility of redeveloping the existing stadium or building a new ground, with former Manchester United captain Neville part of the panel.",
      "The 49-year-old said: \"I'm incredibly fortunate to have had the privilege of playing hundreds of games at Old Trafford, and no one can take away those amazing memories.",
      "\"But Old Trafford has evolved throughout its history and it's clear we are at a point where it has to change again to ensure that Manchester United has a world-class stadium befitting the world's greatest club.",
      "\"While I want the best for Manchester United, I also want the same for the surrounding community. Old Trafford should be a stadium that the whole of Greater Manchester can take pride in, and be a catalyst for sustainable, cohesive growth in an area of the city that has been neglected for too long.\"",
      "United have played at the 74,310-capacity Old Trafford since 1910 and Ratcliffe is hoping to build a 'national stadium in the north'.",
      "Lord Coe said: \"Throughout my career in sport, I have seen the potential for stadiums to become focal points for strong communities and catalysts for social and economic development. That was certainly true of the venues we built in eastLondon for the 2012 Olympics, and we are overdue a project of similar scale and ambition in the north of England.",
      "\"I am honoured to have this opportunity to share my experience in support of this tremendously exciting project.\"",
      "British billionaire Ratcliffe, who by the end of the year will hold a 28.9 per cent stake in United and whose INEOS company now controls football operations at Old Trafford, has supported Manchester United since the age of six.",
      "The 71-year-old said: \"This can be a major regeneration project for an area of Greater Manchester which has played such a key role in British industrial history, but which today requires new investment to thrive again.",
      "\"The north-west of England has a greater concentration of major football clubs than anywhere else in the world, yet we don't have a stadium on the scale of Wembley, the Nou Camp or Bernabeu.",

      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag is optimistic for the future at Old Trafford and says injuries have affected the outlook; Ten Hag's side host Everton in the Saturday lunchtime kick-off with Marcus Rashford and Jonny Evans declared fit",
      "Friday 8 March 2024 16:16, UK",
      "Erik ten Hag believes he may have won up to 75 of his first 100 matches as Manchester United boss was it not for an injury list he claims no team would be able to cope with.",
      "This has been a poor second season in the hotseat for the under-pressure Dutchman, who suffered a 3-1 defeat at rivals Manchester City last weekend as he brought up a century of matches in charge.",
      "Ten Hag had to field a patched-up team against the Premier League champions and absentee-hit United will again be without a host of first-team players for Saturday's clash with embattled Everton.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Jonny Evans have been passed fit after coming off in the Manchester derby, but Omari Forson has joined their lengthy list of injuries ahead of the weekend.",
      "\"That's the good news, (Rashford and Evans) recovered after the derby, so they are available,\" boss Ten Hag said.",
      "\"For the rest it is the same squad apart from Omari Forson. He dropped out. He has an injury.",

      "\"When the process will continue like it is now Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka I expect them to be available for our game against Liverpool. (Rasmus) Hojlund similar, yeah.\"",
      "Defeat in next weekend's FA Cup quarter-final clash against rivals Liverpool will end United's last remaining route to silverware this term.",
      "Ten Hag won the Carabao Cup in his first campaign and led the side to third in the Premier League - a far cry from their current place in sixth, 11 points off fourth-placed Aston Villa with 11 games to go.",
      "Injuries have played a key role in this season's drop-off and without such issues the Dutchman believes he would have won far more than 61 of his first 100 matches at the helm.",
      "\"It tells that we are in the right direction,\" Ten Hag said of his win ratio.",
      "\"So, imagine if we had many more players available, not so many setbacks in injuries, it could have been easily 70 or 75 wins and that tells the bright future of this team when players are available.",
      "\"Because if you compare it, you compare it with other managers or other teams who were in a build-up stage, or with previous managers in this big club, then you can see there is a bright future.",
      "\"Also, I think it's a good balance in ages in this squad, where young players, middle-aged players, experienced players together.",
      "\"Imagine when they are available. As I said, we could have easily win from 100 games 75 and that's a big difference I think with the stats you mentioned.\"",
      "Long-term absentees Lisandro Martinez, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia are others sidelined right now, unbalancing a side clearly lacking strength in depth.",
      "\"No team can deal with this, with so many injuries,\" Ten Hag added. \"I think we are playing to maximum levels if you take in the availability of the players.",
      "\"So, when you miss so many key players over many parts of the season, then obviously the results, the performances will not be (the same as) when the players are available.",
      "\"We have seen when the players were available like in January and February our performances were very good.",
      "\"And I think from that moment when the players were not even fit, they could have done even better when they are 100 per cent fit in that moment but they were not.\"",
      "Hojlund has won the Premier League Player of the Month award for February. The 21-year-old Dane enjoyed a fruitful month, scoring five goals and providing one assist in four Premier League games - all of which Erik ten Hag's side won.",
