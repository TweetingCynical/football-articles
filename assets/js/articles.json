      "Football icon David Beckham has shared his delight at launching his latest business venture in the United States after embarking on a surprise change of career.",
      "The 50-year-old, who retired from professional football in 2013, discovered beekeeping during the COVID-19 lockdowns five years ago and the hobby quickly became a passion of his. Now, it has evolved even further, with the England and Manchester United legend establishing his own honey-based snack line, Bee Up.",
      "Aimed at youngsters as a superfood substitute for traditional sweets, packets of the treats have now appeared on American shop floors, going on sale at retail giant Target. Understandably, Beckham was thrilled to see his product being sold, as he posted an Instagram snap of himself standing by a packed shelf and wrote: \"Swipe to see how excited I am seeing @beeupsnacks in @target\".",
      "Announcing the new venture earlier this year, the former Three Lions captain explained: \"My love of beekeeping and making my own honey began as a hobby and quickly grew into a passion. I built the hives with my sons, learned how to care for the bees, and mastered the art of harvesting one of nature's most powerful superfoods.",
      "\"As a father and former athlete, it's always been important to me to give my kids wholesome alternatives to sweets. That's why I created BEEUP-a new snack brand rooted in honey, my love for family, and active living.",
      "\"Whether it's early mornings, after-school sports, or weekend adventures, BEEUP delivers better energy-one delicious bite at a time. This time-tested superfood tastes delicious and provides the energy kids need - perfect for fueling up before practice, lessons, or games.\"",
      "Beckham discussed his newfound passion for beekeeping while being filmed for the Netflix documentary series about his life, which launched in 2023. The opening sequence of the programme showed him collecting honey from a beehive into at his lavish Cotswolds estate, while his wife Victoria watched on and playfully suggested he should market the honey under the brand name 'DB Sticky Stuff'.",
      "The football legend is no stranger to commercial enterprises, having built up an enormous personal fortune over the years with a string of major ventures beyond the football pitch supplementing the wealth he amassed during his playing career. The 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, published earlier this year, revealed that Beckham and former Spice Girl Victoria boast an eye-watering combined fortune of £500 million.",
      "Business Insider reports that the ex-United and Real Madrid icon had amassed an incredible $800 million (£587 million) by the time he retired from professional football 12 years ago. He once held the title of the world's highest-paid footballer, while the five-year deal he penned with LA Galaxy in 2008 would be valued at approximately £190 million in today's money.",
      "However, Beckham has also significantly boosted his personal wealth through a series of profitable sponsorships and business deals, having collaborated with major brands such as Emporio Armani, Gillette, PepsiCo, H&M, Breitling and Adidas over the years. He's also launched his own line of fragrances, while he's lent his name to everything from sunglasses to video games.",
      "The Netflix documentary is thought to have netted the former footballer around £20 million alone, while he pulled in an impressive £72.6 million in 2023 thanks to his sponsorships and production company. He also inked a 10-year deal to become an ambassador for Qatar, which reportedly saw him pocket around £125 million from the country.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The crowning glory of Brand Beckham, however, is his Major League Soccer team Inter Miami. When Beckham negotiated his move to LA Galaxy nearly two decades ago, he was offered the option to purchase an expansion team in any market for just $25 million. Today, with the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez on its roster, the franchise is now believed to be worth over $1 billion, doubling in value between 2023 and 2024.",
      "As well as raking in astronomical sums from his various ventures, Beckham is no stranger to spending big, with over a dozen properties making up his remarkable portfolio, which is estimated to be worth around £70 million. That includes a luxury penthouse in Miami, purchased for £17.5 million, as well as a London townhouse valued at around £30 million.",
      "The ex-footballer also boasts a 130-foot superyacht that reportedly cost him a whopping £16 million, while his impressive car collection is estimated to be worth over £2 million.",

      "Peter Schmeichel has slammed Manchester United for signing Senne Lammens ahead of Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer. United paid £18.2million for the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper in the summer transfer window after Ruben Amorim decided to replace Andre Onana.",
      "Onana has been shipped out on loan to Trabzonspor this season, with Lammens competing with Altay Bayindir for a place in the starting XI. Bayindir kept his place in the starting XI for the Manchester Derby on Sunday, but the 3-0 defeat means Lammens could make his debut against Chelsea this weekend.",
      "Lammens is 23 years old and has only ever played in Belgium, meaning the step up at United will be a big one. Schmeichel spent eight years at United and is one of the club’s best-ever goalkeepers. He isn’t convinced at all by United’s decision, having been unaware of Lammens before he arrived.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up,” Schmeichel told The Sun. “I know his stats are excellent across the top 10 European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“He saved four out of eight penalties, but recruitment based purely on stats is risky. Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.\"",
      "Lammens has never been called up to the senior Belgium squad and Schmeichel feels United would have been better off paying more for a more established player. They considered signing Martinez from Aston Villa and Donnarumma before he left Paris Saint-Germain for rivals Manchester City.",
      "“Lammens could turn out to be the best signing ever – but right now, it feels like a hopeful one, and that’s not what United need at this moment in time,” Schmeichel added. “If we’d signed him alongside Martinez, that would have made perfect sense: a proven World Cup winner as number one, with a talented young keeper developing behind him. But instead, we’re left asking who’s going to be number one.”",
      "United splashed £47m to sign Onana from Inter Milan two summers ago, but were unwilling to pay the £40m Villa quoted for Martinez, or the significant wages Donnarumma demanded. The position has been a long-term problem for Amorim, but United opted to spend over £200m on attacking additions Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko instead.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez. In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance,” Schmeichel said. “With Martinez, everything was lined up and that felt like really good news, because he’s exactly the kind of goalkeeper Manchester United should have.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jose Mourinho is the new Benfica manager, with his latest break from the game lasting less than a month. The former Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid boss was sacked by Fenerbahce at the end of August after just over a year in charge.",
      "His swift exit came two days after the Turkish club were eliminated from the Champions League play-offs…by his new employers Benfica, who have hired him on a deal until June 2027. Mourinho’s side were beaten by former Premier League manager Bruno Lage, but he was also dismissed this week following a mixed start to the new season.",
      "‘The Special One’, started his managerial career with Benfica in 2000 but lasted less than a season after falling out with the club’s president. Now 62, Mourinho returns to Benfica and is expected to take his first training session on Thursday.",
      "Speaking before his appointment was made official, Mourinho revealed he had no hesitation in going back to his former club. He said: “What I can confirm is that, before I caught the plane, Benfica asked me if I was interested in coaching them.",
      "“I said yes. I said I was abroad and that when I returned to Portugal I would have all the interest in talking with them. My nature is wanting to coach. I told myself that I wanted to balance myself emotionally.",
      "\"I didn’t want to say yes to the wrong club, just because I am a workaholic. When asked if I wanted to coach Benfica, I did not think twice. It interests me.”",
      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim's name had also come up in the wake of Lage's sacking, with his future at Old Trafford uncertain. The former Sporting manager has endured a dismal first year in England and has picked up just one win from United's opening four Premier League games.",
      "The United hierarchy insist they are continuing to back the manager, although another meeting is planned in three games' time, during the next international break.",
      "Capitalising on the speculation, Norohna Lopes - who is hoping to become Benfica's president - was asked about the possibility of landing the Red Devils boss.",
      "He said: \"Ruben Amorim? He's a great coach, he has a contract with Manchester United. I won't comment on that. Of course I like him. He's a great coach and a Benfica fan. I don't have a contract for Ruben to sign.\"",
      "Mourinho's return to Benfica also ends speculation over a move back to the English top flight. He has already had two spells with Chelsea, winning the Premier League three times, as well as managing Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "He had previously suggested he would be open to the idea of taking over a club not featuring in European competition, after several rows with UEFA.",
      "\"I think the best thing I have to do is, when I leave Fenerbahce, I go to a club that does not play UEFA competitions,\" Mourinho said. \"If any club in England from the bottom of the table needs a coach in two years, I am ready to go.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is facing a crucial run of games as he tries to save his job as Manchester United manager. Amorim is under huge pressure following United’s 3-0 defeat by Manchester City on Sunday which worsened his miserable record with the club.",
      "Defeat confirmed United’s worst start to a season since 1992/93 and meant Amorim’s record stands at eight wins from 31 Premier League matches since he arrived in November. The Portuguese boss knows such form cannot continue, with his side 14th with four points from four games.",
      "United have won just once this season, and even that game needed a late Bruno Fernandes penalty to beat Burnley. Their issues were blatantly obvious in their defeat on penalties by Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and Amorim needs immediate improvement, starting against Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday evening. Here are five things Amorim needs to get right in order to keep his job.",
      "The goalkeeping department has been a mess at United for some time. Andre Onana is gone, shipped off on loan to Trabzonspor, but that hasn’t solved the problem. Altay Bayindir has played all four Premier League games this season, but simply doesn’t look up to the level required.",
      "Amorim opted against throwing £18.2million signing Senne Lammens into the firing line for the derby on the weekend, but surely he can’t stick by Bayindir. United opted for Lammens over Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma, who went to City instead, so they clearly believe in the 23-year-old Belgian. Amorim can’t delay the decision any longer; talk of Lammens getting used to the different balls in England is laughable.",
      "Everyone knows it. There is no longer any originality in pointing out that United’s midfield does not function properly. Amorim has stuck steadfastly to his 3-4-3 formation, which sees Fernandes partner either Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte in a two-man midfield. It doesn’t work.",
      "Fernandes is United’s best and most creative player. He doesn’t want to be back defending deep and he is at his best playing further forward with creative licence. Casemiro, meanwhile, now lacks the mobility to get around the pitch and cover the gaps and Ugarte has also been unconvincing. Amorim doesn’t trust Kobbie Mainoo to play as a defensively-minded midfield, but something needs to change.",
      "The midfield issue stems from Amorim’s reluctance to adapt. He plays the same system regardless of the opponent. There was patience initially upon his arrival, with fans knowing it would take time for the players to get used to his ideas, but they are now fed up with it not working.",
      "“You talk about his philosophy, his style of play, the way he wants to play,” United legend Paul Scholes pointed out on The Good the Bad and the Football podcast this week. “There’s so many clever coaches in England and around the world, they work it out quite easily. They know exactly how United are going to play every week.",
      "“When the team sheet comes through an hour before the game you always wonder how your opponents are going to play, five at the back, four at the back? With Amorim, you know, everybody knows. It’s easy to play against and easy to work out as the coaches are that clever. Anyone in the Premier League can beat us.”",
      "On the face of it, Benjamin Sesko has endured a miserable start to life at United following a £73.7m move from RB Leipzig. He has made five appearances without scoring – a stark contrast to the likes of Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres at Arsenal, who he will obviously be compared to this season.",
      "Sesko got 21 goals for Leipzig last season, so has the ability to perform at this level, but he needs service. Bryan Mbeumo has been the best of the new arrivals, but hasn’t linked up well with the Slovenian centre-forward.",
      "Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker know a few things about strikers and believe he is being starved of supply. “He must be thinking; 'Any danger? Any chance of giving me something here'? Something to go after, some crosses,” Shearer said on The Rest Is Football podcast. Speaking about the derby, Lineker added: “He's making darting runs, but I felt for him a little bit. It's tough when you're not getting any service.\"",
      "Fernandes has constantly been forced to defend himself from pundits who believe he isn’t captain material. He did so once again this week, explaining his passionate personality while saying he won’t change. Amorim isn’t about to strip his best player of the captaincy, but he could do with him pulling his team-mates together.",
      "United don’t look like a team that are all pulling in the same direction and Fernandes throwing his arms in the air, arguing with the referee and generally wearing his heart on his sleeve doesn’t help. What United need is somebody who can inspire their team-mates and get them all singing off the same hymn sheet.",
      "Despite not playing in Europe this season, there isn’t any time for a team-building exercise, so muddy obstacle courses and paintballing are out, but Amorim could perhaps do with a clear-the-air team meeting.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Norwegian coach is currently out of work following his dismissal from Besiktas at the end of last month after they failed to qualify for the league phase of the Conference League, losing against Lausanne-Sport - another club under the Ineos umbrella like United - in the play-offs. His team managed just a 1-1 draw in Switzerland before suffering a damaging 1-0 defeat on home soil in Istanbul seven days later.",
      "It marked Solskjaer's maiden managerial stint since United showed him the door in November 2021. The ex-Red Devils striker had stepped away from the dugout for over three years before taking the reins at Besiktas, overseeing merely 29 fixtures during his brief Turkish adventure.",
      "\"He can come in, he can be a stopgap manager, interim manager, get players back onside.\" O'Hara elaborated: \"I believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, if you get him back in, go back to the formation that they were playing before, get the players back onside, give them a bit of freedom, and I think they can maybe just calm everything down.\"",
      "Several weeks on, O'Hara has reinforced that position. \"I can't believe Ruben Amorim is still in charge,\" he declared on talkSPORT this week.",
      "\"When are they going to let it go? When are they going to just... do what Sheffield United have done, just swallow their pride [and say] 'we got this wrong?'\" Sheffield United have recently made a managerial U-turn, with Chris Wilder stepping in to replace Ruben Selles, just three months after the latter's mutual agreement to depart from the Championship club.",
      "O'Hara concluded: \"Get Ole back in. They can't carry on doing this. They'll go down. They'll be playing Rotherham [United] next season.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho can expect a hostile reception this weekend when he returns to Manchester United for the first time since leaving for Chelsea.",
      "Garnacho is the first member of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' to return to Old Trafford, less than three weeks after his acrimonious exit. The winger, along with fellow outcasts Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia, was exiled by Amorim after asking to leave.",
      "For Amroim and United's hierarchy, Garnacho's talent and potential was outweighed by his ego and petulance, so they decided to cut their losses and cash in on the 21-year-old.",
      "On Saturday, Garnacho will be Public Enemy No.1 when he walks out of the tunnel at the Theatre of Dreams, a stadium where he was once lauded but where he is now seen as a traitor.",
      "Such was his standing among the loyal match-going United fans, they even adapted one of their most famous stadium chants – 'Viva Ronaldo' – a homage to Cristiano Ronaldo, replacing his name with that of Garnacho.",
      "But after Garnacho's messy departure from United, when he threw his toys out of the pram and Amorim under the bus after being benched for last season's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, he is now reviled, rather than revered.",
      "Whether Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca can succeed where Amorim failed and unlock Garnacho's hue potential, as well as instilling in him some discipline and humility, only time will tell, but United are not losing any sleep over allowing him to join a Premier League rival.",
      "Garnacho's demise at United began shortly after Amorim took charge, when he was axed from the squad for the Manchester derby last December, along with Rashford, after his boss felt he had failed to listen to instructions when coming on in a Europa League game four days earlier.",
      "Although Garnacho was then handed a reprieve, unlike Rashford, and won back his place in the United line-up, his card was marked with Amorim, with those who work closely with the squad on a daily basis claiming the Argentina international was never able to regain the trust of his manager.",
      "Garnacho's inflammatory public outburst about his omission from the Europa League final starting line-up was the final straw for Amorim, who left him out of the squad for United's final game of last season, a 2-0 home win over Aston Villa.",
      "That was the first major step in offloading a player deemed too troublesome and high maintenance to work with going forward. Concrete evidence of that came over the summer, when Garnacho posted on social media a picture of himself wearing a Villa shirt with Rashford's name and No.9 on the back.",
      "It was considered a provocative gesture and a dig at both Amorim and United, rather than a genuine show of solidarity to Rashford, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa.",
      "Both Garnacho and Rashford were at odds with United and the former's actions served only to strengthen the view within the club that he had to go, irrespective of his talent and potential.",
      "United fans generally do not like seeing talented academy players leave before they have had a chance to fulfil their potential, given the club's rich history is built on giving youth a chance, going back to the Busby Babes.",
      "But talent alone is not enough to succeed at United, as Garnacho found out. You need discipline, a strong work ethic and a mentality that puts the team above your own interests, qualities he failed to grasp or show in his five years at United.",
      "That is why there will be no love lost between him and 70,000 United fand when he walks out at Old Trafford on Saturday evening.",

      "Claims that former Manchester United star Phil Jones could be about to join Wrexham as a player or coach have been firmly shut down. Speculation was rife last weekend after the ex-England defender was spotted watching the Red Dragons' 3-1 defeat to Queens Park Rangers alongside the club's Hollywood co-owner Ryan Reynolds",
      "The sighting of the 33-year-old with the Deadpool actor in a hospitality box at the Racecourse Ground sparked rumours that he could be about to make a sensational return from retirement for Wrexham following their difficult start to life in the Championship. Jones left United in 2023 after 12 years at the Premier League club, spending a season out of the game before deciding to end his playing career.",
      "He has since taken up a coaching role with United's academy, with rumours also circulating that he could be about to make the switch to a position within Wrexham's youth set-up, or even be chosen as a potential successor to manager Phil Parkinson. However, those suggestions have now been rubbished by club director Shaun Harvey, who said Jones was simply there to enjoy the game as a guest and neighbour of chief executive Michael Williamson.",
      "\"Poor old Phil Jones came as a guest of Michael Williamson to the game, because they live very close together,\" the former EFL chief executive told the Fearless in Devotion podcast.",
      "\"If we had won that game on Saturday, nobody would have cared less that he was there. Then all of a sudden, it's 'What's this conspiracy that's going on,' because Phil Jones is watching a game.",
      "\"I can officially confirm that Phil Jones was enjoying his day at Wrexham long before the actual result, and wasn't there for any other purpose than to extend his learning experience as he's now a former footballer.",
      "\"There were probably other ex-footballers and ex-managers there who weren't in the Betty Buzz Suite, but it's just easy to build a story or a narrative that suits an agenda.\"",
      "Tipped as a promising talent early in his career, Jones completed a £16.5m transfer from Blackburn Rovers to United in 2011. He later lifted the Premier League title during Sir Alex Ferguson's final season at Old Trafford.",
      "Recurring injuries hampered much of his playing days, and the defender gradually slipped down the pecking order before leaving. At the start of the 2023/24 campaign, Jones took up a coaching position within United’s academy.",
      "Meanwhile, Reynolds has attended two Wrexham home games so far this season, but is yet to see his team win after witnessing a 3-2 loss to West Brom in August. Phil Parkinson's side have so far picked up just four points from their opening five games in the Championship, leaving them 21st in the table, just one point above the relegation zone.",

      "Theo Walcott says wily attackers will continue to play on Luke Shaw’s weaknesses after Roy Keane ripped into the struggling Manchester United star. Shaw and his team-mates endured a nightmare Manchester derby on Sunday as City cantered to a 3-0 win.",
      "Left-back Shaw, operating as a left-sided central defender, was outstripped by Jeremy Doku and then failed to pick up Phil Foden, who nodded home the first goal. The England defender was then easily held off by Erling Haaland for the second goal.",
      "Shaw came in for scathing criticism from Keane, who said the 30-year-old had been “getting away with murder for years” and called out his fitness record. The Old Trafford great fumed: \"Shaw, for the first goal. So Shaw is an international footballer. For him to get caught out like that…",
      "“I think Shaw has been getting away with murder for years at United. Always injured, never quite fit. We make excuses and then he gets a few games under his belt and then he's making decisions like he doesn't even want to tackle people.”",
      "Former Arsenal forward Walcott was more sympathetic to Shaw’s plight, insisting he will keep being exploited by top strikers like Haaland if he is played out of position. He instead questioned Ruben Amorim’s tactics, which he believes have left players like Shaw lost.",
      "Walcott told the It’s Called Soccer!: “When I look at someone like Luke Shaw, who’s an outstanding full-back… I’ve played against this man, he’s an England international for a reason, one of the best full-backs I’ve ever played against, and I’ve played against your Ashley Coles, your [Patrice] Evras. He’s up there physically because he knows what he’s doing at left-back because he’s played there for so many years.",
      "“[When] You put him at centre-half, smart players like Erling Haaland are going to play on that weakness. And there’s weaknesses all around there, players that aren’t comfortable and aren’t aware of their surroundings.",
      "“They’re second to everything, there’s a delay in everything because they’re unsure. I would be as well.”",
      "However, having backed him heavily in the transfer market, Walcott believes United must stick with Amorim for now. He added: “For me, it doesn’t work but they have to stick with him because they’ve gone this far, that’s the problem.”",
      "Amorim, who are 14th after winning just one of their opening four games, face another tough challenge when they host Chelsea on Saturday evening.",

      "This time, he will be playing for his new club, Barcelona, in their first Champions League game of the season, underlining how much his circumstances have changed. Amorim recalled Rashford during a period when he was being sidelined from the team following a disagreement with the Portuguese coach.",
      "After being dropped due to alleged poor training performances, Rashford found himself unexpectedly named as a substitute for United's final game of 2024 against Eddie Howe's side, his first appearance in five matchday squads.",
      "However, Amorim didn't hide the fact the 27-year-old's inclusion was purely down to a high number of injuries within the United squad. That merely highlighted the dire state of Rashford's situation at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford didn't make it onto the pitch as United tumbled to a 2-0 home defeat after early goals from Alexander Isak and Joelinton.",
      "Then, following a loan stint at Aston Villa, Rashford made a dream move to Barcelona on a season-long loan in the summer. Since then, he has been trying to adapt to Hansi Flick's style of play, while surrounded by world-class talent in a team with a completely different philosophy.",
      "After providing his first assist in Barcelona's 6-0 victory over Valencia last weekend, the England international will be hoping to impress his new manager and team-mates against familiar opposition.",
      "Rashford wasn't joined on the flight to the UK by teenage star Lamine Yamal, who has been ruled out through injury. In better news for Barca, Frenkie de Jong is available for the game after a groin issue.",

      "City shelled out approximately £26m to secure Donnarumma's signature, who was brought in as a replacement for Ederson – with the Brazilian heading off to Turkish side Fenerbahce. City's rivals United were also rumoured to be interested in Donnarumma as they looked for an upgrade for Andre Onana, who eventually also ended up in Turkey.",
      "However, speaking about his move to the Premier League, Donnarumma suggests that he only wanted to make a switch to the Etihad. Speaking ahead of City's Champions League match against Napoli, he said: \"I was very clear, my desire was to come here.",
      "\"That was my only option, the only thing I wanted. My only choice was to come here... so I am happy to be here at City and be part of this fantastic team.",
      "\"Before the summer I knew that City were very interested in me, the relationship strengthened after the Club World Cup.",
      "\"I knew the coach was pushing for my arrival here, everyone wanted me here, it gave me such pride to see such a demonstration of affection. I didn't hesitate to come here with great joy and enthusiasm.\"",
      "Donnarumma, 26, joined City following a highly successful stint with French giants PSG. After transferring from Italian side AC Milan, he went on to clinch four Ligue 1 titles and helped the club to secure their first-ever Champions League title.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has criticised the club's decision not to sign Donnarumma, branding it a \"criminal offence\". Speaking to the BBC, Scholes said: \"I don't think the quality is there [in the side].",
      "\"Goalkeeper was a major issue. Did they really need to get to the Grimsby game to realise [André] Onana is not good enough?\".",
      "\"If Manchester United were not in the market for Gianluigi Donnarumma when he became available, that is [a] criminal offence. The recruitment side went to buy forwards. That did need addressing, but did it need three of them? I'm not sure it did.\"",
      "Donnarumma, who has already made a positive start at Manchester United with a clean sheet in his debut 3-0 win against United, is looking forward to facing Napoli, a team he admits to having a soft spot for.",
      "He added: \"I am very tied to Napoli. I have so many friends and my family who live there.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been told he's put his Manchester United players in an uncomfortable position with his comments after their derby defeat at Manchester City. The Portuguese coach indicated he has no plans to change his approach despite underwhelming results, saying the higher-ups will need to find a new manager if they want that kind of hard reset.",
      "A 3-0 reverse at the Etihad Stadium left United with four points from four games and just one point clear of the relegation places. Across Amorim's entire reign, the total is 31 from 31 games, the lowest points-per-game return of any United boss in the Premier League era.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man,\" Amorim said after the City game. \"We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever.",
      "\"I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club.",
      "\"That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest (on whether United change manager). Until I am here, I will do my best. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.\"",
      "The pressure is mounting on Amorim as United prepare for a trio of games against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland before the international break. Whether or not the results in those games will bring about Amorim's dismissal, former Liverpool and Sunderland star Fabio Borini made his feelings clear about the language being used by the boss.",
      "\"It's harsh on even the players, at times, because the players maybe don't feel comfortable,\" Borini said on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast. \"Even the way he said, 'I'm really happy today because of the effort of every player,' that's standard, that's the bare minimum, you shouldn't be happy for that.\"",
      "Co-host Sam Allardyce then raised the subject of Amorim's conversations with his squad as well as his public words, asking: \"Is that because he wants out?\" Borini then replied: \"Do you think he can ask the players [their thoughts] or not?",
      "\"Culturally, I've seen that happen in Italy, the manager - when he's in a difficult position - he has his staff, he wants to also hear the dressing room's thoughts, which sometimes can be productive or counterproductive because [it depends] how well you take the dressing room opinion.",
      "\"Because sometimes you ask for an opinion and then it kind of backfires on you, and you say, 'Oh, I didn't like what they actually think.' Sometimes that's also the case [as a player], are you saying the things that you want the manager to hear or are you saying the things you're actually thinking.",
      "\"Because there's two different ways and I think both [happen] in my experience. The priority needs to be Manchester United... When [the captain] goes and knocks on the door, the priority is only Manchester United and not players or manager. It's difficult.\"",
      "Reference has also been made to the lack of European football this season giving Amorim nowhere to hide. Last season, a run to the Europa League final excused some domestic sins, but this time around it's all about what happens in the league - starting on Saturday against Chelsea.",

      "Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott claims Manchester United didn't need to sign Matheus Cunha. But Bryan Mbeumo will be pivotal for Ruben Amorim and will enjoy a better season.",
      "With just one win this campaign and a 3-0 embarrassment in the Manchester derby behind him, Red Devils head coach Amorim has seen enormous amounts of pressure begin to mount. The Portuguese manager was backed over the summer and was given a new striker in £74million man Benjamin Sesko, as well as two of the Premier League's most revered forwards in Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "The Cameroon international starred for Brentford and set United back an initial £65m, whilst Cunha cost £62.5m from Wolves. The Brazilian is currently nursing a hamstring injury, but Lescott thinks he's a player United could have done without.",
      "Mbeumo, on the other hand, is a star the ex-City centre-half believes could be a difference-maker this season and must play weekly. He also tipped the 26-year-old to have a better and more influential season than team-mate Cunha.",
      "\"I reckon Mbeumo has a more impactful season than Cunha,\" said Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"They don't need [a player like Cunha].",
      "\"They're trying to build, or probably rebuild now, by buying second-tier or third-tier players and creating the foundations that get you there.",

      "\"Mbeumo is more of a foundational piece to their puzzle than Cunha. They're now a mid-table team, not a mid-table club, and Mbeumo needs to play.\"",
      "Speaking about Mbeumo's hefty total £71m fee, he added: \"This might be a way to explain what I believe, how you value players. Their value shouldn't be value to both parties. It only has to be that value to one entity, whether it's United or whether it is Brentford.",
      "\"I'll use, say, Jack Grealish as an example, or even Harry Maguire. When Jack Grealish was leaving Aston Villa, he was worth more than £100m to Aston Villa. Because if he's not there, they go down.",
      "\"He may not be worth £100m to Man City, or whatever, and Mbeumo may not be worth £64m to Brentford, but he's worth that to Man United. To them, he needs to play and they do well, and so for me, that's the value.\"",
      "Mbeumo has started all of United's first four league games this season, scoring just one goal. His penalty miss saw them exit the Carabao Cup. Cunha has also played a starring role and missed a spot kick in the Grimsby Town defeat, but was substituted during their 3-2 win over Burnley with a hamstring issue.",
      "Whether he will be fit for their next fixture against Chelsea is unknown, but Amorim suggested he won't be on the sidelines for much longer and could return for Saturday evening.",
      "Speaking after the loss to City, he said: \"If you talk with Cunha, if you catch Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game [vs City]! So I don't know. We will manage day by day, but they are pushing hard, and that is a good thing.\"",

Thursday night's game will be Rashford's first taste of non-knockout Champions League football since a red card with Manchester United in 2023, and it was one of his current Barcelona team-mates who stole the show that night.",
      "Rashford showed he still has plenty to offer at this level of football when he impressed on loan at Aston Villa in last season's knockout rounds. He set up a goal in the round of 16 victory over Club Brugge and repeated the trick against PSG as Villa came close to a memorable comeback against the eventual champions.",
      "Back in the autumn of 2023, Rashford's dismissal against FC Copenhagen turned what looked like being a comfortable away win into a dramatic defeat. United led 2-0 through a Rasmus Hojlund brace when the England international landed on the ankle of Elias Jelert, with referee Donatas Rumsas showing him a straight red after a VAR check, and it was 2-2 before half-time.",
      "United retook the lead from the penalty spot midway through the second half, but they couldn't hold on. Lukas Lerager snuck in at the back post to make it 3-3, and Roony Bardghji - a week shy of his 18th birthday - completed the turnaround with his first ever Champions League goal.",
      "Fast forward two years, and Rashford and Bardghji could find themselves sharing a pitch for Barcelona as they look to get their European campaign off to a winning start. And he has had to do things the hard way.",
      "Bardghji, a Sweden Under-21 international, had been in high demand across Europe even before that match against United. The English club were one of a number in the Premier League keeping an eye on him, but a big move was put on hold in May 2024 when he suffered an ACL injury in training.",
      "\"We all feel for Roony, and everyone in and around the club will do everything we can to help him get back on the pitch again,\" Copenhagen's sporting director Peter Christiansen said at the time. \"Right now he needs to take it easy to process what has happened, but we all know him as a dedicated and deeply serious footballer who we know will come back even stronger.\"",
      "It wasn't until March this year that he stepped back onto the pitch. After sitting out the entirety of the regular season in Denmark, he came off the bench during the Superliga's Championship round as Copenhagen looked to chase down Midtjylland and lift the title.",
      "They did just that, triumphing by a single point, and completed a league and couple double at the end of May. Bardghji got minutes in the cup semis against Viborg but that would end up being his final game for the club, with injury keeping him out of the final before Barcelona clinched a cut-price summer transfer to ensure he joined them a few months before his contract in Copenhagen was set to expire.",
      "In his first interview as a Barcelona player, the winger - now 19 - said he has always been a Barca fan and always had the goal of joining the Catalan club. “I feel at home. I’ve fitted in really well with my teammates and I’m very comfortable,” he told club media.",
      "Bardghji made his senior debut for Barcelona over the weekend, starting in place of Raphinha as Hansi Flick's side romped to a 6-0 win over Valencia. The reigning champions' financial situation meant they had to wait to register him, but approval arrived during the international break and he's now ready to get up and running.",
      "With Yamal missing from the travelling squad, a first European opportunity could arrive sooner than anticipated. He's joined Rashford for the trip to Newcastle, but perhaps he's not yet ready to bring up their last meeting in the competition.",

      "Manchester United's nightmare is showing no signs of coming to an end. The club invested over £200million in new signings in the summer, but that has not paid any dividends as of yet.",
      "Following a shock second-round Carabao Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town, United were brushed aside in a 3-0 defeat in last weekend's Manchester Derby. Fans and critics had essentially written off last season, where manager Ruben Amorim led the club to their worst ever Premier League finish down in 15th place, and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur",
      "But Amorim's fortunes have not improved despite his exciting new additions. He now has the lowest win percentage of any permanent United manager since World War II, having suffered an 18th defeat in 47 games in charge on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has put OGC Nice up for sale, according to French outlet Ici. Ratcliffe and INEOS bought Nice for a sum of £89m (€100m) in 2019, with fans of the club initially hopeful that their financial muscle would help them become genuine contenders in a domestic league that has been dominated by Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "But that has not been the case, with Nice failing to finish above fourth under INEOS’ stewardship. Speculation grew over Ratcliffe looking to sell the club in March this year, when the billionaire admitted to The Times that he didn’t particularly enjoy watching Nice because the quality of football wasn’t “high enough” for him to get excited.",
      "He also noted that Nice's best campaign was last season, when INEOS were forced to adopt a less hands-on model due to multi-club ownership rules, admitting: “They’ve been so much better without our interference!”",
      "It’s now been claimed that Ratcliffe has put Nice up for sale, having been deemed to have forsaken the club since becoming United’s minority owner and heading its football strategy. The aforementioned report states Sir Jim is demanding £173m to part ways with the French side.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have been approached for comment by Mirror Sport.",
      "Manchester United may hold off on sacking head coach Amorim, even if they decide he is not the right man to lead the side until the end of the season. The Portuguese signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with the Red Devils less than a year ago on a salary of £6.5m-per-season.",
      "His contract also includes a 12-month extension, having been rushed into the role after United paid Sporting £9.2m to buy him out of his contract. And, according to the Daily Mail, the club would have to directly pay him £12m in compensation if they sack the 40-year-old before he reaches one year in the job.",
      "His coaching staff would also be in line for a pay-off. That means Ratcliffe and INEOS may look to hold off on dismissing him before November 1, after which his payout will decrease, potentially giving them a huge saving.",
      "Amorim’s next three games in charge against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland could essentially be the last chance to save his job. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe will be glad to save money, with the club having forked out an astonishing sum of over £54m in compensation on the five different managers they have sacked since Sir Alex Ferguson’s departure.",
      "Elsewhere, Newcastle are reportedly keeping tabs on Kobbie Mainoo’s situation and could make a move for the midfielder in the January transfer window. According to talkSPORT, Eddie Howe is known to be an admirer of the player.",
      "Mainoo, 20, wanted to leave United in the lead up to transfer deadline day after losing his place in the starting line-up under Amorim. But the Red Devils blocked their academy graduate from sealing a potential £50m move to Napoli, where Scott McTominay has thrived since leaving the Red Devils.",
      "The youngster was once again left on the bench ahead of Sunday’s 3-0 defeat in the Manchester Derby. That will have only added to his frustrations after playing just 73 minutes in the Premier League this season, despite being one of the first names on the team sheet under previous manager Erik ten Hag.",

      "Ruben Neves has hit a significant milestone with Al-Hilal, amidst rumours linking him to Manchester United.",
      "The 28-year-old is being touted as a potential addition to the Reds' midfield, as he enters the final year of his contract with the Saudi Pro League team. Earlier this summer, United had eyed Brighton and Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba as a possible central midfielder.",
      "However, his hefty price tag - thought to be around £100 million - led United to put their interest on hold for now. While they might reconsider a move for the 21-year-old next year, other names like Adam Wharton, Morten Hjulmand, and Elliot Anderson have also been mentioned.",
      "According to the Daily Briefing, Neves is keen on a return to European football after two seasons at Al-Hilal. He previously had a successful stint in the Premier League with Wolves, playing a crucial part in their promotion to the top tier in the 2017/18 season.",
      "The report suggests that Newcastle United and Tottenham are likely to compete for the player's signature, with Ruben Amorim reportedly showing particular interest in signing him.",
      "Despite the speculation, Neves seems focused on his current role in the Middle East, having recently reached 100 games for Al-Hilal.",
      "He acknowledged the club's tribute on Instagram with a simple blue 'love heart' emoji.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese channel Sport TV back in August, Neves expressed his desire to return to his childhood club, FC Porto.",
      "\"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive: that's my big goal,\" he declared.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28 years old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club, it's something I want to give them and experience [for myself].",
      "\"I used to go to the Aliados to celebrate Porto's titles but now I want to be on the other side and want to see my family celebrate.\"",

      "Tom Victor has been part of the Reach Sport team since 2021, writing across national and regional titles. He is based in London and reports on a range of sports, specialising in men's and women's football and tennis",
      "It took just one match away from Manchester United for Andre Onana to earn plaudits, and he's far from the first to thrive as soon as he moved away from Old Trafford. The Cameroonian goalkeeper ended up on the losing side on his Trabzonspor debut, but still earned plaudits after keeping his new side within touching distance of Fenerbahce while a man down.",
      "Former West Brom midfielder Okay Yokuslu was sent off in the 20th minute of the game, but only a solitary Youssef En-Nesyri goal - for which Onana was arguably at fault - separated the two sides. Onana, who only joined on loan from United in the week of the match, earned praise in the Turkish media for \"single-handedly\" keeping his team in the game.",
      "When explaining the decision to let Onana leave, United head coach Ruben Amorim hinted at the \"big brother\" qualities the Turkish press would end up pointing to after his Super Lig debut.\" He was really good on working, trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need to change the environment to return to your level, and I think that was the feeling not just for us but Andre as well,\" the Portuguese said.",
      "Onana is far from the only United player to thrive upon securing a move away. The most dramatic success story is surely that of Scott McTominay, whose performances for Serie A title winners Napoli have propelled him into Ballon d'Or contention.",
      "McTominay found minutes hard to come by in his final season in Manchester, even as he enjoyed some difference-making cameos - not least in a comeback victory over Brentford under Erik ten Hag. He has moved into a wholly different environment in Naples, though, as evidenced by the comments he made after that title win.",
      "\"The sacrifice that every single player in the group has put forward to the cause,\" McTominay said after Antonio Conte's side clinched top spot \"I'm lost for words. It's incredible.",
      "\"The people deserve it because they've been behind us from day one, and for me to come and experience this is a dream,\" he added. While Napoli were able to dig deep and make big sacrifices to earn the biggest prize in Italian football, the same hasn't been forthcoming at Old Trafford.",
      "McTominay might be an extreme example, but he's not the only one. Marcus Rashford felt he had nowhere to go at his boyhood club but thrived at Aston Villa, while even Jadon Sancho - without a minute of football in months after his relationship with former boss Ten Hag proved unsalvageable - played his part in runs to two European finals with Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea.",
      "Much has been made, too, of the fact that few players have seen their stock rise since joining United. It's not as if they have been bringing in misfits from elsewhere, either - these are footballers who have performed to high levels in different environments, only to struggle to replicate it in their new surroundings.",
      "Onana, like McTominay before him, might well be the latest reminder that no player can reach their full potential until the wider environment changes. And making that change, clearly, is no easy task.",

      "The 27-year-old, who departed Old Trafford on loan in the summer, is eager to revive his career after a brief stint at Aston Villa last season. In Spain, he suffered a sluggish beginning, managing no goals or assists in his opening three La Liga outings, fuelling whispers of a potential January return to Manchester.",
      "Chatting to Flashscore, who provide the latest bookmaker offers, Saha warned it could prove harmful for the player, who is desperate to silence his doubters. \"It would be extremely damaging for Marcus Rashford if Barcelona ended his loan,\" he said.",
      "\"Even the talks, the rumours are really bad already. The thing is that we know that he's back in the England squad, he has appreciation from people who know football and understand that there is a big World Cup coming soon. So I wish him the best. That's for sure that he needs to play, maybe better to shut down all these rumours coming from Barcelona.",
      "\"There is a moment where I see the rush for maybe sometimes from the frustrated side. There is a moment that he has to take control back of his career. Yes, you could find some excuses because things happened in Manchester and so on. But at some point you have to look at the mirror and there will be something that you are not doing and that's it.\"",
      "\"Whether you're chuffed or at ease discussing it, it's all well and good, but it's on the pitch where you need to really cement everything and ensure there's no room for doubt. There's a talented lad playing there, I don't reckon he's being questioned. There's something Rashford needs to do.\"",
      "Rashford chalked up an assist in Barcelona's 6-0 thrashing of Valencia last weekend, with Saha adding: \"It's a fresh start. It's a new environment. It's a different league, a new language. So there are loads of things you have to adapt to and people need to understand that.",

      "Despite a challenging time on the pitch for Ruben Amorim's team, who suffered a resounding 3-0 defeat to Manchester City in the derby on Sunday, the club continues to perform well commercially. After raking in £164million in revenues for the fourth quarter, their annual income reached a record-breaking £666.5m.",
      "The club also confirmed that these figures put them in a strong position regarding the Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). This will significantly boost their hopes of making a renewed bid for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "They could revisit their interest in the 21-year-old in 2026, as the club's midfield has been a noticeable weak spot. United have also been linked with a move for Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton as an alternative.",
      "Thanks to their robust financial performance, United will have some extra funds, which could be used to potentially move players like Baleba. Speaking on the Reds' financial results, CEO Omar Berrada stated: \"As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas.",
      "\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men's and women's first team squads over the summer, as we build for the long-term. Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",
      "\"We are also investing to upgrade our infrastructure, including completion of the £50m redevelopment of our men's first team building at Carrington, on time and on budget, following prior investment in our women's team facilities, to create a world-class environment for our players and staff.",
      "\"Meanwhile, planning continues to meet our ambition of developing a new stadium at Old Trafford as part of a transformational regeneration of the surrounding community. To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United.",

As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.\"",

      "Manchester United may be kicking themselves for not appealing after Grimsby were penalised for fielding an ineligible player in their legendary Carabao Cup second round triumph over the Red Devils. The Mariners were slapped with a £20,000 fine for playing Clarke Oduor in the memorable victory.",
      "Despite having grounds to file a complaint, United chose not to, allowing Grimsby to progress to the fourth round of the League Cup after defeating Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 on Tuesday evening.",
      "United manager Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat following the team's League Cup exit and the crushing 3-0 defeat in the Manchester Derby on Sunday. If United had appealed and been successful, they could have been facing off against Wednesday on Tuesday evening instead of Grimsby, who could have been booted out of the tournament.",
      "A tie against a team currently struggling in 23rd place in the Championship could have been just what the doctor ordered for Amorim. A game against Wednesday would have been seen as winnable and could have potentially put United in the fourth round, with dreams of Wembley glory providing a much-needed boost for the beleaguered boss.",
      "United are currently languishing in 14th place in the Premier League, one spot up from their final position last season, and have secured one victory in four matches this campaign. Amorim had been hopeful of leaving last year's disappointments behind, particularly following United's Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "However, despite an influx of new talent, United's midfield seems sluggish and their strikers are lacking service. Their defence appears increasingly vulnerable each week, as players struggle to adapt to Amorim's preferred 3-4-3 formation, a strategy that has yet to prove successful at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite these issues, the club reportedly still believes in Amorim's capabilities, although concerns are mounting. Reports state that some first-team squad members are beginning to question their manager, suggesting that the former Sporting CP boss is too rigid in his philosophy rather than focusing on improving results.",
      "United's decision not to contest Grimsby's continuation in the cup, while commendable, could serve as a pivotal moment for the club, given the favourable draw in the third round.",
      "Grimsby introduced Oduor against United in the second half of their cup tie, with the player having joined on loan just the day before from Bradford City. The club later discovered that the player had been registered one minute and 59 seconds after the 12:00 deadline.",
      "After United staged a comeback from 2-0 down, the match went to penalties. Oduor's penalty was saved by Andre Onana, resulting in Grimsby winning the lengthy shootout 12-11.",
      "However, Grimsby subsequently reported their own breach of rules. They stated that the \"club's non-compliance was not deliberate with no intention to deceive or mislead\".",
      "The League Two team was slapped with a £10,000 fine, with an additional £10,000 suspended until the end of the current season. The EFL stated that the decision to fine David Artell's squad was made after a \"comprehensive review of all the evidence and considering prior decisions taken in respect of offences in the League Cup\".",

      "On Wednesday, Martinez uploaded a photo of himself running on grass at Carrington alongside United physiotherapist Ibrahim Kerem.",
      "Martinez's knee buckled when he fell to the ground against Crystal Palace at the beginning of February, and it was confirmed he had suffered an injury to his cruciate ligament.",
      "United will continue to carefully handle Martinez as he enters the latter stages of rehabilitation and he will only be available for selection again when medical staff deem him to be fully fit and ready.",
      "The sight of Martinez skipping along the turf at Carrington is a boost, as the next step will be returning to full team training. However, United sources have been reluctant to put a timeframe on when Martinez will be available again, so it might still be a while until he joins the main group.",
      "It's understood Martinez will not return imminently and has some way to go with his rehabilitation.",
      "Martinez was spotted on a handful of matchdays at the end of last season. The 27-year-old joined the celebrations after beating Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford and he arrived with the squad, wearing a Paul Smith club suit, at the Estadio de San Mames for the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The defender also took part in the lap of appreciation at Old Trafford on the final day of the season. He was joined by his wife and newborn and was spotted waving at supporters.",
      "Martinez travelled to the United States this summer to continue his rehabilitation programme around the squad, which allowed him to still feel part of the group during his recovery.",
      "The Argentina international has had the challenge of overcoming a handful of injuries during his time in Manchester and will face the task of trying to win back his starting role in the XI when he eventually returns.",
      "Leny Yoro played on the left side of the back-three at the end of last season and delivered strong performances. The presumption was Yoro would continue in that position this term, but he has been permenantly relcoated to the right, with Luke Shaw chosen to start on the opposite side.",
      "Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby defeat, leading to calls to remove him from the starting XI and Martinez has an easier task to earn his role back now he is contending with Shaw.",
      "Martinez will be eased back into action gently, but if he can reproduce the kind of form that established him as a fan favourite then he will be able to lock down the left-sided role.",
      "Shaw could have done better for each of Manchester City's goals. He had performed well up until that game, but most would agree that Martinez is a better fit for the role.",
      "Martinez is a natural centre-back and Shaw has been playing as an auxiliary left-sided central defender. It's been interesting that Amorim has not considered Shaw as a serious option for left wing-back.",
      "The potential spanner in the works is that Martinez still needs to prove he is still the same player who won fans' hearts in 2022/2023. Martinez was outstanding in his first season, however, he has suffered injuries and hasn't strung together a similarly consistent run of performances.",
      "Having said that, there were positive glimmers last winter with Martinez showing a different side of his game by contributing four goal involvements between mid-December and January.",
      "Martinez's pass for Amad's winner at the Etihad was exceptional and his goal against Liverpool at Anfield was another highlight. United have missed Martinez's proactiveness and his spirit in the dressing room.",
      "United fans will be delighted to hear that Martinez is on the comeback trail. It might be a while until he returns, but it will be a relief when he is available again.",

      "Peter Schmeichel believes Ruben Amorim was wrong to suggest Manchester United need to sack him if they want change.",
      "Speaking after the Manchester derby defeat, Amorim was asked whether he would change his approach after United's worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/1993.",
      "Amorim responded: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "United's head coach has stuck by his system, but Schmeichel thought Amorim made a mistake in his post-match press conference because he 'put himself above the club'.",
      "In an interview with Sky Bet, Schmeichel reacted to the Manchester derby defeat, which increased the pressure on Amorim's shoulders at a time when he needs to secure positive results.",
      "Schmeichel explained: “You always have to look at what the manager’s job is; you’re employed to win football matches. At Manchester United, that also means winning trophies, and right now he’s not doing that.",
      "\"His win percentage is around 36%, which is the worst performer of any United manager since World War II. Sticking by his guns obviously isn’t working. Bruno Fernandes said after Sunday’s game that it’s very difficult to play in midfield when you’re always one man short, because you can’t cover the ground.",
      "\"The system might look good when it works, but it hasn’t worked yet. And I don’t think the system itself can be the most important thing. For me, the art of coaching is to get the maximum out of the players you have available. Right now, it’s clear not all of them are playing to their potential.",
      "\"They look confused, sometimes disorganised, especially at the back. That’s where the manager has to take a look and change something.",
      "“I say this because I was at United during a rebuilding phase, when we were moving towards winning trophies and the Premier League. Certain standards were always in place.",
      "\"The main one was simple - no one is ever bigger than the club. That applied from the manager down through the players and staff. If someone tried to go their own way and it didn’t work, it couldn’t continue.",
      "\"That was drilled into us every single day. Sir Alex Ferguson gave us a framework that was very simple and easy to understand. It started with not conceding goals, and then it was about recruiting players who could both defend under pressure and take risks going forward.",
      "\"Guys like Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, myself behind them, Paul Parker and Denis Irwin as attacking full-backs. It worked because it was simple, and because of the mentality and quality of the players.",
      "“Right now, I don’t think we’re getting the quality out of the players we have. They can do more. The manager has to change his ways. I didn’t like what he said the other day – 'If you want change, you have to change the coach'.",
      "\"I like him a lot, I like his leadership qualities, and he came in during a very difficult period with unwanted players and dealt with it well. But as a Manchester United person, I don’t like that sentence. That’s putting yourself above the club and I don’t like that.”",
      "Schmeichel continued: “You only have to look at Sunday’s game at Manchester City to see how unhappy Bruno Fernandes was. He can look frustrated at the best of times, but this was different – he was really unhappy.",
      "\"And understandably so, because Manchester United were outnumbered in midfield throughout the game. The thing about Bruno is simple - why do we have him? Because he’s a world-class player on the ball.",
      "\"He creates, he spreads play, he scores goals. But you don’t score goals from deep. I’d much prefer to see him higher up the pitch. He’s never been a number six, he hasn’t got the legs for it, and it’s unfair to ask him to do that job because it takes away from his real strengths.",
      "“Now, I know people sometimes complain about former players being critical, and I hold my hands up – I’m one of them. But I’ve been there. I know what it takes, how much you have to invest, how much you need to be at 100% in everything you do.",
      "\"Nobody likes criticism, but this isn’t personal. When we talk about these things, it’s about suggesting what could make it better. It comes from love for the club, not for the headlines.",
      "“Bruno is the captain, and he speaks for the players, so of course it’s uncomfortable when there’s this kind of debate – but it’s necessary. United have new people in charge – Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Christopher Vivell – all of them new, without deep Manchester United knowledge.",
      "\"That’s why voices like mine, Roy Keane’s, Gary Neville’s, Paul Scholes’s matter. We’ve been there, we understand what it takes, and when we see things going in the wrong direction, it’s important we speak up to help, and at least make the people in charge think about it.\"",
      "United are next in Premier League action against Chelses at Old Trafford on Saturday evening.",

      "Manchester United are in talks to appoint former Manchester City staff member Alan Wright.",
      "Wright would join the academy to coach in the Professional Development Phase group, which includes players aged Under-18 to Under-21 who are developing into full-time footballers.",
      "The former Premier League defender spent 10 years coaching City's U16s before taking a job at a sports agency in February 2024.",
      "Wright worked closely with Jason Wilcox, who is now the director of football at Old Trafford, during his time at City, but it's understood Travis Binnion advised Wright for the role.",
      "Binnion is known to supporters as the U21 manager, but his official title in United's academy is head of player development and coaching, which reflects his large responsibility in the youth set-up.",
      "The appointment of Wright has not been finalised, but he is expected to take up the position.",
      "Wright has a UEFA A Licence and played a small part in creating more than £350 million of revenue in sales for City during his time coaching in their academy, which has built a reputation for exporting talent.",
      "Wright played more than 300 games for Aston Villa and also represented Blackpool, Blackburn Rovers, Middlesbrough, Sheffield United, Cheltenham Town and Fleetwood Town during his career. Binnion played alongside Wright at Sheffield United before being forced to retire early due to injury.",
      "Torpey is another former City academy employee. He joined City in 2014 and gradually worked his way up in their academy to become the head of coaching between the Under-15 and Under-23 age groups, a role in which he oversaw trophy wins.",
      "He played a role in the development of Cole Palmer, James McAtee and Rico Lewis, who all progressed through the academy system at City to make senior debuts under Pep Guardiola.",
      "Torpey worked closely with Wilcox during their time together at City. The newly appointed U21 assistant manager, David Horseman, also worked with Wilcox when they were employed by Southampton.",
      "Dave Hughes left his position as U21 assistant to become Newport County manager, which created a vacancy.",

      "United do not play this midweek after failing to qualify for any UEFA competition last term and following their League Cup second round exit to Grimsby Town. However, there is no shortage of focus on them following their 3-0 defeat to Manchester City in the derby.",
      "Even though the summer window has closed, transfer talk has remained with Ruben Neves emerging as the latest midfielder of interest. Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton have also been linked with moves to Old Trafford.",
      "We will cover all the latest transfer news and rumours, plus any further developments on Amorim's future and other more general club updates with our live blog below.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is being considered by Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr, according to reports from Spain.",
      "The Brazilian's deal expires next summer, meaning he will be available to depart the club as a free agent. Casemiro's arrival in Erik ten Hag's first transfer window has been heavily criticised, particularly with him signing a four-year deal.",
      "While he impressed in his first campaign under Ten Hag, the Real Madrid legend's dynamism has often been questioned, particularly within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. However, Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo understands Al-Nassr, who Cristiano Ronaldo plays for, are considering a move for the 33-year-old.",
      "Manchester United are considering a move for Brentford midfielder Yehor Yarmolyuk, who is a cheaper alternative to Carlos Baleba.",
      "Midfield has emerged as a glaring weakness for Ruben Amorim's side. The Red Devils were interested in a move for Baleba, but pulled their interest not long after Brighton and Hove Albion said he could cost £100million.",
      "Reports from Ukrainian outlet Dynamo.kiev.ua claim the Red Devils have been impressed by Yarmolyuk's performances for the Bees. It also claims United are \"serious contenders\" for the 21-year-old, who may cost around £30m.",
      "Amorim has been insisting on deploying his 3-4-3 formation with Bruno Fernandes operating as one of the two defensive midfielders in his system. It has so far been exposed on multiple occasions and was painfully picked apart by City at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "Peter Schmeichel has blasted Manchester United for getting rid of Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The former Red Devils duo are both starring for Napoli, with the latter recently scoring on his debut for the Neapolitans. Meanwhile, McTominay was named as the Serie A MVP last season, after winning the title with Antonio Conte's side.",
      "Looking back on the decisions, Schmeichel admits he cannot understand why the club parted with the duo. Speaking to Sky Bet, Schmeichel said: \"I’d say Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund are the two players who should never have left.\"",
      "He added: \"The one that really pains me is Hojlund. I honestly believe he could have been a 25-goal-a-season striker for Manchester United.",
      "\"The problem wasn’t him – it was the way the team played. The system didn’t suit him. When players like [Alejandro] Garnacho or [Marcus] Rashford got the ball, they looked only to shoot. The ball into the number nine never came, even though Rasmus was making really good runs.\"",
      "When referring to Scott McTominay, he added: \"As for McTominay, I honestly can’t say anything other than: why? Why was he allowed to leave?\"",
      "Paul Scholes believes Manchester United need to part with Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.",
      "The United legend was commenting on the Red Devils' 3-0 defeat to Manchester City the previous weekend. Shaw started as Ruben Amorim's left-wing-back, while Maguire came on from the bench against Pep Guardiola's side.",
      "For City's first goal, Jeremy Doku got the better of the ex-Southampton defender, who then failed to track Phil Foden's run before the England international headed in the opener. Speaking to Sportbible, Scholes said: \"I don't think the system was the problem against Manchester City.",
      "\"It's more the personnel. United lack real athletes. In the Premier League, you almost have to be like a machine to survive, and we've got people like Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.",
      "\"They are not at the level. In 85 to 90 percent of games, they will probably cope with people.",
      "\"But when you come to the bigger games, against City, Liverpool and Arsenal, they are going to fall short.\"",

      "TBR Football have now stated he is becoming irate regarding his predicament at Atletico Madrid with just two starts out of a possible five made. Their report did state he is happy, though.",
      "This comes following updates from journalist Graeme Bailey over Gallagher possibly moving elsewhere in January.",
      "As with many players at this moment in time, the World Cup is an added complication or worry.",
      "Gallagher is one of those players who, if playing regularly, at his best, would be firmly in contention for his national side, so that issue can’t be overlooked.",
      "I am told the player would dearly like to make it back into the Atletico Madrid side and that is his priority, but clubs are paying real interest to him and he is very much one to keep an eye on for January.",
      "Chelsea may be sweating on the availability of Cole Palmer ahead of their Premier League clash against Manchester United.",
      "The Blues' talisman made his first start in nearly one month against Bayern Munich and scored for the second consecutive game after grabbing a goal in the 2-2 draw with Brentford off the bench last weekend.",
      "He played the full 90 minutes at Allianz Arena and appeared to be holding his groin in the latter stages of the clash. When asked about that, Enzo Maresca said: \"Cole, I think he's okay. I asked him after the game, he said that he's okay.\"",

      "Speaking to Versus Radio, Bittar has stated that Leon is “happy with how he is enjoying it, being the first Paraguayan at Manchester United.\"",

      "Fortunately, I'm 28 years old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club, it's something I want to give them and experience [for myself].",

      "It’s only been a few days of training, but he seems like a really good lad. He’s calm, but a strong personality. His goalkeeping fundamentals are very impressive, and I think I said that to him after a couple of days of training! Twenty-three years old coming into Manchester United, first few days training and he’s been very impressive so far.",

In my opinion we are talking about a player with great potential and he is only 22, so he has a whole career ahead of him.

I think you have to push it to the point that if there’s no immediate danger to be relegated, you give him time to build something and work with the players.",
      "\"They will need to get results. They will need to get stuck in. There’s a lot of things which, you put that together and it’s difficult to see the bright side, but you have to be patient and stick with your decision until the point where you say: this is going to work or it’s not going to work. I think it’s too early to make that decision yet.\"",

      "Some Manchester United fans are now calling on Ruben Amorim to start Mainoo against Chelsea on Saturday as the Reds look for just their second win of the season. The Stockport-born midfielder has featured for only 73 minutes in the league this campaign, having remained an unused substitute against Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "\"He came on the other day against Man City and I thought he did well, at least he had a go. But he needs to be playing for them from the start, but I don't know why. For me, it's quite worrying because the kid has got talent, he is a Man United lad, come through the ranks and he is not playing. He is the only one that can answer that.\"",

      "The United boss is under increasing pressure after they collected just one win from their first five games of the season. United spent £216million on new signings in the summer transfer window and CEO Berrada believes that the club is set up for future success.",
      "On Wednesday, United announced their financial results for 2024-2025, boasting record revenues of £666.5m. In a statement, ex-Manchester City chief Berrada said: \"As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas. On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men's and women's first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long term.\"",
      "Berrada's comments suggest that the United hierarchy still believe Amorim is the man to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford. But following Sunday's comprehensive 3-0 defeat in the Manchester derby, reports emerged claiming that United are already assessing options to replace him.",
      "The Mirror also add that Amorim effectively has three games to save his job before October's international break.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos are set to make an announcement very soon that could have a major impact on Man United. The Ineos businessman completed a £1.25bn deal to acquire the Red Devils in February last year.",
      "Previous reports have claimed that Ratcliffe is ready to sell his stake in Nice, while some reports have claimed that an announcement could be on the way. As per French outlet Ici, an announcement from Ineos is expected 'in the coming days'.",
      "The content of the statement is still under wraps but Nice boss Franck Haise has called for clarity from the current owners. Speaking recently, he said: \"Lots of us are waiting for the owners to speak. I hope that it will happen. But it isn’t my subject. My subject is the players, the staff, the matches, and the season. It is the only thing I can impact. The subject of the owners isn’t mine.\"",
      "Despite that, Ratcliffe’s influence has waned over recent years. UEFA's multi-club ownership rules preventing Ineos from investing in the side last season.",
      "Read more here.",
      "The Daily star claim that four managers are among the potential replacements should Amorim leave Man United.",
      "United have collected only four points from their opening four Premier League games, leaving them 14th in the table. United will host Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday, before travelling to Brentford and then facing newly-promoted Sunderland at home ahead of the international break.",
      "According to the report, Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner, former England boss Gareth Southgate, Fulhamchief Marco Silva and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, are viewed as potential replacements.",
      "United defender Lisandro Martinez has teased his return from injury with an image of him training on the grass at Carrington.",
      "Since February, the 27-year-old has been sidelined with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and has been a huge loss for Ruben Amorim. Taking to Instagram on Wednesday afternoon, Martinez posted an image of him undergoing individual training with a member of staff.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is said to have initially preferred a move to United over City this summer.",
      "The journalist Rory Smith said on BBC Radio 5 Live during the Monday Night Club.",
      "I’m not 100% certain of this, but what I have heard, which isn’t always accurate, is that Donnarumma preferred United over City initially, because of the glamour of United, but United couldn’t get close to the money that he wanted, and City could, so he was perfectly happy to do that.",
      "David Ornstein has acknowledged not knowing of any set number of matches Ruben Amorim has to save his job as United head coach.",
      "The journalist said on Tuesday night's edition of Back Pages:",
      "I think it's logical to understand that this can't continue. I don't know about a set number of games. I don't think United are minded to be changing manager again already."

      "Manchester United legend Bryan Robson believes Ruben Amorim needs to be tactically flexible.",
      "Amorim oversaw the worst season at Old Trafford for 51 years following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon in November. Amorim needed to start the new campaign well, but United have made their worst start to a season for 33 years and speculation has begun about his future.",
      "United suffered a 3-0 defeat against Manchester City last weekend, which means Amorim has the worst win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "Amorim said: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "Some fans believe Amorim's system was never a good fit for the club, while others have suggested the 40-year-old change his formation to secure results and ease pressure.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United legend Robson spoke to OLBG and shared his verdict: \"I feel as a manager you have to have a few tactics up your sleeve. Otherwise people know how to set up against you.",
      "\"If you're playing the same way week in, week out, the opposition, and especially with all the technology and everything nowadays, you can go out on the training pitch and you set yourself up to do well against a team. That's why I feel he's got to be a bit more flexible.",
      "\"Most top teams in the Premier League now are nearly always playing with a back four and so for me, if you’re playing with four at the back instead of three, you can mix it up a little bit more as well.",
      "\"Some people think about the old fashioned 4-4-2 but then I quite like 4-3-3 when you’ve got good forwards. I think United are still capable of doing that, going with the back four.",
      "\"Whatever the manager wants to set up, if it's with the back five, you have to get off to a good start and score the first goal and then counter attack against teams. I think it's a good system then.",
      "\"If you're chasing the game, I always feel that you're lacking a midfield player or a forward so you're short in numbers because you've got the five at the back.",
      "\"I would like to see him be a bit more flexible but it looks like he's got his mind and he said it all last season that he's got his mind set on the back five so it's up to him and the players to show that they really can play in that system.",
      "\"They need to take on board what the manager's trying to achieve and pick it up as the season goes on because it is still early in the season and we have played against two very good teams who are going to be up there challenging for the title. So it has been quite a difficult start.\"",
      "Robson is one of the finest midfielders to have represented United and he also shared his thoughts on Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "\"Back in my days, Paul Ince was an underrated player and great to play with because Ince was quick, he could tackle, he was a really good passer of the ball and I think Ince was a very underrated player,\" said Robson.",
      "\"Why he was underrated is because the United fans were not pleased that he fell out with Sir Alex and then he went to Inter and he came back and played for Liverpool, so all the Man United fans didn’t like that, a Man United player who's done really well going to Liverpool.",
      "\"I definitely do (think Mainoo could be the next Ince). When I heard that Mainoo might be leaving the club, I was really against it. I think he's a real talent. Last year, he had quite a few injuries and couldn't get going but the year before that, he was outstanding and he looked as if he had great potential.",
      "\"As long as he keeps his feet on the ground and works really hard at it, he could be a really good player. I know he's more attacking but Mainoo can do the defending if you put it on him, and that's what he's got to do.",
      "\"He's got to get his overall game a little bit more established and then I think he would go really well with Bruno being the more advanced midfield player.\"",
      "Last season was stop-start for Mainoo due to a few small injuries and concerns about where he fits into Amorim's system. Amorim played the midfielder in different positions, even using him as a false nine.",
      "Mainoo relocated to the deeper midfield role in pre-season this summer, but Amorim raised eyebrows when he said Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes for a start.",
      "The youngster subsequently requested to leave on loan in the final days of the window, which was denied.",

      "United may have signed three new forwards, a left-back and a goalkeeper during the summer transfer window, but a lot has been said about the need to sign a new midfielder. Brighton star Carlos Baleba was heavily linked with signing for United, but a move never materialised with the Seagulls reportedly demanding a fee in excess of £100million for the Cameroon international.",
      "With the summer transfer window now closed, a fresh report has now emerged claiming that United are interested in Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves. A report in the Daily Briefing has claimed that a €20million (£17million) deal could be on the cards with Neves apparently keen to return to Europe.",
      "This is not the first time that United have been linked with signing Neves. Reports first emerged back in 2018 claiming that United were interested in signing the Portugal international during his time at Wolves.",
      "Neves signed for Wolves in 2017 and helped the club secure promotion to the Premier League, before eventually playing a key role in helping the Molineux outfit also qualify for the Europa League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Neves made 253 appearances for Wolves, scoring 90 goals, and has since featured 60 times for Al-Hilal since making the switch to the Saudi Pro League back in 2023. A move for Neves now would come seven years after United were first linked with the midfielder.",
      "United would certainly benefit from a new option in midfield. What will be key is how determined United are to sign Baleba, and if they have a realistic chance of getting a deal over the line.",
      "If the answer to that is 'no', then the club will consider their options - and links to Neves may stick around. Neves has already outlined his desire to return to his former club Porto before he retires.",
      "\"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive: that's my big goal,\" he said last month.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28 years old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club, it's something I want to give them and experience [for myself].",
      "\"I used to go to the Aliados to celebrate Porto's titles but now I want to be on the other side and want to see my family celebrate.\"",

      "His rapid departure came 48 hours after the Turkish outfit were knocked out of the Champions League play-offs by his new employers Benfica.",

      "'The Special One' commenced his managerial journey with Benfica in 2000 but endured less than a full campaign after clashing with the club's president.",
      "Now aged 62, Mourinho makes his return to Benfica and is anticipated to oversee his inaugural training session on Thursday.",
      "Speaking prior to his appointment being formally confirmed, Mourinho disclosed he had no reservations about returning to his previous club.",
      "He said: \"What I can confirm is that, before I caught the plane, Benfica asked me if I was interested in coaching them.",
      "\"I said yes. I said I was abroad and that when I returned to Portugal I would have all the interest in talking with them. My nature is wanting to coach. I told myself that I wanted to balance myself emotionally.",
      "\"I didn't want to say yes to the wrong club, just because I am a workaholic. When asked if I wanted to coach Benfica, I did not think twice. It interests me.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim, the current Manchester United manager, has also been mentioned as a potential successor following Lage's dismissal, with his future at Old Trafford looking uncertain. The ex-Sporting boss has had a challenging first year in England, managing to secure only one victory from United's initial four Premier League matches.",
      "Despite this, the United board maintains their support for the manager, with another review scheduled after three more games, during the upcoming international break.",
      "In light of the ongoing speculation, Norohna Lopes, who is vying for the Benfica presidency, was questioned about the likelihood of securing the Red Devils' boss.",

      "The return of Mourinho to Benfica also puts an end to rumours of a comeback to the English top tier. He has already had two stints with Chelsea, clinching the Premier League title thrice, in addition to managing Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "Previously, he hinted at being open to leading a club not participating in European competition, following several disputes with UEFA.",
      "\"I think the best thing I have to do is, when I leave Fenerbahce, I go to a club that does not play UEFA competitions,\" Mourinho stated. \"If any club in England from the bottom of the table needs a coach in two years, I am ready to go.\"",

And it appears as though the England international settling into life at the Camp Nou well, if his latest social media post is anything to go by.",
      "With Barcelona heading to St James' Park to face Newcastle United in the Champions League at 8pm on Thursday evening, Rashford took to social media to share a matchday graphic which featured himself, Pedri and Pau Cubarsi. Underneath the three, the poster also read: \"Un dia de partit,\" which translates to \"matchday'.\"",
      "It's also the name of a song that Barcelona fans sing at games, showing the immense bond between the club and its supporters. While it is unknown as to whether Rashford will get the nod to start on Thursday evening ahead of Raphinha or Lamine Yamal, the Englishman has certainly hit the ground running in Spain.",

However, he will hope to make an impact on familiar soil on Thursday evening given the chance.",
      "Unbeaten this season, with three wins and a draw to their name, Barcelona head to Tyneside in high spirits as they hope to kickstart their Champions League campaign in style. They will play a Newcastle side which has struggled to get going in the Premier League this term, after a difficult summer transfer window.",

      "Another 0-0 stalemate with Leeds United followed, before Woltemade came to the rescue against Wolves at the weekend to hand his new club a 1-0 win on home soil. Newcastle's clash with Barcelona isn't the only Champions League clash that Premier League fans will have their eyes on.",

      "The 50-year-old former England captain, who retired from professional football in 2013, discovered beekeeping during the COVID-19 lockdown five years ago and the hobby rapidly developed into something much more significant. The passion project has now evolved into a fully-fledged commercial enterprise, with the Manchester United legend establishing his own honey-based snack company called Bee Up.",
      "Designed for youngsters as a nutritious substitute for traditional sweets, the products have now arrived on American shop floors, going on sale at major retailer Target. Understandably, Beckham was thrilled to see his goods on display and he marked the moment with an Instagram post of him stood in front of a packed shelf, which he captioned: \"Swipe to see how excited I am seeing @beeupsnacks in @target\".",
      "Announcing the venture earlier this year, the former Three Lions captain explained: \"My love of beekeeping and making my own honey began as a hobby and quickly grew into a passion. I built the hives with my sons, learned how to care for the bees, and mastered the art of harvesting one of nature's most powerful superfoods.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"As a father and former athlete, it's always been important to me to give my kids wholesome alternatives to sweets. That's why I created BEEUP-a new snack brand rooted in honey, my love for family, and active living.",
      "\"Whether it's early mornings, after-school sports, or weekend adventures, BEEUP delivers better energy-one delicious bite at a time. This time-tested superfood tastes delicious and provides the energy kids need - perfect for fueling up before practice, lessons, or games.\"",
      "Beckham discussed his passion for beekeeping whilst being filmed for the Netflix documentary series about his life, which was released in 2023. The opening scenes of the series featured him collecting honey from a beehive at his lavish Cotswolds estate, while his wife Victoria looked on and playfully suggested he market the honey as 'DB Sticky Stuff'.",
      "The football legend is, of course, no stranger to commercial enterprises, having built an enormous personal wealth through various strategic moves beyond the football pitch, supplementing the vast fortune he made during his playing career. The 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, published earlier this year, revealed that Beckham and ex-Spice Girl Victoria boast a staggering combined fortune of £500 million.",
      "Business Insider reports that the former United and Real Madrid midfielder had amassed an impressive $800 million (£587 million) by the time he retired 12 years ago. At his peak, he commanded the highest salary in world football, whilst his five-year deal with LA Galaxy signed in 2008 would equate to approximately £190 million today.",
      "However, Beckham has also significantly boosted his personal wealth through a series of profitable sponsorships and business deals, collaborating with major brands such as Emporio Armani, Gillette, PepsiCo, H&M, Breitling and Adidas over the years. Additionally, he's launched his own line of fragrances and lent his name to a range of products from sunglasses to video games.",
      "The Netflix documentary is thought to have netted the former footballer around £20 million alone, while in 2023 he amassed an impressive £72.6 million thanks to his sponsorships and production company. He also inked a 10-year deal to serve as an ambassador for Qatar, which reportedly earned him around £125 million from the country.",
      "However, the crowning glory of Brand Beckham is his Major League Soccer team, Inter Miami. When Beckham negotiated his move to LA Galaxy in 2007, he was offered the option to purchase an expansion team in any market for just $25 million. Today, with superstars like Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez in the squad, the franchise is now believed to be valued at over $1 billion, doubling in worth between 2023 and 2024.",
      "In addition to earning astronomical sums from his various ventures, Beckham is no stranger to lavish spending, owning over a dozen properties that make up his remarkable portfolio, estimated to be worth around £70 million. This includes a luxury penthouse in Miami, purchased for £17.5 million, as well as a London townhouse valued at approximately £30 million.",
      "The ex-footballer also boasts a 130-foot superyacht, which reportedly cost him around £16 million, and his car collection is estimated to be worth over £2 million in total.",

      "Benfica held the Turkish outfit to a goalless draw at the Chobani Stadium before running away 1-0 victors in Lisbon. Despite securing the Eagles' qualification to Europe's top-flight competition, Bruno Lage was sacked shortly after their opening league phase match.",
      "On Tuesday night, Benfica lost to Qarabag at the Estadio da Luz. The Portuguese giants squandered a two-goal lead, with Oleksiy Kashchuk firing the Azerbaijani champions ahead in the final minutes.",
      "Lage was sacked the following day and the Benfica president confirmed that he intends to appoint a new manager by Saturday. Speaking to reporters, Rui Costa said: \"A Benfica coach's profile must be that of a winner.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"A coach representing a club of this size must be one with the ability to bring this team to the levels we demand and give us the titles we desire. There's no point in talking about names here. No coach has been appointed, nor has any coach been mentioned to represent Benfica in the future.\"",
      "Mourinho was quickly linked with a long-awaited return to Benfica, and now he looks set to put pen to paper. On Wednesday afternoon, the former United boss was mobbed by journalists at the Tires Aerodrome – an airport just outside of Lisbon.",
      "While Mourinho kept his cards close to his chest, he didn't hide his interest in the vacancy. As quoted by Portuguese outlet A Bola, the 62-year-old, draped in a Benfica scarf, said: \"Before boarding the plane, they asked me if I might be interested.",
      "\"And I said yes, I might be interested. Benfica officially asked me if I might be interested. I said I was abroad and that when I returned to Portugal, I'd be happy to speak with people.",
      "\"When I was faced with the possibility of coaching Benfica, I didn't think twice: I'm interested,\" asserted Mourinho, who then paid his respects to his predecessor. \"He needs to do what we all do –grieve,\" he added.",
      "\"I don't think there's a coach who doesn't leave frustrated and thinking things could have turned out differently. I look at him with immense respect and solidarity because I went through the same thing. And not long ago.",
      "\"What I said about him a month and a half ago, I repeat – he's a great coach who had a group of important players whom I congratulated. And they know I'm not exactly a great example of fair play.\"",
      "Mourinho added: \"Congratulating them, telling them that the best won and deserved to win, wasn't easy. He knows Benfica very well, he played against this team three times, he often praised the squad, he said I was happy, he will be even more so with Sudakov and Dodi [Lukebakio] arriving.\"",

      "Manchester United suffered a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Phil Foden scored the opening goal in the 18th minute, finding the corner with a header after some excellent work from Jeremy Doku.",
      "Erling Haaland scored early in the second half and then added another with just over 20 minutes remaining to take the game away from United.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Bayindir's confidence is shattered",
      "Altay Bayindir wanted the ground to swallow him up when he conceded the third goal. Haaland finished with ease to net his second of the game and a desolate Bayindir stared at the turf.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted on the halfway line trying to get Bayindir's attention. Mbeumo was screaming at his goalkeeper, trying to tell him to keep his head up, and he eventually got the message across.",
      "Ruben Amorim confirmed at his pre-match press conference that Bayindir would start, despite making mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. That backfired because Bayindir was shaky from the first whistle.",
      "He was a bundle of nerves and went down to the ground far too easily for Haaland's first goal. Mbeumo sensed he was low on confidence after conceding City's third and tried to encourage him.",
      "It feels like only a matter of time before Senne Lammens is the first choice goalkeeper.",
      "City fans do the Poznan",
      "City fans brought out The Poznan after going three goals ahead. The fans in front of the press box turned around in glee to face journalists and the dance spread around the entire lower tier.",
      "United only trailed by a goal at the interval and could have found a way back into the contest, but they capitulated in the space of 15 minutes and a lot of fans in the away section started to leave early.",
      "Amorim has overseen some humiliating defeats and a 3-0 loss to City will be added to the catalogue.",
      "The terrace exchange",
      "Former City director of football Txiki Begiristain was shown on the big screen. He received warm applause from the home support, but United fans responded: \"You cheating b*******, you know what you are.\"",
      "There was another rendition of the chant just minutes into the contest, but City fans fired back after taking the lead through Foden, singing their own version of the Amorim chant.",
      "\"Crying from the Stretford End... He'll turn the Reds around,\" they taunted before reverting to \"Old Trafford is falling down, Amorim is a f****** clown. Glazers staying 10 more years\".",
      "There was a debate on a radio station about whether United and City are still proper rivals, but you only need to listen to matchgoing fans to know that was a stupid suggestion.",
      "United fans who work with City supporters will dread going to work this morning.",
      "United need more leaders",
      "Noussair Mazraoui went down with an injury just outside the City box at the start of the second half and Doku approached him to gesture that he was exaggerating the extent of the issue.",
      "City fans whistled at Mazraoui while he took his time to get back to his feet. Leny Yoro began to make his way over, seemingly looking to protect his colleague from Doku's rant.",
      "Yoro was the only United player to offer protection to Mazraoui. The dressing room needs more characters like Yoro.",
      "The midfield is a problem",
      "The decision to start Ugarte raised eyebrows. The midfielder had been hooked at half-time against Grimsby Town after failing to track back for their first goal and was an unused substitute against Burnley.",
      "Amorim was expected to continue with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but he handed another chance to Ugarte because he felt the 24-year-old's pressing ability and energy would be valuable.",
      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",
      "The midfield is a problem for Amorim, but United didn't believe that area was a priority in the summer.",
      "Beautiful tribute for Hatton",
      "The death of legendary boxer Ricky Hatton was announced on Sunday morning. Hatton was a lifelong City supporter and was expected to attend Sunday's derby.",
      "There was a minute's applause held for Hatton prior to the game and the players wore black armbands. Both sets of fans joined in with the tribute and chanted together: \"There's only one Ricky Hatton.\"",
      "Hatton was a proper Mancunian icon and it was heartwarming to hear City and United fans sing his name together.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim defended his decision to play Bruno Fernandes in central midfield for the fourth game running at Manchester City.",
      "United lost 3-0 at the Etihad to leave them with four points from their first four Premier League games, their worst start to a season since 1992-93.",
      "Fernandes has dropped back into midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who had occupied the two playmaker roles before Cunha suffered an injury against Burnley two weeks ago.",
      "Amorim picked Amad alongside Mbeumo behind Benjamin Sesko while Fernandes was partnered by Manuel Ugarte, having started alongside Casemiro in the previous three league outings.",
      "United only have three out-and-out central midfielders in Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, with the latter yet to start in the league this term.",
      "\"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",
      "\"I am trying to do different things, trying to imagine the game. And then when you don't win, it doesn't work, you take the critics. But that's it.\"",

      "Amie is a football writer covering clubs across the country, she has been a football fan all of her life and supports Leicester City. She graduated with a degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology in 2015. Amie has previous experience in local radio in Leicester and Leicestershire.",
      "It has been a disappointing start to the Premier League season for Manchester United.",
      "One win, one draw, and two losses in their first four games of the season have left them in 14th place in the table, with four points from a possible 12 available. A 3-0 loss against rivals Manchester City on Sunday afternoon was one to forget for United fans.",
      "It has also raised questions again about Ruben Amorim's future. The summer transfer window saw the club spend around £200 million on new players, including striker Benjamin Sesko and forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The first games of the campaign have, however, shown the problems that remain in the squad. With the summer transfer window now closed, work will have to be done in January to address those issues.",
      "Amid growing pressure on his position, Amorim may already be looking to the work he can do when the window reopens if he is still at the club. Addressing problems in the winter window could relieve some of the pressure on the Portuguese boss.",
      "Here’s a look at what a dream January window could look like for Amorim and United.",
      "There’s no doubt that midfield reinforcements should be the priority for United going into the January window. The club did make moves for players in the summer.",
      "Brighton’s strong not-for-sale stance on Carlos Baleba caused them to walk away from any potential deal. But United could potentially try again in January in the hope that the Seagulls may be more open to a sale.",
      "If that’s the case, then negotiations could start, with an agreement between all parties hopefully being reached. The arrival of Baleba could potentially help give Bruno Fernandes more freedom, even if he is playing in a deeper midfield role.",
      "Another player linked with United in the last few days is Nottingham Forest’s Elliott Anderson. The player caught the eye with his performances for England against both Andorra and Serbia in the international break.",
      "The former Newcastle man has shown how he can control games and dictate the play, something that United have been missing so far this season. However, like with Baleba, a deal may not be easy to do with Forest, who will be keen to keep hold of a key player, especially during the first transfer window with Ange Postecoglou at the helm.",
      "Away from midfield, one other area where United probably need more cover is at right-back. Currently, Diego Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are the two recognised right-backs in the squad.",
      "An injury or suspension to just one will leave United short on options. United have again been linked with an interest in Inter’s Denzel Dumfries.",
      "The full-back has recently admitted that he would be open to a Premier League move, and would add experience and quality to that side of defence.",
      "If United did complete the signings of both Baleba and Anderson, or two deeper midfielders in the January window, then it would allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave the club on loan for the second half of the season. The midfielder outlined his desire to leave on a temporary deal during the summer, but United refused.",
      "If the club can add to their midfield options, then it would free up the academy graduate to go out and get regular game time.",
      "Another player who could go out on loan is Tyler Fredricson. Lisandro Martinez is expected to be back from injury in the next couple of months, if the centre-back can get up to speed quickly then it would provide enough defensive cover to allow the 20-year-old to go out and get more games.",
      "Chido Obi could be a third candidate to go out on loan. After making his United debut last season, the striker is yet to make a matchday squad this season, and has been back playing for the U21 squad.",
      "A loan deal could see him get more of a taste for first-team football in the second half of the season, and hopefully return a better player.",
      "One player who could leave permanently is Tyrell Malacia. The full-back was linked with a move away in the summer, but a transfer never materialised.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Goalkeepers: Senne Lammens, Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton",

      "Despite being highly regarded in his native Portugal for his outstanding work at Sporting Clube de Portugal - ending their 19-year league title drought and leading them back into Europe - the last few months in England have not been easy for him.",
      "Outsiders are keeping an eye on his situation and reports in Portugal claim he is being considered as a potential manager for Benfica.",

      "Ethan Williams has described the chance to play for Manchester United during the pre-season tour as \"life-changing.\"",
      "United travelled to the United States to compete in the Premier League Summer Series this summer, preparing for the new season with friendlies against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Ruben Amorim included a handful of youngsters from the academy in the travelling tour squad. Williams made the cut and scored his first senior goal in a 4-1 win against Bournemouth.",
      "In August, Williams signed for Falkirk on a season-long loan. The forward made 17 appearances during his six-month loan with Cheltenham Town last term and will now try to develop his game in Scotland.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Record, Williams said: “I played about 15 minutes against Bournemouth in Chicago in the summer. We won 4-1 and I scored. The whole team was really warming to me and the other young players. To play and score on tour was life-changing. Something I will never forget.",
      "“Coming off the back of that, getting the opportunity to play here in a good league against good teams is really important to me. I just can’t wait to get my foot in the door and start pushing for starts.\"",
      "Explaining his move to Falkirk, he said: “I’d been speaking to the manager (John McGlynn) and his coaches for quite some time over the summer. Going on tour with United it was quite difficult, communication wise. But once it was set in motion I was ready to come here. I’m happy to be here.",
      "“It’s always good to know that a manager trusts you. For him to come to me and be interested is quite flattering. I’m proud to be here.",
      "“The team has had back-to-back promotions and want to play aggressive football against the top teams. It’s a style I like as a winger. That’s what sold it on me.",
      "“The Scottish Premiership is a very good league, comparable with leagues in England. My first experience of it was good. It was a really proud moment and I’m thankful the manager trusts me and gave me minutes.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as United's Under-18 manager in the summer, but his previous role involved keeping tabs on academy prospects and reporting on their progress.",
      "Williams discussed his relationship with Fletcher, adding: \"I’ve been a United fan for a long time. Him being in the team with the likes of Ronaldo and Rooney, they were the glory days of Man United.",
      "“It’s quite an unreal experience when you step back and think ‘wow’ I’m actually talking with Darren Fletcher. It’s a mad experience for a young kid. But being up here and around it is a good thing.",
      "“Darren was one of the first team assistant coaches, he’s with the U18s now but I’m in contact with him. He knows the game and is a big part of Manchester United. He’s someone that is looking to help me in my journey.",

      "Legendary former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has revealed he had “never heard of” Senne Lammens prior to the Red Devils being linked with him, and has told the club who they should’ve signed instead.",
      "United were told throughout the summer that their goalkeepers were not up to scratch. For a man who reached a Champions League final with Inter Milan, it was hard to tell Andre Onana had been close to that level.",
      "As such, in the final days of the summer, he was replaced by Lammens and loaned out to Trabzonspor.",
      "Pior to Lammens’ signing, though, there were links with Emiliano Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma. The former has won the World Cup and the latter the Champions League.",
      "Schmeichel feels those are the ilk of players United should have signed, instead of 23-year-old Lammens, from Royal Antwerp.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez. In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance,” he said.",
      "“With Martinez, everything was lined up and that felt like really good news, because he’s exactly the kind of goalkeeper Manchester United should have.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up.",
      "“I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.”",
      "Lammens has a fantastic save percentage, but has never played in a top-five league, has featured in the Champions League just once, and is yet to make his national team debut for Belgium.",
      "He is still yet to play for United despite being in place for their last Premier League game – the 3-0 loss to Manchester City.",
      "Indeed, Altay Bayindir was preferred between the sticks, despite rumours he could have been allowed to leave in the summer, and the goalkeeper having made mistakes during his time in the United net.",
      "When Lammens does get his first crack is unclear, as most would have expected he’d have been in immediately after his signing.",
      "In any case, Schmeichel was disappointed that he was the man signed, not a better option, and having one of the best players ever in your position, at the club you now play for, already on your back, is not a good start.",
      "Peter Schmeichel has questioned Manchester United letting a pair of stars leave the club, and he “hopes” one of them scores “25 goals” to show them what they’re missing.",
      "The brother of new Man Utd signing Senne Lammens attempted to stop him from joining the Red Devils but the Premier League club “gave him the best feeling”.",

      "He said: “With Antony, it’s different. He was never good enough for Manchester United. Yes, he scored on his debut, but very quickly you could see he didn’t have what it takes for the Premier League.",
      "“In Holland, playing in a dominant team, he looked good. But at United, the pace is relentless from the first minute to the last, the pressure is constant, and every opponent raises their game. To succeed here, you need something extra, and he didn’t have it. He’s moved on, and we wish him well.",
      "“The one that really pains me is Højlund. I honestly believe he could have been a 25-goal-a-season striker for Manchester United. The problem wasn’t him – it was the way the team played. The system didn’t suit him. When players like Garnacho or Rashford got the ball, they looked only to shoot. The ball into the No.9 never came, even though Rasmus was making really good runs.",
      "“The fans saw it. They loved him because he fought, he ran, he gave everything, and he had to play every game because there were no other strikers. Of course, when you don’t score as a striker, people point to it again and again. But what more could he do without service?",
      "“I’ve seen what he can do when he’s on form and gets the right service. That’s why I’m glad it’s only a loan. I hope he scores 25 goals, and that people at Old Trafford are then thinking: ‘We have to bring him back.’",
      "“With [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo now providing service, and Bruno [Fernandes] playing further up the pitch, I still believe he could be a fantastic striker for Manchester United. He’s already scored after just 30 minutes for Napoli, which shows his quality. He’s still our player, and that’s the positive.”",

      "‘Even one of his staunchest allies, captain Bruno Fernandes, is believed to be unhappy operating in a deeper midfield role.’",

      "“So it’s not the midfielders because, again, if you feel that what you are going to do in the first goal has to do with the amount of midfielders. Doku receives the ball, turns to the defence and then takes two guys inside the box. Then the second half, we start really well with two midfielders.",
      "“You are near the box controlling the game and then throw-in, goal. Third goal, you are controlling the game, trying to open the game, Bryan has a great opportunity, Amad is pushing on the side, we had some distraction with going to the ball, Haaland has all the field to run so it’s not to do with the midfielders.",
      "“It’s the way you want to see the games. I saw a lot of teams playing here [at the Etihad Stadium] with five midfielders just blocking and they suffer more than us. I see a lot of games from Manchester United playing here with a lot of midfielders.",

      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "The bookies aren’t often wrong so we’ve gone through the top 10 favourites to become United’s next manager.",
      "Frankly, it’s a s*** list. Bad enough to think that maybe 3-4-2-1 might work in the Championship after all.",
      "Please, Ruben. Just consider for a second that there might be a better way. Otherwise United should be bringing either the ex-England manager or a Barcelona legend back into management.",
      "Here’s how we’ve ranked the 10 current favourites to replace Amorim…",
      "",
      "Carrick failed to meet expectations at Middlesbrough in the Championship. Which makes a mockery of the fact that, at the time of writing, he’s third favourite for Amorim’s job.",
      "Of course, that’s down to his United legacy as one of the finest midfielders of the modern era. He also served as a coach and retains an unbeaten record as caretaker boss. Carrick’s link to United’s glorious past will always stand out on his CV. But the rest of it needs expanding and polishing before he can be considered a credible candidate for the top job at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Nuno’s stock has probably never been as high despite being sacked by Nottingham Forest. He left the City Ground after falling out with a man who falls out with everyone eventually, with Forest back in Europe for the first time in 30 years on his watch.",
      "Which is very commendable. Just not commendable enough to give him the keys to the Manchester United clown car.",
      "He would be far better off at West Ham.",
      "",
      "The nearly man of Dortmund has been out of work for over a year having left his boyhood club in the wake of their Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. Prior to that, he was a game away from winning the Bundesliga before blowing it spectacularly on the final day in 2023.",
      "Since leaving Dortmund, Terzic has spent his time preparing for his next opportunity, tapping into others’ knowledge to make sure he’s ready for wherever that might be. It was thought the German was on United’s list when they moved for Amorim.",
      "But Terzic seems to be looking for a project, the time for which he would never be afforded at Old Trafford.",
      "We have him pegged for Aston Villa.",
      "",
      "It was thought that Nagelsmann was only passing through international football and that he would be looking for a return to club management after the European Championships on home soil last year.",
      "But he then extended his stay to next summer’s World Cup, and subsequently signed a contract to manage Germany at Euro 2028. Presumably, he’s having a whale of time.",
      "So United would struggle to get the one-time coaching prodigy away from managing his country, especially given the mess he would be walking in to. That’s that then.",
      "",
      "The German won the FA Cup with Crystal Palace – a marvellous achievement that makes him an Eagles legend. Beating City also made him pretty popular at United. But it doesn’t make him qualified to put out the Old Trafford bin fire.",
      "Those lobbying for Glasner also point to the fact that he’s had success with 3-4-2-1, which Amorim is more wedded to than his wife. But Glasner would suffer the same as Amorim from the woeful lack of a midfielder than holds the system together.",
      "Doubtless Glasner would deserve a step up if he was to leave Selhurst Park. But there would have to be a bridging club between Palace and United.",
      "",
      "Much of what we think about Glasner applies to Iraola too. The Spaniard has done a wonderful job with Bournemouth. But Manchester United – especially THIS Manchester United – is a different proposition altogether.",
      "Iraola’s success at Bournemouth has come from high-press, high octane football. Which we know the current United squad is not built for.",
      "Would he get the time and breathing space to get them up to speed? Not a f***ing chance.",
      "",
      "Emery has already curried favour at Old Trafford by relieving United of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. Though that goodwill must be tempered by concerns over the Spaniard’s judgement if he really believed signing Sancho to be a good idea.",
      "Emery has done a very fine job at Villa, taking a once-proud club flirting with relegation back in to the Champions League, all the while dealing with restrictive budgets and an unsustainable wage bill.",
      "Which makes Emery an ideal candidate. And given the general feeling of uneasiness at Villa Park right now, the timing could be perfect.",
      "But, for reasons we’re struggling to explain, it’s a very difficult proposition to get excited about. Perhaps it is the memory of his attempt at succeeding Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, from which he has bounced back from superbly. His subsequent body of work at Villarreal and Villa has restored his reputation. And no one at Old Trafford should be looking down their nose at the 53-year-old. So any lack of anticipation would probably say more about United’s perception of themselves than it does about Emery.",
      "🚨 Top 10 available managers: Nuno to be in demand as ex-Man Utd bosses seek jobs…",
      "",
      "Pochettino has had his fingers burned by United before, who might have hired the Argentine to replace as many as three of their previous managers. But every time, they have gone in a different direction.",
      "All of which led Pochettino to the United States job. And it is very difficult to imagine him walking away from that gig less than a year from hosting a World Cup.",
      "But not impossible. It seems that Pochettino and the United States remain to be convinced by each other, and if United finally make a serious play for the former Spurs, PSG and Chelsea boss, he might be tempted. He might also fancy telling them to shove it after multiple missed opportunities in the past.",
      "Out of sheer curiosity, we would be up for this.",
      "",
      "“I won’t coach in the next year, for sure. I’m certain of that,” said Southgate. A year ago…",
      "The ex-England boss doesn’t spark much excitement among United fans. Actually, we’re not sure he prompts any. But in that respect, he’s in very good company on this dreary list.",
      "His brand of football with England was hardly swashbuckling, but that is not what United need right now. First they have to stiffen up before they can zhuzh it up.",
      "Had his mate Dan Ashworth not been binned after 20 minutes as sporting director, Southgate may already have been fitted for his club blazer. And he is one of very few among the candidates who have experience with the level of scrutiny being United boss brings.",
      "On paper, after his success with England – let’s not pretend his record makes him anything else – Southgate has the credentials. He’s available and, according to his own timetable, he should be good to go. After the tacticians, maybe it’s time for the statesman.",
      "",
      "Xavi has already managed one giant basket case. Quite successfully too. While juggling financial levers, the Catalan guided his boyhood team to the La Liga title in his first full season in charge.",
      "He left after his second, initially of his own accord then the club’s, and Xavi spent last season on sabbatical. The 45-year-old is ready, though, for his next gig having used his break to broaden his coaching horizons.",
      "Yeah, why not? Xavi has a track record with one of the game’s big beasts and as one of the greatest midfielders in the modern game, his playing career ought to make him beyond reproach among the players.",

      "Amorim believes he’s “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must be similarly confused as to why he’s not playing in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He’s been told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte. And what has Fernandes done to merit his spot in the team over him other than scoring a last-minute penalty against Burnley?",
      "Mainoo is currently the second biggest stick to beat Amorim with aside from his failing philosophy and formation. It works in Mainoo’s favour with regard to his supporters and champions that his absence from the team is directly linked to that system, and very much against Amorim in the minds of those believing he should be sacked by Manchester United. Not only are they terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It’s not a good look.",
      "United may have been a mess before Amorim arrived, but Mainoo was brilliant, for them and then for England at Euro 2024, and his cameo against City goes to show that very same dynamic, skilful player is still in there.",
      "It remains to be seen whether it’s a performance which will push Amorim to stick him in the starting lineup against Chelsea, but that surely won’t be the case if he sticks to his either/or stance vs Fernandes. He’s not about to drop the United captain.",
      "The obvious suggestion amid United’s poor start to the season and the decision not to grant Mainoo’s wish to leave the club on loan at the end of the transfer window is that he need only wait out Amorim to play regular football again.",
      "Guardiola’s admiration, along with longstanding interest from Chelsea, links to Real Madrid and recent rumours of a January move for his services by Newcastle suggests Amorim is one of very few managers not valuing Mainoo’s quality enough to rely on him as a key cog in a starting lineup.",
      "Most, we suspect, would be building the team around him.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be sacked and replaced by former Red Devils head coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, according to reports.",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "Solskjaer to replace Amorim at Man Utd? Hey, he ‘knows the club’. But he also did the first time. Also, what happened to Lampard at Chelsea again?",
      "Manchester United have been told to sell Bruno Fernandes and build around Kobbie Mainoo, but they face the ‘most excruciating’ outcome.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford."

      "“It’s a pretty easy decision. This is my club. I have a lot of emotions and feelings. I’ve come with a belief I can come and help the cause until the end of the season. I’ll give my utmost to give the fans what they want.”",
      "Not the imagined words of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when he takes back the Manchester United reins during the October international break, but those of Frank Lampard in April 2023 as he returned for an interim spell at Chelsea two years after his sacking, for a two-month nightmare which should serve as a warning to the man now being mentioned as a possible replacement for Ruben Amorim.",
      "“This is the worst Man United team I’ve seen,” Jamie O’Hara said on talkSPORT. “Honestly. I can’t believe Ruben Amorim is still in charge, honestly, when are they going to let it go?",
      "“When are they going to just…do what Sheffield United have done, just swallow their pride [and say] ‘we got this wrong?’ Get Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] back…get Ole back in. They can’t carry on doing this. They’ll go down. They’ll be playing Rotherham next season.”",
      "We can understand why Solskjaer would be seen as an attractive short-term appointment by some fans. What you could never say about his Manchester United is that they weren’t entertaining. His tactics board featured no coloured magnets and simply had ‘United Way’ written on it in permanent marker, with the old ‘go out there and express yourselves’ mantra clearly evident in what was some fantastic football to watch at times. The best since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Sure, “Ole’s at the wheel” was shouted back at them by goading scousers when Liverpool spanked them 5-0 at Old Trafford, but for a fair while the Manchester United fans chanted it with nothing but joy in their hearts at seeing one of their favourite sons leading them by playing a similar – if significantly less polished and gritty – style to that which saw him win nine major trophies in his playing career at Old Trafford.",
      "There’s no chance United would offer him anything but an interim role until the end of the season. Like Lampard upon his return to Chelsea having been sacked by Everton, Solskjaer is currently picking up the pieces of his managerial career after just 29 games in charge of Besiktas. And as evidenced by him not being good enough the first time, there’s only so much benefit to ‘knowing the club’.",
      "United hiring a manager whom they’ve already sacked once would be a bad look. But it wasn’t the INEOS regime that got rid of him and assuming they won’t make the same grave ‘now or never’ ultimatum error to force Amorim to take permanent charge mid-season, we could absolutely see them plumping for an appointment in a bid to get the fans back onside, with that fanciful ‘Manchester United DNA’ so far removed from the current football being played that it’s no longer even part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Solskjaer would also usher in the return of 4-3-3, which may be United’s best bet of getting back into Europe with the current crop of players, many of whom have now taken against Amorim’s doomed formation and philosophy, and would presumably welcome Solskjaer’s – let’s call it fluid – style.",
      "But we would urge Solksjaer when asking himself ‘why wouldn’t I?’ to consider Lampard at Chelsea.",
      "“I’m not getting ahead of myself,” Lampard said when asked about what the future might hold at the end of the 2022/2023 season. “I want to do the best I can to impact the club in this period and we will see what happens afterwards.”",
      "He arrived believing it possible he would be handed a permanent contract. He won one and lost eight of his 11 games in charge and Chelsea scored just nine goals, and left that role with many of us wondering whether that would be that for him in management before showing his worth at Championship level with Coventry.",
      "We imagine Solskjaer is poised for the United call. We can’t imagine a world in which he refuses an offer to return. But while the worst outcome for United would be another terrible season, the worst for him would be the demolition of an already broken reputation, and the best merely a few months of paid work and the Stretford End chanting his name before he’s out on his ear looking for further employment.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be sacked and replaced by former Red Devils head coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, according to reports.",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",

      "Raphinha and Lamine Yamal sparkled for Barcelona last season, but Barcelona’s priority in this summer’s window was to sign a new attacker to provide competition for places.",

      "However, the 27-year-old has endured a slow start at Barcelona as he has only registered one goal involvement in his first four appearances.",
      "This has fuelled speculation that he could return to Man Utd in 2026, though a new report in Spain claims he is part of their plans moving forward.",
      "It is suggested that Barcelona already have a ‘priority 2026 plan’ regarding signings as they want a winger, a centre-back and a ‘galactico’.",

      "The report explains:",
      "‘The second focus is on the wing. The club reserves the option of signing Marcus Rashford permanently if his loan agreement goes through this season. The Englishman is popular for his power, dribbling, and versatility, and if he maintains a high-level season, Barça will seriously consider paying the 30 million euro option. This would ensure an attacking trident with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha as their strike partners.’",
      "Elsewhere, it is noted that Julian Alvarez and Erling Haaland are their main options to be their next ‘galactico’, though the Man City superstar is their ‘ultimate dream’ signing.",
      "Regarding Barcelona’s interest in these players, the report adds:",
      "‘Haaland is the ultimate dream: he would be the signing that would define an era at Camp Nou. However, his signing is presented as a highly difficult transaction due to competition from other European giants and the financial implications. Meanwhile, the option of Julián Álvarez appears to be a more realistic option: young, versatile, and with elite experience, he could fit perfectly into Flick’s model.’",

      "According to reports, a Manchester United ‘midfielder transfer’ is ‘gaining momentum’ ahead of the winter transfer window for four reasons.",
      "Man Utd had a mixed summer transfer window as they invested around £230m on signings, landing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "The Red Devils also offloaded several unwanted stars, including Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim‘s side did not land all of their desired targets as their failure to sign Brighton standout Carlos Baleba means they are lacking a top-tier No.6.",
      "This means that rival Premier League clubs have found it easy to play through Man Utd, who sit 14th in the Premier League after only winning one of their opening four matches.",
      "READ: Amorim to be sacked by Man Utd on one condition with players ‘perplexed’ at Mainoo decision",
      "Therefore, Man Utd’s January transfer priority will be to sign a centre-midfielder, though they are linked with alternatives to Baleba.",
      "Crystal Palace standout Adam Wharton has also been mentioned as a possible target, while former Wolves star Ruben Neves is a left-field option.",
      "The 28-year-old was heavily linked with several Big Six clubs before he left Wolves to join Al-Hilal in 2023, though a possible move to Man Utd has been mooted in recent weeks.",
      "Now, a report from journalist Mark Brus for The Daily Briefing has revealed an ‘interesting update’ on Neves to Man Utd, with this transfer ‘gaining momentum’ for four reasons.",
      "Neves is said to be ‘open to offers’ and ‘willing to return to the Premier League, while Man Utd boss Amorim is a “fan”.",
      "A ‘trustworthy source’ told Brus: “There’s the Portuguese connection there, and he’s seen as someone who would adapt well and fit in to Amorim’s system.”",
      "Another factor in Man Utd’s favour is that Neves could leave Al-Hilal ‘on the cheap’, though they do face competition from other Premier League sides.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Newcastle and Tottenham will also likely be in contention as long-time admirers of Neves, but there’s also a particularly strong interest from United boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "‘My source added that Neves could also move on the cheap, perhaps as little as €20m, which will likely make him a tempting market opportunity. Still, it’s worth emphasising that there haven’t been any talks yet, or any offers made, so it’s just one to keep an eye on.’",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be sacked and replaced by former Red Devils head coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, according to reports.",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",
      "Solskjaer to replace Amorim at Man Utd? Hey, he ‘knows the club’. But he also did the first time. Also, what happened to Lampard at Chelsea again?",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford."

But theirs is a long-term plan to rejuvenate and regenerate the club, and while record revenues show that the club still has a huge commercial pull as one of the biggest in world football, fans shouldn't think that will mean bumper spending in the January window, or next summer.",

These latest figures will show that they have maintained that strong position, despite their worst performance on the pitch since 1974, when the club was relegated. A lack of Champions League football and a 15th-placed finish in the league cost them tens of millions of pounds.",

      "\"These latest figures show that debt has reduced somewhat (by around £39m to £471.9m), but that reduction is because of a change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, rather than any of the debt being specifically paid off.",
      "\"In addition, the \"revolving credit facility\" that the club has (in effect, like a personal credit card) now has £165.1m of additional debt on it - up from £35.6m last year.",
      "\"While the record revenues and reduced losses are no doubt a sign that United are making impressive commercial strides off the pitch, the Glazer debt and the continued under-performance of the team on the pitch are two nagging negatives.\"",

      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 13:03, UK",
      "It is four years ago now that Nicky Butt made headlines for his claim that Declan Rice is no better than Scott McTominay. While Butt acknowledges that the England midfielder has improved since then, there is more respect on McTominay's name now too.",
      "McTominay was the driving force behind Napoli's Serie A title win last season, scoring a dozen goals and winning the competition's player of the year award. It has made a mockery of the notion that he was not good enough to be a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Scott is an amazing person. He is a really great lad.\" Butt, who made 387 appearances for United, including one in the 1999 Champions League final, knows him well. He was an academy coach at United when McTominay broke through. \"He had it tough,\" he adds.",
      "\"He had a lot of growing problems, a lot of injuries.\" That growth spurt has been well documented. \"Back in the day, he was only small and slight.\" But his great strength was his resolve. \"His determination and his drive, you could not ever question,\" says Butt.",
      "\"Scott would be the first to sit here and say he was not the most gifted and talented footballer on the planet, which I wasn't, Roy Keane wasn't. But when you've got that kind of drive, which Scott has and obviously Roy had, you get yourself through the levels.",
      "\"And that is what Scott has done. Scott had the disappointment of leaving Man Utd, I felt that was wrong to let him go because he is one of your own, he would run through brick walls for you, a Manchester United fan from a family of Manchester United fans.\"",
      "McTominay returns to Manchester this week to play against City in the Champions League on Thursday. United themselves are not in European competition. \"It is the same old thing,\" says Butt. \"You don't know what you have got until you've not got it.\"",
      "He adds: \"He is a god in Napoli now. You go there and his picture is on all the walls. It is great. He has earned all that. He has grafted, worked hard, had knockbacks and fair play to him he is a player now. If he'd stayed, he might have stagnated and never got better.\"",
      "Indeed, Butt believes that even the famous Class of '92 would have struggled in the current climate. He made his Premier League debut alongside Bryan Robson in midfield with Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister behind him, Brian McClair and Mark Hughes ahead.",
      "\"Everybody talks about our group,\" says Butt of a crop of talent that included Paul Scholes and David Beckham. \"If we had been brought into this environment now, you would never have heard of us. We would have played seven, eight, nine or 10 games.\"",
      "Why is that? \"We got brought into a football team that was successful with world-class players but more importantly world-class professionals, good men. They made us, really. Trust me, it was more the fact that we had professionals around,\" he explains.",
      "\"When you come into a football club it is hard enough to put one young lad into a team. If you have not got real men to look after you then you will struggle. If we had got into this group now together, we would not have survived, we would have had a nightmare.\"",
      "Nicky Butt came close to making his own move abroad in 2004 when he was a target for Real Madrid. \n\n\n“I had a conversation with the club and they said that if you can find the right club for yourself and Manchester United then you can go. So I started looking around. Carlos Queiroz was Real Madrid manager at the time, he wanted me.”\n\n\nButt went as far as getting a passport sorted for his dog. “I am a big dog man so I made sure they were coming straight away. But it never transpired.” Sir Alex Ferguson decided to block the move.\n\n\n“Player power was not around then but even if it was I was not the kind of bloke to kick up too much of a fuss. I went to Newcastle which was an amazing club and I enjoyed my time there.”",
      "Speaking ahead of the launch of his new podcast with Scholes, The Good, The Bad and The Football, United's ongoing malaise is a recurring theme of the conversation. Having worked in United's academy between 2012 and 2021, Butt saw this unfolding up close.",
      "It remains a source of frustration. \"The worst thing you can do is bury your head in the sand,\" he says of City's rise to become the destination of choice in Manchester. \"Kids saw other clubs coming to them with better facilities. It was a massive pull for them.",
      "\"All over the country, academies upped their game. At Manchester United, we got a bit lacklustre, thinking we were the biggest and the best and did not have to go out and do all the things that the others were doing, but you have to stay on top of your game.\"",
      "Given his prominent role, could he not have arrested that slide himself? \"You're a small cog in a big machine.\" In 2021, he walked away. \"There were things happening at the club where there were people with different philosophies to what I was brought up on.\"",
      "An example. The separation between the academy and the senior players annoyed him. \"Young kids are moving further away from the first team,\" he says. \"I did not agree with the idea that the first team gets everything there and everyone else is on the other side.\"",
      "It was far removed from his own experience as a young player. \"When I was coming into the first team, I knew Brian Robson. I knew Mark Hughes. I knew Peter Schmeichel. I knew Brian McClair. All these superstars that you have on your wall,\" he says.",
      "\"Three years earlier I was at school. But I knew them because I was having dinner with them every day. I was training with them every day. And there was one big family. And when you go into the first team, they know your name and you know how they play.",
      "\"I could not ever imagine playing in front of 75,000 people and not even knowing who these people are. I think they have got to be a lot more together, a lot tighter. And my way, I felt, was changing. That was because other people were coming in from outside.\"",
      "If the sense is of Butt being wistful about United's past, do not mistake him for a sentimentalist. His take on the prospect of the club's proud record of having an academy graduate in every squad for 88 years and counting might just surprise.",
      "\"I'm a bit 50-50 with that. Unless you are bringing players in who are going to play for the club for years, it's pointless because anybody can put someone on the bench from the academy. They don't have to be good enough, it is just to keep the tradition going.",
      "\"If it is someone who you are putting on like Kobbie Mainoo or some of the other names that you can throw about, where you know they are a real player, an international who is going to improve the team and be there for the longevity, then that's brilliant.",
      "\"But if you are just going to bring in little Billy from the under-16s, who is nowhere near the level and you are just doing it to keep the tradition, it can be false, that. It is a bit of a sham. You have to be brave enough to go against the tradition. It will happen one day.\"",
      "United's future remains a fascination. And Butt, one of their own, is not optimistic that Benjamin Sesko can change their fortunes. He argues that it is not fair to expect too much of him. \"I hope he goes and gets the golden boot this year but it is highly unlikely.\"",
      "He is more encouraged by the investment in the training ground. \"The fundamentals of any club have to be solid.\" But how long until the title returns? \"That is the big question, isn't it? My heart says one thing,\" concludes Butt. \"My head says something else.\"",

      "Paul Merson pens his latest column on Ruben Amorim's struggles at Manchester United, Arsenal's Premier League title hopes, Noni Madueke's form, Liverpool's interesting  start to the season and Aston Villa's struggles",
      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 09:46, UK",
      "Paul Merson says Ruben Amorim must adapt his tactics at Manchester United to improve his \"unthinkable\" record.",
      "Also, The Magic Man discusses Arsenal's Premier League title hopes after their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest and Liverpool's interesting start to the season after Mohamed Salah's late penalty got them out of jail at Burnley.",
      "Read on for Merson's thoughts in full...",
      "Ruben Amorim, the way he wants to play, is a worry.",
      "He won't change. He'll look at it and say 'I've got where I am today by playing the way I play', using three at the back and high wing-backs.",
      "He would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea. They've got world-class wing-backs in Reece James and Malo Gusto, they've got the best holding midfield player in the league in Moises Caicedo. It would fit the players.",
      "You look at Man United and this system does not suit the squad they've got at all. The two wing-backs are nowhere near it, nowhere near good enough. And they are a big part of this formation working. No legs in midfield. Everything is up against him.",
      "You've got to be able to change now and then. You can tweak it, it's horses for courses, that doesn't mean you are abandoning your beliefs.",
      "I don't see them finishing anywhere near it this season, there's too much work to be done. They haven't got the quality.",
      "They were decent against Burnley, but it ends up 2-2 and they need a penalty in the last minute. Their best two players are Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha, they cannot afford to be missed.",
      "He still hasn't won back-to-back games in the league, nearly a year in. That's unthinkable for a club like Man Utd. Unthinkable.",
      "I just wish he would change it every now and then and adapt to the personnel he's got available. It's worrying because he doesn't know his best team, the back three don't even play together every week. He's been there a year, that's a big, big worry.",
      "It's a hard week for Arsenal.",
      "I thought they played really well against Nottingham Forest, a solid result. The performance showed their depth. No Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice was a sub, Martin Odegaard had to go off - it just showed their quality.",
      "If they get through these next couple of weeks, I see them as the team. They are the ones. If they get through these next couple of games, you go advantage Arsenal. They have got ample quality to win the league.",
      "They were very good against Liverpool. That's the most comfortable I've seen an Arsenal team at Anfield in 20 years. If it had ended 0-0 we would be saying 'who is going to touch Arsenal this season?'. Liverpool didn't look like scoring for toffee and then Dominik Szoboszlai scores a worldie from nothing.",
      "Noni Madueke needs to keep on performing, it's only just started.",
      "Arsenal play a certain way, he's been positive, but the way Arsenal play compared to Chelsea will suit him.",
      "Arsenal move the ball quicker, it goes into his feet quicker and then he's one-vs-one in a flash. Chelsea are slower, by the time the ball is moved out to the winger the other side have doubled up. Arsenal don't do that.",
      "He's done outstanding so far - his goal for England against Serbia was really good - better than what I thought. But this has got to go on for the rest of the season. So far, so good.",
      "I'm unsure about Liverpool. They should be mid-table. They've been gifted six points.",
      "They never looked like scoring against Arsenal, Newcastle last kick of the game, then Burnley a penalty in stoppage time. What Hannibal Mejbri is doing there I do not know. You could take six points off Liverpool and no one would have argued. No one would say 'oh that's a bit harsh, they were bang unlucky'. All three should have ended up as draws, and they would be mid-table.",
      "I'm not convinced yet. There is a lot of work for Arne Slot to do. I don't think this Florian Wirtz one is working. I like Wirtz, a terrific player, but teams are sitting back against Liverpool and it's so claustrophobic for him. Their midfield three, for me, won them the league last year. I thought Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Szoboszlai were outstanding for long parts, dominating midfields - I don't see that this season. Teams are getting at Liverpool.",
      "Alexander Isak has got to come in, you can have all the best players in the world but if they don't gel, it doesn't work. So they could be mid-table, but you could also say they haven't started playing yet and they have won every game. That's the sign of a very good team.",
      "It's not like Aston Villa have been unlucky, you can't say they have been peppering opposition goals and been unlucky not to score. It's a slow burner. It's shocked me, I thought they would be right up there. It's worrying times.",
      "They will be okay because I think the manager is outstanding, but they have been caught behind. They didn't bring in a forward, Ollie Watkins looks lost. Hopefully one comes off his backside and he goes on a run but Villa don't look like scoring and that's the worry.",
      "They don't look right. A lot of stuff happened in the market - clubs spent, Villa didn't. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were taken away, goals have dried up. And these are players that can make chances for other people as well, they aren't getting those anymore. I look at that Villa team and it doesn't inspire me.",
      "I'm a big fan of Unai Emery, and so if anyone can turn it around, he can.",

      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Tom Stitson",
      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 10:14, UK",
      "Manchester United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City in Sunday's derby increased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim and raised more questions about his favoured 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "Between the Lines returns with a look at his approach, a breakdown of how formations have evolved in the Premier League, and an examination of the system's issues at Manchester United.",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",

      "Ruben Amorim has promised he won’t change his footballing philosophy and his bosses at Manchester United have no plans to change the head coach.",
      "The club has a long-term plan and while there is obvious and growing frustration with results, there will be no knee-jerk reaction or regular reassessment of the head coach's future after every defeat - however loud the noise grows from outside.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago, there have been two caretakers, and eight 'substantive' bosses. There is no desire to start afresh with a ninth.",
      "With four points from their opening four games, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also went out of the Carabao Cup - one of only three competitions they had the chance to win in 2025-26 - against Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "This, after last season which saw their lowest ever Premier League points tally (42), and their most Premier League defeats (15).",
      "It is painful to watch. Amorim acknowledges and understands the supporters are hurting, but he says he is suffering still more as he battles to turn things around.",
      "He knows that his bosses are patient, and that they are realistic in their assessment that there are no quick fixes at Old Trafford. But there is also a recognition on all sides that currently things are far from good enough.",
      "There is no doubt Pep Guardiola's team definitively deserved the victory, and there is dismay at the three goals United conceded - with Erling Haaland's second a particularly tough one to swallow after the visitors vacated their entire defensive half to allow the Norwegian striker to run through unchecked.",
      "But there is pragmatism in the Old Trafford boardroom too recognising that, had Bryan Mbeumo's wondrous volley not been met with an equally wonderful Gianluigi Donnarumma save when the score was 2-0, or had Casemiro not missed a sitter at the back post later on in the game - there might have been a better gloss to the result.",
      "Amorim and the United hierarchy feel they are losing out on the fine margins right now.",
      "There are other mitigating circumstances too - the injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are particularly damaging, especially because United's squad doesn't have the strength in depth of any of the other \"Big Six\" clubs right now.",

      "Amorim's stubbornness over his playing system - with a defiant three centre backs - is very much a live debate. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change,\" the manager said on Sunday evening. \"If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is not the first time that he has effectively said \"back me or sack me\" in front of the media. But when Amorim was appointed in November last year, the United hierarchy knew what they were getting, and the specific way in which the Portuguese coach chooses to play.",
      "There remains a belief, beyond Amorim's coaching staff, that the system can be a success.",
      "But there is some consternation that, with United's midfield struggling to hold its own so far this season, Amorim is repeatedly overlooking the talent of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The midfielder looked bright when he came off the bench for the last 30 minutes against City, and that again has prompted many a United fan to ask why he is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "What is clear is that Amorim doesn't think he is the finished article and that, at 20-years-old, he still needs to develop. The United boss is working hard and personally with Mainoo behind the scenes, but rightly or wrongly - Mainoo's involvement will be managed. He is not currently in Amorim's first-choice line-up.",
      "For the Manchester United bosses, they feel little has changed after this weekend's game against their bitter rivals. That is not to say they will wait for change indefinitely. Rather, they accept that correcting United's malaise is a long-term project.",
      "And there is little or no desire to rip up the current plan, change the man in charge of the football team, and start (again) from scratch.",
      "Club legends are lining up to say enough is enough - Wayne Rooney, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more among the voices saying the pressure on Amorim is mounting, and things have to improve quickly.",
      "That is true. And no one knows it more acutely than Ruben Amorim himself."

      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 08:34, UK",
      "\"But he is being asked to do something different. It is normal for a No 10 like he is to be able to do it for two or three games, to fill in when a midfielder is injured or suspended or something. But then you get a little bit bored of going back into position to defend.\"",
      "It is the voice of experience. \"I did both roles. As a No 10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It's a totally different mindset.\"",
      "There is a view now that Scholes was a natural deep-lying playmaker, England's answer to Andrea Pirlo or Xavi Hernandez. It is true that he took on that role late in his career but, now 50 and reflecting on his career, it is not necessarily how he sees himself.",
      "\"When I first came into the team I was a centre-forward,\" he recalls. And while Sir Alex Ferguson had always insisted that he would end up playing as a central midfielder, that took time. \"I ended up playing as a No 10 for three, four, five years, which I loved.\"",
      "They were some of his happiest and most successful years. \"Defending was not my strong point. I didn't like having to think about defending and as a No 10 you didn't have to. All you think about is getting your team to play, creating chances, scoring goals.\"",
      "In truth, the obsession with possession was never his. When watching old clips, he has been known to groan at the sight of himself passing backwards. \"It was not until my late twenties when I went into that controlling role as the manager wanted me to do.\"",
      "It required a mentality shift. \"I remember a game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League where he did not really want me to go over the halfway line, which was something different for me, because we were getting done in Europe quite a bit.\"",
      "Scholes' job was not to unlock the opposition but to stifle them. \"He wanted us to just be controlled and not vacate that area. It was something new for me to learn.\" Even now, he still recalls his surprise at the United manager's reaction to his performance.",
      "\"I remember after that game, I had not had a shot on goal and I don't think I created a chance. I didn't do anything attacking wise very well. He said, 'Brilliant, that is what I wanted from you'. From that day on, it just seemed to grow. I became used to the role.\"",
      "As such, you might expect Scholes to be an advocate for Fernandes making the same positional journey. The United skipper turned 31 this month, after all. Instead, it seems he would prefer the Portuguese playmaker to be the one still trying that killer pass.",
      "\"That is the way I was brought up. That is the way the manager wanted us to play. Pass forward and run forward. It was all about playing attacking, being entertaining. So, to go back, just passing it back, I hate seeing it now and I hated seeing it when I did it.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging conversation at a Manchester pub where he is even volunteering to pull pints to help promote his new podcast The Good, the Bad and the Football with fellow Class of '92 graduate Nicky Butt, Scholes touches on subjects old and new.",
      "He has been following the debate about the relative merits of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as teenagers. Scholes played with both. Owen even nicked the ball off his toe when scoring his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998. \"He could have left it for me.\"",
      "His own view? Succinct but definitive. \"At that age, Michael was the better goalscorer, Wayne was the better footballer.\"",
      "But he is keen to stress that Owen was a phenomenon in his own right, his pace setting him apart from the rest. \"With Michael in the early days, I just had to look and he would spin in behind and I just had to hit the ball into 20 yards of space. It was an easy job.\"",
      "Easy for Scholes, perhaps. He had a connection with many top-class strikers for club and country. \"As a midfield player you need to know your players' strengths.\" But Ruud van Nistelrooy was his favourite. \"I had the feeling that I knew what he wanted to do.\"",
      "Scholes wonders whether too much is being expected of the latest United striker Benjamin Sesko. Will he really be able to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed? \"He is a 22-year-old kid replacing someone of a very similar ilk. It is a difficult job to adapt.\"",
      "He would have liked the club to opt for a more experienced goalkeeper such as Emiliano Martinez too. \"He would have been a lot safer.\" And that is crucial. Scholes saw up close the difficulties that the club faced in trying to find a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "He is reluctant to criticise Massimo Taibi too much. \"He made a couple of mistakes. It did not work out.\" But he is less delicate on Mark Bosnich's footwork. \"Would he be able to play in this day and age for some of the best coaches in the world? I don't see it.\"",
      "On United more broadly, Scholes describes himself as \"more hopeful than confident\" that Amorim can bring the good times back. \"I like the way he speaks,\" he says, before later adding: \"The results are not really there to have massive confidence in him yet.\"",
      "Perhaps he would have more confidence if Fernandes were given more freedom to express himself further forwards. \"If you watched some of the Europa League games last year, he was really good in that [deeper] position so he can do it,\" says Scholes.",
      "\"I think if you asked him to do everything then he would try to do it all, almost in that Wayne Rooney type of way as well. But I think with him playing in that deeper-lying area it is taking away some of the important qualities that he has further up the pitch.\"",
      "Paul Scholes. Still a No 10 at heart.",

      "The Debrief column this week focuses on Patrick Dorgu's ineffectiveness despite getting in good positions for Manchester United and what that says about Ruben Amorim's system. Plus: Jeremy Doku's creativity and Brentford's long throws...",
      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "Being in Ruben Amorim's press conference after Manchester United's 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday, it was striking once again just how open that he is about his team's ongoing struggles. More than that, he is aware of what he calls the narratives.",
      "There were more questions about Bruno Fernandes, while Amorim himself referenced the debate about Kobbie Mainoo. But more troubling for the United coach is the growing feeling that even if he succeeds in shaping this side in his own image, it might not work.",
      "Patrick Dorgu's role in the derby was fascinating. He had more touches in the opposition penalty box than any other player on the pitch. In fact, with 12 touches there, he became the first United player to hit double figures in the area so far this season.",
      "So often the space was his. But he was not particularly effective. There was one completed dribble. Crosses were looped in. But even late in the game, with City having long since sealed the points, there was a toothlessness to United in the final third.",
      "It seems extraordinary to think that this is by design but that is how it can feel with Amorim's United. So much depends on the quality of the wing-backs in this system but even though Dorgu is seen as a specialist in the role, does he have the tools required?",
      "Two seasons ago, the player to find themselves in the most one-on-one situations in the Premier League was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka. Last season, it was Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. This suits those teams. Get your best player isolated against the opposition.",
      "The United player to have found themselves in the most one-on-one situations is Dorgu. If that is the plan with Amorim's 3-4-3 then it is a concern because on Sunday that is probably the United player Pep Guardiola would have wanted to have the space.",
      "Any system that compromises the strengths of your most talented players and highlights the deficiencies of your most limited ones is surely doomed to fail. For Amorim, the wing-backs are key. And Manchester United's are not good enough to make this work.",
      "For proof that isolating a wide player against the opposition defence can be effective, look no further than the other end of the pitch and a hugely impactful performance by Jeremy Doku who provided assists for Manchester City's first two goals of the game.",
      "Jack Grealish's improved end product has been a feature of the Premier League season, racking up four assists already since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City. But Doku's impressive display in the Manchester derby was a reminder of his talent.",
      "The Belgian forced himself ahead of Grealish in the mind of Pep Guardiola and certainly justified his inclusion against Manchester United. It was Doku's skill that opened up the defence for Phil Foden's opening goal, dancing past two opponents to set it up.",
      "Guardiola has described the winger as the best in the world over five metres and that explosivity was the key factor in that goal but the City boss has urged him to improve other facets of his game and there was some evidence of that with his second assist.",
      "It was his measured pass through to Erling Haaland that ended any hopes of a United comeback. It is the first time that Doku has registered two assists in a Premier League game since producing four of them in one game against Bournemouth in 2023.",
      "Grealish, who had a season-high 16 touches in the opposition box in Everton's goalless draw with Aston Villa, still ranks second for chances created from open play in the Premier League so far this season, but the one man ahead of him on that list is Doku.",
      "The return of the long throw remains a big talking point in this Premier League season but after Crystal Palace found the net as a result of one against Aston Villa before the international break, it was time for the masters of it to make their own statement.",
      "Brentford's stoppage-time equaliser against Chelsea was finished by Fabio Carvalho but it came from a Kevin Schade long throw. According to the expected-goals data, the Bees have now created better chances from throw-ins than any other team this season.",
      "No surprise there. That was the case last season, and the season before that, and the season before that, and the season before that. Other teams are finally cottoning on to the fact that the throw-in is an opportunity to do more than just recycle possession.",
      "\"It is not new to us,\" said Brentford boss Keith Andrews. How true. Over the past five seasons, their expected-goals tally from throw-ins is 21.47. The next best in the Premier League in that period is just 5.49 by Nottingham Forest. The rest are playing catch up.",
      "Speaking recently to Thomas Gronnemark, the renowned throw-in specialist who has worked with Brentford for the past three seasons, he believes that this is inevitable because paying attention to the importance of this set piece just makes sense.",

      "This is as bad as it gets unless you were watching Man Utd in the 1970s when they were relegated.",
      "Here's the thing, though, United fans who were there have great memories of that 1974/75 season in the Second Division. Tommy Docherty was in charge and there were new grounds to visit.",
      "The team still had players you could look up to like Stuart Pearson, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy and Brian Greenhoff. Despite playing in the second tier United still had the highest average home attendance in England.",
      "After an instant return to the First Division, United also denied Liverpool the Treble a year later by beating Bob Paisley's side in the 1977 FA Cup final.",
      "Even in the 1980s when United went through long dark periods, they still had teams full of club legends like Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Mark Hughes and Paul McGrath.",
      "In recent years there have been so many changes at every level of the club that it's difficult to put your finger on what makes United that special anymore.",
      "Of course, there is the history and the trophies and the fans. More than 2.2m of them watched games at Old Trafford last season. There wasn't much to celebrate with United finishing 15th in the Premier League, but that made them the best supported team in Europe.",
      "Many of those fans will not have been around in the 1970s and 1980s so for them this is definitely as bad as it gets. And that's a view that would probably be shared by at least some of the older fans who were there in those days.",
      "Ruben Amorim was defiant in Sunday's post-match press conference after his side's 3-0 defeat to Man City, and made it clear, again, that he is not going to change his philosophy.",
      "No matter how bad things get, it seems he will carry on playing three at the back even though it is pretty obvious to everyone that the system is not working and it does not suit his players.",
      "If nobody at United can convince him to be more flexible, then they just have to hope the players will eventually look at home playing the way Amorim wants them to play.",
      "The only other option is to replace the head coach, but that it is a road United have been down too often since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down 12 years ago.",
      "You could make a pretty good case that United would be in a better state if they had stuck with any of the managers who followed Ferguson: David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Although, judging by the fact that they wasted so much money in the transfer market when Ten Hag was in charge, perhaps it was the right decision to sack him nine months ago, when United were 14th - exactly where did they are today.",
      "Even Ten Hag, though, could point out that since Amorim's first game in charge, no ever-present Premier League team have performed worse than United - 31 points from 31 games means United are bottom of the table.",
      "Not if he only has one way of playing.",
      "The Premier League is ferociously competitive and United are too easy to play against at the moment. Opponents know exactly what to expect when they face United and the fear factor has totally disappeared.",
      "It used to be a shock when United lost; now it is a shock when they win. So-called smaller clubs are better run, have better balanced squads and can spend tens of millions of pounds on players every summer.",
      "United have been left behind and Amorim has a massive job on his hands. He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and comes across as extremely honest and transparent in all his dealings with the media. That is a breath of fresh in one sense, but it can also diminish his status as a strong leader.",
      "Managing Manchester United is like managing Real Madrid. Everything you say is going to be a headline. United are back-page news every day.",
      "Perhaps the ideal United head coach is someone who wears a suit and tie and gives little away. It worked in the old days, but these are not the old days any more.",
      "It is too early to answer that question properly because the window closed only two weeks ago.",
      "United focused their spending on buying a new forward line when many outside observers would have thought that the money would have been better spent on a new spine for the team. They also had the option of selling Bruno Fernandes for a big transfer fee to Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The captain stayed and his new team-mates Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo need to be given more time to show what they can do. Senne Lammens could also turn out to be an exceptional goalkeeper if he lives up to expectations and adapts to English football.",
      "There is a nagging feeling, though, that a club the size and stature of United should be going all out to buy the best players in the world - players like Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Not being in the Champions League and cutting the wage bill means United fans have to get used to a new reality, a new reality which means the very best players going to their rivals for the time being.",
      "Even the fact that United managed to move out so many players this summer who were surplus to requirements was not a cause for celebration. United have taken a big financial hit on the transfer fees paid for the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony but at least they were able to get their wages off their books.",
      "United were sixth in the table when INEOS completed their deal to buy their minority stake and take over sporting control in February last year.",
      "There has been very little to get excited about on the pitch, apart from a shock FA Cup final win against Manchester City, which earned Ten Hag a new contract but left United counting the cost - some £13m - when they fired him just five months later.",
      "There's no point going through all the statistics and defeats here - there are too many losses - but it is safe to say that this has been one of the worst periods in the history of the club.",
      "INEOS have put their own money in and are making big changes off the pitch, including redeveloping the training ground, but there have been just as many mistakes as good decisions. With the benefit of hindsight, flying to Ibiza to give Ten Hag a new deal was absolutely the wrong decision and hiring and firing Dan Ashworth was another costly mistake.",
      "At least INEOS have a plan. The plan changes from time to time as all plans do, but they do have a plan and they have put their own money on the table. It is just extremely unfortunate that the plan has also meant so many people losing their jobs and a new controversial ticketing policy.",
      "The Glazer family also had a plan and if you wanted to start an argument, you could whisper very quietly that the results, league tables and trophies, taken in isolation, show that United were better off when the Glazers and executives like Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold were in charge.",
      "The priority has to be getting back into the Champions League or any European competition at the very least.",
      "The League Cup is already gone thanks to that calamitous night in Grimsby and you can get odds of 100/1 on United to win the title so, trophy wise, the FA Cup is all United realistically have to play for.",
      "Winning the FA Cup would mean a place in the Europa League, but the Champions League is where United have to be. The commercial benefits of being back in the expanded top-tier European tournament are huge and it would make it easier to sign the best players in the world.",
      "Finishing in the top five is likely to mean Champions League qualification but United are a long way off that standard at the moment. At least the lack of European competition this season means Amorim has more time to work with his players in between league games. It is not much of a silver lining, but it is something at least.",
      "United's next game is against Chelsea next weekend. Luckily for them, Chelsea have a terrible record at Old Trafford - no league win for 12 years - and they were not particularly convincing in their 2-2 draw with Brentford on Saturday night.",
      "The six teams below United at the moment are all capable of beating them but that is not to say United are in a relegation fight - yet.",
      "If they carry on the way they have started, they will probably end up where they finished last season - in the middle of the bottom half of the table.",
      "And if that is the case, it is likely that INEOS will make a change at the top - just as they did last October when United were 14th."
