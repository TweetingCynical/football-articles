      "Manchester United will have to pay £60m to sign Hugo Ekitike this summer. A striker is on the Red Devils’ shopping list all summer following some serious goalscoring issues last term.",
      "A number of candidates have been mentioned as potential recruits but so far, United have been left frustrated in their attempts to sign a new forward. They were originally interested in a move for Liam Delap, only for Chelsea to steam in and seal a deal for £30m.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres also had admirers at Old Trafford but as it stands, the Sporting Lisbon star prefers a move to Premier League rivals Arsenal - although they might not prefer him, amid their interest in Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig.",
      "That has forced United to look elsewhere, and, as first reported by The Times, they are interested in a move for Frankfurt forward Ekitike and could compete with Liverpool for his signature. But a deal won’t be cheap.",
      "The Bundesliga side have slapped a minimum £60m price tag on the Frenchman after his excellent breakthrough season. But given they are also under no pressure to sell having earned around £63million in January from Omar Marmoush’s move to Manchester City and having done some outstanding business in recent windows - particularly when it comes to strikers - that figure may well rise as we move forwards through the summer window.",
      "Even then, paying big might not be enough. Because Frankfurt have already warned they may simply eschew options out there and decide to keep Ekitike and build around him next season.",
      "Frankfurt chief Markus Krosche has already made clear they will not undersell their star asset. He said: “If the price isn’t right, then he’ll simply stay with us. We don’t have to sell Hugo.”",
      "\"He's one of the most interesting strikers on the European market. Hugo has to decide that,\" added at the end of the season. \"I'm glad we have him. If he decides otherwise, that's our motto: If a player develops faster than us, we let him go.\"",
      "Ekitike, 22, joined Frankfurt permanently from Paris Saint-Germain last summer following a loan spell with the side. He scored 22 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "Ironically, the young forward has already dropped a hint over his future amid interest from Man United and Liverpool. He revealed that he was once a childhood Red Devils fan.",
      "Speaking in December last year, he said: “My favourite club as a child was Manchester United. I’ve always admired them.\"",
      "Away from Ekitike, Man United are also chasing the signing of Bryan Mbeumo. The Brentford forward has already expressed his desire to move to Old Trafford this summer but a switch might not be straightforward. Tottenham are also keen, with ex-Brentford boss Thomas Frank targeting a reunion in North London."

      "Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada claims the Red Devils can win the Premier League by 2028, having given his backing to Ruben Amorim. United have endured a rotten few years recently, which culminated in their worst-ever Premier League season last term.",
      "They slumped to 15th under Amorim after losing 18 of their league games. United also failed to earn a spot back in the Champions League having lost out to Premier League rivals Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "Despite their dismal campaign still being fresh in the mind, Berrada is still convinced that United can challenge for the Premier League crown over the coming seasons. Asked if the club are capable of winning the title, he replied: “Of course.",
      "“We’ve just finished 15th and it seems like an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?",
      "“I firmly believe that we can do it. We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League and if we can achieve it before then, we’ll all be happy — and so nobody’s saying that we don’t want to win it until then.”",
      "The closest United have come to winning the league since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson came in 2018 and 2021 as they finished second to local rivals Manchester City under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer respectively. And Berrada still has faith that Amorim could be the man to end that long wait despite claims last season that he could have been jettisoned.",
      "“We saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give time to Ruben to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League,” Berrada added.",
      "“So by the time that we got to now, we’ll have had all the discussions about what does the squad need, the two-to-three-year plan to get to a squad that’s capable of winning the Premier League.",
      "“We have a very clear roadmap of how we’re going to get there. Had Ruben started on July 1, 2025, we wouldn’t have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that’s what I feel these seven or eight months that he’s had. He’s suffered in the Premier League, and the team has suffered. That’s why I feel that it’s really going to help us in the future.”",
      "United have already been busy in the transfer market as they attempt to recover from their woeful campaign. The Red Devils activated a £62.5m release clause in Matheus Cunha’s Wolves deal to sign him.",
      "They also remain keen on a deal for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo but are facing competition from Spurs. United also want a new striker this summer with Viktor Gyokeres a long-term target."

      "Matheus Cunha has been compared to Manchester United legend Eric Cantona in terms of the transformative impact he can have on the club.",
      "Brazil forward Cunha became United's first signing of the summer after they met his £62.5million release clause to bring him from Wolves.",
      "Cantona is credited for unlocking the door to United's first Premier League title in 1993, ending the club's 26-year wait to be English champions again.",
      "United chief executive Omar Berrada reckons 26-year-old Cunha possesses a similar charisma and playing style to Cantona, and can prove a modern-day version of the enigmatic Frenchman at Old Trafford.",
      "“He’s a player that I think fans are going to love,” Berrada said. “We can talk about his technical abilities and he can play in three different positions.",
      "“He’s a playmaking attacking midfielder; he can score goals, he can make assists. I think he’s going to lift people off their seats. He’s got a bit of a swagger about him that people are going to really like. Dare I say, Cantona-esque. He was an important one to get done. We’re going to do our best to do more signings quickly.",
      "“Sometimes, when you’re not quick, it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn’t necessarily the best thing for the club.”",
      "Berrada also doubled down on his belief that United can win the title by 2028 – despite ending last season in 15th place – their worst finish of the Premier League era.",
      "Asked if winning the title in three years was realistic, Berrada said: “Of course. We’ve just finished 15th and it seems like an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?",
      "“I firmly believe that we can do it. We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League and if we can achieve it before then, we’ll all be happy — and so nobody’s saying that we don’t want to win it until then.”",
      "Berrada admitted appointing Ruben Amorim midway through the season was always likely to make it even more difficult for the team to perform. He said: “We saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give time to Ruben to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League.",
      "“So by the time that we got to now, we’ll have had all the discussions about what does the squad need, the two-to-three-year plan to get to a squad that’s capable of winning the Premier League.",
      "\"We have a very clear roadmap of how we’re going to get there. Had Ruben started on July 1, 2025, we wouldn’t have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that’s what I feel these seven or eight months that he’s had. He’s suffered in the Premier League, and the team has suffered. That’s why I feel that it’s really going to help us in the future.\"",
      "Berrada, who worked at Manchester City before crossing the city to join United, said there were similarities between Amorim's start at United and Pep Guardiola's first season at City.",
      "“Very much so,” Berrada told United We Stand. “Pep stuck to his principles and given what he’d won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank. He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.",
      "\"We’ve taken all the short-term pain in this season, but as of this summer, the worst bit is going to be behind us. We will have settled the management team; we will have settled the coaching team with the technical team around them.",
      "\"On the football side, there’s a clear idea of what we want to do, what players we want to get, how we want to see the team playing, how we’re going to integrate academy players, how we’re going to go and invest in future talent.",
      "\"I’m actually very optimistic and quite positive about what’s ahead. Of course we need to get a lot of decisions right. And we will make mistakes, there’s no doubt. We’ll try to minimise those. But what we want is to build something that’s sustainable for the long, long term.",
      "\"We’ve put ourselves in the best position possible by doing everything that we’ve had this year around cost-cutting. I’m confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we’ve gone into.\"",

      "Dwight Yorke has laid into former club Manchester United and claimed they are “way off” competing with the top teams in the Premier League.",
      "United ended last season in 15th place, their worst finish of the Premier League era, and failed to secure European football for next term after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Against that backdrop, Yorke – who won the Treble with United in 1999 – said there is no way Ruben Amorim's side can challenge the top clubs in England, like Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "\"I don't think so,” Yorke told Flash Score. “They are probably not in the conversation right now. Let's get back to trying to compete at a very consistent, sort of consistent, what we do consistently.",
      "\"And if we can do that, then we'll have to see where we finish. But in terms of challenging the big boys in the minute, we're way off the mark.",
      "\"I think it's been well documented that it's been a really poor season by our standards. Of course we don't like to see Manchester United in the position that they are, but it's where the club is at the moment.",
      "\"It's been a very difficult campaign all round, so we have to look at the season and have a reflection and hopefully come back stronger and with a bit of fighting spirit. If we're finishing 15th in the league, then something is really wrong. So we have to reflect and start building immediately.\"",
      "Asked how much time Amorim should be given to turn United's fortunes around, Yorke said: \"I don't know the exact amount of time. What I do know as a manager, is you've got to win football matches. And the more you go about not winning football matches, you're certainly making life difficult for yourself.",
      "\"So I think as any manager, he has got to find a way to try to win matches and be a little bit more consistent. But if you're not winning matches, you're sort of forcing the way in terms of trying to put a real negative spin on it.”",
      "Asked what he would do differently if he were in Amorim's position, Yorke said: \"Well, to begin with, I would need some players. If I don't get the players, then it's a bit difficult to sort of even implement those ideas. I think that there's enough in the team.",
      "\"I think there's a lot of talent within the squad. You've just got to find a way to win matches.\"",

      "September 27 would've been the first clash between defending champions Liverpool and Pep Guardiola's City. The first Manchester derby of the season was supposedly scheduled for November 29. Villa hosting Arsenal is down as a clash on the final day on May 24.",
      "Despite the leak being, well, let's be honest, wrong, the start and finish dates are correct, as provided by the Premier League. The weekend of Saturday August 16 will kick-off the season before it ends on Sunday 24 May 2026. The season will consist of 33 weekends and five midweek match rounds.",

No two rounds take place within 60 hours of each other, which honours commitments made to clubs to address the congested Christmas and New Year schedule.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo looks to be on the move from Brentford this summer, but the burning question is will he arrive at Old Trafford or the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 25-year-old winger scored 20 goals and bagged eight assists for the Bees this season, and as a result, a number of their Premier League rivals are linked with him.",
      "Manchester United have been pursuing Mbeumo since the initial summer transfer window opened, with Ruben Amorim looking to bolster his firepower for 2025/26 following a dismal 15th-place finish. The Red Devils saw an initial bid worth up to £55million rejected by Brentford, who value Mbeumo at £60m.",
      "However, it is said that United are currently preparing another offer for the Cameroon international, who has 22 caps for the country. Thomas Frank moving to north London put the cat amongst the pigeons.",
      "The Danish mastermind, who enjoyed seven years at Brentford, was appointed as Spurs' new manager earlier this month in the wake of Ange Postecoglou's sacking, and he will also be hoping to enhance his attacking options as the Lilywhites finished even lower than United in 17th, albeit beating them in the Europa League final.",
      "It's claimed United remain confident in their pursuit of Mbeumo despite interest from Spurs. According to the MEN, the forward has told confidants that Old Trafford is his destination of choice, although other sources have claimed that he has not snubbed the possibility of reuniting with Frank at Spurs.",
      "Sources say Spurs are \"going hard\" for the talisman and are potentially ready to offer a higher salary, but United are still the frontrunners in the race to secure his signature. After already shelling out £62.5m on Matheus Cunha, it's clear Amorim has the backing of the board this summer as he looks to overhaul his inherited squad from Erik ten Hag.",
      "And it is thought that Mbeumo would be perfect for Amorim's patented 3-4-2-1 system as United hope to find an answer for their right-hand flank, given that it has been a problem position at Old Trafford for more than a decade now.",
      "Elsewhere, Mbeumo has noted that he \"accepts\" the speculation surrounding his future. Spurs are said to have held initial talks with Brentford over a deal for the attacker, who finds himself more intrigued by the team now that they have playing under Frank as an added incentive.",
      "He added: \"It's been my best season so far in the Premier League. And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we've been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it's been a fantastic season.\"",
      "Despite sources claiming that Mbeumo is more favouring of United this summer, the star has kept his cards incredibly close to his chest since Spurs entered the race for his signature.",
      "Spurs have a back-up in mind should they be unable to sign Mbeumo this summer, with talks having been held with the representatives of Antoine Semenyo of Bournemouth. The winger enjoyed somewhat of a breakthrough season with the Cherries in 2024/25, scoring 11 goals and providing six assists in the Premier League.",
      "Spurs like his versatility, able to play wide or as a No.9. But Bournemouth have no intention of parting with the Ghanaian, 25, cheaply - refusing to go for anything less than £60m, however, reflecting his importance as a key player.",

The fans love me.' But I think he's in the game of wanting to give back after all he's received. So I've got nothing but respect for him. I would have understood him leaving if he left, 100 percent.",
      "\"But the fact that he stayed and said, listen, there's stuff for me still to do here. I think it's a testament to him as a person, but also another reason why the managers comfortably give him the armband.\"",
      "And Ferdinand admitted: \"If I was him, I think I'd have found it difficult to say no. I've got to be honest.\"",

They have already struck a £62.5m deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha as they bid to rectify that issue, with Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo now being targeted too. A new No.9 is also on their list, with Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike both having been mooted as potential arrivals.",
      "On the personal front, ex-England ace Ferdinand recently launched his Career Transfer Hub in collaboration with Talking Futures, with hopes of bridging the gap between teenagers and their parents in terms of future planning. He says about the cause: \" I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents.",
      "\"I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time.",
      "\"So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",

      "The Premier League will confirm the official fixture list for the 2025/26 campaign on Wednesday. While the 2024/25 season feels like it only just ended, all 20 sides will soon learn who they will be playing and when.",
      "Liverpool dominated the Premier League, finishing 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal. Things were also far from close at the bottom of the table, as Southampton, Ipswich Town and Leicester City returned to the Championship.",
      "Sunderland, Burnley and Leeds United will be taking their places, hoping to put up a better fight than their predecessors. How their fixtures fall will soon become apparent.",
      "Officials from the Premier League claim the creation of the fixture list takes up to six months. It is put together by French IT company Atos, who are based just outside of Paris.",
      "A wide variety of factors have to be taken into account before the list is created. A litany of information that implicates the order of matches is inputted into their system, which then generates the list of matches.",
      "For example, it needs to take into account dates of international matches as well as those of Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League clashes. It also needs to consider the scheduling of matches in the lower leagues.",
      "Moreover, policing capacity and geographical proximity of teams are also considered to make sure public safety resources are not spread too thin. For example, Liverpool and Everton are not allowed to play at home on the same weekend, due to the intense strain it would put on police resources. The same would also apply to Manchester United and Manchester City, but the rules are relaxed when it comes to London teams, due to the large number of clubs in the capital.",
      "Individual sides are also allowed to make special fixture requests when there is the potential of a stadium clash. For example, on October 11, Old Trafford will be playing host to the Super League Grand Final, so United will likely have asked to play away on that weekend.",
      "Furthermore, as well as considering all of the above, there are also three strict rules for fixture scheduling. Firstly, over the course of a period of five matches, a team must play two matches at home and three away or vice versa.",
      "Secondly, a club is not allowed to begin or end the season with two home or two away matches. In the 2023/24 campaign, Luton Town had to start their campaign with two consecutive away matches as Kenilworth Road was still undergoing refurbishments to make the ground Premier League compliant.",
      "Thirdly, over the course of the Boxing Day and New Year's Day fixtures, a team is not allowed to play at home or away twice. Once all of the background information has been inputted, clubs are placed into a pairing grid, defining when they will be competing at home or away.",
      "The system will then randomly generate sets of fixtures. These are then manually verified by staff at Atos, as well as officials at the Premier League and the English Football League (EFL).",
      "If an issue arises, the process is repeated, thus generating a new set of fixtures. This will be repeated and repeated until one fixture list is deemed to satisfy all requirements and rules.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "But Italian side Juventus have attempted to muscle in on a deal over recent days. It's been claimed in Italy that the Serie A giants are willing to offer Gyokeres a stunning £11m-per-year deal to snub Premier League interest and move to Turin.",
      "But the club need to bring in some serious funds in order to afford that contract offer, as well as the €80m plus €10m in add ons (£68.1m plus £8.5m) fee that Sporting are demanding for their star forward. According to Corriere dello Sport, Juventus already have eight players in mind to potentially sell this summer.",
      "Right at the top of that list sit Vlahovic and former Aston Villa star Luiz, who could fetch around £50m between them. Lloyd Kelly, who was only signed permanently from Newcastle this summer, could also be sold.",

      "Former loanee Randal Kolo Muani remains an option, while Jonathan David could also be a bargain signing after leaving Lille at the end of his contract. Italian-based forwards Victor Osimhen and Mateo Retegui have also reportedly been considered, although neither would come cheap.",
      "It remains to be seen if Juventus’ efforts are enough to convince Gyokeres to move to Italy. But either way, his potential exit from Sporting has turned bitter with previous reports suggesting he was willing to go on strike in order to force a move away from the club.",
      "Gyokeres then took to Instagram to give his side of the story. He wrote: \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sporting president Federico Varandas has confirmed that his side won’t be bullied into selling his star forward. Speaking to Record, he said: \"One thing you should already know is me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\""

But the former midfielder struggled to hit the heights expected of him in the Premier League having made just 30 appearances for the club over two seasons before being allowed to join Turkish giants Besiktas.",
      "“It all happened so fast. It’s so fast. Unfortunately, I got a lot of injuries that push me back. I only say that because when I got an injury, I got back 100% to play, I need to compete against Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo who started to fly.",
      "“It’s not easy. I know I won the World Cup at the time and at a big name Manchester United but it took time to get to a better level. But injuries didn’t help me at that time.",
      "“But I was the first Brazilian in the Reds jersey, the first to score in Old Trafford and my sons are born there. I have great memories, I really enjoyed that time.”",
      "While Kleberson’s injuries limited his contributions for United, the man who he was unveiled alongside - Cristiano Ronaldo - enjoyed plenty of success. The five-time Ballon d'Or scored 118 goals across his first spell before his record move to Real Madrid.",
      "Kleberson knew he was destined for stardom after meeting him for the first time. He said: \"It’s so funny because when I get into Old Trafford to sign my contract, I remember I was on a table with a lot of agents. And then a young guy was there. I asked ‘who’s that kid?’ And it was Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "“I was told he played in a friendly game for Sporting vs United and he destroyed the game. Before Cristiano, they tried to bring Ronaldinho and I think ‘wow, that kid is probably special’.",
      "“As soon as I saw that kid on the field, his dribbling, his technical quality, it’s amazing. But one thing is was how focused he was. He was really focused on the things he wanted to see, concentrated.",
      "\"He wants to get better quickly. He had a special mentor in Sir Alex Ferguson and he put him in the right direction. Ferdinand, Roy Keane and Gary Neville helped him to improve. But the strong mind he had at that time really impressed me. To see him score goals in a final for Portugal, that kid never stops.”",
      "With it now being over two decades since Kleberson became the first Brazilian to sign for the club, United have once again turned to a Selecao star in the transfer market. Ruben Amorim’s side quickly paid Matheus Cunha’s £62.5m release clause to sign him from Wolves.",
      "Kleberson believes he could be just the answer the club are looking for to solve their goalscoring woes. He added: “It’s a big signing for Man United. I really enjoy watching Cunha play.",

      "“He does a little bit more close movement, a lot of runs without the ball, diagonal moves. It’s a big signing. I think United are going to be scoring well with him.”",
      "Another Premier League player who has been on the move this summer has been Jorginho. The Arsenal midfielder was allowed to leave the Emirates Stadium to sign for Brazilian side Flamengo ahead of the Club World Cup.",

      "“He’s a leader. He wants to come to Brazil, wants to play in the Maracana and now he can help the club a lot. But for this tournament, it’s a great signing and he’s going to be helping Flamengo a lot in some of the games.”",
      "Kleberson was speaking ahead of the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup 2025. Watch all 63 games live on DAZN for free.",

If and when the club becomes a major Premier League force again, it will be the biggest story in town and that is why Mbeumo should fancy the move to Old Trafford ahead of the move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "There are several obvious reasons why Spurs is an attractive proposition but the idea of being part of an exciting United rebuild should be an enticing one. And anyhow, the importance of what will surely turn out to be a Champions League struggle for Spurs is probably overstated.",
      "The talk is that Mbeumo’s heart tells him United … and he should go with his heart.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo should go to Tottenham. The Brentford forward is a serious player and moving to Tottenham, with his old boss Thomas Frank, would propel him to another level into the Champions League.",
      "In many ways I admire his ambition and why he wants to move to Manchester United. They are still such a big club with amazing tradition and great pulling power. To be part of a team - him on one side with Matheus Cunha on the other - could be really special if they suddenly reignite a sleeping giant. But what a gamble.",
      "And I refuse to believe it’s just about money and United offering more. Players earn huge wages and United are clearly trying to sell the dream. But Tottenham can offer European football.",
      "Mbeumo is a terrific player One former Premier League manager, who has scouted and discovered countless players, is convinced he is elite level and even likened him to Mo Salah. That good.",
      "His pace, skill, control and stats make him a huge star. He must choose well - because he has got the lot.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo should be a man of his word. If he’s told Manchester United he wants to join them then he should go through with that.",
      "What’s changed in the last few weeks? OK his boss at Brentford has joined Tottenham but are Tottenham suddenly in a different position? He knew they had Champions League football weeks ago and he knew United didn’t. If he told United he was sold on their project then not enough has changed since then for him to turn on his heels.",
      "But that still needs United to pay up the money and if they don’t then the player will have to make a choice.",
      "Jurgen Klopp once said he wanted players to push the train rather than ones who just want to jump on it. Mbeumo now has a decision to make which player he wants to be as United look to rebuild.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo should absolutely stick to his guns if Manchester United is the dream ticket.",
      "Tottenham can offer Champions League football and, of course, the lure of working with Thomas Frank again. But as a player approaching his peak years the challenge of restoring an institution like Manchester United to their former glory is surely just as appealing.",
      "The biggest factor here is that United are yet to strike a deal. Given they were leading a one-horse race before Frank swapped Brentford for Spurs, the onus is on them to make this happen.",
      "Forget about what Mbeumo should do next, United have to get this done if they are serious about rebuilding; that's how highly I rate Mbeumo.",
      "If I were in Bryan Mbeumo’s position, I might find myself wondering why Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur represent the only offers seemingly on the table. Only three players scored more Premier League goals than the Cameroonian last season, and yet his options appear to involve either staying put or moving to a club which finished several spots below his Brentford side this season.",
      "Mbeumo will be 26 when the new season begins. His peak years are approaching, but he can’t parlay that 20-goal season into more of a sure thing when it comes to locking in sustained Champions League football - with his two suitors mustering a combined two knockout ties in the competition this decade.",
      "Of the two options, Tottenham looks to be the slightly better fit. A reunion with Thomas Frank speaks for itself, while a first crack at Champions League football for a player still playing second-tier football as recently as 2021 may well be an opportunity he can’t resist.",
      "Yes, the potential upside at Old Trafford may feel greater, but how many others have thought the same in recent years only to find themselves lamenting wasted seasons. Spurs feels like the best option, even if Mbeumo might wonder why there isn’t something even better available to him.",
      "It’s certainly a tricky decision for Mbeumo. It basically boils down to money or European football so it depends on what the Brentford forward wants from his career.",
      "Given the investment that the Red Devils are making this summer, it might not actually be too long before they return to the Champions League and given that Old Trafford is his preferred option, it might make more sense to go there - but it is a big gamble.",
      "However, with Thomas Frank being appointed by Spurs, he will know exactly how to make a success of him North London. And should he manage to replicate the form he has shown over recent seasons in Brentford, there is no reason why Mbeumo can’t play in the Champions League over the coming seasons with Spurs.",
      "And while it might not have been in his thinking yet, a move to North London means he will not have to uproot anything. So as it stands, Spurs would potentially be the better option.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Former Manchester United youngster Angel Gomes believes the weight of the shirt may have stood in the way of some players succeeding for the Premier League club. United finished 16th in the league last season, and will not play in Europe in any capacity next term after losing the Europa League final, but some of their former stars have thrived away from Old Trafford.",
      "Gomes is certainly one of that number, impressing at Lille and earning a summer switch to fellow Ligue 1 side Marseille. He will link up there with Mason Greenwood, the former United forward who scored a career-best 22 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "Elsewhere in Europe, Scott McTominay enjoyed the best scoring season of his own career last term to help Napoli win Serie A. McTominay's former United team-mate Romelu Lukaku was also part of that title-winning squad, while former United players Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Alexis Sanchez and Matteo Darmian won the same competition with Inter Milan 12 months earlier.",
      "\"\"Players may have been intimidated or not really know about the weight, what it carries and what it takes,\" Gomes told BBC Sport. \"But ultimately, sometimes, it's down to environment, timing and having the right things in place to help you.",
      "\"Some players who have left and gone on to do better than when they were at United, there might be things in place at that certain club, at that moment in time, that helped them succeed. Sometimes it's not as black and white as they failed or they've not held their own there because of the weight of the shirt.\"",
      "Gomes became United's youngest ever Premier League player when he made his debut at the age of 16, but left in 2020 with just 10 senior outings to his name. His form at Lille really caught the eye, earning him a senior England bow under Lee Carsley, and he maintains it was the right decision to leave Old Trafford.",
      "\"It was obviously a difficult process because there are a lot of things that pull you towards staying,\" he added. \"But then you have to think about what is right for your career. There were a lot of things I sacrificed.\"",
      "Gomes thrived for England's Under-21s during his time at Lille, helping the team win the 2023 European Under-21 Championships under Carsley. He made his senior debut under the same manager at the age of 24, featuring in four of the Three Lions' six UEFA Nations League matches in the autumn of 2024.",
      "“He’s a player that we’re probably not used to seeing in terms of that kind of player,\" Carsley said upon handing Gomes his first call-up. \"But yet when we watched a Portugal team or a Spain team: ‘Ah, I really like that No.10. I really like him.’ We’ve got players like that within our pathway that need a chance.",
      "“Angel has had to go to another country to get that. He was such a talent, they had such high hopes for him at Manchester United. He’s just had to find a different route to get to where he is. I expect him to go from strength to strength.”",

With the transfer window's closure date brought forward to before the start of the season, United spent roughly a month apiece to bring in Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka before the world-record £80m they spent on Maguire in August.",
      "2018-19 had been United's worst defensive season in 40 years after Ed Woodward failed, or refused, to furnish Jose Mourinho with a new centre back. Maguire, also coveted by Mourinho, was priced at £75m by Leicester in 2018 and left for only £5m more a year later. Mourinho is the only modern United manager to be deprived of a priority target.",

      "Of course Mbeumo is full of appreciation for a man who plucked him from the French second tier and helped him develop into a player good enough to finish as the Premier League's fourth top scorer last season. But wishing him all the best doesn't smack of a player expecting to be reunited with his former boss any time soon.",
      "‌Frank was appointed as Tottenham boss last week, potentially throwing a spanner in the works of Manchester United's pursuit of Mbeumo.",
      "Frank and Mbeumo have spearheaded Brentford's transformation from Championship nearly men to an established Premier League outfit, and so it didn't take long for reports of Tottenham's interest in Mbeumo to surface following Frank's appointment as Ange Postecoglou's successor.",
      "Both Spurs and United endured wretched domestic campaigns last term, with the former finishing just one place above the relegation zone and United ending the season just two places and four points better off.",
      "However, Spurs' Europa League final triumph over United means they have the glamour of Champions League football to offer when looking to lure new signings to the club. There will be no European football at Old Trafford next term.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Tuesday, June 17.",
      "The summer transfer window has officially reopened and clubs can now start doing business freely again until the market closes for good on Monday, September 1. United have plenty of business to do both this week, and the subsequent weeks which are to follow.",
      "United's top priority will be to bring Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford after the Brentford star's ongoing negotiations with the Reds. Tottenham Hotspur have also shown an interest in him following the appointment of Thomas Frank and the Cameroonian has now broken his silence surrounding his future.",
      "Elsewhere, United appeared to receive a boost in their hunt to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer. Reports in Portugal suggest that Arsenal's interest is cooling in the Swedish star due to Sporting's valuation of the forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund continues to be linked with a move back to Italy with Inter Milan seemingly desperate for his signature. All United players are available to be sold in the summer window, for the right price, and thus Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Marcus Rashford all have suitors chasing their services.",
      "Keep across the United transfer updates in our blog below:",
      "According to Sky Sport Italia, the interest in Sancho from Napoli is there but his wages could prevent a deal from happening.",
      "The structure of a deal is currently unknown but this will apparently not stop the Naples club trying for him.",
      "Sancho has just one year remaining on his deal at United.",
      "If we were in Sancho's shoes right now, we would be all over a move to Napoli this summer.",
      "The club is on a high after winning Serie A, shall be playing in the Champions League and has already shown what they can do for a player that has lost their way.",
      "McTominay has progressed leaps and bounds under Conte and Sancho must surely feel he can follow in those footsteps.",
      "Journalist Gianluca di Marzio understands that Napoli have opened up as a potential home for Jadon Sancho this summer.",
      "United are on the lookout for suitors for Sancho after he failed to reach personal terms with Chelsea at the end of the season.",
      "Napoli reinvigorated the career of Scott McTominay this season and are looking to strengthen their wings ahead of the new campaign.",
      "With Boudaoui currently playing for Nice, another arm of Ineos' sporting empire, there may be some concerns as to whether United can actually purchase the midfielder.",
      "Last year, it was thought that United were blocked from signing Jean-Clair Todibo because both Nice and the Reds were competing in the Europa League.",
      "However, because United are not competing in Europe next season, it is unlikely that UEFA would block the sale as it would not be seen as a conflict of interest.",
      "Manchester United reportedly sent scouts to watch OGC Nice midfielder Hicham Boudaoui during Algeria's encounter with Sweden.",
      "It has been said that the transfer chiefs at Old Trafford monitored the 25-year-old's performance with reports suggesting that the club are eyeing a midfield addition this summer.",
      "In a report last month, it was claimed that an exit was looking increasingly likely for the Nice man.",
      "According to The Athletic, Eintracht Frankfurt remain stubborn with their £85m price tag for their talisman this summer.",
      "However, United have contacted the German club regarding his availability and how much the deal would cost.",
      "It is believed that these enquiries have found that Frankfurt are flexible on the structure of the £85m deal which could open the door for Ekitike to arrive in Manchester.",
      "Remaining on Hugo Ekitike, according to Caught Offside, United are still keen on his signature.",
      "It has been said that the fee for the Eintracht Frankfurt star is problematic but they are trying to bring the €100m (£85m) fee down.",
      "A swap deal isn't being ruled out either, the report adds. United could offer Ramus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee as part of the deal.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reported that Manchester United face a fight to sign Eintracht Frankfurt star Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Liverpool are also reportedly interested.",
      "However, the Anfield club face a number of factors surrounding their pursuit namely the future of Darwin Nunez.",
      "Romano claimed: “With Darwin leaving, Ekitike is a concrete target for Liverpool. Liverpool already spoke to the agents of the player at the end of May.",
      "\"Liverpool are in regular contact with people close to Hugo Ekitike, so for sure Ekitike remains a player on Liverpool’s list.",
      "“I know there are rumours on several clubs for this kind of striker, but don’t forget Liverpool, because they are still there.”",
      "Hello, we are back for another day of news and all things transfers.",

      "Thank you for tuning in and stay alerted for updates tomorrow...",
      "TuttoAtalanta have reported that Atalanta's Marco Carnesecchi is Manchester United's first-choice goalkeeper target to replace Andre Onana this summer.",
      "While Atalanta don't want to sell, they could be willing to cash in if a bid of £38million comes in for Carnesecchi. That would allow the Serie A club to make a serious amount on a homegrown player.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has praised Bruno Fernandes after the Manchester United captain turned down a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"The one thing it says to me, there's a loyalty. And I think that word gets banded about quite a lot, but we don't really see it often from the club's point of view and the players,\" Ferdinand told the Mirror.",
      "\"I understand it's a business. But I think he looks at this as pure, 'I've got unfinished business at United. There's stuff I want to do here. Yes, I've been paid well here. The fans love me.' But I think he's in the game of wanting to give back after all he's received. So I've got nothing but respect for him. I would have understood him leaving if he left, 100%. But the fact that he stayed and said there's stuff for me still to do here. I think it's a testament to him as a person, but also another reason why managers comfortably give him the armband.",
      "\"If I was him, I think I'd have found it difficult to say no [to Al Hilal]. I've got to be honest.\"",
      "Manchester United are showing interest in a summer move for Inter Milan midfielder Davide Frattesi, according to Sky Sport Switzerland journalist Sacha Tavolieri.",

      "Manchester United could have an unexpected boost in the race to sign Hugo Ekitike after the Eintracht Frankfurt forward revealed he supported the Reds as a child.",
      "The 22-year-old has been linked with a move to the Premier League this summer, with United, Chelsea and Liverpool all credited with an interest in the Frenchman.",
      "But if United's interest in the forward is genuine, then they will need to be creative with their pitch to the forward after missing out on Champions League qualification, while both Liverpool and Chelsea will be able to offer Ekitike the chance to play in Europe's premier competition.",
      "The Reds, though, will be able to play on the Frenchman's emotional connection to the club, after he revealed last year he supported United when he was younger.",
      "\"My favourite club as a child was Manchester United. I've always admired them,\" Ekitike told German broadcaster RTL in December 2024.",
      "Antony is keen to remain at Real Betis and the Spanish club have held several meetings in Manchester regarding his future, as per Diario AS.",
      "The Brazilian, 25, joined Betis on loan in January and impressed during the second half of the season, scoring nine goals and adding five assists in 26 appearances.",
      "Betis want to keep hold of Antony, and while there is concerns over the size of a transfer fee, work is ongoing and confidence is growing.",
      "Manchester United have made contact to sign Real Madrid forward Brahim Diaz this summer, according to a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes.",
      "It's added that United would be looking to give him a 'greater role' in the side, with Real said to be prepared to cash in on the 25-year-old former Manchester City man.",
      "Manchester United are keen on signing Algerian midfielder Hicham Boudaoui from INEOS-owned Ligue 1 side Nice, it has been claimed.",
      "The Sun report that United send scouts to watch Boudaoui in international action as Algeria took on Sweden at the Friends Arena.",
      "Club officials monitored the performance of Boudaoui, who started and played an hour before he was taken off. United are now thinking of signing the 25-year-old, who has been tipped to leave Nice.",
      "Marcus Rashford's 'dream' transfer to Barcelona could be left in tatters as the Catalan club press ahead to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club de Bilbao instead.",
      "The Manchester United forward has seen his long-term future become uncertain after a successful loan at Aston Villa, where he scored four times and added six assists in 17 matches.",
      "Despite this, United are expected to sever ties with the 27-year-old and want to secure a permanent exit, with Barcelona among those that have been linked with a potential summer move.",
      "But Barca appear to be focusing on another target, with Spain international Williams at the top of their shopping list. According to Sky Sport Germany, Barca have the 'best chance' to sign the 22-year-old ahead of Arsenal, Chelsea and Bayern Munich after 'important negotiations' took place over the last 24 hours.",
      "Spanish outlet Partidazo de Cope [via Footmercato] have reported that Man United target Marc-Andre ter Stegen has no intention of leaving Barcelona this summer.",
      "The goalkeeper has been linked with a move to Old Trafford but it's now said the 33-year-old will not consider terminating his contract despite Joan Garcia joining.",
      "Jadon Sancho is reportedly refusing to lower his wage demands in a move that could stop Man United selling the winger.",
      "GiveMeSport claim that Sancho's demands are putting off potential buyers due to his £300k-per-week wages.",
      "It's claimed Borussia Dortmund remain keen on signing him.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has suggested that Man United's move for Bryan Mbeumo is still 'ongoing' with the club yet to agree on a deal with Brentford.",

      "Tottenham have reportedly joined Chelsea and Aston Villa in the race to land Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The Daily Mail has claimed that the forward wants to stay in the Premier League but faces the tough challenge of leaving United. It's claimed United have slapped a £70m price tag on the 20-year-old.",
      "Chelsea, Villa and Tottenham are all keeping tabs.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has suggested that Viktor Gyokeres is yet to decide on his next move despite claims he has turned down Manchester United.",

      "Speaking to BBC Sport, Gomes said:",
      "I think some do. Players may have been intimidated or not really know about the weight, what it carries and what it takes. But ultimately, sometimes, it's down to environment, timing and having the right things in place to help you. Some players who have left and gone on to do better than when they were at United, there might be things in place at that certain club, at that moment in time, that helped them succeed. Sometimes it's not as black and white as they failed or they've not held their own there because of the weight of the shirt.",
      "While they were rejected by the striker in the first part of the summer transfer window, Al Hilal have not given up on their pursuit of the forward.",
      "According to Goal, the Saudi Pro League club are willing to offer the striker more than £42m per year to move to Al Hilal.",
      "Such an offer would gazump anything United could offer the forward but it remains to be seen if that figure is enough to tempt Osimhen to wave good bye to European football.",

      "Manchester United are hoping to avoid further UEFA punishment this summer should they try to purchase Nice midfielder Hicham Boudaoui in the transfer window.",
      "According to The Sun, United have sent scouts to France to take a look at the Algerian as they aim to strengthen their midfield. Danish international Christian Eriksen left on a free transfer at the end of this season so a gap has opened up for a replacement.",
      "However, the Reds will be wary about moving for the Nice man, considering how a deal last season reportedly collapsed with the club for centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo. Last summer, journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that a deal for Todibo was 99 per cent done until United won the FA Cup.",
      "That victory over Manchester City ensured that United would be playing European football during the 2024/25 campaign. Not only that, they would be entering the Europa League which Ineos-owned Nice had already qualified for through their Ligue 1 position.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe needed to provide evidence to UEFA to convince them that multi-club ownership rules were not being infringed. The European football authority insists that two clubs owned by the same entity or person cannot actively compete against each other.",
      "This rule was created to avoid a scenario where an owner may instruct one of his clubs to lose because he feels the other team has a better chance of advancing. Alternatively, an owner could theoretically instruct a team to lose to allow the other club to avoid dropping out of the competition altogether.",
      "Ratcliffe managed to satisfy UEFA that this would not be an issue but UEFA drew the line at United and Nice doing business that summer. This ensured that Todibo did not move to Old Trafford and instead he joined West Ham on loan where he has now joined permanently.",
      "Fast forward to this summer and, once again, Nice will be competing in Europe as they enter the Champions League qualifying stages. United on the other hand, are not in any European competition and therefore multi-club ownership restrictions should not be enforced if they were to try and sign Boudaoui.",
      "It is understood that Nice would be looking for £20m to allow their midfielder to leave this summer. This could be a good deal considering he is 25 and United will be looking to save money having spent a relatively large sum on Matheus Cunha and, should the deal be confirmed, Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo."

The financial benefit they will receive from the Club World Cup will swell coffers further, while the impact made on audiences in America could open further doors for commercial investment or growing the fanbase.",
      "United, meanwhile, are one of those looking in. Their task next term is to compete in the top six but, financially at least, City and Chelsea are stealing a march this summer and raking money in while the Reds felt the need to head off to Asia hours after the final whistle of the Premier League season to pocket around £10million.",
      "That's a drop in the ocean compared to the riches on offer right now in America and next season in the Champions League. United will need to box clever in the transfer market to close that gap.",
      "Their focus will be on recruitment and adding Mbeumo, and potentially others, to try and reshape Ruben Amorim's squad ahead of pre-season and the Portuguese's first full campaign in charge at Old Trafford.",

That is not straightforward when it's clear they're desperate to sell and their track record of selling players in recent years is awful.",

      "Although sources say Spurs are \"going hard\" for Mbeumo and are potentially prepared to offer him a higher salary, United are still regarded as the frontrunners on account of the player's wish to join the club. United's opening offer of £45million and £10m in add-ons was rejected earlier this month.",

      "An update has emerged about Manchester United's potential move for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike.",
      "United have been heavily linked with signing Ekitike this summer as they look to strengthen the centre forward position in their squad. Liverpool and Chelsea have also been credited with an interest in signing Ekitike this summer, who looks increasingly likely to leave Frankfurt during this transfer window.",
      "Frankfurt are reported to value Ekitike at around £85 millon and it remains to be seen what United will have planned for the striker position going into next season. United had wanted to sign Liam Delap from Ipswich Town before he completed a £30m move to Chelsea instead.",
      "A fresh report from Fabrizio Romano in Caught Offside has provided an update on Ekitike's future, which could see United handed a major boost.",
      "The report claims that United \"appreciate\" Ekitike, and have already held talks with the player's agent over a potential deal this summer. United currently have Christopher Vivell as their director of recruitment, who previously has experience working in the Bundesliga.",
      "As well as previously spending time at Chelsea, Vivell has also worked at RB Leipzig and Hoffenheim and, as a result, has built up an impressive understanding of the Bundesliga market.",
      "The report states that Vivell knows Ekitike well from his time in the Bundesliga, which could give United the edge over their rivals if they decide to pursue a deal for the France Under-21 international.",
      "Despite the recent links surrounding Ekitike, the striker is not the only centre forward rumoured to be a target for United. Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres have also been mentioned heavily on the rumour mill.",
      "United also want to finalise a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford this summer. A deal worth an initial £45m fee plus £10m in add-ons has already been rejected by the Bees, but United still have confidence that they can bring the Cameroon international to Anfield."

      "It's fair to say that Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will have a much better squad to choose from than the one that ended the miserable 2024/25 season.",
      "After inheriting a poorly built squad in November, Amorim failed to get his ideas across for the most part and even after reaching the Europa League final, United ended their worst season in 51 years with little optimism.",
      "Work is already underway in ensuring a repeat of last term doesn't repeat itself. Matheus Cunha's £62.5million arrival from Wolves significantly improves the attacking midfielder slots behind the striker and there is no sign of stopping there.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and a new centre-forward are the priority now the window has reopened for business. Yet there needs to be balance and players must be sold to not only raise funds, but to make room in Amorim's squad.",
      "No European football means the necessity for a large squad is no longer needed. But what is clear is that by the time the Premier League season kicks off (weekend of 16 August), Amorim must have the best possible squad.",
      "The rules are the same as last year. At least eight players must be qualified as homegrown (someone who has 'featured for an FA-affiliated club for at least three years before turning 21') while a maximum of 17 can be non-homegrown.",
      "Players under the age of 21 (born on or after January 1, 2004) will also not count towards the 25-man selection. Given United's recruitment focus on talented wonderkids in the last 18 months, there is space.",
      "Andre Onana isn't a player that United are desperate to sell, and he could very well stay as Amorim's number one. However, in a dream world, a goalkeeper as good as Emiliano Martinez would be snapped up.",
      "The World Cup winner could leave Aston Villa, and reports in Argentina have claimed he is open to moving to the club. He's an improvement to Onana, meaning the Cameroon international will be sold.",
      "Altay Bayindir will remain as second choice with Elyh Harrison, who was named in eight senior matchday squads last season, named too.",
      "Amorim uses five defenders in his 3-4-2-1 formation, with the job of the wing-backs vital. Victor Lindelof's exit means there are only five natural centre-backs now, but Noussair Mazraoui's reliability to cover means they have six options for three positions.",
      "At wing-back, United could do with another signing. A new left-back has been tipped, but Denzel Dumfries is one player that would be perfect for the system.",
      "The Inter Milan star is a natural at bombing up and down the right, offering such a dangerous threat. Diogo Dalot could do with the competition, although the Portuguese would be the first choice at left wing-back due to Luke Shaw's injury record.",
      "Harry Amass will be hoping to get more minutes in the first-team during pre-season, or a loan move could be the play for the youngster.",
      "Adam Wharton, as many have said, would be perfect for United's midfield. However, even with Christian Eriksen leaving, one more player would have to depart, such as Casemiro, to free up the funds and space in the squad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is a nailed-on starter after rejecting a move to Saudi Arabia, while Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are set to battle it out for a spot alongside the United captain. Wharton's arrival would provide even more competition.",
      "Amad is set to play a huge part this season, and Mason Mount's time at Old Trafford could come down to how successful he can be this season.",
      "However, it must be said, Wharton's signing could spell the end of one more player. Mainoo, who has been linked with a move away amid uncertainty over his contract, may be sacrificed, with him classed as pure profit on the books.",
      "There has to be a striker through the door this summer, and Viktor Gyokeres is the perfect man. Everything that has been said about what Amorim wants in a centre-forward points towards the Swede.",
      "The arrival of a new number nine would ultimately put an end to Rasmus Hojlund's time in England, although maybe only temporarily. Interest in Italy is growing, but whether the likes of Inter or Juventus could pay a permanent transfer.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee provides excellent back-up at centre-forward and behind the striker, with Chido Obi also an option for cup games and further senior minutes.",
      "Having both Cunha and Mbeumo behind a goalscoring-obsessed striker like Gyokeres would completely turn United's fortunes around in returning to the Champions League.",
      "Possible Man United 25-man Premier League squad: Martinez, Bayindir, De Ligt, Martinez, Maguire, Shaw, Dumfries, Dalot, Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte, Mainoo, Mount, Amad, Cunha, Mbeumo, Gyokeres, Zirkzee.",
      "Under-21: Harrison, Yoro, Heaven, Amass, Mainoo, Dorgu, Wharton, Collyer, Obi."

      "It was claimed that Gyokeres was keen to sign for the Gunners with the lure of Champions League football thought to be enough to sway him. However on Sunday, Arsenal were thought to be pulling away from the deal after it emerged that Sporting were unwilling to budge on their £68m release clause.",
      "The Swede's camp insist that Sporting made a gentleman's agreement with Gyokeres to allow him to depart Lisbon for just shy of £60m. However, according to Record, the north London club were now looking at Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins as an option.",
      "Amidst all this drama, it appears that Juve are looking to capitalise. Corriere dello Sport understand that the Turin club are looking to take advantage of the uncertainty and, after speaking with Gyokeres' representatives, would be willing to offer him an £11m per year contract which breaks down to roughly £211,000 per month.",
      "Unfortunately for Juventus, they do hit a hurdle in their pursuit of Gyokeres as it first rests on their current striker Dusan Vlahovic being sold. Despite scoring 15 goals this season, Juve are looking to offload the striker due to his unwillingness to lower his wage to allign with the club's new salary structure.",

      "Bayer Leverkusen striker Patrick Schick has 'received multiple enquiries' from clubs in the Premier League and Serie A, according to a report by Sky Germany.",
      "The 29-year-old's stock is currently high after he scored 27 goals in 45 appearances for Leverkusen during the 2024/25 campaign. It marked his best season in front of goal since joining the German club from AS Roma in January 2020.",
      "Of his 27 goals, 21 were plundered in the Bundesliga, meaning only Harry Kane scored more goals in the German top flight in the most recent campaign.",
      "Schick has been a fairly reliable source of goals in recent seasons, scoring 81 times in 168 games for Leverkusen. He scored 13 times in 33 games in 2023/24.",
      "With two years remaining on his Leverkusen contract, the Bundesliga outfit, who recently appointed former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag as their new boss, will not feel pressured into selling the Czech Republic international this summer. It has been claimed that if he does not leave the BayArena, he could be offered a contract extension.",
      "Although the report has not stated which clubs have enquired about signing the striker, who will turn 30 next January, he could be a realistic option for United to try and strengthen the tip of their attack this summer.",
      "The Reds are desperate to recruit a new No.9 and their search currently offers no obvious answer. They are being linked with a catalogue of strikers and the latest to have joined the list is Eintracht Frankfurt ace Hugo Ekitike, who scored 15 Bundesliga goals in 2024/25.",
      "United are also continuing to be heavily linked with Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli. However, none of the aforementioned players will come cheaply.",
      "However, despite his impressive record in 2024/25, Schick is unlikely to find himself categorised in the same bracket as Ekitike, Gyokeres and Osimhen, not least because he is slightly older and his record in front of goal has not been as prolific in comparison to Gyokeres' and Osimhen's.",
      "Despite scoring 40 goals since the start of the 2023/24 campaign, the 2022/23 season saw him score just four goals in 23 games, although his campaign was ravaged by injury issues. The season prior, though, he scored 24 times in 27 Bundesliga outings.",
      "United, despite signing Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and wanting to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal that could be worth a similar fee, do not have a bottomless pit to rely on this summer, meaning their hopes of landing a new No.9 are set to rely on raising funds via player sales.",
      "However, Schick is unlikely to command a fee as extravagant as what the likes of Gyokeres, Osimhen or Ekitike would. On the flip side, though, the Leverkusen striker is not held as high esteem as the aforementioned trio and will turn 30 next year."

      "Rapper Big Zuu, however, popped up with the winner in the closing stages, meaning an immensely popular figure turned out to be the match-winner.",
      "Here is how we rated the players out of ten:",
      "Joe Hart",
      "He was rarely troubled by a blunt World XI attack. He made one routine catch in a very quiet first half at his end of the pitch and was taken off at the break. 6",
      "Louis Tomlinson",
      "The One Direction star was the subject of cheers every time he got the ball. He started at right-back and regularly got forward on the overlap. 6",
      "Gary Neville",
      "The former United skipper started at centre-back and he didn't have much defending to do in the first half. 6",
      "Angry Ginge",
      "The United fan, who started at centre-back, produced an outstanding goal-line clearance to somehow keep out a chipped effort from Rivaldo in the first half. He also got the assist for Defoe's opener. 8",
      "Tom Grennan",
      "He started at left-back and went close to scoring England's second just minutes after Rooney's opener when he motored forward and bent a shot just over the bar. He regularly got forward and wanted to get on the ball. He also showed a willingness to win possession back. 7",
      "Jill Scott",
      "Captained England from the start and played with a trademark smile on her face. Carried the ball forward a few times from midfield before going off with just over 30 minutes on the clock. 6",
      "Michael Carrick",
      "Sat at the base of England's midfield, the former United midfielder bossed proceedings, picking out passes he so often did in his playing days. He played a superb pass to set Toni Duggan free to double England's lead. 7",
      "Jack Wilshere",
      "He started just behind Rooney and was awarded a free role. He delivered the cross that led to the opening goal and he enjoyed plenty of the ball after that. He popped up everywhere with possession and hit the post in the closing stages. 8",
      "James Nelson-Joyce",
      "Started on the right was arguably England's quietest player in the first half. He was replaced not long before half-time. 4",
      "Wayne Rooney",
      "The former United star opened the scoring with less than five minutes on the clock after finding himself in the right place at the right time to capitalise on a cross that wasn't dealt with. He linked up nicely with Wilshere throughout the opening half. 7",
      "Bella Ramsey",
      "Started on the left flank and huffed and puffed in the hope of getting on the ball and make something happen. Offered as much as energy as possible before going off after 21 minutes. 4",
      "Noteworthy subs:",
      "Toni Duggan",
      "Stepped off the bench and doubled England's lead on the stroke of half-time when she slotted a clinical finish past Edwin van der Sar. She timed her run to perfection to latch onto Carrick's pass. 7",
      "Paddy McGuinness",
      "After replacing Hart at the break, McGuinness was haunted by Tevez, who put four goals past him. He didn't cover himself in much glory. 4",
      "Jermain Defoe",
      "The former England striker scored twice after coming on at half-time, moving him level with Kem Cetinay at the top of the Soccer Aid scoring charts. His first goal was an emphatic finish and his second was a cool poke beyond Nicky Byrne. 8",
      "Aaron Lennon",
      "He rolled back the years by reminding everyone of his pace. The former Tottenham Hotspur man could have had two assists within minutes of coming on. 7",
      "Edwin van der Sar",
      "The legendary Dutchman was beaten twice in the first half, and he will not want to see the first goal back. He was unable to get his hands on Wilshere's cross after Nemanja Vidic tried to beat him to the same ball. He was taken off at half-time. 5",
      "Tony Bellew",
      "He was forced off with an apparent injury with just six minutes on the clock. N/A",
      "Nemanja Vidic",
      "Attempted to go for Wilshere's cross alongside Van der Sar and got caught out. However, he settled into the game and tried to help the World XI get up the pitch as much as he could. 5",
      "Richard Gadd",
      "The star of Baby Reindeer could not keep up with Duggan when she went scampering free to double England's lead. 4",
      "Harry Kewell",
      "The former Liverpool man's evening was over after just 15 minutes before being replaced by John O'Shea. He had a few touches of the ball but didn't do anything of note. 4",
      "Dermot Kennedy",
      "Tried a shot from distance five minutes before half-time that did not look all that far away from the top corner on second viewing. It was his only notable moment in the first half. 5",
      "Asim Chaudhry",
      "He was substituted after just over 20 minutes following a relatively low-key performance with few highlights. 4",
      "Kheira Hamraoui",
      "The former Paris Saint-Germain star tried to make things happen for the World XI and she had a couple of attempts at goal, the first of which was an inventive lob that required a comfortable save from Hart in the England goal. 6",
      "Diamond",
      "The Gladiators star lined up in attack that featured two former World Cup winners. She had a few touches of the ball, but her one foray forward was stopped by an excellent challenge from Angry Ginge. 5",
      "David Trezeguet",
      "A World Cup winner with France in 1998, the former striker had a fairly quiet first half, with England dominating. He flashed a shot wide not long before the break and went off not long after the break. 5",
      "Rivaldo",
      "One of the most famous names on the pitch, the Brazilian, now 53, lacked pace to make things happen as often as would have liked. However, he was unlucky not to make it 1-1. 6",
      "Noteworthy subs:",
      "Nicky Byrne",
      "Brought on at half-time and made a terrific double save less than two minutes in, denying Defoe and Bartlett when it looked easier for them both to score. He then got booked just moments later for handling the ball outside the box. 8",
      "Carlos Tevez",
      "The Argentine came on at half-time and helped himself to four goals in less than 15 second half minutes, inspiring an impressive second half comeback. His quartet of goals featured a cool finish at the end of a jinking run and a well-placed free-kick. 10",
      "Robbie Keane",
      "The former Tottenham man is a seasoned Soccer Aid star and the World XI benefitted from his experience up front. He provided the assist for Tevez's opener and was a real nuisance. 7",
      "Big Zuu",
      "An unlikely match-winner. He curled a smart finish past McGuinness, who made a theatrical attempt to keep it out of the net. 7"

      "19) 🆕 Jarrad Branthwaite – Everton to Tottenham\nAre Tottenham and Manchester United using the same scouts? Will Spurs be linked with Nicolas Gaitan next? Or maybe Wesley Sneijder? Regardless, Everton have told everyone the defender is not for sale. Given they priced out United last year when he probably was up for grabs, we can forget this one for now unless Branthwaite kicks up a fuss.",

We’re told Napoli have £45million to spend on a winger, but they have a couple of better options in Manchester. More specifically, they have a better option in the United cast-off bin. And if Chelsea wouldn’t pay Sancho’s wages, an amount he is due for another year from United, then the ex-England winger has no hope of getting such a salary from Napoli.",

      "",
      "16) Antoine Semenyo – Bournemouth to Manchester United\nTottenham were linked with the Bournemouth attacker and now United apparently have him in their sights if Mbeumo chooses a reunion with Thomas Frank at Spurs. Eberechi Eze is also an alternative target. This is a long way from being a thing.",
      "",
      "",
      "14) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are looking for a striker, and Nunez would probably be very popular in Naples. But the chances of Napoli meeting Liverpool’s asking price seem slim, especially while the Reds know their Saudi friends are willing to pay in excess of £60million for a player who definitely isn’t worth that.",

      "",
      "13) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThere was a report from Record in Portugal that Gyokeres had told United he wasn’t interested, but others dispute that claim. Either way, it seems to us that the Swede is holding out for Arsenal. If the Gunners go a different way, then United might be in. But then they have to deal with Sporting, who deny they ever agreed to sell for £59million.",

City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",

Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack.

Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Alexander Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East?

      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, getting as far as they can with both before they have to make a decision either way. It’s a dangerous game, especially while both attract interest from elsewhere and players like to feel wanted. The Gunners will get no discount on either. Right now, there seems to be a little more noise around Sesko, but that could quickly change with the wind.",

      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo is giving mixed signals. At first he only had eyes for United but Thomas Frank’s appointment has given Spurs renewed hope. If nothing else, it should prompt United into decisive action in the form of a second offer, though they would ‘abandon’ a move on one condition.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, apparently, are coming around to RB Leipzig’s thinking and they were due to spend the weekend gathering their loose change with the intention of submitting a serious bid this week. The Gunners are trying to keep their options open, which can only take them so far. Especially while Bayern Munich eye Sesko as a potential successor to Harry Kane.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein said it’s done. But still we wait.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nIt’s happening, apparently. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here. The fact Bournemouth have now signed a replacement suggests this will get moving again very soon.",

      "Chelsea have already directly replaced three transfer-listed players they are yet to sell this summer, with 10 stars available for £337.6m on their ways out.",
      "",
      "10) Lucas Digne (unknown)\nIt seems curious for Atletico Madrid to lead their transfer philosophy on old Marco Silva quotes dredging up the Merseyside rivalry between Digne and Andy Robertson, but Diego Simeone has his methods.",
      "If Robertson cannot be procured on a cheap basis from Liverpool then Digne is a suitable alternative: 31, with a contract expiring soon, abundant experience and a skillset which could thrive in La Liga.",
      "Unai Emery might ordinarily be loathe to lose a player who started 37 Premier and Champions League games last season, but with Ian Maatsen ready to step up and £5.9m teenage signing Yasin Ozcan capable of moving into that back-up void, it could be a perfect opportunity to trim a ludicrous wage bill.",
      "",
      "9) Milos Kerkez (£45m)\nAnother domino fell in The Great Left-Back Transfer Exchange when Bournemouth completed the signing of Adrien Truffert from Rennes, who themselves have brought in Lilian Brassier to help cover a side vacated by their erstwhile captain.",
      "Whether Robertson remains at Anfield or not, his Liverpool starting place will be lost either way when Kerkez is finally picked from the Cherries, who have moved decisively for their own replacement.",
      "“It’s a dream for any player to play in the Premier League,” said Truffert upon his £11.4m switch to the south coast. “It’s a great opportunity for me to keep progressing and to be part of an ambitious project.”",
      "It is also, crucially, a wide-open berth on his side of the defence. Kerkez has shown the power of the Bournemouth stepping stone and it was a contractual obligation to describe his current employers as ‘paving the way’ for the Hungarian to leave for Liverpool with a necessary Truffert shuffle.",
      "",
      "8) Mateo Joseph (£13m)\n“There was a change, the other striker started to play. I started playing quite a bit and then went from everything to nothing. It was a blow,” said young Joseph of a season in which he started the first eight Championship games, then three of the next 16 and none of the final 22.",
      "Having played all but seven of the club’s league matches en route to promotion, yet ranking 16th for minutes played in the squad, the hint has been entirely taken and Real Betis are hoping they have found a cost-efficient Antony equivalent.",
      "Eight goals in 11 Spain U21 caps suggest he could flourish in a more comfortable environment yet it seems unlikely Leeds and Daniel Farke would trust Joseph any more in the Premier League than they did on the journey there.",
      "It might be that the free transfer capture of Lukas Nmecha from Wolfsburg was a signal of intent to cash in on Joseph if enough can be raised through his sale for necessary reinforcements.",
      "",
      "7) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (£30m)\nThere is an element of sympathy for Dewsbury-Hall, the usual comfort blanket signing made by a manager climbing up the football ladder, who was discarded almost as soon as Enzo Maresca unpacked.",
      "But there is equally a sense that he really ought to have known things could turn out this way for a big fish in the little pond at Leicester when dropped into the shark-infested transfer ocean of Chelsea.",
      "Including the Club World Cup, with Dewsbury-Hall an inevitable unused substitute in the opening game, the midfielder ranked 15th for minutes played this season at Chelsea.",
      "Remove from the equation the Conference League – in which he finished the full 90 minutes in nine of 12 games and started 11 before coming on as a late substitute in the final – and he comes 22nd behind Benoit Badiashile.",
      "That is his reality with Champions League qualification secured. Dario Essugo has arrived from Sporting and immediately established himself as the Moises Caicedo understudy guaranteed a great many minutes. Dewsbury-Hall knows the bomb squad treatment awaits unless he accepts his fate of a move to Burnley or West Ham or some such.",
      "",
      "6) Mateo Kovacic (£25.5m)\nTijjani Reijnders has already dismissed the idea he is “here to replace” Kevin de Bruyne, and 19 goals with nine assists in 104 Milan appearances, while admirable, do not scream attacking midfield genius.",
      "“A lot of times I watched Kevin but another player I can learn a lot of things from is Gundogan. It is nice to see him up close and see how he does it,” said Reijnders of a more apt comparison. But it feels as though Kovacic has the most to lose in this sudden midfield evolution at the Etihad.",
      "The return of Rodri to the fold was bound to reduce the chances for his midfield companions but it is easy to envisage how responsibilities might otherwise be shared between Reijnders, Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, weird FA Cup final substitute Claudio Echeverri, forgotten January signing Nico Gonzalez and academy graduate Nico O’Reilly.",
      "For Kovacic, any answer beyond an exit with his transitional purpose under Pep Guardiola served is less obvious.",
      "",
      "5) Evan Ferguson (£60m)\nA West Ham loan under Graham Potter did nothing to resuscitate the career of Ferguson, who nevertheless seems destined for another hopeful loan. Given the current choice of Everton or Celtic, he might be in no rush to make a decision.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler seemed open to the idea of working with Ferguson in January but accepted his desire for more minutes and a change of surroundings. Yet his short stay at West Ham only deepened the sense of a player having lost his way.",
      "And Brighton know they cannot stand still and wait for the 20-year-old to realise his potential, hence the double down on teenage orthodox Greek forwards in January signing Stefanos Tzimas and £29.8m Olympiacos prodigy Charalampos Kostoulas.",
      "",
      "4) Noni Madueke (£51.1m)\nWith Chelsea having already made a faintly ludicrous five signings for almost £100m this summer, their planned 14-player exodus will proceed as planned to sate their weird transfer fetish.",
      "As one of the longest-serving players in the squad, Madueke has had his turn and is among those for whom the club will listen to offers while not actively and desperately seeking a sale.",
      "A prohibitive price narrows Madueke’s options considerably with Chelsea wanting around double what they paid in January 2023 for a forward with 20 goals and nine assists in 88 appearances since.",
      "But nowhere are new toys shinier than at Stamford Bridge and there is a particular sparkle emanating from 18-year-old Brazilian winger Estevao Willian, who will link up with his new employers and take someone’s place upon the conclusion of the Club World Cup.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish (£40m)\n“I’m not Kevin De Bruyne,” revealed Rayan Cherki. “He is the legend.”",
      "But the Ballon d’Or-chasing Frenchman might well be the successor to Jack Grealish as the exciting, absurdly talented wide forward who is destined to be accused at some point of being ruined by Guardiola and turned into a backwards-passing robot.",
      "“Today’s game is less beautiful, fewer mistakes, but also fewer risks taken,” Cherki added in what could quite easily have been interpreted as a dig at his new manager. “I want to bring that spark back and give kids the joy it once had.”",
      "It was a battle Grealish fought and quite convincingly lost in the end, to the extent there are precious few takers at a considerable knock-down price this summer for a player Manchester City absolutely no longer want.",
      "",
      "2) Christopher Nkunku (£35m)\nIt was something of a surprise to see Nkunku given some cameo minutes against LAFC, the forward having been imbued with the aura of a pre-match chat with a beshirted Olivier Giroud.",
      "But that might well be where his Chelsea odyssey ends, considering Liam Delap proved his almost immediate suitability to the Enzo Maresca cause in a way many have struggled before him.",
      "Delap stands to take the permanent place of Nicolas Jackson, as he did from the bench in that impressive Club World Cup cameo. But the Senegal forward has shown enough to remain a fine squad option, dropping down the pecking order to knock Nkunku out of it entirely.",
      "“I think it is always healthy to have competition, it is football,” Delap said after the game. “The good thing about Liam is that he knows the way we want to play, so the process is quite quick,” Maresca added, with Nkunku having no part to play in a bright future.",
      "",
      "1) Rasmus Hojlund (£38m)\nThe complexion will change again once Harry Kane definitely joins Manchester United, but there are no feasible scenarios which benefit Hojlund in this transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim has neither the time nor the patience to invest on a project, even with his public admiration of a 22-year-old who has never lacked in attitude and application.",
      "But Manchester United renewing an old transfer policy betrays their need to sign players who are as close to a guarantee of quality in the current day as possible. Matheus Cunha ticks all the boxes Hojlund cannot yet wish to.",
      "Pep Guardiola has reportedly asked Manchester City to include Jack Grealish in a deal for a Real Madrid superstar in order to lower the price of the deal.",
      "According to reports, Jack Grealish could join another Manchester City star in joining Everton this summer as Kyle Walker has ‘agreed a sensational’ move.",
      "According to reports, Jack Grealish’s proposed move from Manchester City to Napoli hinges on Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Premier League giants Arsenal have been urged to sanction another raid on rivals Manchester City to reunite Mikel Arteta with a former player.",
      "Florian Wirtz is set to become the Premier League’s most expensive signing but how have his predecessors fared?",

      "Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer – and even the Premier League champions could let one go.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Your guess is as good as ours.",
      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Jhon Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which puts him firmly in the undesirable camp in modern football. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of a late panic.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. And Mikel Arteta reportedly prefers him to Gyokeres. Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Manchester United.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea have now brought in Liam Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but that would open him up to ridicule after calling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s agent a “dumb f**k” for saying he was moving there.",
      "Clubs seem to be oblivious to Osimhen’s availability but it’s guaranteed that the Nigerian will leave Napoli this summer after spending the season on loan at Galatasaray. His bridges in Naples have been burned to the ground.",
      "READ NOW: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have submitted a higher ‘offer’ than FC Barcelona as the Premier League giants look to sign a long-term target.",
      "The longer Viktor Gyokeres’ future remains undecided, the more clubs join Arsenal in pursuing an interest in one of Europe’s most potent strikers.",
      "Arsenal are in ‘advanced talks’ over signing a new striker as a fresh report has revealed sporting director Andrea Berta’s ‘plan’ in an ‘unusual approach’.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Not if Kylian Mbappe has anything to do with it…",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have decided to ‘freeze’ their move for Manchester United target Viktor Gyokeres as they ‘look at’ two alternatives.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is ‘unlikely’ to join Manchester United this summer as his ‘priority is to join Arsenal’, Fabrizio Romano has confirmed."

If Rayan Cherki ends up doing skills on the edge of the pitch and losing the ball when City are 1-0 (like he often did at Lyon) he will feel like wasted money even though it was a small fee. If Wirtz scores the winner in a Champions League final it will feel worth it. That’s just how it works.",
      "If the player does the job they were brought in to do he’s worth it. Allison for example was brought in for an enormous price because we hadn’t had a keeper who can stop one on ones and distribute the ball well in a decade, Allison did that and much more so nobody ever talks about the price.",

      "Is any United fan really gonna tell me that if Antony cost a quid they believe he would be a good players who brings something to the team it doesn’t already have? If Jack Grealish didn’t cost £100m would he be a better player for City?\nLee",

      "Some Arsenal fans have this weird obsession with comparing their players with Rodri. I was told Partey was better than Rodri after the former joined Arsenal in 2020 (he wasn’t). And then they repeated the trick when announcing that Rice is better than Rodri after Arsenal signed him in 2023. Partey was now, no longer worthy of comparison strangely. And I bet that they will say that Zubimendi is better than Rodri if he signs for Arsenal as planned.",
      "The weirdest bit is that Arteta doesn’t play Rice at DM. He played Partey or Jorginho instead, and has bought Zubimendi, as he knows Rice isn’t good enough to play DM at a team that wants to compete at the highest level. So it makes no sense to compare Rice to Rodri, when Rice is a box to box number 8 now, that compliments his physical strengths.",
      "If we assume that Tuchel will end up playing 4-3-3, as most of the English players he can pick play in that formation I find it weird how high Rice is rated in the England Ladder.",
      "When Rice played DM for England at the Euros, the back 4 ended up playing the ball left and right in a horseshoe shape as Rice wasn’t showing for the ball. He pretty much man marked the opposition and took himself out of the game. He wasn’t on the half turn, he didn’t get into space quick enough when pressed and his first touch isn’t good enough. As a result England couldn’t transition from defence to midfield when pressed. What England need is a proper DM for that role. We tried Angel Gomes and I still have hopes for Wharton, but we need someone who can play that role properly.",
      "Then England need two other midfielders and this is where Rice should play. But if everyone was fit and on form, and with a proper DM, would Rice be in the team ahead of all but one of Bellingham, Palmer, Foden, Eze, Rogers or Mainoo? Bellingham, when not being stroppy, provides the physicality that Rice does, so there should be a space for a more creative player next to him. Personally, I’d choose Palmer, so I’m surprised that Rice is number 3 on the ladder.",
      "TL;DR – Rice seems like a nice bloke, but isn’t a DM, shouldn’t be compared to Rodri, and shouldn’t play DM for England, and has a battle IMO to keep his England place in a midfield 3 if everyone is fit.\nAndy D. Manchester. MCFC",

FA Cup, Coca-Cola Cup, Charity Shield, Super Cup…..the players that win those trophies quite clearly think they are worth winning.",

No Johnny, what people were shocked by was it was so clean & without flaws that it clearly meant that he’d been learning it for quite some time – let’s say a lot longer than when Real first approached Liverpool back in January. Which means his decision to join Real has probably been taken long time ago & he could’ve even met privately with people from the club to discuss a potential move, whilst firmly a contracted Liverpool player.",
      "I think that will be the real kicker for Liverpool fans – it’s not like he’s had his head turned in January by Real’s interest but that he’s probably been sounded out by people at Madrid several years ago & he’s just allowed his contract to run down.",
      "Up the Wahs.\nPeter Stone",
      "",
      "…Johnny Nic spent about 8 paragraphs making the point that it shouldn’t be surprising a footballer speaking a foreign language.",
      "He is almost seeing what’s surprising about it. See it isn’t surprising when a football player can speak a second language. Nobody is surprised at that.",
      "However it is surprising seeing and English or American person speaking a second language because that really isn’t so common. I’d go a little further and say that in Trent’s case the consternation stems from him being Scouse.",
      "Those of us whose first language is English tend to be a little bit….entitled and carry an expectation that people will speak English because it’s the sort of international language. I’ve travelled most of the world and I’ve English, Americans and australians all in foreign countries just using English with little to no attempt at the local language. This isn’t just my opinion either, the locals I speak to on my travels are always surprised when I can speak their language (Portuguese, Spanish, Filipino and Vietnamese in case you’re curious) and they’re surprised because English speaking people don’t usually make the effort.",
      "And I confess in my teenage school years I did not bother with french because had the naive opinion that “everywhere speaks English anyway.”",
      "I currently reside in Brasil and local faces light up when they learn I’m not a brasileiro and speak it well. In fact the only places where people don’t seem to appreciate that effort is Paris (where they have actual disdain if you attempt french and would rather you use English) and in the UK where people swat someone attempt at English aside like it’s a simple thing.",
      "So perhaps Johnny , the reason everyone is surprised at Trents Spanish is because the English aren’t known for their linguistic skills…Joey Barton speaking french is how it often turns out.\nLee",

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘put an offer of £127m on the table’ for Barcelona star Raphinha as the Red Devils ‘strike a blow to the market’.",
      "Amorim is working closely with newly-promoted Director of Football Jason Wilcox to rebuild an ailing squad which produced the worst season in living memory last term.",
      "The focus is very much on attacking players in the transfer market, with Matheus Cunha already joining the club after the Red Devils triggered his £62.5m release clause to land him from Wolves.",
      "Having been beaten to the signing of Liam Delap – who impressed on his debut for Chelsea on Monday – they’re also scouring the market for a new No.9, though their pursuit of Viktor Gyokeres appears to have ended after the striker told them where to go.",
      "They’ve had one bid rejected for Bryan Mbeumo of £55m plus a further £10m in add-ons rejected by Brentford, and are considering an improved bid amid competition from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham.",
      "And now, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, the Red Devils have made a genuinely unbelievable ‘offer of €150m [£127m] for Raphinha’, having found some loose change down the back of one of their canteen chairs now collecting dust in a warehouse.",
      "‘The figure has surprised even in the Camp Nou offices’ the report admits, ‘where a proposal of such magnitude was not expected by the Brazilian winger’.",
      "No mention of the dire financial straits that Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed would have seen Manchester United go “bust by Christmas” had he not stopped providing lunches for staff though, nor their failure to qualify for European competition next season to further increase their woes, with the report instead stating that ‘the interest of the English team responds to its desire to strike a blow to the market’.",
      "United supposedly ‘see in Raphinha a piece that could make a difference from day one’ and that ‘his experience in the Premier League, after his time at Leeds United, makes his adaptation to the rhythm and demands of English football not unknown’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Although Barça does not contemplate easily parting with one of its most decisive players – with 34 goals and 25 assists in 57 games this season – the economic dimension of the offer forces the club to reflect. United’s proposal comes at a time when the Barcelona entity needs financial balance, and that income would be an opportunity difficult to ignore.’",
      "By far the strangest claim in the report appears to be an assertion that ‘United’s sporting situation’, which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League last season – could actually be a factor in persuading him to leave Barcelona for Old Trafford.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘It remains to know Raphinha’s position. At 28 years old, the Brazilian is in the best moment of his career, and although he has shown commitment to Flick’s project, United’s sporting situation could weigh on his decision.’",
      "Absurd.",
      "Barcelona forward Raphinha is against any move to bring Liverpool winger Luis Diaz to the Camp Nou this summer, according to reports.",
      "Another Big Midweek brings another huge Champions League test for Arsenal and a potential last dance for Spurs head coach Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Chelsea and Man City have both identified Barcelona winger Raphinha as a ‘top priority’ for the summer transfer window, according to a report.",
      "According to reports, a ‘last-minute offer’ to Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has ‘boosted’ FC Barcelona and done the Spanish giants a ‘favour’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City are among two potential destinations for Barcelona star Raphinha, who has ‘offers on the table to leave’.",
      "Raphinha was made to eat his own words after his Brazil side were thumped 4-1 against rivals Argentina in the World Cup qualifiers."

      "The outlet wrote on X: ‘EXCL. Manchester United is now looking for a new GK. 25 yo OGC Nice GK Marcin Bułka among interests. Marcin Bulka is open to a move this summer as he has already asked to leave Nice.’",
      "It comes as no surprise that United are looking to Nice in order to improve their squad given the Ligue 1 side are also owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, but any moves would have to wait until the last day of the transfer window on September 1 after UEFA put a ban on the multi-club transfers as a result of both teams competing in the Europa League together last season.",
      "A report on Monday claimed United may not be looking to sign a new goalkeeper in any case, or not a new No.1 at least, as Amorim has decided to put his ‘trust’ in Andre Onana.",

      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "The longer Viktor Gyokeres’ future remains undecided, the more clubs are crystallising an interest in one of Europe’s most potent strikers.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester United have been strongly linked with the Swedish centre-forward and a return to England from Sporting CP has seemed inevitable, even with Gyokeres sending up smoke signals trying to catch the eye of Real Madrid.",
      "Despite the prospect of a reunion with former Sporting head coach Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford, Arsenal have been the favourites to sign the 27-year-old and can wave Champions League football in his face just in case.",

      "The Bianconeri’s attacking corps includes Dusan Vlahovic, Arkadiusz Milik, Timothy Weah and Kenan Yildiz but Vlahovic and Yildiz in particular are known to be of interest to other clubs in the summer transfer window.",
      "Gyokeres would be seen as an upgrade in any case and Juventus are reportedly putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to backing head coach Igor Tudor and equipping him with the firepower to get the club back on track.",

Arsenal, Man Utd bid(s), ‘blackmail’, fake agent quotes and a ‘sales mandate’",
      "Vlahovic’s departure might be a prerequisite. Corriere dello Sport reports that Vlahovic would need to be sold for Juve to be able to afford Gyokeres.",
      "“Juventus has been anticipating the move for weeks, talking to the [player’s] entourage and even with the club, despite denials on the surface,” according to George Marota.",
      "“Obviously, it is a complex deal. It certainly is from an economic point of view: the Bianconeri, after an initial offer, have relaunched by getting closer to the boy’s wishes.”",
      "Chief among Gyokeres’ reported expectations is a colossal £11m per year in wages, the kind of income that could tempt a young man to abandon hopes of a Premier League move and keep him in hair product for a lifetime.",
      "Gyokeres joined Sporting from Coventry City in 2023 after almost firing the Sky Blues back to the top flight of English football.",
      "His scoring record in Portugal has been nothing short of absurd. Gyokeres has scored 68 goals in 66 league appearances for the Lisbon giants and six times in six starts in the Champions League.",
      "In all competitions, he’s scored 97 goals in 102 Sporting appearances. While it’s certainly possible to question how effectively a prolific scorer can apply his abilities in the Premier League or Serie A, these are numbers that cannot be ignored.",
      "If it comes down to a direct choice between Vlahovic and Gyokeres, Juventus would surely see the latter as an £11m-a-year gamble worth taking.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "Arsenal are in ‘advanced talks’ over signing a new striker as a fresh report has revealed sporting director Andrea Berta’s ‘plan’ in an ‘unusual approach’.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Not if Kylian Mbappe has anything to do with it…",

      "The Ballon d’Or has become A Thing for players in the modern era but this summer has been marked by transfer decisions being made based on winning it, with Liverpool heavily impacted.",
      "",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid\nFinishing 19th in the 2019 Ballon d’Or vote – and collecting more career votes than Paul Scholes in the process – planted a seed in the mind of Alexander-Arnold.",
      "Zero points from his next and most recent shortlist appearance in 2022 helped crystallise a decision he would formalise three years later, dragging him kicking and screaming (in fluent Spanish) away from his Anfield home.",
      "In hindsight, publicly and proudly picking a Ballon d’Or win over becoming Liverpool captain, lifting the World Cup with England or claiming a second Champions League was the first sign for the Reds that simply being the sole Scouser in their team was not enough to sate some grandiose life goals.",
      "“I want to be the first full-back to ever do it,” he said of his Ballon d’Or ambition, adding that his desire was to be remembered as “a legend of football, someone who changed the game” with a “legacy of being the greatest right-back to have played football”.",
      "Jan Kromkamp has a lot to answer for.",
      "With Michael Owen in 2001 still the only winner of the award as a Liverpool player, and Real Madrid offering a platform to more individual champions than any other club in history, it was not difficult to see where Alexander-Arnold was signalling and manoeuvring with his career crossroads on the horizon.",
      "Conducted in October 2024 at a time Alexander-Arnold was supposedly locked in negotiations with Liverpool over extending a contract due to expire in the summer, it might as well have been an exit interview.",
      "Alexander-Arnold did downplay the Ballon d’Or lure at his Real unveiling, saying he was not sure it “influenced my decision to come here at all” as “it is going to be quite hard to win the Ballon d’Or with the amount of superstars in this team”.",
      "But he also claimed to have been learning Spanish for “a few months”, and said he “grew up watching Real Madrid win three Champions League titles in a row” despite literally appearing in the last of those finals, so his status as a reliable narrator is uncertain.",
      "",
      "Rayan Cherki joining Manchester City\n“I want to win the Ballon d’Or and win the Champions League,” reads and sounds like a bold but feasible set of objectives laid out by Cherki as a new Manchester City signing.",
      "Yet that was his response to Lyon academy director Jean-Francois Vulliez when the 15-year-old was asked about what he wanted to achieve as a player, around the time Manchester United were considering an ‘unusual’ move for one of Europe’s most thrilling young talents.",
      "The Frenchman understandably never came close to enacting that plan in a solid but unspectacular Lyon side, but the Manchester City spotlight was a specific driving factor in his £30.5m summer switch.",
      "“When you see Rodri win the Ballon d’Or it is clear with Manchester City it is possible to do so and I am here for this,” he said in his first Etihad interview.",
      "Manchester City do only have as many Ballon d’Or wins as Blackpool, Dukla Prague and Ferencvaros, but you see his point.",
      "",
      "Mohamed Salah staying at Liverpool\nMany seemed to consider it an inevitability but the 2025 award was beyond Salah once his no-show across two legs of a Champions League last-16 exit to Paris Saint-Germain was completed.",
      "The Egyptian was at one stage most certainly among the favourites, but record-breaking excellence in a Premier League title win was never likely to be enough by itself.",
      "But it remains a holy grail of sorts – and a key motivation behind his decision to resist Saudi Arabia overtures and continue at Liverpool with a new contract.",
      "“It’s not in my hands, but obviously, one day I would like to win the Ballon d’Or for my people,” he said in May. “When you come from a village in Egypt, as a child, it’s difficult to dream of the Ballon d’Or. It was when I came to Liverpool that I started to think that, maybe, one day…”",
      "Salah went on to point out that “several winners in recent years have been in their 30s” so his candidacy remains strong, as “next season promises to be exciting with the defence of our title with Liverpool and the Champions League, the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt and the World Cup.”",
      "Jamie Carragher will be wondering why the little dancer listed three major tournaments there alongside a jolly continent-wide gathering, but 2026 does feel like Salah’s best opportunity to round off his long catalogue of achievements.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho deciding his next steps\nVinicius Junior came second. Callum Hudson-Odoi was third. Phil Foden and Rodrygo rounded out the top five. But they all lagged behind Sancho in the running for Goal’s NXGN award, handed to the season’s best player under the age of 19.",
      "It can be an indicator of success for the transition from prodigious excellence to brilliance at a more senior level; the last two winners were Lamine Yamal and Jude Bellingham.",
      "But it can go the way of the 2021 winner, with the pressure translating to unfulfilled potential.",
      "Sancho never envisaged taking that path when he was crowned in 2019, saying: “This is not the end of it. I dream of winning the Ballon d’Or, given the likes of those who have won it previously, like Leo Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Modric and Ronaldinho.”",
      "Six years later, compulsive buyers Chelsea have paid £5m to specifically not sign him and the 25-year-old has no part to play in the Manchester United revolution.",
      "If he wants to revive those long-faded Ballon d’Or dreams, it might be a start for Sancho to drop his wage demands and secure a more permanent “freedom” arrangement.",
      "",
      "Pedri considering Manchester City\nThat Rodri win in 2024 was a watershed moment for many a player as the first Manchester City coronation, and only the second defensive-minded victor in almost three decades.",
      "“Since Rodri won it, it’s shown that a player who runs the midfield and dictates the tempo and the rhythm of the game can win a Ballon d’Or,” said compatriot Pedri, one of the standard-bearers of the next generation of midfield metronomes.",
      "“It’s always been a dream of mine to lift the Ballon d’Or,” he added in May. “But right now, there’s a month to go, and the focus is on the team – on completing the Treble, which is what really matters and once that month’s over, we’ll see if we can start talking about things like that.”",
      "The conversation sadly ended there, with Pedri powerless to stop Inter in the Champions League semi-finals before defeat to Portugal in the Nations League final. The sight of Vitinha and Joao Neves controlling the games on each of those occasions cannot have helped.",
      "But perhaps the answer is staring Pedri in the face: a British transfer record move to Manchester City to truly emulate Rodri.",
      "An actual footballer can learn a foreign language?! If you’re surprised, maybe you’re the thick one…",
      "Some modern legends of the game are out of contract in 2025; will they sign on again to give themselves a shot at World Cup 2026?",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are involved in a ‘three-way Premier League battle’ to sign Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho.",
      "Liverpool will eventually pay a British record transfer fee for Florian Wirtz while Manchester City have paid just £30.5m for Rayan Cherki.",
      "The ‘exceptional’ Club World Cup transfer window closes at 7pm on Tuesday, with a series of eye-catching possible signings including some Liverpool sales.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has given his ‘here we go’ confirmation with Man City set to complete a deal for Lyon attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki."

      "So much to unpick here. We’re fighting the urge to knock out one of those ‘bullsh*t’ coughs, but the salient point is that Sport Central Audience Writer Josh Holland absolutely knows this is nonsense. It’s just a game.",
      "He knows Harry Kane is not leaving Bayern Munich. He knows Manchester United are not signing Harry Kane. He also knows this is not remotely linked with Arsenal, but we suspect he tried and failed to crowbar Liverpool into the headline and eventually settled on the next best thing.",
      "‘Harry Kane’s place in Bayern Munich’s team could be in doubt’ is the first caption. It seems an extreme reaction to Kane’s failure to score in a 10-0 win over some Kiwi amateurs but carry on…",
      "Now 32, Kane has ended his wait for silverware at Bayern with the Bundesliga title. A return to England has been mooted in recent months and while it seems far-fetched to think of Kane walking out at Old Trafford, hear us out.",
      "Hear you out? You genuinely could not drag us away…",
      "According to respected outlet BILD, the German champions hold an interest in RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko. It’s said they view the 22-year-old as Kane’s long-term replacement and they could move for him this summer.",
      "Priced at £75m, Sesko is Arsenal’s number one target after bagging 21 goals in spite of a disappointing season for Leipzig. Surprisingly, the report adds that should Sesko be signed, Bayern would bring Kane back into the number 10 role with his tendency to drop deep complimenting that.",
      "Sesko to the Allianz Arena has work to do with Arsenal claiming to ‘hold the upper hand’ but Bayern’s pull in Germany is telling. If a move did materialise, it’s not yet clear whether Kane would be happy with being moving away from centre-forward.",
      "Step forward, Jason Wilcox.",
      "So if we’re following this correctly, Bayern buying Sesko (that’s the ‘Arsenal hijack’) could directly lead to Kane entirely deciding to f*** off Champions League football and the possibility of more silverware, to join a really sh*t Manchester United. And that’s supposing Bayern would be remotely open to selling a player who has scored an extraordinary 62 goals in 63 Bundesliga games.",
      "The pay-off paragraph is a thing of great wonder…",
      "Whether United would entertain the prospect of signing Kane, or whether the England international would be open to returning to England. However, if Bayern do pull off a deal for Sesko, it would be the perfect green light for United to swoop in and bring in the ready-made goalscorer needed.",
      "The first sentence makes literally no sense. But you simply cannot argue with the second. And that’s that. Deal done. Done deal.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is a player in demand and Tottenham Hotspur’s appointment of Thomas Frank might have affected Manchester United’s hopes of making him their next big summer signing.",
      "United have tried to move quickly since the end of the season. Finishing in the lower reaches of the Premier League is indicative of an alarming decline in the club’s fortunes and a loss in the Europa League final, which shut the back door on an unlikely Champions League salvation, jerked what’s left of the Red Devils’ recruitment operation into gear.",
      "Matheus Cunha was snapped up from Wolverhampton Wanderers more or less immediately but United’s twin pursuits of Viktor Gyokeres and Mbeumo have yet to bear fruit.",
      "Cunha’s £62.5m release clause has become a bargaining chip for Brentford as they seek to ensure they’re not picked apart on the cheap after Frank’s departure to Spurs, and the former Brentford manager’s choice of club threatens to put another obstacle in Man United’s way.",
      "The Cameroon international enjoys a positive relationship with his former boss and Spurs’ Champions League qualification gives them another theoretical advantage over the Red Devils.",
      "“And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we’ve been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it’s been a fantastic season.",
      "“[Thomas Frank] has done so much for me. He literally trusted me from the start. I think he developed the team so well. He developed me as a human and a player as well. So I can only wish him all the best, and I’m sure he’s going to do well.",
      "“I think he knows everything. He’s really smart. He knows where he wants to bring the team, how he wants to play. I think he’s been fantastic for Brentford.”",
      "The 25-year-old scored 20 goals in the Premier League in 2024-25 as Brentford finished in tenth place, outscoring Bruno Fernandes and Amad Diallo – United’s top league scorers last season – combined.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is expected to remain a United player despite scoring only three Premier League goals, but Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly seen as expendable by the United hierarchy.",
      "Hojlund scored four times as his return deteriorated in his second season with United but is still a target for clubs in Italy. Juventus and Inter Milan are reportedly interested in the 22-year-old, who earned his Premier League move thanks to impressive Serie A form for Atalanta in 2022-23.",
      "If United find a buyer for the misfiring Dane, Brentford’s valuation of Mbeumo could be met.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur are ‘growing in confidence’ as they look to sign a Premier League winger also linked with Manchester United.",
      "New Tottenham manager Thomas Frank has reportedly identified one of his old Brentford players as a ‘priority’ target and the club are ‘determined’ to land him.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are willing to ‘abandon’ their move for ‘top target’ Bryan Mbeumo amid interest from Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur have submitted a £70million bid to hijack Manchester United’s move for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports.",
      "Tottenham have ‘received encouragement’ over a possible transfer for Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo after ‘initial discussions with Brentford’.",
      "With Thomas Frank off to Spurs, we have jumped the gun on a possible Brentford exodus and reassigned five Bees stars to rival Premier League clubs…"

      "Regarding Napoli’s ‘preference’, it is suggested that they are leaning towards Grealish, but there is also the acceptance that it would be a ‘better investment’ to sign Garnacho, given the age factor.",
      "The report adds:",
      "Tottenham and Everton have been linked with a move, while a return to Villa could appeal. However, it is unlikely City would receive a £45m offer from a Premier League club — meaning a loan would be his only option to stay in England. Prem sides would also be unlikely to pay Grealish’s £230,000-a-week wages in full.",

      "Selling Hojlund would help speed that process along and would be seen as a positive outcome after the 22-year-old’s two frustrating seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dane has been unable to find his best form consistently in a United shirt but remains a tempting proposition for clubs in Italy, where his nine Serie A goals and all-round forward play for Atalanta persuaded United to commit a reported £64m fee to sign him.",
      "Hojlund is widely believed to be a possible target for Turin giants Juventus but Gazzetta dello Sport now reports that Champions League finalists and Serie A runners-up Inter Milan want him too.",
      "“[Hojlund] he is ahead of everyone in the club’s preferences for the attack of the future: there is finally room for an investment up front,” writes Filippo Conticello.",
      "“[Cristian] Chivu is confident in a quality addition to the department: a striker with international experience, who can stand worthily alongside Lautaro [Martinez] and [Marcus] Thuram and not be considered just the first of the reserves.”",
      "Hojlund has informed Inter that he’s keen on a move, reports Conticello, but the initial agreement might have to be a loan for the striker, with United demanding €45m to prise him away on a permanent basis.",
      "Corriere dello Sport reports that one decision has already been made amid the comings and potential goings at Old Trafford, reporting that the Red Devils “consider [Joshua] Zirkzee’s presence fundamental” and will not be selling him this summer.",
      "The 24-year-old only managed three goals in his first Premier League season but is regarded as a player around whom Ruben Amorim can build a competent attack with Cunha in tow.",
      "But Hojlund, who scored ten league goals in his first season but only four in 2024-25, has evidently been deemed surplus to requirements as the Europa League finalists work to get their fortunes back on track next season.",
      "Hojlund earned his previous move to Serie A with a more prolific spell with Sturm Graz but goals are just one measure of his game.",
      "However, a dwindling return from one season to the next in England, coupled with a number of squandered chances as an inability to match Zirkzee’s knack for finding a way in the biggest moments, has marked out Hojlund as a player United should look to move on with an eye on an improved future.",
      "A return to blue and black stripes, albeit of a slightly different flavour, might do all parties the world of good.",

      "12) Nelson Weiper (Mainz)\nThe club have an option for another year that will surely be triggered for the striker.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret (Napoli)\nWon Serie A as Napoli’s first-choice goalkeeper and so the smart money is on a two-year extension.",
      "",
      "10) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr)\nRonaldo reportedly wants the club to sack their manager, director and presumably half the players; he’s the Saudi Pro League top scorer but he has only one trophy to show for two-and-a-half years in the desert. He claims he is staying in Saudi.",
      "",
      "9) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026. The problem? He is perma-injured.",
      "",
      "8) Mario Pasalic (Atalanta)\nSpent six years at Chelsea without playing a single game but has played almost 300 matches for Atalanta. Neither club nor player is likely to call an end to that in the summer; an extension is very likely.",

      "7) Kenny Tete (Fulham)\nAfter a one-year extension was triggered last summer, there is talk of the can being kicked even further down the road.",

      "",
      "4) Kyle Walker-Peters (Southampton)\nHe has more than served his dues and a whole host of mid-table Premier League sides should be interested after he exits the club following a second relegation.",
      "",
      "3) Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\nInitially reluctant to commit himself to the unstable Toffees and will likely have his pick of mid-table Premier League clubs on a free transfer. Tottenham are said to be very predictably interested as well as Manchester United.",
      "",
      "2) Olivier Boscagli (PSV)\nThe ball-playing centre-half looks bound for Brighton despite some interest from Inter.",
      "",
      "1) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool? Tottenham Hotspur, Juventus, Napoli, Newcastle United and Aston Villa have all been linked and it seems that Napoli may emerge top of the pile.",

      "Transfer insider Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Alejandro Garnacho leaving Manchester United to reunite with a former boss will be “complicated.”",

      "Following that, on the Red Devils’ post-season tour of Southeast Asia, Ruben Amorim reportedly told him: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "It has since been reported that the United boss has weakened the club’s negotiating position, as sides are aware he wants rid of Garnacho, so won’t pay the asking price, aware the Manchester outfit will probably accept less than they’d initially hoped for.",

      "According to transfer insider Romano, that move to reunite the pair will not be an easy one to be pulled off.",
      "He said on X that Garnacho’s ‘priority is to remain in the Premier League,’ while he’s expected to leave United. Despite Leverkusen’s ‘interest and and Ten Hag’s appreciation, the deal looks complicated’.",
      "It has previously been suggested that Chelsea is the United man’s preferred destination. Indeed, he has reportedly told his agent to make it clear that he’d like to land at Stamford Bridge this summer.",
      "But Romano has reported there’s not a massively high chance that move goes through. He recently stated there is a ’35 per cent chance’ that Garnacho does move to the Blues.",
      "In the same report, he suggested the United man ‘could stay in the Premier League’.",
      "Indeed, that is his preference, but if no clubs in England make an offer, but sides elsewhere offer United what they want, it seems they will waste no time in getting Garnacho off the books.",
      "Whether that is Leverkusen remains to be seen, as the likes of Napoli, AC Milan and Atletico Madrid have all been linked with the Argentine, too.",

      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",

      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",

      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",

      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
