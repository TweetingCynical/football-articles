      "Manchester United have recognised Tyler Fredricson and Chido Obi as first-team squad members as they begin to get increasing minutes under Ruben Amorim. Backing young players has been part of the club's DNA and that has continued.",
      "Fredricson and Obi, who have seen opportunities come their way recently, are now visible on the club's official website under the first-team player profiles. 20-year-old Fredricson made his debut in the 1-0 defeat to Wolves last month.",
      "Obi moved to Manchester from Arsenal having been recognised as one of the best players worldwide in his age group and the 17-year-old made his full debut in the 4-3 loss at Brentford earlier this month.",
      "Both men were named on the bench on Sunday as United were beaten 2-0 at home by West Ham, but ultimately didn't get any minutes. Fredricson could yet feature in the Europa League final having been added to United's B list whilst the squad deal with injuries to four of their centre-half options.",
      "Obi though is ineligible to figure in the final against Tottenham next week after United did not register the Denmark U21 international for their revised squad in February.",
      "Amorim has previously been hugely complimentary of Fredricson and said last month: \"He's really composed, he's really humble, every training he has with the first-team, he is really focused on every detail of training. He's really good on the ball, and it's a good opportunity for him.\"",
      "Obi meanwhile has been looking to take advantage of the issues United have in the final third. Several of the main forwards are struggling for form and the teenager has been given opportunities off the bench, but the Red Devils boss has urged him to keep his feet on the ground.",
      "\"He’s just told me to be humble and keep working hard every day,” Obi said on Amorim's advice. “And hopefully, I get more opportunities soon. My Dad and my Mum always told me to be a good person and listen to my coaches because they want me to get better, so it’s good.\"",
      "He added: \"I’ve learnt to be smart and to think quicker by training with the first team because the game is quicker compared to Academy football. It helps me a lot, training with them every day.”"

      "UEFA have confirmed that Felix Zwayer will referee the Europa League final between Tottenham and Manchester United. The two English clubs will clash at the San Memes in Bilbao on Wednesday, May 21, and the German has been selected to be the man in the middle.",
      "Zwayer, 43, recently took charge of Arsenal's Champions League semi-final second leg away to Paris Saint-Germain. Fans may also remember him from refereeing the Euro 2024 semi-final between England and the Netherlands last July.",
      "Despite his vast experience and pedigree, the Bundesliga official is renowned for being involved in a match-fixing scandal. In 2005, he accepted a £250 bribe from fellow referee Robert Hoyzer. Zwayer was slapped with a six-month ban while Hoyzer received a two-year five-month prison sentence and was given a lifetime ban from any role in football.",
      "The Berlin-born ref's chequered past hasn't stopped him from becoming one of the most highly regarded officials in European football, though. Zwayer has taken charge of over 685 top-level matches, one of those being a controversial Bundesliga clash between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in 2021.",
      "After Zwayer awarded a penalty to Bayern following a handball by Mats Hummels, then-Dortmund star Jude Bellingham brought up Zwayer's past. \"You give a referee, that has match fixed before, the biggest game in Germany. What do you expect?\" Bellingham said to Viaplay in an explosive post-match interview.",
      "\"You can look at a lot of the decisions in the game. For me, it wasn't [a penalty]. He (Hummels) is not even looking at the ball and he's fighting to get it and it hits him.\"",
      "Bellingham was fined £34,000 for his comments by the German FA and Zwayer demanded a personal apology. \"I would prefer to clarify this in a personal conversation with Jude Bellingham and have offered such a personal conversation to Borussia Dortmund,\" he told Bild.",
      "Who'll win the Europa League final - Tottenham or Man Utd? Give us your score predictions in the comments section.",
      "\"For me, it's not about punishment, but about the realisation that he went too far. I would accept a sincere apology. The statement deliberately creates the false impression that I did not referee the match to the best of my ability.",
      "\"It is personal, disparaging and disrespectful. Even if you put yourself in the subjective perspective, which is marked by emotion, his statement is far from professional or factual.\""

      "Danny Murphy has criticised Ruben Amorim for his consistent negative attitude towards Manchester United. The ex-Liverpool midfielder believes the current United boss should be thinking with a \"bit more positivity\" and looking ahead to their Europa League final, instead of dwelling on poor results.",
      "Results matches haven't exactly been the best way to exude forward-thinking at Old Trafford, with United's last Premier League win coming way back in March, with a 3-0 victory over now-relegated Leicester City.",
      "Europe aside, the Red Devils are in dreadful form in recent history, just two places above the relegation zone and with the club about to land their lowest ever Premier League finish.",
      "However, Murphy believes that Amorim could have a better attitude when talking about his team, especially considering their exploits outside of the league.",
      "Speaking on Match of the Day, the ex-England international said: \"I'm not a big fan of a manager continually and consistently talking negatively about how bad things are and how bad it is, how we're the worst team, worst United team in the Premier League etc.",
      "\"I'd like to hear a bit more solution-based answers and a bit more positivity and moving forward and thinking forward.\"",
      "These comments from Murphy come after Amorim admitted he may have to step aside at Old Trafford if form doesn't improve by next season. Post-match, the 40-year-old said: \"Everybody here has to think seriously about a lot of things",
      "\"Everybody is thinking about the [Europa League] final. The final is not the issue. We have bigger things to think about. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team. We need to change that.",
      "\"It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this. If we start like this, if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different people.\"",
      "Co-host Mark Chapman then directed the attention to United's latest statistics, as he said: \"When you look at that, it's a bit difficult to be positive isn't it?\"",
      "Prior to Erik ten Hag's dismissal from Old Trafford, he had only suffered two home defeats all season. These were 3-0 losses to current champions Liverpool and fellow Europa League finalists Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Meanwhile, under Amorim, United have faced home defeats against Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle United, Brighton and Hove Albion, Crystal Palace, Wolves and most recently, West Ham United.",
      "Despite this, Murphy was adamant that the Portuguese boss has not faced a lot of criticism during his time, and believes his attitude must change soon.",
      "He said: \"Well, I'm not talking unrealistically, but well, just, you know, they have got a final to look forward to. They could be Champions League [next season], he's got a, hopefully, got a summer of a lot of activity in the window to bring in some of his own players and start moulding his own team if you like.",
      "\"They've only had one signing since he's been there, so he's not faced a lot of criticism, I don't think, considering how bad they've been.",
      "\"So yeah, I've always felt that the leader of the clubs I was at and the managers there, if they're putting on a nice, positive front and trying to be forthright and looking forward, then it'll help the players, rather than constant negativity.\"",
      "Next up for Amorim's team is a visit to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea in the penultimate game of the Premier League season, before an all-important clash with Spurs in a European final."

That one of those two sides will be in the Champions League next season is at odds with a competition supposedly showcasing the best sides in Europe, with Amorim unsure if playing in it would benefit United.",

His comments will certainly have not gone down well with the club's hierarchy, in particular co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",

      "The problem for Amorim and his players is that there is no hiding place at arguably the world's biggest club, where the focus and scrutiny is unparalleled, whether the team is racking up trophies or grubbing around near the bottom of the Premier League.",
      "Amorim's request to see out the rest of this season at Sporting Lisbon, before taking over at United, has been vindicated by the disastrous way the campaign has gone. Amorim felt it was best to start afresh at United this summer, with a full pre-season behind him.",

The fallen giants have truly hit rock bottom and it is hard to see a way back to the glory days of the past any time soon. Just ask Amorim."

      "Ruben Amorim's side recorded a second straight triumph over Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night to book a date with Tottenham in the Europa League final later this month. They were unable to follow that up on Sunday, though, instead falling to a 17th league defeat of the season.",
      "With United already consigned to a record low Premier League finish, the Europa League represents a shot of salvaging a sorry season. As such, Amorim made six changes to the team that beat Bilbao at Old Trafford in midweek.",
      "However, Fernandes was having none of it when he was asked if said changes to the team and balancing the workload at the end of the season had made things more difficult.",
      "He told MUTV: “No, it can’t make (a) difference because everyone has been training very hard, very well, so everyone is prepared to play at any moment. So, I don’t think that’s the point because I think all the team is prepared for that.",
      "“Every chance and every opportunity is a chance to get into the next 11 and the next 11, and the next 11, so you have to get your chance, you have to get your opportunity.",

      "The former Sporting Lisbon chief added: “I feel how a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed. It’s hard to accept. We need to be more aggressive, and we need to feel that it is the end of the world when we are not winning a game. Especially when we are not winning.",
      "“So it's a big problem that we have here at the club. It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to address that. It's a big problem because it's mentally. We are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United. We don't have that fear anymore and that is the most dangerous thing that a big club can have.”"

      "Former Manchester United starlet Daniel Nardiello was one of the first casualties of the Glazer family's takeover, being released by the club before earning just £90-a-week at Blackpool.",
      "This Monday marks 20 years since Malcolm Glazer launched his formal bid to take over the Red Devils. He acquired John Magnier and J.P. McManus' 28.7 per cent stake, boosting his own share to around 57 per cent. By the end of that month, he had a whopping 76 per cent ownership of the club.",
      "And by June, the American tycoon had secured 98 per cent of shares and control of United, causing outrage among fans for having funded his purchase with loans secured against the club's assets.",
      "Since then, the Glazers have been at the helm and faced repeated backlash for the decaying of the club's infrastructure as well as the team's decline on the pitch. In February 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was given complete control of football operations by the family after buying a minority stake in the club.",
      "One of the first moves made by the Glazers in June 2005 was to let go of a group of players. The released players included Coventry-born forward Nardiello, Northern Irish goalkeeper Roy Carroll, Spanish shot-stopper Ricardo, Republic of Ireland defender Paul Tierney and Gambian striker Arthur Gomez.",
      "Nardiello, who came through the academy ranks at Wolves, joined United in 1999 and quickly rose through the Under-17 and Under-19 teams to make his debut in 2000/2001 in the League Cup against Arsenal.",
      "The following season saw him mainly playing in the reserves, where he netted 12 goals before being loaned out to Swansea City for a month in October 2003.",
      "The Welsh international spent the latter half of the 2003/04 season on loan at Barnsley, scoring seven goals in 16 matches. He returned to Oakwell for the 2004/05 season on loan, adding another seven goals to his tally in 30 games.",
      "Deemed surplus to requirements by Sir Alex Ferguson and the new club hierarchy, he was released on June 30, 2005, ahead of the 2005/06 season, without playing a minute of Premier League football and having made just four appearances in all competitions.",
      "After his release, Nardiello signed a two-year contract with Barnsley in July 2005, scoring two crucial goals in their League One play-off matches that season. After two years, he rejected a new contract offer to sign for Championship rivals Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer, before rejoining Barnsley on loan in January 2008.",
      "He returned to QPR at the end of the 2007/08 season, after which he inked a two-year deal with another Championship side, Blackpool. His full debut for the Seasiders only came in January 2009 following an injury-plagued stint at the club.",
      "And it was there that he agreed to a contract clause, which meant he, along with the other Blackpool players, was only paid £90-a-week during the summer break. When asked about his bizarre wages on the Undr The Cosh podcast, Nardiello explained: \"I went to Blackpool, I was on decent wages but every summer for six weeks I was being paid £90 a week.",
      "\"It was just really weird. There were lads there playing in the Championship on £600-a-week and they had to save their pennies for the summer. It was like what the hell is going on. It was such a poorly run club.\"",
      "When quizzed on what the benefit of that was for the club, the 42-year-old replied: \"They just saved on everything that club. It wasn't a Championship-run club.",
      "\"You had to take your kit home every day and wash your kits, there was no heating in the training ground and the food they served was like slop, when players were turning up in Porsches and lovely cars on Championship wages.\"",
      "He continued: \"It was such a strange club to be a part of,\" before being asked if he knew about the bizarre rule before signing. Nardiello replied: \"I knew about the £90 quid before I signed because they told me.",
      "\"I think everyone did [struggle with it]. Because you go from whatever you're used to getting on a monthly basis and then one month you're getting next to nothing and you've still got your mortgage to pay and your bills to pay.\"",
      "During his two-year spell at Blackpool, he was loaned out to Hartlepool United, Bury and Oldham before making a permanent move to Exeter City in 2010. Nardiello only played nine games for Blackpool, scoring one goal.",
      "He later had stints at Rotherham United, Bury, Plymouth Argyle and Bangor City before retiring in October 2017, after being let go by the Welsh Premier League team."

      "Ruben Amorim cast doubt over his position following Manchester United's latest Premier League defeat. The Red Devils boss has failed to turn around the club's fortunes domestically with the club sitting 16th in the division.",
      "Only Europa League finalists Tottenham separate United from the bottom three clubs in the table, as Amorim was once again left to reflect on his difficulties as his team recorded their most extensive winless streak in the division. And following the goalless draw, it was the Portuguese coach who looked to shoulder the responsibility.",
      "He said: \"It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons\".",
      "Despite that, it would appear United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a degree of sympathy for Amorim's position. It does not seem like it is his Europa League exploits keeping him in a job alone.",
      "Ratcliffe spoke earlier this season about the circumstances Amorim has had to work in, and with the side's form no better then, suggested the head coach was doing a good job.",
      "\"I think he’s done a great job in the circumstances, frankly, with the squad that he’s had available, the fact he came in mid-season,\" he explained in March.",
      "\"Everybody expects miracles overnight. It’s not the way, not real life in my view. I mean, you saw the performance yesterday (against Arsenal ).",
      "\"It was, I thought, a really impressive performance. They could not have worked harder. They couldn’t have been more committed.",
      "\"And if you looked at the names on the bench, there weren’t many you recognised, were there? Half the squad’s missing for Ruben.",
      "\"If you look at the top eight players in terms of salaries in Manchester United, 50 percent of those are not available to Ruben. You’ve got Mason Mount, you’ve got Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford has gone, and Jadon Sancho (on loan at Chelsea ).",
      "\"And he’s got a bunch of other injuries as you know, so I think he’s done a fantastic job.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim is not content and knows he must improve his side's Premier League outings. The 40-year-old expressed his discontent on Sunday.",
      "Amorim added: \"I feel how a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed. It’s hard to accept. We need to be more aggressive, and we need to feel that it is the end of the world when we are not winning a game. Especially when we are not winning.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson was asked to resign amid Manchester United's takeover by the Glazer family in 2005. Not by the club's owners but by United supporters hoping to take control of the club themselves.",
      "Almost 20 years ago, on May 12, Red Football - the Glazers' holding company - confirmed it had reached an agreement with Manchester United shareholders JP McManus and John Magnier to purchase a 28.7 per cent stake in the club. That would ultimately see United's board write to the remaining shareholders to reveal their intention to sell and advise the recipients to do the same.",
      "Before that tipping point there remained hope in some corners that the infamous takeover could be prevented. To prevent a historic, debt-free club being saddled with £580million of debt in a leveraged takeover.",
      "Andy Walsh was part of the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA), and among a group of fans working on a rival bid for the club via Shareholders United and the Japanese bank Nomura. Wash had developed a relationship with Ferguson and made a late plea in his desire to stop the Glazers.",
      "\"My call to Alex Ferguson was to ask him to consider resigning,” Walsh told The Athletic. \"He genuinely believed the supporters should be heard in the takeover.\"",
      "“Our last throw of the dice,\" Walsh added. \"It was a highly leveraged takeover and major corporate financiers were already shying away based on what was being proposed.",
      "“We felt any loss of support from senior management executives — Ferguson and Gill — would have dealt a fatal blow.”",
      "Walsh's plan would have hoped Ferguson's resignation would see the deal collapse. Ferguson would then return to his position off the back of the fan-led offering, but it was not a risk the Scotsman was willing to take.",
      "“If the deal collapsed, Ferguson would then be carried back into the stadium on the shoulders of supporters,\" he said.",
      "\"Ferguson politely declined, believing he had a responsibility not just to himself and his family, but also all the people he had brought to Old Trafford and were working under him. We were asking him to take a huge risk. There was no legal undertaking we could give him. Just a word.",
      "\"We believed the club would then be controlled by fans rather than people draining it for personal profit. That was the point I made to Alex Ferguson in that call. But I fully respect and understand his decision.”"

      "Arsenal have pushed both Liverpool and Manchester City over recent seasons, while they reached the Champions League semi-finals this term. But former Manchester United goalkeeper Schmeichel reckons Arteta’s methods could actually be doing more damage than good.",
      "Speaking on ViaPlay, he said: “It’s all on Arteta, all. What I’m saying is, he was employed as head coach. He inherited the team and that team is the only team that he has won a trophy with.",
      "“Then it’s his own team and then in the process, he’s now changed the job description so he’s now the manager. Everything is on him. It’s not recruitment, it’s not the board.",
      "“Whenever they [fans] get the opportunity today, watch him in the technical area. Arteta is a control freak, he wants his players to play the ball that he wants. He’s directing everything.",

Arteta is still playing the game for the players and that would confuse the hell out of me as a football player that you had a coach that wants to direct me for everything I do. It would confuse me and make me a worse player.”",

      "\"I think deep down he thinks they could have won the league without this and that. There's no doubt they would be a lot closer but the sendings-off are down to you. They weren't all sendings-off, but that can happen in a season.",
      "\"The injuries have hit them this season but they also played for them last season. What they have done in terms of competing Man City in the last two seasons is fantastic but a lot of that was down to having the same eight or nine players week in, week out, and him never rotating.\""

      "Mason Greenwood could secure the Premier League return he craves in the next 12 months with two top-flight clubs now supposedly ready to pursue a deal for the former Manchester United forward.",
      "Greenwood, 23, moved to France last summer in a deal worth £26million after being informed he had no future at Old Trafford. He has delivered in a Marseille shirt, too, accumulating 20 goals and five assists across 35 games for Roberto De Zerbi's side.",
      "Despite Greenwood's fine maiden campaign in Ligue 1, it was recently claimed that he is 'yearning' for a return to England - and it now seems as though he could be offered the chance to move back across the channel sooner rather than later.",
      "As revealed by The Telegraph, there are two Premier League clubs who are now 'weighing up' the possibility of offering Greenwood a route back to England, with figures close to Marseille accepting a transfer within the next two windows is 'possible'.",
      "However, there is said to be a difference of opinion among those close to Greenwood over whether or not he is ready to return to the Premier League.",
      "The Sun previously claimed that playing abroad has helped Greenwood and his partner, Harriet Robson, 'rebuild their lives' after charges of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour against the striker were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "The 'novelty' of playing overseas has worn off, though, with Greenwood keen on a return to his native north-west. Manchester United would stand to profit should their former academy star making another move due to a sell-on clause which was inserted in the deal that took him to France last year.",
      "While Greenwood has been amongst the goals for Marseille, who are currently second in the Ligue 1 table, he has also encountered setbacks. His work ethic has been questioned by both De Zerbi and supporters, with the club's Ultras unfurling a banner urging Greenwood to \"get a move on\".",
      "De Zerbi did take the time to laud the forward's ability last month, saying: \"Greenwood is a natural talent. All the credit goes to his mother and father. And I'm here to help him become more complete. When he needs a hug, a word of support, I gladly give it. And when I need to push him to give more, I have to do that too because that's my job.",
      "\"I would especially like to help him be remembered, in this stadium and by these supporters, as one of the greatest players to have played here at the Velodrome. There have been so many great players here, but I think Greenwood has the qualities to be remembered that way. And I'm trying to help him progress."

      "Financially it would be huge, but Sunday's loss to West Ham at Old Trafford highlighted the major issues that still exist. They've now lost five of their last seven league games - drawing the other two - with their domestic form in stark contrast to their European exploits.",
      "Amorim watched his team hammer Athletic Bilbao in midweek, winning 4-1 at home to complete a 7-1 aggregate triumph. But the Portuguese manager has accused some of having their eyes on the Europa League final, whilst ignoring the apparent issues and claiming they shouldn't be operating in the Champions League.",

      "\"We need to change a lot of things. If we don't change the way we play and perform and feel this urgency of winning every game, we should not play in the Champions League. We should just stay in the Premier League and learn how to be competitive one week at a time. The biggest focus on our football club is to change a lot of things. It's not just the final.\"",
      "United were dealt a major scare when Leny Yoro was forced off in the second-half. The French defender has become an integral figure in his debut season and Amorim was evidently concerned, but has since claimed the issue looks minor. \"We hope it's nothing serious. We will assess the player but I think it is a small thing,\" said the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss.",

      "Manchester United matchgoers unfurled a foreboding banner bearing the faces of Robson, Cantona and Keane that read ‘Standards’ a few seasons ago. They may start to reassess their own.",
      "One of United’s worst ever teams is still applauded. They routinely embark on half-laps of honour in defeat, certain they will not be barracked. It is a far cry from three years ago and chants of ‘You’re not fit to wear the shirt’ and ‘F**k off Pogba’ during an actual win against Norwich City. The away-dayers re-aired the former at Brighton and Brentford that year.",
      "Wolves and West Ham United have done the double over United in successive months at Old Trafford and there was barely a murmur of discontent in the stands. Apathy is rife.",
      "One is not advocating booing or abuse. A new benchmark was set at Selhurst Park last season. That 4-0 drubbing was the seasonal nadir yet the support from the away end at full-time was remarkably, well, supportive. A friend in the Arthur Wait Stand described it as “poignant”.",
      "United supporters will not turn as long as there is glory on the horizon. That Europa League trophy they can see is not a mirage.",
      "Woe betide the players if they return from Bilbao without some extra hand luggage. The only thing more humiliating than finishing 17th and losing a final to Tottenham is relegation.",
      "The atmosphere on the final day against Aston Villa at Old Trafford will either be optimistic or antagonistic. There was more chanting against the Glazers and those now-permanent banners in front of the directors’ box were brandished again on Sunday.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has not been at the stadium since those choreographed protests against his callous treatment of loyal paying supporters began against Wolves on Easter Sunday. A startled security official strode to the front of the directors’ box during the impromptu protest in the first half against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Antipathy towards the owners and the hierarchy is simmering and confirmation of a worst domestic season in 51 years might halt the happy-clappy reactions. United have lost nine times at Old Trafford - as many as when the team was relegated in 1930-31. A tenth against Villa would be unprecedented in a single season.",
      "The supporters' silence spoke volumes on Sunday. There were no boos at half-time or full-time. That is commendable loyalty on a weekend that thousands of histrionic Scousers booed Trent Alexander-Arnold for having the temerity to walk alone.",
      "“It is hard to say something about our fans and everybody,” Ruben Amorim admitted. “There is no explanation, no matter the context. And I‘m talking here, I’m the biggest responsible for that. We need to change a lot of things during the summer.”",
      "Amorim has never been angrier at a post-match press conference. He could be seen gnawing at his knuckles seven minutes after West Ham went 1-0 up.",
      "Those of us present in the press room sensed he would cut loose. It was after a non-televised Sunday afternoon home defeat to Brighton in January that Amorim billed his United as “maybe the worst team in the history of the club”.",
      "The recent four-goal defeats to Newcastle United and Brentford could be dismissed; league fixtures sandwiched between European ties. West Ham was not.",
      "West Ham had not won a match since February 28. They were, at kick-off, the worst team in the top flight bar the three sinking ships plunging into the Championship. Their once placid manager had been so tempestuous in recent press conferences he appeared to be bordering on the brink.",
      "And still Graham Potter was able to motivate West Ham to win at Old Trafford. Amorim was incapable of motivating United’s players to win a first Premier League fixture in seven.",
      "He effectively acknowledged some players pick and choose when to perform. “It’s hard to explain that and that feeling,” he admitted.",
      "“For me, the biggest concern is that feeling it’s okay, we cannot change our position so much so it’s okay. That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it’s the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.”",
      "A colleague singled out Manuel Ugarte. Amorim was reluctant to throw players under the bus. If he was of that persuasion, he would still be in the press room.",
      "Ugarte can cope in the Europa League but barely copes in the Premier League. Rasmus Hojlund curates captions on Instagram more carefully than he strikes the ball. Luke Shaw cannot complete 90 minutes. Kobbie Mainoo does not know whether he is coming or going. Altay Bayindir wears the number one but is the third-best goalie.",
      "The majority of United’s league losses have been greeted with a shrug of the shoulders. Confirmation of a first bottom-half finish in 35 years against Brentford was not back-page news. Amorim ensured he was the splash on Monday’s editions.",
      "'I'LL HAVE TO GO', warns The Sun. The Mirror went with 'AMBARRASSED'. It was 'SHAMEFUL' on the Express. The Times opted for, 'Amorim: I'll quit if we don't fix this'. He won't quit. He will be sacked.",
      "United’s team against West Ham was stronger than expected. Harry Amass was the sole raw pick. Some starters were signed for £58million, £50m, £60m, £67m, £37m and £72m. United fired blanks for a 14th game this season.",
      "Records continue to tumble with any home United reverse: West Ham won their first league game at Old Trafford since May 2007. Six clubs have done the domestic double over United this season. They have not lost this many league games since they were last relegated.",
      "That is how bad this team is and the players still put their hands together and confidently approached the north-east quadrant at full-time. Old Trafford was half-empty at best and actions speak louder than words.",
      "Amorim pondered whether not winning the Europa League would be a blessing in disguise. United's FA Cup final victory proved to be detrimental in the long run as impressionable and fickle fans forced the decision-makers into a ridiculous U-turn on Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim suggested at his first Carrington press conference back in November that it would be fair to judge him after two years. Make that one year. United’s league position is borderline unforgivable. If they are in an identical position this time next year then there will be a different manager in the dugout.",
      "This has been the worst of the Premier League seasons since its inception in 1992, devoid of a title race and jeopardy at the foot of the table. United have won ten out of 36 games and half of them were against the relegated trio. Fulham (twice), Brentford, Everton and Manchester City ought to feel rueful.",
      "Lose in Bilbao and United should not expect to encounter the open arms of forgiving fans in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong on their post-season tour, either. Harry Maguire was booed in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin during pre-season. Ashley Young copped similar flak in Singapore in 2019.",
      "The memory of United fans serenading Anthony Martial after the final home game of last season was a minor but watershed moment. Martial had put his feet up for five months, failed to support Hojlund and ran down his contract yet got a hero's send-off.",
      "Conveniently, Martial returned to team training for the FA Cup final. Ten Hag coldly omitted him from the squad and Martial could not even be bothered to travel to Wembley.",

      "Now or never was the message when Manchester United came knocking on Ruben Amorim's door last October.",
      "After making the decision to sack Erik ten Hag less than 24 hours after a 2-1 defeat to West Ham United at the London Stadium, United earmarked Amorim as their top target to replace the Dutchman at Old Trafford.",
      "United moved swiftly to get a deal in place, paying €10million (£8.3m) to trigger his Sporting Lisbon release clause.",
      "Amorim had put Sporting back on the map, winning two Primeira Liga titles in three seasons after the club previously gone 19 years without being top dog in Portugal. Sporting's style of play was also attractive to United, with club bosses hopeful he would be able to revolutionise the Reds' fortunes with a new-look style.",
      "However, Amorim was hesitant about making the move there and then, informing United that he wanted to wait until the summer to become United's next permanent head coach. He had already informed Sporting of his plan to leave the club at the end of the season.",
      "United, though, were not willing to take no for an answer and Amorim had to make a life-changing decision there and then.",
      "\"The season started, we started very well, and then Manchester United came, they pay above the compensation clause and the president defends the club's interests,\" Amorim explained back in November.",
      "\"I never discussed anything with the president. For three days I said I wanted to stay until the end of the season, but then I was told it was not possible.",
      "\"It was now or never, or Manchester would go for another option. So, I had three days to make my mind up, to make a decision that changes radically my life.\"",
      "On reflection, it is easy to understand why Amorim wanted to take charge at United ahead of the start of a new season, getting the opportunity to oversee a full pre-season and start afresh. Instead, he has overseen 14 defeats in his first 39 games in charge.",
      "He said in February: \"When you start a season it's completely different [how] you feel things, have pre-season and time to change things you feel are necessary in a team and a squad, that is clear.",
      "\"That was the choice so I don't want to talk about that. I had my reasons to ask for it and I have the most important reasons to accept the job. I knew it would be tough and a risk but it's Manchester United and you can't say no.\"",
      "Of course, the fact Amorim has led United to the Europa League final cannot be ignored, and nor should it. He deserves credit for leading the club to their first European final since 2021.",
      "However, if they are on the losing side against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao next week, it will count for nothing. Their Premier League campaign has been nothing short of embarrassing, with the defeat to West Ham leaving them 16th in the table with two games to go.",
      "Defeats to Chelsea and Aston Villa either side of the final would see United end their Premier League campaign having lost half of their 38 matches. For a club of United's size, there is no escaping that.",
      "Amorim inherited an expensively-assembled squad in November, still fresh from five new additions being added to it last summer, but its profile, as the last few months have highlighted countless times, is not wedded to Amorim's philosophy.",
      "Only come the summer transfer window will Amorim get the chance to make just some of the necessary changes. It will be impossible for every change that needs to happen to take place in one window.",
      "It is unfair to judge Amorim until he has had a meaningful opportunity to build his own squad, with only Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven being signed since he was appointed, but he is not a position where he is immune from criticism.",
      "He has won just 24 points from 25 Premier League games in charge, with ten of them being amassed against the three relegated clubs, highlighting just how poor United's league form has been in recent months.",
      "It was clear from his initial hesitation about taking the job mid-season that he was conscious the timing wasn't right for him to come in and make an immediate impact, referencing the importance of pre-season. He will get the opportunity."

      "The suggestion from Ornstein is that United could swoop in if Arsenal's interest cools. However, with a price tag likely to be upwards of £60m, Ineos may need Amorim to deliver the Europa League to allow a move for the striker.",

      "It is expected that Delap would be available for £30m thanks to a relegation clause in his contract. Wolverhampton Wanderers' utility man Matheus Cunha is also thought to be considered a top target by the United recruitment team."

      "All charges were later dropped and the winger would join Getafe on loan on deadline day in the summer of 2023. His permanent move to Marseille in 2024 saw United include a significant sell-on clause in the deal."

      "After knocking out Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Bilbao, United will go head-to-head with Spurs for a chance for silverware. The winners of the clash will automatically qualify for the Champions League, but for United, that may not be the case.",
      "According to old UEFA rules, two clubs under the same control were prevented from competing even in different European competitions. As Sir Jim Ratcliffe holds a stake in both Man United and Ligue 1 outfit Nice, it would have been impossible for the two clubs to both be playing European football.",
      "Ratcliffe's Nice are in a great position to qualify for the Champions League with them sitting fourth in Ligue 1. The club were facing a similar situation this time last year, with UEFA eventually allowing both clubs to participate under certain provisions.",
      "Fortunately, those rules were changed last year to accommodate the number of clubs under the same ownership. Each situation is looked at on a case-by-case basis, like Manchester City and Girona this season.",
      "Reports have stated that Ratcliffe is exploring a sale of Nice meaning if everything goes well - United win the Europa League and Nice qualify for the Champions League - there should be no issues. If Ratcliffe keeps his stake in both clubs, there is still a way for both to compete, as revealed by a UEFA statement.",

      "As such, all that is really needed will be proof that the two clubs are not run simultaneously and Ratcliffe's desire to sell his Nice stake could certainly help their case if the worst transpired.",

      "\"We have spoken to UEFA and I have to say the conversation wasn’t directed at, 'you have to solve this problem and you know we don’t like it'. We have an issue and we might have to change some things. But what they do recognise is that the multi-club model in many circumstances benefits the smaller club quite a lot.",

So that’s a good thing. But what they’re worried about is if there’s ever an accusation that somebody influences the result of a game - lack of integrity. That’s the most concerning thing.",

Also, the UEFA thing is changing so you have to do it in the light of where you think UEFA is going to finish up, what the handicaps are. There are obviously handicaps involved.\"",
      "A statement released by UEFA on July 5, 2024, explains: \"The First Chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body (CFCB First Chamber) had previously opened proceedings involving: Girona FC (ESP) and Manchester City FC (ENG); and Manchester United FC (ENG) and OGC Nice (FRA) due to a potential conflict with the multi-club ownership rule provided for in Article 5 of the UEFA club competitions regulations.",

The clubs were able to demonstrate that such changes brought them into compliance with the multi-club ownership rule, considering that:",
      "\"More specifically, the significant changes made to the ownership, governance, and financial support of the concerned clubs, substantially restrict the investors’ influence and decision-making power over more than one club, ensuring compliance with the multi-club ownership rule during the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"In particular, the concerned investors have transferred their shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice to independent trustees through a blind trust structure established under the supervision of the CFCB First Chamber. Such blind trust was accepted by the CFCB First Chamber on an exceptional basis for the 2024/25 UEFA competitions. The trustees will regularly exchange information with the CFCB First Chamber during the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"As a result, the following applies at the level of Girona FC and OGC Nice for the 2024/25 season:",

      "\"From 1 July 2025, the shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice will be transferred back to their respective investor. As a result, in the absence of any major modifications to the clubs’ shareholding, governance or financing, the above-mentioned clubs shall be considered, as from that date, under the control or decisive influence of their investor.",

With their seven-game winless run in the Premier League marking their longest since 1992, Fernandes has outlined four key improvements United must make.",

      "United and Tottenham currently occupy the two places above the relegation zone, and Postecoglou was asked whether it was heartening to see United going through similar struggles ahead of the final.",
      "\"Nah, I said before, I couldn’t care less about Man U,\" he said. \"They have their own journey. It is about us and what we’re trying to create here. It is too easy to accept a performance [against Crystal Palace] that is not up to the level because of other factors.",
      "\"I think irrespective of other factors, you should still be able to perform at a certain level and we didn’t reach that level today. That’s disappointing.\"",
      "Postecoglou touched on Spurs' season, adding \"People are banging the drum about this record with defeats, but if people don’t see there is a correlation between the two, I am not going to sit here and, it’s not exactly Pythagoras' theorem. It’s quite simple to understand we would have had much better results if we didn’t have to navigate this. So, either you understand or you don’t and beat us over the head, I get it.",
      "\"I am not happy with the way we performed today, so that’s what I look at. I think we could have performed better and irrespective of the result you can still lose a game of football and our performance level wasn't anywhere near where it should be. That's my responsibility to address.\"",
      "Postecoglou insisted he didn't know his starting team for the final in Bilbao. \"We lost Lucas [Bergvall] the day before a game. You've got to be ready for your opportunity,\" he explained. \"They may think that this team's already set, but if there's nothing else we've learnt this year it's that nothing goes to plan.",
      "\"So I'm not thinking about the starting line-up now for the final because we've still got another game and 10 days to navigate, so if there is that attitude in there then it's the wrong attitude because you're missing an opportunity. Like I said when Lucas went down, we had to throw Biss (Yves Bissouma) in there, so you have to be ready.\"",
      "Amorim was also downbeat when he spoke in his post-match press conference on Sunday, saying he was \"embarrassed\" and that United must \"change a lot of things during the summer\"."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo once stunned Owen Hargreaves as he claimed he was \"going to win the Ballon d'Or this year\" – a moment which kickstarted the Portuguese star's dominance in football.",
      "Hargreaves spent two years at Manchester United with Ronaldo, winning the Premier League and Champions League titles in his first season with the club. After joining in 2007, the English midfielder spent some time in the gym in pre-season preparing himself for what would be an incredible season at United, which is where he got closer to a young Ronaldo.",
      "During an appearance on the High Performance podcast alongside Jake Humphrey and Damian Hughes, Hargreaves spoke about his first impressions of the Portuguese superstar, and what Ronaldo – who was just 22 at the time – said that left him in awe.",
      "Hargreaves, 44, said: \"I remember Cristiano about where you are on the mat [points at Jake Humphrey], and he wasn't Cristiano, that Cristiano yet. And he was doing these crazy sit-ups with this medicine ball, coming up and then throwing it, and I was watching him and then he said, 'I'm going to win the Ballon d'Or this year.'",
      "\"And he did at the end of the season – but this was pre-season in the gym, nobody could see [it].\"",
      "Hargreaves was taken aback by the young winger, as Ronaldo's serious period of dominance in football hadn't really begun yet. However, this straightforward and dedicated attitude was a marker for how the five-time Champions League winner would take on the rest of his glittering career in the sport.",
      "And it turns out Ronaldo's prediction was correct; after a dramatic penalty shoot-out win against Chelsea in the Champions League final and a two-point cushion against the same club that secured the Premier League title, the United star was awarded his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 – beating eventual rival Lionel Messi and Liverpool's Fernando Torres to the prestigious honour.",
      "Hargreaves continued to praise Ronaldo's work ethic that was instilled in the footballer since the beginning of his career, and also pinpointed the culture at United that helped the team achieve greatness like nobody had seen before.",
      "He said: \"Everyone looks at him finished now and how he looks and how he plays and the goals he's scoring, but again you're doing that every day. Take a guy thats 6'1 with that talent, that work ethic, and you're going to create gold.",
      "\"And so when I saw him putting the work in, I always thought I was a good pro, like before bed I used to do push-ups and sit-ups and stretch for an hour and I just thought that kind of helped me a little but I didn't do much else.",
      "\"And then I met Mike and we were in the gym a lot, which I loved, but then I saw Cristiano. So you put the work in, then you add another layer so then you start to do more, and I just think culture is such a powerful thing and we just had an amazing culture of everybody was talented but everybody wants to get better.\"",
      "Since his departure from United in 2009, Ronaldo has gone on to win four more Ballon d'Ors, four more Champions League titles and a host of other accolades, including two La Liga titles, two Serie A titles and the European Championship in 2016 with Portugal. The 40-year-old is still plying his trade in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr, and has his sights set on playing at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Hargreaves had a different path compared to his former United team-mate, as injuries plagued his time at Old Trafford, which eventually led to his departure from the club at the end of the 2010/11 season.",
      "From there, the midfielder spent one year at rivals Manchester City, in the same season that they dramatically won the Premier League on the final day from under United's fingertips thanks to a last minute winner from Sergio Aguero against Queens Park Rangers.",
      "However, due to Hargreaves only playing one league match all season, he did not qualify to receive a winner's medal."

      "“So, I think it’s much more about whether they just decide they’re going to keep him or if they’re going to take the fee, whatever that fee is from Saudi. I think it’s very unlikely that the fee will be the sort of numbers that have been speculated. They very rarely pay very big fees of the type that’s been rumoured there. Clearly, they paid it for Neymar, which was a disastrous deal.",
      "“There is some speculation they’re going to pay a very big fee for Kudus from West Ham. We will see about that. They paid a reasonably sized fee for Duran, although that’s a different category of deal given his age and given the striker.",
      "“They have paid very big wages but have tended not to pay very big transfer fees, and we’ll have to see whether that changes this summer. But if they weren’t to, then I think that would be the deal dead as far as Fernandes is concerned. I don’t think United would contemplate selling him unless they could get an extraordinarily large fee anyway.”",

      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim and Ange, Newcastle, Dias, Rusk, Beto, Jackson",
      "The winger had a decent start to this season, but his performances have declined in recent months as he’s slipped in the pecking order at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Sancho’s move to Chelsea is set to be made permanent with Enzo Maresca’s side finishing higher than 14th, but it has emerged that they can pay a penalty fee to cancel this agreement and send him back to Man Utd.",
      "A report from The Mirror claims this penalty fee is set at around £5m and Chelsea are ‘preparing to pay’ this figure to end Sancho’s time at Stamford Bridge.",
      "This is a blow for Man Utd, because it’s been widely reported that they need to raise funds for signings and could even need to sell to buy.",
      "The Mirror also have good news for Man Utd, though. This comes as Bundesliga outfit Bayer Leverkusen are to ‘offer Sancho a transfer lifeline’, while Dortmund are interested. Ruben Amorim’s side have also reduced his asking price below £25m to get rid.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘United are ready to cut their losses on the £73million former England international after discovering that the London club are now unlikely to take up the option of signing Sancho permanently following his season-long loan at Stamford Bridge.",
      "‘That has alerted Bundesliga pair Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "‘Both would want Sancho to take a cut on his current £250,000-a-week salary – but United are hoping that their willingness to accept less than £20million for the 25-year-old will make the numbers work.",
      "‘And Leverkusen are now looking to add some creativity to their squad as they prepare for life without coach Xabi Alonso and playmaker Florian Wirtz.’",
      "Marcus Rashford has not ruled out a Man Utd return and could embark on the sort of redemption arc which embarrassed Real Madrid and Jose Mourinho.",
      "You are Todd Boehly. Or one of his recruitment minions. Would you pay to keep Jadon Sancho at Chelsea, or pay to send him back to Man Utd?",
      "Chelsea are reportedly planning to raise around £430million in a ‘big clear-out’ this summer, as they look to raise funds for new players by getting rid of half of their ...",

      "“Everybody here has to think seriously about a lot of things. Everybody is thinking about the [Europa League] final. The final is not the issue. We have bigger things to think about,” Amorim said.",
      "“I’m talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team. We need to change that.”",

      "Nothing at Man Utd is as bad as it seems\nRuben Amorim seems like a decent man, and his admission after the West Ham game has sent the gossip machine into overdrive about his leaving the job. However, in the direst of dire seasons, it’s worth looking for signs of hope. Here are a few:",
      "This team had turned a corner around March, and while not winning games, was showing signs of solidity, especially against the top teams. But the dual challenges of the Europa League and the PL have meant the constant prioritisation of the former, in the last 4 weeks. So we’ve had a somewhat weakened team in the PL games, especially in defence.",
      "Harry Amass is far from Premier League ready, he probably needs to go on loan to a Championship clubs and play a season of punishing physical football. But as a team it’s clear that the Europa is being prioritised which I’m sure impacts the mental state of all players on the pitch.",
      "I’d really like to see a quantitative analysis of the injuries suffered by PL teams. Every team feels that they were unlucky with injuries, but I suspect United (and Spurs) have had it quite bad this year. Every time a player gains a little form he seems to go off for a few weeks (or months), for us. Martinez, Zirkzee, Dalot, De Ligt have all gotten injured just as a run of regular games in the right position was bringing them into some kind of confident form. Others like Mount, Mainoo, Amad, Maguire, and Shaw have had months out and have had to be nursed back with managed minutes.",
      "The lack of a settled defence is particularly debilitating – we seem to have had about seventeen thousand combinations of the back 3 in one season. The 18 year old Tyler Fredricson played well on the left in his first game, but then on the right versus Brentford. Lindelof’s confidence is so low, he might as well be playing his first professional game. Mazroui has been running on fumes lately, and Dalot is out for the season it seems. DeLigt has been in and out. Ayden Heaven looked great, for the few games he played before he went off injured. But he’s only 18. Shaw is still feeling his way in. Yoro is now injured – let’s hope not for too long.",
      "Dorgu is still relatively new to the PL and he’s 20 years old. Especially given the physicality of the PL, it’s a real challenge for the young players to come up to scratch physically and mentally. If we had a consistent run with say Maguire, DeLigt and Martinez as the settled back 3, with Yoro as the option, and with Mazraoi and Shaw able to step in occasionally – I think this season goes differently. Not to mention the cliche of the impact the lack of a settled defence on the goalkeeper.",
      "At the other end, it’s all about poor Hojlund. The one striker on whom everybody depends, who is so out of form that he couldn’t score a pint at a brewery. And yet there are no options here, with the Rashford meltdown, and Garnacho who is good for the odd worldy but generally unreliable with his decision making. And when your main striker isn’t scoring goals, the opposition find it easy to block the other routes. If your striker is in form, it also opens up opportunities for others to score.",
      "This is a feast or famine situation and United are most definitely in a famine. In the past few games we’ve created more chances than the opposition, but when you’re not scoring goals it always puts more pressure on the defence.",
      "How much of this is fixable? My argument is that Amorim desperately finds a way to bring consistency to his backline – whether through luck, or finding more indestructible defenders. And he needs at least 2 front players who are capable of scoring in the range of 20 goals a season. If the combined sales of Garnacho, Sancho, and Rashford allow for (say) Cunha and Liam Delap – it would be a different team.",
      "The midfield is actually quite competitive when everybody is fit and at the top of their game. When you can combine Dalot/Mazraoui/Amad on the left, and Dorgu/Leon (incoming)/Shaw on the right, with Mainoo, Bruno, Casemiro (managed minutes), and Ugarte in the middle. Sure, another solid DM wouldn’t hurt with the money we save from Eriksen and Lindelof salaries.",
      "None of this is to suggest that United will become CL contenders overnight. There’s a lot more missing in terms of chemistry and style. But maybe Amorim deserves one preseason and even then I’ll take a good run that gets us into the Europa League next season.",

After 40 years of being one, I don’t think I can carry on being a Liverpool fan.",

For the last time, players do not owe it to you to sign a contract just to get the club a fee!!! This narrative is genuinely pathetic. He signed a 4 year deal. He fulfilled his end of the bargain. If he had signed a 6-year deal and then said he wanted to leave, I absolutely 100% know for certain that you would be criticising him for wanting to leave mid-contract.",

      "Trent has been a starring member of the team that has won it all and brought LFC to 20 English titles. He should be (and is) a club legend. The fact that is is being criticised for seeing out his contract, rather than handing in a transfer request mid-contract is just utterly bizarre. He should have got a huge ovation and we wish him well as he goes off to a new challenge. Instead, pathetic, small minded idiots chose to see him leave under a cloud.",

      "We’ve been pretty down on this Premier League season at various points so let’s give credit where it’s due: that was a brilliant weekend.",
      "And the not-so-secret reason why it was such a brilliant weekend? Misery. Despair. Hearts breaking in two.",
      "We haven’t yet fully recovered from the saccharine, sickly sweet response to Newcastle’s Carabao Cup win, an event we were all instructed was one of great wondrousness that we should all be enjoying. We were baffled then and remain baffled now.",
      "Why should anyone other than Newcastle fans be delighted about Newcastle winning something?",
      "What we do understand is why for plenty of other ‘neutral’ supporters it was the more desirable outcome from the final. Everton supporters, for instance. Manchester United supporters. Any fans who find Liverpool’s This Means More exceptionalism more grating than Newcastle’s Best Fans in the World exceptionalism.",
      "And that brings us to the key point underpinning so much of football fandom. It’s not just about nice things happening to your team; it’s about bad things happening to other teams. And not necessarily even ones you particularly dislike.",
      "When you stop and think about it, this is obvious. If we had to rely on the joy our own teams actually provide us then almost all of us would surely have packed up the daft idea of following a football team years ago. For the vast majority of clubs the joy-despair ratio is all wrong.",
      "No, what keeps us coming back over and over is the fact that no matter what guff and nonsense your lot might be up to, at least someone else somewhere is showing more of their arse.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim and Ange, Newcastle, Dias, Rusk, Beto, Jackson",
      "Now to be clear here, we’re not subscribers to the idea that rivals’ disappointment should be more important than your own success. There’s a sliding scale here, but this is where we’d place ourselves: Spurs fans being quite happy to lose to Man City and scupper Arsenal’s league hopes at no great cost to themselves (avoiding Champions League qualification last season could yet prove their best decision in decades…) is absolutely fine, but Spurs fans who would settle for the hypothetical scenario of them not winning the Europa League if it meant Arsenal not winning the Champions League is too much.",
      "But the disappointment and upset of others is still a huge part of being a football fan and it’s ridiculous to pretend otherwise. It’s one more reason why we didn’t really understand that whole Newcastle thing. Knowing other fans are having their piss boiled to dangerous levels is a huge contributing factor to what makes your own success so enjoyable.",
      "Why would you want everyone else to be happy about it? Where’s the fun in that? This applies to success both large and small, too. Do Liverpool fans enjoy their title win more or less because it’s caused Mikel Arteta’s salty head to fall off? Do Southampton fans enjoy their point against Man City more or less because it’s caused Ruben Dias’ salty head to fall off?",
      "The whole guard of honour discourse is quite silly, but its existence tells us that deep down we all know this phenomenon is real. The idea of seeing Chelsea or Arsenal or whoever forced into this weird ritual humiliation by a luckless quirk of the fixture list is deeply enjoyable for everyone else.",
      "Which brings us back to this weekend and why it was so good: because so few people were actually happy.",
      "Man City weren’t happy because Southampton decided to actually defend against them, which is in fairness quite poor etiquette when they haven’t bothered with it against anyone else for 35 games.",
      "Arsenal aren’t happy because they’ve won nothing again and have dread fear about multiple potential banter outcomes to this season.",
      "Even Liverpool weren’t happy at their latest Anfield title party because they had simply no choice but to boo a player who has helped deliver everything those fans had craved for 30 years but now fancies playing for the biggest football club on earth for a bit.",
      "Chelsea: not happy.",
      "Man United and Spurs: involved in what is perhaps the all-time greatest season-long act of piss-boiling ever conceived, one which can now only end with one of those clubs as happy as a dog with two dicks while the other hits new depths of despair and everyone else is furious about one side of the equation and laughing their bollocks clear off about the other.",
      "They are, therefore, clearly the two standout clubs of this season and we have no notes. The fact they have now become so committed to ensuring they finish 16th and 17th to maximise the emotional extremes at the end of it all is truly magnificent.",
      "Even Nottingham Forest have found a way to bring misery upon themselves in a season that now brings a guaranteed place in European competition next season. The owner is literally on the pitch having a go at the manager because they might now only finish seventh.",
      "Here, then, is just another way this game is far more about misery than joy. Because the shift in expectations that follows things like Forest’s profoundly unlikely-looking season means that ‘We’d have given everything to be precisely where we are now back in August’ ends up meaning two-fifths of f*ck all in reality even though its logic is utterly impeccable.",
      "Do we have any actual problem with Nottingham Forest? Not really. Did we nevertheless take perverse and extreme delight in pinpointing the precise moment yesterday where their hearts broke in two? Of course we did.",
      "And don’t pretend you didn’t feel it too.",
      "Social media and ragebait and the wider collapse of society in general may have all helped hasten football’s descent into rabid and often unhealthy tribalism, but let’s not pretend the despair of others hasn’t always been an absolute core element of fan culture.",
      "We all love to hate."

      "Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou cannot complain that their preparations for a ludicrously important game have been shocking. Newcastle are flying.",
      "",
      "Leicester\nIf annoying your rivals represents the high point of a season it has not gone especially well. But fair play because that is a very funny bit.",
      "",
      "Newcastle\nIt could have gone two different ways. Newcastle ending their long trophy drought might just as easily have derailed the rest of their season, the instinct to celebrate and that release of pent-up emotion providing the most intoxicating and understandable distraction imaginable.",
      "But harnessed properly, it was always a potential springboard for something not greater and certainly not as tangible, but definitely more beneficial in the long run. While Newcastle cannot put Champions League qualification alongside the Carabao Cup in their trophy cabinet, it means more for their future aspirations.",
      "And no team has earned more Premier League points since the Carabao final than winners Newcastle, who have used that platform and momentum to surge past almost all of their rivals into prime position:",
      "These games really do suit them like no other. Newcastle have played members of the Big Six eight times at St James’ Park this season, winning six, drawing two, scoring 17 goals and conceding six. Those results formed a crucial part of their Carabao glory and seem likely to do the same with this Champions League push.",
      "",
      "Simon Rusk\nPerhaps only Eddie Howe, Thomas Frank, Oliver Glasner, Vitor Pereira and David Moyes have met their Premier League job requirements as specifically and definitively as Rusk this season. The man responsible for a quarter of Southampton’s points and two-thirds of their clean sheets having taken charge of just one sixth of their games has crossed an underwhelming but entirely necessary finish line nonetheless.",
      "In dragging Southampton beyond record-breakingly dreadful and into the mere realm of historically poor without the stigma attached, Rusk has delivered on his remit and bruised some egos along the way.",
      "The 43-year-old should be allowed to step back into a permanent role on the first-team coaching staff in the summer under whichever poor sap is chosen to lead their Championship promotion charge. Rusk has shown enough to suggest he is worth keeping around.",
      "He is also one of five managers to face and never lose to Pep Guardiola in the Premier League, and probably in time the toughest of those quiz question answers alongside former Middlesbrough caretaker Steve Agnew.",
      "",
      "Brentford\nFour straight wins for the first time in their Premier League history has turned European qualification from distant chance to distinct possibility for Brentford. Their home and away form has finally aligned at the perfect time and the injuries have abated.",
      "It is a ridiculous achievement for them to be eighth, with the ritual sacrifice of their domestic cup hopes entirely vindicated if Europa Conference League football can be secured.",
      "Selling your star striker and scoring more goals than all but the current top four is wild. Frank is a ludicrously good coach, even if it does still feel as though he would be sacked within six months if appointed anywhere else.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace\nOne point from setting a new club-record Premier League tally after doing the double over Spurs, Manchester United and Brighton, with the FA Cup final to follow this weekend.",
      "One man will be particularly devastated but Oliver Glasner is doing phenomenal work.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa\nThe success of their January transfer gamble depends exclusively on reaching the Champions League, but Aston Villa qualifying for Europe through league position for a third straight season is an underrated accomplishment that surprisingly few teams have managed in recent years.",
      "Unai Emery’s worth is undoubted but he continues to prove it in circumstances such as these. Away at Bournemouth without Youri Tielemans and Marcus Rashford, the Spaniard figured that Villa’s best chance was also without the ball. And that in itself was a risk, considering their six lowest shares of Premier League possession this season had returned five defeats and a draw.",
      "Their four lowest shares of Premier League possession in 2023/24 yielded three defeats and a draw. It is not Villa’s typical game to sit back and soak up pressure.",
      "But against Bournemouth it was an inspirational call, with a more rudimentary defensive four than usual helping combine Ollie Watkins’ record-breaking goal with a clean sheet.",
      "The key to their season has been in games against the teams around them. Only Liverpool have more points against the top half than Villa (28), who have done better in just one Premier League season – the 42-game inaugural campaign of 1992/93. That is down to a change in mindset overseen wonderfully by the manager.",
      "Of course, it won’t be relevant for their final two games against the teams in 16th and 17th. But Villa have played a blinder in saving these miserable, preoccupied versions of Manchester United and Spurs til last.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nNo club has been behind in fewer Premier League games so the opportunities to do so have been limited, but had Arsenal been able to turn more of their deficits into draws or wins their season would have a vastly different complexion.",
      "As it is, recovering from two quickfire first-half goals at Anfield to draw 2-2 even against a slightly absent Liverpool provided welcome proof that they retain those powers of recovery.",
      "",
      "Conor Bradley\nHe might well get a statue at this rate.",
      "",
      "Beto\nIt might be that Moyes is able to resist the obvious temptation to sign Marko Arnautovic, whose Inter contract expires at the end of the season and will not be renewed. The success of Beto as his latest centre-forward reclamation project should offset any desperate transfer moves at least.",
      "There was one sensational line from the Everton manager about the Guinean’s progress. “He’s done great, he’s improving,” Moyes said. “If he was a 19-year-old striker you’d say he’s got a bit to go, he’s not but he’s certainly improving,” he added of a 27-year-old who cannot afford to coast on potential.",
      "Nor does he have any inclination. Moyes mentioning how Beto trains “like you wouldn’t believe” and “is really trying” is a better indication of his standing under the Scot than the seven goals he has scored in 17 games since his appointment – as many as he mustered in 50 Sean Dyche appointments.",
      "No player has scored more goals in the Premier League this season without providing a single assist, and that narrowed focus between the posts has worked wonders. Unless Leeds offer stupid money, Beto has a part to play in this sustained Everton revival.",
      "",
      "Brighton\nFrom a recent Winners and Losers:",
      "‘It will be a close-run thing but Yasin Ayari’s stunning strike against West Ham has given Brighton a chance. They have pulled level with Arsenal for the most different scorers in the Premier League this season (16 each) and can claim the crown outright over the next four games.",
      "‘Brajan Gruda seems like the safest bet but Lewis Dunk could continue his resurgence with a goal and if worst comes to worst, Bart Verbruggen can be sent up for a corner on the final day.’",
      "Fabian Hurzeler knows what he must do. Verbruggen securing Conference League qualification by sending a goal kick flying over Fraser Forster’s head is written in the stars.",
      "",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka\n“I can’t say this categorically because I don’t know Aaron’s career, but I can’t imagine he’s played as well as he has for us at this point in his career,” said Graham Potter of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who set up the clinching goal against his former club to render this his joint-best Premier League season in terms of an attacking return.",
      "It’s difficult to imagine he’s played many clever reverse passes in the build-up to a goal at Old Trafford either.",
      "Two goals and four assists is not especially productive but the full-back’s improvement in that department has been obvious. In a season of unrelenting suffering for West Ham his £15m signing and six-year contract offers hope.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE REACTION FROM F365\n👉 European qualification latest: Forest follow Manchester City in squandering huge chance\n👉 Trent replaced in Premier League XI of the season by proper defender\n👉 Premier League prize money table revealed with Liverpool breaking Manchester City record",
      "Manchester United and Spurs\nThere have been games with bigger stakes before, but surely none with such a ridiculous gulf between the potential reward for victory and further embarrassment inflicted by defeat.",
      "It is difficult to recall the last fixture both teams so willingly torched their entire seasons for. Neither Manchester United nor Spurs were particularly wrong to have prioritised the Europa League basically since the knockout stage commenced, but the idea their Premier League form had to be offered as an unavoidable sacrifice is preposterous – not least because their apparent advantage over continental opposition will be entirely redundant in the final.",
      "Both Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou made reference to “the levels” needing to be higher after their latest defeats, with surprise that players could not step up and motivate themselves for games the managers have openly written off in terms of importance.",
      "Their approaches in the build-up have been different, with Amorim publicly wondering whether Champions League qualification might actually be worse for his players, rather ignoring how it should offset the need for any more unnecessary job losses throughout the club, while Postecoglou has made no attempt to hide what it would mean for Spurs.",
      "But both have essentially said for months that these games don’t really matter, as their combined 37 Premier League defeats bear out. “Who cares if we’re struggling in the league? It’s a separate thing,” Postecoglou said in a fair reaction after reaching the Europa final, but that sentiment inevitably transmits through the squad.",
      "The result is two Premier League teams entering a stupidly important one-off game in wilfully abysmal form, and as much as the lucrative and glorious plaster on offer for the winners has been highlighted, it doesn’t feel like nearly enough has been made of what the loser will be left with: a historically bad campaign, a squad with shattered confidence, a manager with at best an uncertain future and a summer which must go perfectly just to stabilise themselves.",
      "",
      "Ruben Dias\nIt had been a while since someone associated with Manchester City decidedly to actively soil themselves in protest at an insolent team not rolling over to have their bellies tickled.",
      "If ever a season was going to properly humble and shame that dormant side of self-important, condescending arrogance Pep Guardiola seemed to have suppressed within his squad it would be this one – the reigning champions’ worst of the Spaniard’s reign by far.",
      "And to be fair to Guardiola, he outright dismissed the suggestion Southampton were somehow to blame for Manchester City’s failings.",
      "“They can do whatever they want. It’s on us to break them. They didn’t do much but we have to accept the way they play. I don’t agree with Ruben. We have to accept it,” is absolutely right.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that the aversion to introspection so proudly worn by one of their leaders does not pervade a side in no position whatsoever to snipe at the way other teams play. It was always curious when they blamed those rare slips at their peak on the opposition choosing not to hand three points over, but feeling the need to punch so far down when they have been laughably short of their own standards all campaign is embarrassing.",
      "Manchester City had largely outgrown that finger-pointing, responsibility-shirking part of their identity, and any rebuild should involve restoring it. As eagerly awaited as Rodri’s comeback is, it would be regrettable if it heralds the return of Manchester City’s sore loser edge too.",
      "",
      "Erling Haaland\nThe Are Manchester City Better Without Erling Haaland narrative strand will never die. A ten-year contract ought to have rendered such talk null and void but Guardiola’s side were notably worse for the Norwegian’s presence against Southampton.",
      "The strikerless 4-2-2-2 formation had been refined to the point Manchester City were on their longest winning streak since October, and sacrificing it to give Haaland the full 90 minutes on his return felt like a mistake.",
      "Guardiola “did not expect” Southampton to set up so defensively and simply said of Haaland’s lack of supply that “Erling needs people to deliver balls to him” regardless of what position they play, but it does feel as though his effectiveness is contingent on using wingers, which in turn relies on there being the sort of stable midfield Manchester City cannot currently offer.",
      "If Rodri cannot make it for the FA Cup final then there could be a good old-fashioned Guardiola overthink in reverting back to the system which inspired Manchester City to beat Crystal Palace 5-2 just one month ago. Omar Marmoush feels like the better option than Haaland right now.",
      "",
      "Fulham\nMarco Silva mentioned that “the last six or seven games” had not been good enough from Fulham, but it feels like the eighth in that sequence – the 3-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup quarter-final – was the most damaging.",
      "On the morning of that game, Fulham were eighth and three points off the Champions League places. But since then their form has been miserable, with only the two Europa League finalists and relegated three faring worse.",
      "The international break in March might have killed their momentum and that tendency to drop points from winning positions has become a particular problem. Only Liverpool, Arsenal and Nottingham Forest have led more Premier League games than Fulham this season but the Cottagers seem to build their foundations on quicksand and have too frequently squandered those advantages.",
      "That result confirmed this to be a season of consolidation when so much more was promised.",
      "",
      "Nicolas Jackson\nA quite silly thing to do for a player whose talents are obvious but his drawbacks no less so. The race between a player’s Premier League goals (24) and Premier League cards (18) should not be so close, particularly when his former manager outlined two years ago a need to be more disciplined which appears to have gone ignored.",
      "Another club might be more patient and accommodating; Chelsea are not that club.",
      "",
      "Wolves\n“I think this was the first match that I watched my team playing like this,” said Vitor Pereira, ruing how Wolves were governed by emotion and chaos and drawn into the “open, completely unpredictable game” Brighton would have preferred.",
      "Matheus Cunha leaned into the vibe by conceding a penalty after losing the ball on the edge of his own area, while Pablo Sarabia’s aimless switch was punished to the fullest degree.",
      "It was the first time in 17 games Wolves had lost by at least two goals, and not coincidentally the first time in a while Wolves played someone else’s game rather than their own.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth\nIt is starting to feel a little bit like those swashbuckling January wins cursed them. Bournemouth have not won consecutive Premier League games since dispatching Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in the space of a week so spectacularly four months ago.",
      "Their form since that pair of victories which left them seventh, a point behind both Manchester City and Newcastle, has been atrocious:",
      "Andoni Iraola emphasised the need to “manage the small things better,” presumably like not letting Tyrone Mings test the structural integrity of one’s jaw with his elbow. And when you consider Bournemouth have lost 13 games in all competitions this season, but the only two by more than one goal were both administered by Liverpool, you see his point.",
      "",
      "Ipswich\nThe record for fewest home points in a Premier League season remains seven, set by Sunderland in 2005/06. It is a bar Southampton (six) are set to clear, but Ipswich have only managed to match it while already conceding more goals at Portman Road than the Black Cats at the Stadium of Light two decades ago.",
      "Only four clubs have accrued more points away than at home, but none with such a drastic difference as Ipswich. If they are to return to this stage soon, correcting that must be the priority.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest\nAn undoubtedly frustrating result, performance and general petering out of a wonderful season, with Matz Sels still Golden Glove-bound despite not keeping a clean sheet in seven games.",
      "Forest are basically just knackered and really that is fine. More signings could have been made in January and fewer rotation risks taken in the FA Cup but neither would have guaranteed a better outcome and both came with risks Forest decided it was better not to take.",
      "How embarrassing to only maybe qualify for one of Europe’s lesser competitions after being projected to battle relegation for a third straight season. Definitely worth the owner staging a one-man pitch invasion.",
      "Ruben Dias has criticised Southampton for not simply bending over and letting Manchester City score eight goals at St Mary’s.",
      "Including a mere one Leicester City player, here is the worst Premier League XI of the weekend. Ratings are taken from WhoScored.",
      "Everton may well have a major transfer decision to make with David Moyes and the Friedkin Group set to make a bold call.",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola has revealed that Ruben Dias could miss up to four weeks with a muscle issue after their Manchester derby loss last weekend."

      "As always, match ratings are taken from WhoScored.",
      "",
      "GK: Bernd Leno (Fulham) – 5.42\nLeno’s weak attempt to parry away Beto’s shot handed Everton an impressive away win, and that error earned the German a spot in the Premier League Worst XI. He has a pretty poor season by his standards.",
      "",
      "RB: Ola Aina (Nottingham Forest) – 5.80\nIt was a close call between Aina and Bournemouth’s Adam Smith (5.83), but the Nottingham Forest man makes the cut after a lacklustre performance in his side’s disappointing 2-2 draw against Leicester City.",
      "Aina picked up a yellow card, lost his only aerial duel, committed an error leading to a shot, and failed to make any tackles or interceptions.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.11\nManchester United have won six, drawn six, and lost 13 of their Premier League matches under Ruben Amorim. That is a diabolical record, and their latest defeat – at home to West Ham on Sunday – left them 16th in the table with a -11 goal difference.",
      "Say what you want about this being a transitional period, the players not being Amorim’s, or the focus being on Europe – this is still a squad worth over £700million in transfer fees and packed with international footballers. Amorim is embarrassed, and rightly so; winning the Europa League should not paper over the cracks of a worst-ever Premier League campaign.",
      "Anyway, rant over. Yoro struggled on Sunday before coming off injured.",
      "",
      "CB: Luke Shaw (Manchester United) – 5.90\nShaw played 52 minutes against West Ham, coming off alongside Yoro. He wasn’t injured – Amorim is simply managing his minutes carefully given his wretched injury record.",
      "Deployed at left centre-back in a back three, Shaw offered little defensive output: just one clearance, no interceptions, no tackles, and not a single aerial duel contested.",
      "",
      "LB: Harry Amass (Manchester United) – 5.76\nSticking with the shambles that is Manchester United, 18-year-old left wing-back Harry Amass made his fourth Premier League start in five games, which sounds promising until you realise he’s lost every single one, with an aggregate score of 11–4. Not ideal.",
      "United have now won just once in nine league matches, having seemingly written off their top-flight campaign the moment Ruben Amorim walked through the door.",
      "In their latest disappointment, Amass was dribbled past twice and probably shouldn’t have lasted the full 90 minutes.",
      "For the record, the lowest-rated actual left-back this week was Arsenal’s Myles Lewis-Skelly (6.08).",
      "",
      "DM: Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool) – 5.62\nIpswich’s Jack Taylor and Chelsea’s Romeo Lavia both had tough weekends, each recording a 5.78 match rating – but it’s Liverpool’s Ryan Gravenberch who claims the unwanted spot in this week’s worst XI.",
      "Arsenal came from two goals down at Anfield to salvage a point that should offer real encouragement heading into next season. They were helped by a toxic atmosphere following Trent Alexander-Arnold’s introduction, with the bizarre boos clearly unsettling Arne Slot’s side.",
      "Gravenberch, in particular, looked uncharacteristically unsettled. He was dribbled past once, failed with his only dribble attempt, misplaced four passes, made no interceptions, was dispossessed twice, committed one foul, and made an error leading to a shot.",
      "Fair play to Arsenal, who managed to rattle the Premier League’s best No.6 this season without Declan Rice.",
      "",
      "CM: Manuel Ugarte (Manchester United) – 5.74\nBack to the shambles at Old Trafford, is it? Hardly surprising that another goalless home defeat sees four Manchester United players in the worst XI – and rounding it off is £50m summer signing Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Uruguayan lasted just 59 minutes after failing to make any meaningful impact, with a dreaded error leading to a shot contributing to his poor 5.74 rating.",
      "",
      "CM: Andreas Pereira (Fulham) – 5.66\nFulham took the lead against Everton in the most 3pm blackout fixture imaginable – but they never took control and ultimately slumped to a deserved 3-1 defeat.",
      "They lost the midfield battle, with Andreas Pereira and Sander Berge struggling to assert themselves. Pereira committed one error leading to a shot and lost possession nine times.",
      "It’s a limp ending to what has been a genuinely fantastic Premier League season. Fulham have now lost four of their last five matches, with their only win in that time coming against the second-worst team in Premier League history.",
      "",
      "RW: Matheus Cunha (Wolves) – 5.73\nCunha is gleefully aware that he is, by some distance, Wolves’ best player. With that status comes a sense of responsibility – one that seemingly compels him to drop all the way back into his own box to collect the ball from goal-kicks. Against a high-pressing Brighton side at Molineux, this proved costly. Caught in possession by Mats Wieffer, the Dutchman was brought down in the box for a stonewall penalty. Danny Welbeck converted from the spot to score his tenth Premier League goal of the season – the first time he’s reached double figures in a single campaign.",
      "It could have been worse for Cunha, who was fortunate not to be sent off for the last-man foul. There was no common sense applied by VAR, who deemed the double jeopardy rule sufficient to spare the Brazilian a red card. But watching the replay, it’s clear there was no attempt to play the ball – Cunha’s eyes are fixed on Wieffer before he deliberately brings him down.",
      "Oh well. Wolves still lost 2-0, so literally only I care about that.",
      "",
      "LW: Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa) 5.27\nVilla secured a crucial 1-0 win at Bournemouth to keep their Champions League hopes alive. But on what had been a decent afternoon for Jacob Ramsey, a second yellow card ensured a nervy finish for Unai Emery and his players.",
      "They held on – but that doesn’t do Ramsey any favours here.",
      "",
      "ST: Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea) – 4.98\nSent off for an incredibly stupid assault on Newcastle United’s Sven Botman, Jackson seemed to have sabotaged Chelsea’s chances of a comeback in their biggest league game of the season. Oddly, though, Enzo Maresca’s side looked far better without him.",
      "Either way, he was a shoo-in the moment that first-half red card was shown.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘preparing a massive outlay’ to ‘secure’ three Premier League stars as ‘key signings’ this summer.",
      "PGMOL has been asked to consider John Brooks’ future as a Premier League official after Nicolas Jackson’s red card for Chelsea vs Newcastle.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is a fool but Chelsea were much better without him anyway. Newcastle were very good then pretty bad, but we can’t imagine they give a damn.",
      "A former England international has likened one of Man Utd’s summer transfer targets to Eric Cantona, but warns they’ll need to do much more.",

Money which could be frittered away on second-rate talent, of course.",
      "The PFMs sat with their legs apart and held it in contempt, very much the glass of dry white white wine to their three bottles of strong Barolo and they would put out weakened sides in order to get knocked out as soon as possible.",
      "“It’s one of those competitions that teams get in and then they try to get out of,” said Harry Redknapp who spoke and, to an extent still speaks, for this viewpoint. Playing on a Thursday and Sunday was spuriously claimed to upset players’ delicate biorhythms.",
      "“It takes an even bigger toll in my opinion, that’s the problem. That Thursday night one, every week, and playing Sundays every week…it’s not ideal,” said Redknapp, a physiological expert in his own lunchtime. Is he saying it now that it’s much easier for rubbish Premier League teams to get to a final?",
      "Foreign clubs could cope, of course, but not the delicate Premier League players. Some fans bought this line of bullsh*t and still cling to it, for some reason downplaying one of the few trophies that can be won in a season, having written out an ordered list of trophy importance, based on nothing but some invented truths only they believe.",
      "But now it’s an all-English final, they seem to have decided to take it seriously in a way they did not when Porto beat Braga or Sevilla remarkably won it three times consecutively. Or perhaps we do now because the manager that achieved that feat works in the Premier League so must now be respected. That’s how English exceptionalism works.",
      "Much humour has been derived from Manchester United playing Spurs. Two absolutely chronic bin fires who are both some shade of disgraceful. But the Premier League rewards even the worst with more than £100million of free money; no one from Europe can compete with that.",
      "The truth is, as anyone who watches European football will tell you, other leagues are certainly more regularly entertaining and there are loads of great players who have no interest in playing for an English club. Even though they might earn more, they know that’s not the most important thing. But the teams they play for have diminishing chances of doing well because of simple economics.",
      "A lot of the best players, but not all, have been drawn to the Premier League. That doesn’t mean they play the most entertaining football, of course, but the weight of numbers and overall quality are having an effect because of the sheer volume and depth of resources in favour of the Premier League.",
      "The imbalance is now so massive that it just can’t be ignored, best expressed with Spurs playing Bodo/Glimt. The disparity of resources was profound. Just in case you don’t know how profound, Bodo had one player in the squad worth six million Euro, Spurs had 26 worth more. Now, you don’t have to be critical of this competitive imbalance to recognise that it exists and must influence results. Imagine if, say, rubbish Italian clubs had such an advantage. It’d feel unfair wouldn’t it? Not that it’s possible to totally even out resources and we accept there’ll be differences. It’s the extent of the disparities, not the disparities per se.",
      "As the Premier League becomes ever more financially dominant, it will obviously have an impact on European competitions, especially outside of equally financially dominant sides in the Champions League. Even these rubbish Premier League sides can’t be competed with and they are really terrible. Is it desirable that this should be the case? We’re now at a stage where only a handful of clubs can win any European trophy.",
      "For example, watching Chelsea beat Djurgårdens wasn’t interesting for anyone not a Chelsea fan because of their altogether vastly superior resources. It’s like if they got to an FA Cup final by beating Walsall. You’d think, well, so what? Of course they did.",
      "When West Ham won the Conference League, only when they beat Fiorentina in the final did they play any side even vaguely near their resources. It was hailed as a great victory, but how great was it really? You wouldn’t think that if they won the FA Cup after only playing third or fourth-tier sides and then beat a top Championship side in the final.",
      "If money means anything at all, the Europa and Conference League final should always be between English clubs and if they were as good as is often claimed they are, probably the Champions League too.",
      "Part of the fun of football is not knowing the outcome of games but when fixtures are so imbalanced, you inevitably do. The argument for a separate European money league grows ever stronger the more the gap widens. You just want teams to have a decent chance and right now, that chance is diminishing every year.",
      "It’s not even just about the winners so much as just doing well. How does UEFA pass these tournaments off as proper competitions, because they’re not. Maybe they want them to harden around a few teams. Predictability attracts more investment after all, so the last thing they want is unpredictability.",
      "The Thursday night curse may have been lifted from Premier League clubs just at a time when the competitions are having their competitiveness undermined by grotesque financial imbalance."

      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton.",

Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",

      "",
      "4) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.7\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his last five games.",
      "",
      "5) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",

That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",

      "9) Alisson (Liverpool): +1.3\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",
      "",
      "10) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.3\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",
      "11) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +1.3\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",

      "12) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.2\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Now being saved for the Europa League.",
      "",
      "13) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.0\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine.

But he under-conceded v Liverpool to drag himself level for the season.",

Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",

      "West Ham became the sixth team to complete a Premier League double over Man Utd this season in numbers which should shame any post-Ferguson decision-maker.",
      "Julen Lopetegui masterminded the 2-1 win which prompted Erik ten Hag’s sacking in October, meaning Graham Potter completed a surprise league double for West Ham over Manchester United with that victory.",
      "Five teams did it a combined 14 times under Sir Alex Ferguson – including West Ham themselves – but since his retirement in 2013, 13 sides have completed 16 such doubles between them.",
      "",
      "Manchester City – three times (in 2013/14, 2018/19 and 2023/24)\nGames have been raised and pretend (and actual) cup finals won by all manner of Man Utd managers for and in this fixture, from Louis van Gaal to Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag and even Amorim. But Pep Guardiola has managed to overcome such ridiculousness a couple of times and Manuel Pellegrini needed those six points to help deliver a title.",
      "",
      "Brighton – two times (in 2022/23 and 2024/25)\nNever before had Brighton completed a league double over Man Utd until they bookended an actually decent Ten Hag season with a pair of defeats, including Alexis Mac Allister’s 99th-minute winning penalty at the Amex. Then Fabian Hurzeler repeated the feat in just the worst campaign.",
      "",
      "Liverpool – two times (in 2013/14 and 2021/22)\nIt really should have been more, and indeed Liverpool will be frustrated to have completed more Premier League doubles in 21 attempts against Ferguson’s Man Utd than in 12 tries against the incompetent mess he left behind. Considering how generally excellent the Reds have been in that time it is especially curious that Jurgen Klopp could only do it as often as Brendan Rodgers – and that was against the risible combined efforts of Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick.",
      "",
      "West Ham – one time (in 2024/25)\nWhile many Hammers will still fondly remember the work of Alans Pardew and Curbishley in beating Man Utd 1-0 home and away to help secure Premier League safety in 2006/07, for many the double act of Julen and Graham will be the first taste of that particular double. Lopetegui got Erik ten Hag the sack in October before himself being replaced in January by Potter, who finished the job with a win at Old Trafford in May.",
      "",
      "Wolves – one time (2024/25)\nVitor Pereira was only appointed in December of the 2024/25 season but he still managed to guide Wolves to their first league double over Man Utd since 1979/80 by masterminding entirely deserved wins by 2-0 at Molineux and 1-0 at Old Trafford, the latter taking them level on points with their hosts in the league table despite being 17th for most of the campaign.",
      "",
      "Newcastle – one time (in 2024/25)\nSo confident were Newcastle that the demons of Kevin Keegan could finally be exorcised that they trusted Jason Tindall to finish the job at St James’ Park. A swashbuckling 4-1 thrashing was about as dominant as the 2-0 victory the Magpies secured at Old Trafford a few months prior. For the first time since 1930/31, the Magpies beat their tormentors home and away in a season.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest – one time (in 2024/25)\nChris Wood was impossibly tall, all elbows and an absolute handful for the babysitter when at five months old he witnessed Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest put Man Utd down in March and April of 1992. Over 30 years later he helped ensure history would repeat itself but Anthony Elanga was by far the more embarrassing goalscorer.",
      "",
      "Spurs – one time (in 2024/25)\nIn an abysmal and very possibly sack-worthy domestic season for Ange Postecoglou, almost one-fifth of his total league wins have come against Man Utd. Spurs completed their first league double over the Red Devils since 1989/90 with a 3-0 hammering at Old Trafford before James Maddison fed Roy Keane a few of his words in north London.",
      "",
      "Arsenal – one time (in 2023/24)\nThe tide has only recently turned definitively in favour of Arsenal, who had waited so long to vanquish Man Utd that Emmanuel Adebayor and Thierry Henry were their heroes on the most recent such occasion. The roles were recast for Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard 17 years later.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace – one time (in 2023/24)\nHaving never beaten Manchester United twice in a league season, Palace made it look mightily easy when they followed up 1-0 win at Old Trafford in September with a proper paddling at Selhurst Park the following April. That was the Casemiro “leave the football before the football leaves you” game; it was an absolute humiliation.",
      "",
      "Swansea – one time (in 2014/15)\nPerhaps the most surprising side to take advantage of this hilariously embarrassing era to register their first league double over a club which must technically be described as Man Utd was Swansea. Their highest-ever Premier League finish of 8th was at least in some part supported by a couple of 2-1 wins, with Ki Sung-yueng scoring in both. The great man is still playing, and even being captained by Jesse Lingard at FC Seoul, no less.",
      "",
      "Everton – one time (in 2013/14)\nThe schadenfreude was wonderful as Man Utd handpicked Everton’s manager as their Ferguson replacement and the Toffees promptly dealt out a pair of results which contributed heavily to his demise. David Moyes was sacked a couple of days after Goodison Park revelled in that second win, the first obviously having been secured by a Bryan Oviedo goal.",

      "Liverpool thanked them by securing a 3-0 win at Elland Road that set two unbroken top-flight records: most points in a top-flight season with two for a win (68); and fewest goals conceded in a 42-game campaign (16).",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",
      "Rashford has been heavily linked with a potential move to Barcelona over the past couple of years.",
      "Ahead of this season’s winter transfer window, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd and it was widely reported that Barcelona were his preferred destination.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants did not go through as his poor form for Man Utd and huge salary proved huge stumbling blocks.",
      "Instead, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m and his form has picked up in recent months. He has four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Unai Emery’s side.",
      "READ: Where next for Marcus Rashford? Villa or ‘dream’ scenario threatened by lack of cash?",
      "Rashford’s improved form is likely to attract interest from further afield and a recent report claimed he remains keen on a move to Barcelona, with the forward willing to take a significant pay cut and a ‘strategic step’ to force through a move to the Spanish giants.",
      "Romano has provided an update on Rashford situation and in a boost for the England international, Barcelona are in favour of a move.",
      "The transfer expert claims two factors boost Rashford’s chances of joining Barcelona as he is “under consideration” ahead of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "“Internally at Barcelona, they still believe that Marcus Rashford could be an option for the summer transfer window,” Romano said on his  YouTube channel.",
      "“They believe at Barcelona that Rashford might be available on the market. They believe at Barcelona that Rashford could be a good solution because he can play as a No 9 and play on the wing, so he can help in several positions.",
      "“He’s a player appreciated by those at Barcelona. They already wanted Rashford in January, it didn’t happen because Ansu Fati didn’t leave and so in terms of FFP it was not possible to balance the deal.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford remains in the list of Barcelona and so if Rashford is not staying at Aston Villa we will see what happens. He’s one of the options under consideration at Barcelona.",
      "“Then it will depend on FFP, on deal conditions, on more clubs being keen on the player and on what he decides to do.",
      "“We will see on Rashford’s side, but on club side one of the names being mentioned internally at Barcelona is for sure Marcus Rashford.”",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side."

      "By Pete Gill and Ron Walker",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 09:43, UK",
      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

Like in Paris on Wednesday night, the Gunners had multiple chances to open the scoring - most notably Bukayo Saka's from a free-kick - but they failed to take them. Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side ended the first half with the same number of shots as Liverpool, but they were two goals down. Liverpool took their chances while Arsenal didn't have the firepower. It hit the nail in the coffin that a new striker was needed.",
      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim: \"For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK'. That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it’s the end of the world to lose a game at home\"",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 10:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim insists Man Utd are \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\" after admitting to being “embarrassed” about his side's lack of urgency amid their Premier League struggles.",
      "United returned to earth with a bump three days after reaching the Europa League final as fellow strugglers West Ham secured their first Premier League win at Old Trafford since 2007.",
      "Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen scored in a 2-0 triumph that meant United have now lost an eye-watering 17 top-flight matches this term, with nine of them coming on home turf.",
      "Their latest meek performance infuriated Amorim, who says there is a \"lack of urgency in everything we do\" and a worrying mentality at a club sitting 16th in the standings.",
      "\"For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK', and 'we cannot change our position so much so it's OK',\" the United boss said.",
      "\"That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.\"",
      "Amorim said it is \"the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club\" - one that is without a league title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",
      "\"I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here. Everybody is thinking about the final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club.",
      "\"We have bigger things to think and we have to change a lot of things in the end of the season.\"",
      "Amorim then appeared to cast doubt over his own role at United he reiterated that United \"need to change a lot of things during the summer\" and acknowledged that could eventually lead to a change in the dugout, having overseen just six league wins since succeeding Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Asked how he changes the players' attitude given his struggles to do so, he said: \"I don't know, and I don't want to talk about players. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team.",
      "\"I have that feeling, we need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this.",
      "\"If we start like this, or if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.\"",
      "So poor have United been that he even suggested that Champions League qualification may be an issue.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I'm not concerned about the final,\" he said. \"It's by far the smallest problem in our club. We need to change something that is deeper than this.",
      "\"We are showing that in the end of this season that playing Premier League and Champions League for us is the moon, so we need to know that.",
      "\"I'm not concerned about the final. They (the players) will be focused and I don't know what is best, if it's playing Champions League or not. So, let's think about Chelsea to improve a lot of things.\"",
      "Man Utd deserve to be in a relegation scrap.",
      "If you take the three relegated clubs out of the equation, Manchester United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games.",
      "They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and top-flight is so great, otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go. If they lose both their remaining league games, they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",
      "Apart from the flashy feet of Amad Diallo, who got 80 minutes under his belt down the right-flank, this was another dispiriting afternoon for the locals. West Ham carried the greater attacking threat, were more robust without the ball and were clinical with their finishing.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Yet this team are one win away from playing Champions League football next season. Someone make it make sense."

      "Amad was the spark and he was denied by a smart save from Alphonse Areola, but the atmosphere soon went flat as West Ham, who were without win in eight league games themselves, took control.",
      "Mohammed Kudus was the standout player on the pitch and his drilled cross into the six-yard box was flicked in from close range by Tomas Soucek to give the visitors the lead.",
      "The problems continued to mount up for Man Utd in the second half as Leny Yoro was forced off through injury just 10 days before the Europa League final.",
      "The West Ham supporters were celebrating again soon after as Manuel Ugarte was caught in possession by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Kudus then exploded into space and the ball broke for Wan-Bissaka, who decided against shooting and played the ball across goal for Bowen to tap home at the far post.",
      "Man Utd tried to find a way back into the game and their best opportunity fell to Rasmus Hojlund, but the striker was brilliantly denied from close range by Areola at full stretch as the Hammers sealed a first league win since February.",

You can feel it at the beginning of the game. Between our box and opponent's box there is a lack of urgency. That is something we have to change in this club.",
      "\"I am responsible for that. It is frustrating because we are so near the goals. We have such a lack of urgency to protect our goal. This is week by week. We don't play so well in the Europa League but we have a different sense of urgency.",

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Arsenal's target at the start of the season was to win the Premier League. They would have also been hoping to improve on last season's run to quarter finals of the Champions League and potentially go on and taste success for the first time in that competition.",
      "The Gunners wanted silverware. Mikel Arteta wanted to win.",
      "However, with Liverpool running away with the Premier League, a Champions league last-four exit to PSG, an early exit in the FA Cup and a semi-final defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the reality is a fifth trophyless season under Arteta.",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",

But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",

      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course.

      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",

      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",

      "Champions League prize money increased by a third following the competition's revamp this season, making it all the more important for the Premier League teams vying to qualify.",
      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",
      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League, which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams, is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",
      "Every club that qualifies earns an automatic £15.7m - even if they lose every game and go out at the league phase.",
      "At that stage, every win earns a club £1.8m and a draw £590,000.",
      "For finishing in the top eight of the league phase, which seals automatic qualification to the round of 16, UEFA awards £1.7m to each team.",
      "Teams are also awarded £233,000 for each place in the league phase table, meaning Liverpool got £8.4m for finishing top, while Arsenal earned £7.9m for finishing third.",
      "UEFA then rewards teams for reaching each round of the knockout phase:",
      "Arsenal are therefore the biggest earners among the English clubs this season.",
      "Their run to the last four, where they were beaten by Paris Saint-Germain, earned them roughly £70m in prize money, and that is before factoring gate receipts and commercial revenues.",
      "The winner of the final between Paris-Saint Germain will earn close to £100m in prize money.",
      "For comparison, Manchester United received just £3.9m in prize money for winning the FA Cup last summer",
      "UEFA has also introduced a new \"value pillar\" of payments for the first time this season - which could be worth an additional £10.5m to clubs.",
      "This is a complicated bonus based on your club's historical success in Europe and how much your country pays for its broadcast rights to the Champions League.",
      "As we approach the end of the Premier League season, just seven points separate six teams fighting for the remaining places below champions Liverpool, whose place is already assured.",
      "Crucially, England's co-efficient score means the Premier League has five spots this season, rather than the usual four.",
      "Arsenal could clinch their place with victory over Liverpool on Super Sunday, with Man City, Newcastle and Chelsea currently occupying the other spots, and Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Five spots will become six now that both Tottenham and Manchester United have reached the Europa League final.",
      "Both sides are in the bottom half in the Premier League and not in the conversation for a top-five finish, but the Europa League winners earn qualification to the Champions League.",
      "An English Europa League winner does not mean the fifth-placed Premier League team lose their Champions League place."

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",

      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",

      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",
      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",
      "Although Spurs and Manchester United don't officially fall into that category, it gives a relevant overview of how a European campaign can make it very hard to remain consistent in the Premier League.",
      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",
