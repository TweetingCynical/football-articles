      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has requested his former trusted ally Acacio Valentim be added to his staff as part of another coaching restructure. The Portuguese head coach is determined to avoid another woeful campaign after a tricky first season at the helm.",
      "After replacing Erik ten Hag following a move from Sporting Lisbon, he led United to 14th in the Premier League, while they were defeated in the Europa League final by Spurs. And ahead of his second season with the club, Amorim has asked for some help behind the scenes.",
      "According to Portuguese outlet Record, Amorim has made a personal request to United chiefs to make a move for Acacio Valentim. The 49-year-old previously worked alongside his countryman as a coach at former club Braga, with Amorim keen to be reunited at Old Trafford.",
      "Talks are reportedly underway over a move to the UK, with Valentim a free agent having exited the Portuguese club this summer. His move would become the latest reshuffle behind the scenes since Amorim’s arrival.",
      "Erik ten Hag’s former staff members including Ruud van Nistelrooy all left - the Dutchman has now been sacked by Leicester. Rene Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel all also left following Amorim’s arrival.",
      "Set piece coach Andreas Georgson was initially retained but appeared to take on a new role in December after Amorim confirmed that his assistant Carlos Fernandes was instead at the forefront of set piece planning.",
      "Explaining the change after a clash with Arsenal, he said: \"The thinking is Carlos is responsible for set pieces, different stuff. Andreas is also there to help. That’s it. That’s the reason.",
      "\"I think if you follow Premier League for a long time you can see that they (Arsenal) are also big players for that. And you can see it in every occasion that (Bukayo) Saka and (Gabriel) Martinelli has one against one, a lot of times they go outside and cross. They already know if the cross is going well, they can score. If it’s a corner, they can score.",
      "\"So we have to be better on that situation but like in every area of our game we need time to improve also. But you can see in all Arsenal games every team has a problem with that.\"",
      "Georgson eventually left his role in May of this year, while a number of prominent backroom figures have also departed Old Trafford over recent weeks.",

      "Emi Martinez remains keen on an exit from Aston Villa this summer and both Chelsea and Manchester United are said to have been given 'encouragement' over a move from the Argentine's camp.",
      "Martinez, 32, has established himself as one of the Premier League's top goalkeepers since joining Villa from Arsenal. But there are doubts over his long-term future and it's understood that he is keen on a move ahead of the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "Manchester United have been heavily linked with Martinez amid the ongoing scrutiny over Andre Onana's position at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United’s attempts to sign Bryan Mbeumo have suffered a blow after Brentford rejected their second offer for the forward. United want to add Mbeumo to their squad after landing Matheus Cunha, but negotiations have been far from straightforward.",
      "Cunha joined United for £62.5million from Wolves earlier in June and the club quickly identified Mbeumo as the second player they wanted for their new-look attack. The Cameroon international scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season and has attracted interest from United, Tottenham, Newcastle and Arsenal.",
      "Mbeumo has his heart set on moving to Old Trafford and has told Brentford and his former manager, Thomas Frank, that he won’t be joining him at Tottenham. Yet Ruben Amorim is still waiting to land the 25-year-old right winger, with the Bees playing hard ball.",
      "United’s improved bid of £55m and £7.5m of bonuses, which was submitted on Monday, has been rejected by Brentford.",
      "It followed an opening offer of £45m plus £10m. Brentford, naturally, want the bulk of the fee paid up front, while United would prefer to spread out the cost. The Bees are holding out for a fee close to £65m and it remains to be seen if United return with an improved third bid for the Cameroon international or decide to look at alternative targets.",
      "While Tottenham made their interest known, they never submitted an official offer for Mbeumo. And the north London club are understood to have moved on after Mbeumo informed Frank personally of his preference to join United.",
      "United will continue negotiations with Brentford over Mbeumo and are still confident of getting a deal done. That confidence is based on the player’s wishes and the fact that they don’t need to sell their unwanted players to fund the move.",
      "They are understood to be willing to offer Mbeumo between £150,000-£175,000-a-week, with bonuses taking that expected package to £200,000-a-week. He is under contract with the Bees until June 2026, but the club also have the option to extend it by a further 12 months.",
      "Mbeumo has been with Brentford since 2019, when he joined for £5.8m from French side Troyes. He has contributed 70 goals and 51 assists in 242 appearances for the club altogether and looks set to follow in the footsteps of Ivan Toney is leaving west London.",

      "\"There is a reason why he costs X number of million pounds, and we do not have X number of million pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",

      "Recruiting proven firepower is thought to be a priority at Old Trafford in the coming months, given that Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee failed to have much of an impact in the Premier League in 2024/25 - scoring a combined seven goals.",
      "And as a result, United have been endless in their pursuit of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while also showing an interest in the likes of Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres. An initial bid of £55m for Mbeumo was rejected, but it is thought that their improved figure exceeding £60m may get a deal over the line for the 25-year-old winger.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, has also proved to be a tough acquisition for Amorim and the United board. While Arsenal are thought to have held pole position for the 27-year-old striker, who found the back of the net 39 times in the Primeira Liga this season, it appears as though the Red Devils are now back in the running - although a move could cost another £60m.",
      "Newcastle United talisman Alexander Isak is another of the summer transfer window's most talked-about names having impressed at St. James' Park since arriving from Real Sociedad back in 2022. However, the £150m price tag set on the 25-year-old - given that he is considered one of the best goal-scorers in Europe at present and is under contract with the Magpies until 2028 - may prove off-putting to a cost-cutting United side.",
      "With those players totalling as much as £270m, Ince, who played at Old Trafford between 1989 and 1995, believes that his old club could find a far cheaper solution in Aston Villa's Watkins this summer.",
      "\"He can run it behind, he's quick, he can hold the ball up. He's got all the attributes of a striker that you want. And if you look at the way he was kind of pushed out towards the back end of the season when [Marcus] Rashford came, there might be something.",
      "\"He won't be happy about not playing towards the back end of the season. So, there might be something doing. Maybe not, that's down to Ollie and his agent and getting it sorted out. But if I was trying to bring a striker in, I'd bring in Ollie Watkins.",
      "\"And I think it would take a lot of weight off Hojlund. Rasmus Hojlund is a young striker and he's been asked all last season to play at the biggest club under the biggest expectations, under the biggest pressure and the biggest spotlight to score goals.",
      "\"And, you know, it's not happened for him and he's been criticised for it - and I think sometimes a bit unfairly. I think he's one of those young players who maybe needs to maybe go on loan somewhere for a year, score goals or just be a support act for whoever they bring in so he's not under pressure every time when he starts a game.",
      "\"And that coincides with United being poor, United not playing well, players not adjusting to the system. It's been a tough, tough year for him but he’ll learn. It's character-building.",
      "\"But he needs that striker where he can just say, ‘Right, well, the pressure’s not on me to go and score a week in and a week out, and when the game opens up, maybe I can get 15, 20 minutes on the pitch where I can - hit the back of the net.'",
      "\"But it wasn't just the goals and people just talk about the goals. I think, you know, he's got to work on his hold-up play. For me, he needs to be a lot, lot better at his retention of the ball. But these are all things you expect from a young player, but things that he needs to be working on every day.\"",
      "It comes after Arsenal made a bid for Watkins in the January transfer window to the tune of around £60m, which left Villa officials fuming given it was made public just two hours before their Champions League clash with Celtic. Watkins impressed in the Premier League this season, finding the back of the net on 16 occasions in 38 appearances while providing eight goals overall - and should United be serious in bolstering their lead line ahead of 2025/26, the 29-year-old would undoubtedly fit the bill.",

      "Manchester United have lost the opportunity to sign former wonderkid target Youssoufa Moukoko at a bargain price, years after Erling Haaland praised the Borussia Dortmund striker's skills on the pitch. The 20-year-old has been the subject of much transfer speculation over the years following his history-making Bundesliga debut.",
      "However, it now appears that the young talent will be leaving Germany and joining FC Copenhagen in an unexpected move for the former prodigy. The forward made history in 2020 by becoming the youngest player to debut in the German league at 16 years old during Dortmund's 5-2 victory over Hertha Berlin.",
      "Following the match, Manchester City forward Haaland, who was also with Der BVB at the time, hailed Moukoko as the best young player he'd ever seen. He said: \"He's the biggest talent in the world right now. I am over 20, I am getting old now!\"",
      "This wasn't the first time Haaland had lavished praise on Moukoko. He told the Bundesliga's official website that the young striker was superior to him at that age, adding: \"Moukoko is much better than I was at his age.",
      "\"The advantage for him is that he's already playing for Dortmund at the age of 15. At his age, I was still playing for my home town of Bryne.\"",
      "Now, five years later, Moukoko is securing his transfer from the German club, but not to the major European giant that many would anticipate.",
      "In 2022, United were quoted a hefty £26.2million for the promising young striker, who was garnering attention from rivals such as Liverpool, as well as European giants Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "At the time, Moukoko's representative, Patrick Williams, was frank when he spoke to BILD about his client's need for more game time to blossom. He made the point to warn Dortmund over the looming end of the player's contract.",
      "Williams said: \"It is not a matter of course that Youssoufa is extending BVB. Of course, many clubs are interested in Youssoufa, that's no secret. The end of his contract in the summer of 2023 is getting closer, the top clubs have that on the slip.",
      "\"Yes, injuries have thrown him back a bit this season. Yes, the competition at BVB is of course great. But he hardly gets the playing time that he needs in the current phase of his career in Dortmund. So of course we think about what is best for the future.\"",
      "Unfortunately, a transfer to United never came to fruition, and Moukoko is reportedly now heading off to Copenhagen for a much more modest £4.3million. Fabrizio Romano has reported that the star will undergo a medical on Friday, paving the way for a new journey in the Superliga.",
      "Even though Moukoko has slipped through their fingers, the Red Devils aren’t avoiding making any transfer moves this summer. United have already secured Brazilian star Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million on a five-year deal, signalling their intent for the future.",
      "It's also been reported that they're set to beat Tottenham Hotspur to the post in signing Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo, with the 25-year-old on the verge of sealing a £60m deal with the Red Devils.",
      "However, boss Ruben Amorim will be keen for more arrivals at Old Trafford - and departures too - in what is sure to be a hectic few weeks ahead of the Premier League season kick-off.",

      "The England international was sent on loan to Aston Villa in January, with United manager Ruben Amorim making it clear that he was no longer part of his plans. Rashford scored four goals and registered five assists in 17 appearances for Villa, who weren't convinced him enough to trigger their £40million option to buy him permanently.",
      "That's still the amount which United are holding out for, with Rashford expected to return for pre-season training next month if no buyer is found. The forward's preference is to join Barcelona, even sending a come-get-me-plea last week.",
      "His brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, was previously spotted meeting Barca sporting director Deco in Catalunya. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick has also described Rashford as a 'fantastic player'.",
      "But the La Liga champions are unlikely to cough up United's asking price, as they're currently prioritising the £50m signing of Nico Williams from Athletic Bilbao. In light of Barcelona's stance, Newcastle emerged as alternative destination - although that, too, now looks like a dead end for the 27-year-old.",
      "The Sun report that Rashford isn't on Newcastle's list of targets. Magpies boss Eddie Howe wants to bolster his attack this summer, as they prepare to return to the Champions League.",

      "Manchester United have been given a glimmer of hope that an auction for Jadon Sancho could help drive up the winger's price. Chelsea opted against signing the England international at the end of his season-long loan, but a second new club has now entered the race.",
      "Fenerbahce were already linked with Sancho, who has found things tough at Old Trafford since joining in a big-money move from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. Jose Mourinho aren't the only side in the mix, though, it has been claimed.",
      "According to The Sun, Juventus are now ready to test United's resolve. The Serie A club are looking to add to their ranks after installing Igor Tudor as manager, and Sancho is said to be a target.",
      "Juve endured a difficult season last term, but Tudor helped them sneak into the final Champions League qualification spot after replacing Thiago Motta in March. The Bianconeri are also through to the last 16 of the Club World Cup, where they will face Real Madrid.",
      "They faced Manchester City on Thursday, with the winner knowing they would likely avoid Los Blancos and set up a meeting with Al Hilal. The game was delicately poised at the break, with City 2-1 ahead, only for Erling Haaland, Phil Foden and Savinho to all score in the second half to earn a 5-2 win.",
      "Fenerbahce had reportedly been hopeful of getting a deal over the line for as little as £15million. With a second club now in the mix, though, that could change.",
      "Chelsea's loan deal for Sancho included an obligation to buy the player for around £25m. However, they also had the option of paying £5m to get out of that obligation and did just that - despite the winger scoring in their Conference League final victory.",
      "If United are able to cash in on Sancho, it could help free up transfer funds and wage budget. Ruben Amorim's side have already completed their first signing of the season, with Matheus Cunha joining in a £62.5m move from Wolves, and further ins and outs are anticipated.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is also set to move to Old Trafford, with the Brentford star due to arrive for a similar sum. With two attacking players on the way in, logic dictates that there will be no room for at least one other member of the front-line.",

The Nigeria international has made waves after the highest-scoring season of his career to date and is now attracting attention from the big leagues.",
      "An outstanding 2024/25 campaign saw him net 23 goals in 45 appearances for Genk to capture United's attention. The Red Devils appear to be on the verge of signing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo but seem eager to continue reinforcing their attacking options.",
      "Ruben Amorim made a swift start to his first summer in England by wrapping up a £62.5million move for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha. And United look set to spend a similar fee bringing Mbeumo to the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "Arokodare, 24, boasted an impressive tally of 30 direct goal contributions this season, an average of two in every three games. And to make United's job easier, he revealed his long-held admiration for the club and his aspiration to compete in the Premier League.",
      "\"I'm a Manchester United fan, and if it happens, it would mean a lot to me and my family. Of course, it would be a dream come true.\"",
      "Since his arrival at Genk in January 2023, Arokodare has amassed 40 goals in 108 appearances, along with 12 assists. And after taking some time to find his feet in the Pro League, he now looks like an asset capable of completing another step up in his career.",
      "Only Sint-Truiden forward Adriano Bertaccini matched Arokodare for goals scored this season. However, Genk's leading man pipped his peer to the Pro League's Golden Boot after racking up more assists.",
      "Amorim is clear in his mission to improve United's array of attacking options after a dismal 2024/25 campaign up front. The 44 goals scored marked the club's lowest goal tally in the Premier League era, not to mention their worst finish on record after placing 15th.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund failed to inspire as United's go-to frontman and looked out of his depth at times despite showing promise in the past. And Joshua Zirkzee, who arrived from Bologna for £36.5million last summer, had a stuttering debut season before his campaign was effectively ended by injury in April.",
      "The arrival of Cunha and possibly Mbeumo strengthens their depth in attack, but Arokodare would present a different presence altogether. The relative unknown boasts a surprising turn of pace considering he stands at 6'5\" tall and would offer Amorim a more traditional target man capable of imposing himself on opposition defences.",
      "That being said, Arokodare also veers from the standard hold-up play in that he likes to drop into the wider channels to open up space for his team-mates. And it appears that if United like what they see, he'd do his bit to make the move happen.",

      "Gyokeres wants to test himself in one of Europe's biggest leagues, but hasn't found clubs rushing to knock down his door. Sporting insist they've not had any offer put their way, while club president Frederico Varandas has accused the player's agent of falsely claiming the club would accept £59million to sell the player as part of a 'gentleman's agreement'.",

      "“I think they knew he was a good player, maybe not to the degree that he’s performed this past season,” said Sheringham, speaking to Racing Tipster. “But let’s have a look at his attitude, his leadership qualities, the way he plays the game and the way he carries himself.",
      "“I thought these qualities were obvious for United and for Scotland. Every time he pulled on the Scotland shirt, you could tell he was a leader - and United fans loved him. He has that British mentality where he knows and understands what it means to play for United, to represent his country and all that.",
      "“The issue with what United did, for me, is that you’ve got to read the signs. They should have rated his leadership qualities, and all the things he brought to the table.",
      "“Okay, I understand that to go and be the player of the year in Italy last season is phenomenal. But the signs were there that he was capable of that. It’s exactly what United have been missing at the moment. He leads by example, and that’s how football clubs get better and stronger.”",

      "Malacia joins Antony, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho in being yet to secure an exit from Old Trafford. The full-back spent the second half of 2024/25 on loan at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "The 25-year-old was the first player to arrive at the club under Erik ten Hag in 2022. After making 39 appearances in his first season with United, Malacia failed to make a single outing in an injury-hit second year and made three Premier League showings before making the move to PSV last term.",

United welcome Mikel Arteta's side – runners'-up in the Premier League last season – at Old Trafford for their opening fixture of the new league campaign .",
      "But United legend Sheringham, who helped the Red Devils to their historic Treble triumph of 1999, fears they could lose by as much as 4-0 to the Gunners, who will be pushing for the title after falling short the past two seasons. Sheringham fears a humiliating loss for Amorim's side on the opening weekend will see the United boss come under immediate pressure and suggested it may be hard for him to turn the situation around.",
      "“United are signing players and getting ready for a much different season this year than last year, but they must have those concerns on their mind at the moment,” said Sheringham. “More so than what Arsenal have on their minds.",
      "“It really is a horrible game for them to start the season. If the result is bad, if the scoreline is bad, things can escalate very quickly over there.",
      "“Everyone’s talking about Arsenal having a big, tough start to the season. First six or seven games, they look really tough. But I think when the fixtures came out, it was United who looked at them and said 'Oh no, Arsenal at home in the first game'.",
      "“You can imagine Arsenal coming up there with all the confidence, all the intent right now. They’ve got the momentum, a good squad. United are still figuring it out under Amorim.",
      "“If Arsenal go up there and roll United over and if they’re comfortable, get an early goal, a second before half-time, maybe even a third or fourth in the second half?",
      "“Arsenal are usually really strong at the start of the season. You’re more likely to get a result if it’s later on and they’re looking over their shoulder a little bit. It’s only one game, but if Arsenal really roll them over, United fans are going to be putting the pressure on Amorim from the get-go.”",
      "Sheringham also said United striker Marcus Rashford is making a big mistake by holding out for a summer move to Barcelona.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, after falling out with Amorim, but Sheringham said going to Barca would send out the wrong message to United and their fans.",
      "“I certainly hope he isn’t,” said Sheringham, speaking to Racing Tipster. “A few years ago, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was seen as the bad apple at Arsenal. Arteta wanted him out and he ended up going to Barcelona. What a move that is, for a bad apple!",
      "“For Rashford to not want to play at United, telling people after he signed a mega-deal that he doesn’t want to play for them, and yet he’s happy to pick up the money. Now he wants to go to Barcelona? It’s like, 'oof!'.",
      "“I really hope it doesn’t happen. That’s not the way football careers should work, for me. If you’re playing well, okay, look at where you can go. See if you can get a move to a team like Barcelona. Try and make yourself even better.",
      "“But not for downing tools and demanding that you get to go somewhere that’s debatably better than how you’re currently playing. That just doesn’t sit well with me. I don’t think Rashford could say that he has played his way into a move to the Camp Nou over the last few years.”",

      "Sporting Lisbon players went from celebrating a vital victory to bursting into tears when Ruben Amorim told them he would be leaving to join Manchester United. Amorim, 40, was appointed as manager of the Red Devils at the start of November, but did not officially start at Old Trafford until 11 days later.",
      "He left a squad who were on their way to their third Primeira Liga title in five seasons and looked set to finish in the top eight of the Champions League division phase. He also said goodbye to a group of players who loved him as a manager and mentor.",
      "This was confirmed by their emotional reaction when he told them he was going to Old Trafford. Sporting star Geny Catamo revealed a huge number of players burst into tears when Amorim informed them of his decision.",
      "In an interview with Bar Da Liga, the Mozambique international said: \"A week before, we were informed Manchester United was interested in our manager. Ruben Amorim only told us that everything was fine and not to worry, we just had to focus on our game in Braga.",
      "\"It was an epic match; losing 2-0 and turning it around to 4-2 in the second half. It was the best football we played all season.",
      "\"We were all celebrating in the locker room when he came in and announced he was indeed going to Manchester United. We were sad and cried. Most players cried. I believe I was one of those who cried the most that day.\"",
      "United forked out £11million to release Amorim from his contract at Sporting. When the news was announced, he remained with the Portuguese side to oversee clashes against Estrela, Manchester City in the Champions League and Braga.",
      "He would go on to mastermind convincing victories in all three matches, that ended 5-1, 4-1 and 4-2 in Sporting's favour. However, while the Sporting stars were devastated to see him leave, Amorim has not formed the same bond with his United players.",
      "In fact, the mood at Old Trafford has been the complete opposite, as United have not improved under his stewardship so far. After taking over from Erik ten Hag, Amorim was only able to guide United to 15th, their lowest position in Premier League history.",
      "Their loss to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final also meant United failed to qualify for European football for the first time since the 2014/15 campaign. While Sporting players were heartbroken when Amorim left, the current crop of United players do not have that same affection for the Portuguese boss, yet.",
      "One of Amorim's first major decisions at Old Trafford was to banish academy graduate Marcus Rashford, by leaving him out of the squad on several occasions before sending him on loan to Aston Villa in the January transfer window. In February, the Mail claimed several United players discussed whether Amorim should change his tactics, with the Portuguese boss insisting on using the same 3-4-3 formation he used at Sporting, for better or for worse.",
      "Moreover, Alejandro Garnacho also looks set to meet the same fate as Rashford. The Argentine winger publicly criticised Amorim after he was left out of the starting eleven for the Europa League final.",
      "Not long after reportedly being told to find a new club by the United boss, Garnacho was recently pictured wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Rashford's name on the back. He has since been linked with moves to Chelsea and Napoli.",

      "With Manchester United edging closer towards wrapping up the signing of Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo, Ruben Amorim's attack is continuing to take shape.",
      "After recording a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League last season, United had to prioritise strengthening their attack this summer, and they have done exactly that.",
      "Matheus Cunha arrived from Wolves just over a fortnight ago for a fee of £62.5million and Mbeumo is poised to arrive at Old Trafford for a relatively similar fee after United tabled an offer in excess of £60m earlier this week.",
      "In doing so, United are on the cusp of adding two attackers to their ranks that scored a combined 35 Premier League goals last season. It means they will immediately slot into Amorim's first-choice starting XI.",
      "Cunha is a specialist No.10, well-versed from playing in that role from his time at Molineux, meaning he is expected to operate in the left-sided No.10 berth in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Mbeumo is increasingly likely to operate as the right-sided No.10 amid his tendency to drift inside from the right flank and make things happen on his trustworthy left foot.",
      "United immediately transitioned to a 3-4-2-1 shape under Amorim last November, meaning it was a completely different dynamic to what the players had previously been used to under Erik ten Hag. The unique nature of it requires specialists to play in certain positions.",
      "Arguably the most demanding role within Amorim's system is the wing-back berth. It requires athleticism and confidence to be comfortable both defensively and offensively.",
      "United swooped for Patrick Dorgu in January, signing him from Lecce, and he is a specialist wing-back. Despite being signed to play on the left, he made his United debut from the right, highlighting his versatility.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are cut from a similar cloth. They are both versatile operators, capable of operating out wide, as No.10s or as a centre-forward, though the two No.10 berths look as though they will be their preferred positions in Amorim's system.",
      "Nevertheless, signing players who are adaptable and comfortable in playing more than one position can only be considered as a positive. United chief executive Omar Berrada threw his weight of support behind Amorim's idea for wanting to sign versatile players.",
      "\"Ruben himself has said it, it's not about the 3-4-3 tactical formation, it's about an idea, a concept of how he wants to see the team playing,\" said Berrada. \"He wants to see the team playing more on the front foot, more of a possession, attacking-based style of football.",
      "\"So for that, you need players that can play in multiple positions that can adapt to that vision that Ruben has. And this is what we're going try to do over the next years in in our recruitment.\"",
      "After signing Dorgu, who can play on either flank or on the left of the back-three, in the January window, and now attempting to add Mbeumo to the signing of Cunha, United's hierarchy are showing they are fully committed to Amorim's philosophy.",
      "It has become increasingly important for clubs to recruit multi-functional operators, and that is something United have failed to do far too often in recent years. However, under Amorim, that is changing."

      "Should United add Mbeumo to Ruben Amorim's pool of attacking options, he will become their second statement signing of the summer. Between them, Cunha and Mbeumo got 35 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "United scored just 44 league goals as a collective last term and they remain hungry to sign an out-and-out striker.",
      "With the start of the new Premier League season now less than 50 days away, it will be here before we know it, meaning United will be determined to finalise their squad ahead of the big kick-off. It means plenty of work is still to be done, particularly in the attacking department.",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport has had a look at what United need to do between now the start of the campaign to try and assemble an ideal pool of attacking options for Amorim.",
      "With Cunha already signed, Mbeumo is expected to be the next new face through the door. United are closing in on his signature and it feels as though it will only be a matter of time before he arrives at Old Trafford.",
      "Once Mbeumo is through the door, focus must switch to signing a No.9. After missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen who United will turn to in their search for a goal-getter.",
      "They desperately need a proven and reliable goalscorer this summer, meaning ongoing links with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen make perfect sense. Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike is also under consideration.",
      "However, United do not have unlimited funds available, meaning sales are set to dictate what is achievable. They also want to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer.",
      "Rashford is valued at £40m, Antony is available for £32.58m and Sancho is valued at somewhere in the region of £20m-£25m. Offloading each of them, however, is already shaping up to be an easier-said-than-done task, particularly in the cases of Rashford and Sancho due to their salary demands.",
      "Fellow winger Alejandro Garnacho is also expected to leave after United informed him last month he will be sold if they receive an acceptable offer. Napoli had a bid of £40m turned down for the Argentine in January, meaning somewhere north of £50m is likely to be United's valuation of the 20-year-old.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has attracted interest from Inter Milan and has most recently been linked with Napoli. Hojlund regressed in his second season at Old Trafford, scoring just ten goals, and he could be moved on to free up vital funds.",
      "If United oversee the aforementioned incomings and outgoings, their attack will have a more rounded and healthier look to it. Cunha is a natural fit for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and Mbeumo is versatile enough to operate as the right-sided No.10, the right wing-back or as the centre-forward.",
      "The addition of a striker, whoever it proves to be, is a necessity, and the chosen candidate will be installed as the club's starting No.9. Competition would come from Mbeumo (if signed), possibly Cunha, who can operate as a striker, and Chido Obi.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, he is an option to play as one of the two No.10s, likewise Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Cunha, Mbeumo and Amad, meaning Amorim will not be short of options.",
      "No.10s: Amad, Mbeumo, Mount, Mainoo, Fernandes, Cunha, Zirkzee.",

      "It is easy to understand why Manchester United were attracted to Liam Delap ahead of the start of this summer's transfer window.",
      "The England Under-21 international was available via a £30million release clause this summer after his first season at Ipswich Town ended in relegation to the Championship.",
      "After joining the Tractor Boys from Manchester City last summer, a £30m release clause was inserted into his contract that would become active if the Suffolk club were to fail to preserve its Premier League status.",
      "Winning just four league games all season, Kieran Mckenna's men had next to no chance of beating the drop. Delap, however, produced some eye-catching moments by plundering 12 Premier League goals in his first season as a regular starter at this level.",
      "As a result, clubs were attracted to him and held discussions about signing him. Despite the best efforts of United, Everton and Newcastle United, Delap chose Chelsea, saying their project was what convinced him to move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "It means United are now having to explore alternative avenues in their search for a No.9. United struggled for goals last season and desperately need to add a focal point to the tip of their attack that can find the back of the net on a regular basis.",
      "The club has already shown plenty of ambition in their efforts to beef up their attacking options, signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and attempting to get a deal over the line for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. The addition of an out-and-out centre-forward, though, remains vital.",
      "United have been linked with a plethora of strikers in recent weeks, both domestically and abroad, but their financial situation will dictate who is a realistic target. At £30m, Delap was an enterprising option, but the Reds would have once again been gambling on potential in their search for a goal-getter.",
      "As respectable as Delap's haul of 12 goals was last season, he is not the finished product. United need somebody who has proven they are a reliable goalscorer over several seasons.",
      "When analysing which of the Premier League's centre-forwards from last season reached double figures, they were all north of 22-years-old with the exception of Delap. Brighton & Hove Albion's Joao Pedro and Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson were the only strikers to reach double figures in the Premier League that were as young as 23.",
      "Of the 13 recognised strikers that got into double figures for Premier League goals in 2024/25, nine of them were 25 or older. It has been a similar theme in recent seasons, too, highlighting that more experienced strikers find it easier to score goals in the Premier League in comparison to youngsters who are trying to make the grade.",
      "Of course, Manchester City's Erling Haaland is an exception to the rule, scoring 36 times in his debut Premier League campaign at the age of 22 in 2022/23, but the Norwegian is in a league of his own. His freakish record is unlike anything many of us have seen before.",
      "In the sense that Delap would have been an easy target to obtain and sign relatively quickly had others not stuck their nose in, missing out on him is a blow for United, as they have been left trying to solve a search with currently no obvious answer.",
      "However, he was not the striker they needed at this particular juncture, with the club gambling on potential two years ago in the form of Rasmus Hojlund. Signing a striker that little bit older and more experienced is the way forward this summer.",
      "For example, Yoane Wissa (28), Ollie Watkins (29) and Chris Wood (33) were three of the top five scoring strikers in the Premier League last term. United should be attempting to sign someone around the age of 26 or 27 who is about to enter their prime years.",
      "Of course, signing a striker of that profile is going to set United back in terms of spending, but they knew ahead of this summer's transfer window they would have to loosen the purse strings in search of attacking reinforcements.",
      "Any transfer has the capacity to fail or succeed, meaning nothing is a guarantee. But United's Premier League counterparts have proven they will be wiser going for a more experienced goal-getter."

      "After seeing an opening offer of £55m knocked back earlier this month, United submitted a new and improved offer in excess of £60m for the Cameroonian earlier this week.",
      "Barring any late snags or hitches, the 25-year-old, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, is on course to become their second signing of the summer. Between them, him and Cunha scored 35 league goals in 2024/25.",
      "After seeing their opening offer for Mbeumo rejected, United anticipated they would have to pay a similar fee to the one they did for Cunha. It means that if they get the Mbeumo deal over the line, their spending will go through the £120m mark.",
      "As a result of missing out on European football, United's budget for transfers this summer is not as big as what it would have been had they won the Europa League final. No European football means United are missing out on a minimum of four home games that would have improved cashflow via various matchday revenue streams.",
      "It means more strain will be put on the finances heading into the new financial year. Their latest financial results for the first three months of 2025 revealed a more encouraging picture, despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe, earlier this year, suggesting the club was on course to run out of money by Christmas.",
      "United have slashed their workforce over the last 12 months or so, with around 450 staff being made redundant. As a result, United, earlier this month, played down concerns about breaching UEFA's FFP rules and the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "The end of the 2024/25 financial year for Premier League clubs is Monday, meaning some sides will be under pressure to balance their books. United, however, are not in a position where they are under immediate threat.",
      "An improved start to this calendar year means the club have increased its expected revenue for the financial year ending June 2025 from £660m to £670m. Additionally, United's net cash inflow of £22.3m during the last quarter was an increase of £7.2m from the same quarter last year, highlighting how funds have been freed up.",
      "United know they need to sell players this summer to bring in funds and strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad, and the likes of Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony have been earmarked as priority sales. Alejandro Garnacho is also available at the right price.",
      "If United bank the fees they are looking for for the aforementioned quartet, they will secure somewhere in the region of £150m. No exits are understood to be in the pipeline ahead of Monday, meaning the prospect of them all being sold would see the funds generated from their departures go into the next PSR cycle.",
      "United are understood to want to try and sign Mbeumo ahead of the June 30 deadline and that means the clock is ticking to get the deal over the line. Formally completing a transfer requires various steps and agreements to be put in place and the Brentford attacker is yet to have had a medical.",
      "Ideally, United would like to get him signed and sealed before the end of the Premier League's financial year, but failing to do so would not necessarily be disastrous.",
      "If anything, United's preference to get him in the building ahead of the June 30 deadline highlights they have room to manoeuvre and are not on the brink of landing themselves in hot water with the governing body."

      "Inter are keen on a summer deal for Hojlund and have been in talks with United over agreeing a possible move.",
      "However, United want £40million for the Dane and Inter want a loan deal with an option to make the deal permanent.",
      "After United rejected that approach, Inter decided to offer Taremi to Ruben Amorim's side and got a negative response.",
      "Brentford have confirmed that Keith Andrews has been appointed as their new head coach, as the wait goes on for Bryan Mbeumo's move to Manchester United.",
      "\"Keith is a very good fit,\" said director of football Phil Giles. \"He gets on with everyone, he's very open and he's a learner. Keith is clear in what he wants, he's detailed, and the players and staff like and respect him.",
      "\"He understands the players in the building and the way we've played and trained under Thomas Frank. Keith will bring his own evolution but isn’t starting from scratch, so hopefully we can make some quick progress.\"",
      "Manchester United have made an 'offer' for Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo, according to reports in Spain.",

      "Juve are the 'most advanced' club right now, but no one has yet done enough to tempt Barcelona to 'open the door' to his exit, with the minimum price set at around £34million.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has put Manchester United into pole position for his signature after making a U-turn on a move to Arsenal, according to the Mirror.",
      "The Sporting CP forward scored 54 goals and added 13 assists in 52 matches last season and turned down a move to Juventus and Saudi Arabia last month.",

      "Real Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo has delivered an update on the club's pursuit of another move for Manchester United forward Antony, following his successful loan spell last season.",
      "Fajardo said, via Estadio Deportivo: \"We all have to be aware that this is a very complex operation. Given the player’s level and his recent career at Real Betis, it’s not an easy transaction.",
      "\"But, as long as Antony hasn’t committed to a third party, we, with the utmost humility, will play our cards to be able to opt for Antony. I insist, despite this being a complex operation, we will try to carry it out in different ways without compromising the club.",
      "\"In the end, the most important thing is also the sustainability of the club. We will try to be creative, as we have been in the past, so that Antony can be here. Today, the market is open, as I said before, it’s very dynamic, and we are part of that game.\"",

      "It's added that while United are prepared to make a £34.1m bid for Carnsecchi, Atalanta want between £38.4m and £42.6m to sanction the 24-year-old's exit in the summer transfer window.",
      "As well as Carnesecchi, it appears that United remain keen on a deal for long-term target Ederson. The Reds have asked for more information on the Brazilian's situation at Old Trafford.",
      "It is easy to understand why Manchester United were attracted to Liam Delap ahead of the start of this summer's transfer window.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing up a move for Fiorentina striker Moise Kean, who has a £44.5million release clause in his contract. The Reds are said to be keen on bolstering their attacking options and have identified the 25-year-old as a potential target.",
      "According to Italian publication La Gazzetta dello Sport, Kean's release clause becomes active between July 1 and 15. This means that despite having four years left on his deal, Fiorentina would be obliged to let him go if another club activates the clause during this short window.",

      "A host of clubs have been linked with signing Rashford this summer, whether that be on a permanent basis or on loan.",
      "Read more here",

      "England star Marcus Rashford has shown how the power of football can help communities in Manchester in recent years, and Football for Foodbanks is doing just that by continuing to make a huge difference in the lives of thousands.",
      "Originally founded in Sheffield in 2020, creator Matty Cassell began hosting friendly, casual football games with the idea of donating the excess from playing fees to local foodbanks. The initiative took Sheffield by storm and was brought to Manchester the following year.",
      "It was also five years ago that Rashford became an ambassador for FareShare, helping fight hunger in the nation’s most vulnerable communities at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "\"He’s a great example of how football can make a huge difference off the pitch. It will be a real milestone moment for us when we get to the point where massive clubs are interested in supporting and working with us.”",
      "Football for Foodbanks was formed in response to the need for inclusive football games that welcome players of all abilities and backgrounds.",
      "Adam explained: \"There was a huge gap for casual games of football that can accommodate all abilities and anyone who wants to play. We do not mind that you have a dodgy knee, have never kicked a ball before, or are feeling a bit old these days.",
      "\"We are proud to provide the space where you are welcome to play. We won’t charge more than £4 per player as we want to make sure that our games are always accessible and affordable for all. This does mean that many of the pitches in Manchester are out of our price range, and we’d risk running at a loss if we didn’t fill the pitch every week.",
      "\"As a result, we are reliant on the generosity of our current venues offering special rates for community-focused organisations, allowing us to make the money that goes on to make the difference for those who need it. Not every pitch offers such rates, so it’s a real sign that a particular venue cares about being part of the community, and it’s something we’d like to see more of, as our organisation is an example of bringing that to life.\"",
      "In Manchester, the organisation hosts three men's games each week, along with one game specifically for women and gender minorities. \"The games are at different times on different days to try and accommodate as many different lifestyles as possible,\" Adam stated.",
      "\"Mens currently play Mondays at 8:00pm at the Manchester Academy High School and on Tuesdays, the game is played at Burnage Rugby & Football Club at 9pm. On Wednesdays, men's, women & gender minorities play two games at The Energy Box at 7pm.\"",
      "If you're based in Manchester and want to take part, it's simple to get started. \"We have two Facebook groups – one for our Men’s Division, and one for our Women and Gender Minorities Division,\" he detailed.",
      "\"We love giving everyone a chance to get involved, so our players can join whichever group they feel comfortable playing with. Sign-up posts go live at 6pm two days before each game, and spaces are allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis depending on pitch size.",
      "\"On the day, turn up and pay your £4 fee, and we’ll take care of the rest. Once a month, we do a big shop where around 70% of the money left over after paying for the pitch gets used to buy food, toiletries and hygiene products which we then donate to foodbanks in the area.\"",
      "The organisation has seen great success, with Adam and his team running games non-stop since launching the initiative in Manchester in May 2021.",
      "\"We have put on games every week - other than a well-earned break over Christmas - since we started in Manchester, and there is no sign of slowing down,\" he revealed.",
      "The past few years have been incredibly rewarding for the organisation, and it has been difficult to choose just one standout moment among so many meaningful experiences.",
      "\"We have so many wonderful moments to choose from,\" Adam recalled. \"We have organised multiple 11-a-side friendlies against other like-minded teams in the Greater Manchester area, and when we do this we ask players to bring a bag of food rather than pay money to play.",
      "\"On one such occasion we combined the physical donations and the cash raised by one month of games, to donate over £600 to Humans MCR - their biggest donation ever, all through passive income from kicking a ball about and having a laugh.\"",
      "However, if football’s not your cup of tea, you can still support Football for Foodbanks with a donation. The organisation’s own merchandise helps raise donations which are then exchanged for food.",
      "A total of 15 foodbanks are supported by the organisation. They are proud to support Clay Cross Foodbank, Chesterfield Foodbank, Derbyshire Community Hub, MK Foodbank, Emmeline’s Pantry, Perry’s Pantry Foodbank, Little Bundles, Humans MCR, Manchester South Central Foodbank, The S2 Foodbank Network, Grace Foodbank, Burngreave Foodbank, Baby Basics, Stannington Foodbank and Sheffield S6 Foodbank.",
      "In addition to Manchester, the organisation operates in Chesterfield, Rotherham, Milton Keynes, and Northampton. If there isn’t a location near you, you can still choose to donate directly to your local foodbank.",
      "\"If you want to support your local foodbank, contact them directly - many of them have direct donation options and are able to claim Gift Aid to boost your donation even further,\" Adam encouraged.",
      "While community support remains strong week in and week out, Football for Foodbanks is still in need of sponsorship. “We have been successful in some small funding applications over the years to enable us to build a website.",
      "\"We have had some very generous players over the years that have helped fund trophies, kits, or donated their time to referee our organised games, but we have not had formal sponsorship up to now.”",
      "If you're interested in becoming a sponsor, you can get in touch via hello@footballforfoodbanks.com."

      "You can probably count on one hand the amount of times Manchester United have produced a performance that has left you on the edge of your seat in the last few years.",
      "United were often renowned as the most entertaining and exciting team to watch during their heyday under Sir Alex Ferguson, but those memories have become more and more distant.",
      "The Reds were so poor last season that they limped their way to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League. Had the three relegated clubs been any better, United might not have been so lucky.",
      "Under both Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim, United were rarely exciting to watch. Their performances were often slow, laboured and uninspiring.",
      "The challenge for Amorim, with the bonus of a full pre-season to come, is to turn United into an entertaining and vibrant team to watch again. Every team, regardless of what level they play at, aspire to be pleasing on-the-eye, but it is rarely that straightforward.",
      "United's inability to be vibrant and energetic in recent years has often stemmed from a lack of energy and athleticism in the team. However, they are in the process of reinstating those particular qualities this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha, a Brazilian international, has arrived from Wolves for £62.5million and Bryan Mbeumo is very close to completing a move from Brentford for a fee in excess of £60m.",
      "The duo were among the best players in the Premier League last season, scoring 35 goals between them. They also chalked up 13 assists, meaning they had a direct hand in 48 goals.",
      "Cunha, 26, completed his move to Old Trafford earlier this month and is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. Mbeumo is highly likely to be deployed as the right-sided No.10.",
      "Both players are renowned for their speed, trickery, energy, creativity and scoring goals. On paper, they are exactly the type of players United have been missing.",
      "Supporters flock to Old Trafford week-in, week-out with the thirst of being entertained. Instead, United fans have often left M16 uninspired in recent years.",
      "Although football has evolved in recent years, with players rarely taking as many risks as they used to, the appetite for entertainment from the stands hasn't wained. Fans love nothing more than seeing a player beat his man and score a goal.",
      "The element of entertainment, however, has been lost on United too often in recent years. But as director of football Jason Wilcox declared when summarising the addition of Cunha earlier this month, it is the club's ambition to become a vibrant and exciting team to watch again.",
      "Wilcox said of Cunha: \"He has all the qualities we are looking for as we seek to build a strong, dynamic and entertaining team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\"",
      "Many United supporters accept the club is still a few years away of being capable of mounting a genuine title charge, but they still want to see a level of improvement in terms of the entertainment on offer at Old Trafford.",
      "There are no guarantees the addition of Cunha and the expected arrival of Mbeumo will be successes in M16, just as there is no guarantee Amorim will be a long-term success, but United are most definitely signing players of the right ilk to achieve the ambition laid out by Wilcox.",
      "Cunha was one of the most entertaining players to watch in the Premier League last term, often bringing energy and excitement to the table, while Mbeumo's tally of 20 goals tells you everything you need to know about him.",
      "Amid Wilcox's admission about wanting United to create a \"strong, dynamic and entertaining team\", United are certainly shopping in the right market to acquire the right tools to bring their vision to life. Mbeumo is an excellent player, who regularly attempts to take a game by the scruff on the neck and make something happen.",
      "It is players of his ilk, who are renowned for scoring goals and bringing a sense of excitement to the table, that will help United fulfil their ambition for the season ahead."

      "However, Amorim is keen to sign a new midfielder, too, to bring competition for the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Links to who that midfielder may be have been few and far between but talk of a move for teenage midfielder Warren Zaire-Emery has tentatively emerged this week.",
      "The 19-year-old is already a France international and a serial trophy-winner with PSG, and first came to the attention of English football fans with an excellent performance against Newcastle United in the Champions League back in 2023 when he was just 17.",
      "Despite Les Parisiens losing the game at St James' Park, Zaire-Emery stood out as one of the best players on the pitch.",
      "He caught the eye of former Arsenal and Barcelona forward Thierry Henry that evening, while he was working as a pundit for CBS Sports, and he later made him the captain of France Under-21s while he was manager.",
      "\"The way Warren Zaire-Emery is playing, it is normal to run the show at just 17 years old,\" Henry said.",
      "\"He was the only one that held his ground at St James’ Park. He’s been magnificent… the sky is the limit. I have never seen a player that young being so mature.",
      "\"Usually, you have youngsters that play as forwards that make the difference. But when you play in midfield for a team like PSG, you need to readjust. It is rare to see such a young player in that position.",
      "\"I gave him the armband (as France U21s boss) because I wanted to see the next thing.",
      "\"I know that physically he is strong, he can run, he can see a pass, he can stop a counter. I want to know if he can also stop a player by talking.",
      "\"I gave him the armband to know if he could direct the team and talk. That was my way of seeing if he could do that, and trust me, he can. This guy has no limits.\"",
      "Still a teenager, Zaire-Emery's ceiling is extremely high but he has found himself below Portuguese duo Joao Neves and Vitinha in the midfield pecking order.",
      "He still made 51 appearances across the course of the 2024/25 season but he was afforded just six minutes in the Champions League final win over Inter Milan.",
      "As such, this summer could be the ideal time to ask about his situation, but while he may not be an automatic starter he still has four years left on his deal and any move won't come cheap.",
      "Reports in France have suggested he will be available for around £85million this summer and while United don't have an endless pot of money to spend, the upside of signing a player of Zaire-Emery's profile may make it a deal worth pursuing."

      "Manchester United's summer transfer business is starting to ramp back up following a positive start to the window. Ruben Amorim's side got a deal done on June 1, as Matheus Cunha made the £62.5million move from Wolves.",
      "Shortly after, Bryan Mbeumo expressed his desire to move to Old Trafford despite interest from Newcastle United and Tottenham. A move for the Brentford man has been rumbling along for the entire month, but now it appears that United are closing in on securing Mbeumo's signature, with a £60m swoop all-but done.",
      "Young left-back Diego Leon is also set to join the club from Cerro Porteño for a fee of £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons. Work is still to be done though, with Amorim aiming for significant improvement following the disappointment of the last campaign.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has put Manchester United into pole position for his signature after making a U-turn on a move to Arsenal, according to the Daily Mirror.",
      "The Sporting CP forward scored 54 goals and added 13 assists in 52 matches last season and turned down a move to Juventus and Saudi Arabia last month.",
      "With the Gunners expected to target Benjamin Sesko, Gyokeres is now prepared to reunite with former Sporting head coach Ruben Amorim, and his representatives have made contact.",
      "MEN says: I think Viktor Gyokeres would be perfect for Manchester United. He has worked with Ruben Amorim before, having spent 18 months together at Sporting, and I feel he can fit straight into his 3-4-2-1 formation at Old Trafford, leading the line and firing United back up the table.",
      "United should attempt to get Rasmus Hojlund off the books, sell him for £40m and reinvest that into signing Gyokeres, even if Sporting want £60m for the 27-year-old.",
      "Manchester United are 'ready to submit an offer of £34.1million' for Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi and have 'asked for information' on one of his teammates, according to Calcio Mercato.",
      "Carnesecchi impressed for Atalanta last season, keeping 18 clean sheets in all competitions, and could be available for transfer after the departure of Gian Piero Gasperini as head coach.",
      "It's added that while United are prepared to make a £34.1m bid for Carnsecchi, Atalanta want between £38.4m and £42.6m to sanction the 24-year-old's exit in the summer transfer window.",
      "As well as Carnesecchi, it appears that United remain keen on a deal for long-term target Ederson. The Reds have asked for more information on the Brazilian's situation at Old Trafford.",
      "MEN says: Again, I think Marco Carnesecchi would suit Manchester United down to the ground. It's clear that Andre Onana is not good enough to be United's first-choice goalkeeper following his arrival under Erik ten Hag and therefore another one is needed.",
      "They would do no wrong by looking into a move for Carnesecchi, who has been excellent for Atalanta. He has age on his side as well, as he is only 24 and has years ahead of him to improve and develop."

      "Both are looking to bounce back under a new manager (or relatively new, in United's case), yet it is Spurs who can offer Champions League football next season while United's campaign will be restricted to domestic matters.",

      "Ten Hag was given freedom to splash the cash in the market and that meant a whole host of outgoings would be necessary. But one exit really irked the former United boss.",
      "\"I’m very happy for Scott (McTominay). As I said, when he left, I didn’t want this but that’s the rules the club had to deal with. The rules are, I would even say, bad, but that’s the situation created. It forced us to make this decision,\" Ten Hag said last season.",
      "The £25m United sold McTominay to Napoli for was a solid fee given it went down as pure profit under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. United were in the market for a combative midfielder, with Manuel Ugarte arriving in an initial £42.3m deal, and so room had to be made in the squad, meaning McTominay was shipped out.",
      "McTominay enjoyed a great first campaign in Naples, scoring 13 goals in all competitions as Napoli were crowned Serie A champions. That being said, his 13-goal haul wasn't too dissimilar to the 10 he managed in his final season at United, and so it would be wrong to suggest he's suddenly turned into a different player away from United.",
      "Serie A has become something of a dumping ground for Premier League players in recent years, and it's something United should be looking to take advantage of in the coming months.",
      "Napoli tabled a bid for Alejandro Garnacho in January and there's a chance they could enter discussions over the player again this summer. Jadon Sancho is also rumoured to be on the Serie A champions' wishlist, with Juventus another potential destination for Sancho.",
      "Ten Hag might not have approved of United's sale of McTominay to Napoli last summer, but when they need to raise funds via sales to buy the players they need for Ruben Amorim's system, doing business with Serie A teams would help them get to where they want to be."

      "Meanwhile, Barcelona are reportedly working on a deal to sign Athletic Bilbao sensation Nico Williams. On Thursday, Bilbao issued a statement addressing Barca's interest while highlighting La Liga rules for registering players.",
      "The Spanish giants encountered registration issues with Pau Victor and Dani Olmo earlier this year. The Catalans were granted temporary licenses to register the duo last summer but those registrations were then revoked in January after La Liga accused Barcelona of failing to prove they were compliant with the league's financial rules by their deadline of 31 December.",
      "Still under financial constraints, Barcelona must comply with the ‘1:1 rule’ and are only able to spend as much as their income and accounts allow, governed by LaLiga, which calculates a limit.",
      "Amid Barcelona's public courting of Williams this summer, Athletic sought a meeting with La Liga for clarity over Barcelona's current position and have now released a statement following the talks.",
      "A statement released by Bilbao, read: \"The club appreciates the willingness and clarity of the organisation that defends the interests of all clubs. Within the framework of financial fair play, among other issues, FC Barcelona's ability to recruit players was discussed.",
      "\"Athletic Club would like to thank LaLiga de Futbol Profesional for the willingness and clarity shown at the meeting held yesterday between the two entities, which was attended by the presidents of both organisations, Javier Tebas and Jon Uriarte.",
      "\"The meeting was held in Madrid in response to a request from Athletic Club made within the framework of compliance with financial fair play. Among the topics discussed was FC Barcelona's ability to sign players, given Athletic Club's legitimate interest in accessing the relevant information, after FC Barcelona sporting director Deco publicly acknowledged that they will try to sign a player from our first team.",
      "\"This player has a contract with Athletic Club until June 30, 2027. Minding our own business means ensuring that the rules of the competition are followed. Deco’s statements add to the public statements made by FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta himself, admitting that the Blaugrana club “is working to be within the 1:1 rule” and that, therefore, it is not currently within the parameters of said rule for registering players.",
      "\"We appreciate LaLiga's complete willingness and clarity in its qualified response, and we affirm that Athletic Club will defend its interests to the fullest extent in compliance with the financial fair play regulations approved by each and every one of the professional clubs that make up LaLiga.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Barca president Joan Laporta insisted there would be no issues for the club in registering new players. \"We can sign players normally and are within the 1:1 [rule],\" he said. \"We are about to make an imminent signing and are working on another signing. We currently have a flexible relationship with La Liga, I believe we will be able to announce new signings soon.\"",
      "However, should player registration prove to be an issue, Barca will likely be unable to make further additions to their squad - despite their interest in Rashford. The Blaugrana manager Hansi Flick reputedly views Rashford's versatility as a valuable asset, making him an attractive option to pair with Williams, although this latest update suggests any move may well have to be on pause, for now at least."

      "\"It was one of those moments when I felt most valued. I felt the confidence he placed in me. We needed to feel confident, and Ruben conveyed it very positively and encouragingly. I felt I just had to respond by giving my best.\"",
      "Having thrived since his switch to wing-back under Amorim, he proudly summed up his joy in representing a club of Sporting's stature in football. \"It's a pride to realise that many people have this passion for me, especially Sporting fans,\" he said.",
      "\"And I say this because I think they also feel what I feel when representing Sporting. I have a huge passion for Sporting. Pride for the club, the fans, the squad, the staff, everything that happens within Sporting.",
      "\"They are good people who take care of our comfort, transmit good energies, and make us wake up every day wanting to train and play. When I arrive at Sporting, I know there are genuine people waiting for me with whom I'll share my life throughout an entire season.\"",
      "Although his stellar performances have reportedly caught the eye of clubs like Aston Villa, Newcastle United, and Arsenal, Catamo insists he's not entertaining thoughts of a transfer until after his holiday, following a successful title-defending campaign.",
      "\"I don't like reading news about transfers, interest, approaches, whatever it may be,\" he added. \"It doesn't matter if it's good or bad news; I don't want anyone telling me anything. I've told my agents, 'Your job is to handle these things. At the end of the holidays, update me on everything.'",
      "\"I want to focus on work, games, and achieving our goals. My mind isn't even thinking about offers. I'm on holiday in Mozambique, resting with family. If my agents have something to say, they'll have to wait until I'm back in Portugal.\""

      "10) Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal) – Undisclosed\nCards on the table, we have no idea what Lewis-Skelly is on. What is for sure is that he’s among the highest-paid teenagers in the world. His new five-year contract is almost certainly worth somewhere between £25,000 and £100,000 per week. If we were to guess (and it’s nothing more than a guess), we’d say he’s taking home £50,000 a week. That’s more than £2.5m annually.",
      "MORE: The Famous F365 Friday Quiz: Wonderkids edition…",
      "",
      "=8) Marc Guiu (Chelsea) – £50,000 p/w\nThe most baffling inclusion in this teenage rich list. Chelsea were obviously willing to offer Guiu big money due to his low transfer fee (€6million) and the fact he’s tied down until 2029.",
      "",
      "=8) Oscar Bobb (Manchester City) – £50,000 p/w\nWe reckon Bobb is just about more deserving of his hefty wage, but his City future is uncertain after a lengthy injury.",

      "6) Lucas Bergvall (Tottenham Hotspur) – £65,000 p/w\nSpurs beat Barcelona to the signing of Bergvall and all of a sudden, it makes perfect sense.",
      "",
      "5) Endrick (Real Madrid) – £67,513 p/w\nBrazilian wonderkid Endrick is Real Madrid’s highest-earning teenager, taking the mantle from Arda Guler, who left his teenage years behind in February. We’re looking forward to discovering how much Franco Mastantuono is earning.",
      "",

They’re grateful to be cutting that figure down from 17 with Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen leaving for nothing.",

      "",

      "Yamal earns a base salary of £270,540 per week and a further £169,108 in bonuses, meaning he takes home £439,648 every bloody week, at the age of 17.",
      "He is under contract for seven years, meaning he’ll still be very young when it expires. It’s honestly frightening. Every single statistic about the Barcelona wonderkid makes me sick. And he could win the Ballon d’Or.",

      "Arsenal are reportedly interested in signing the Brazilian midfielder and if the Blues receive a very handsome offer they probably would sell; they have Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo, and seem to value profit over keeping very capable players.",
      "Should Santos stay at Stamford Bridge, he is guaranteed to make a positive impact. There’s a lot of football to be played next season and Chelsea will be jaded going into the campaign after the Club World Cup.",
      "He should be above Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in Enzo Maresca’s pecking order and competing with Romeo Lavia as Fernandez’s deputy. And given Lavia’s injury issues, Santos could become an important player if he isn’t flogged in the summer transfer window.",

      "It was absolutely the correct decision to keep the 19-year-old in France. In 30 Ligue 2 appearances, he scored an impressive 22 goals and helped Lorient gain promotion as champions.",
      "Kroupi is primed for another loan, probably to an English club this time, but with Enes Unal still injured and Antoine Semenyo expected to leave, there could be sufficient minutes available to justify keeping him around.",

Should they opt not to exercise that option, the 19-year-old Serbian will be ready to usurp Matty Cash as Villa’s first-choice right-back — that is, of course, assuming Emery doesn’t bring in another.",

      "He might be lightweight and yet to really prove himself in 33 Premier League appearances, but Vieira’s technical ability will always create the lingering thought that he could come good.",
      "Arsenal could’ve done with Vieira last season when Martin Odegaard was injured and then struggling in the second half of the campaign — and that lack of attacking midfield depth could be what convinces Mikel Arteta to give the Portuguese playmaker another chance.",

      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nNever going to happen, is it? But if Ruben Amorim and Rashford don’t put their differences behind them and promise to be better in their relationship, the latter is going to be leaving on loan every single summer until his contract expires. That might be more useful than ripping up his contract now, but it’s still wildly impractical for everyone involved.",
      "Rashford just needs to enjoy his football and be shown a bit of love from his manager to thrive. He looked electric at times on loan at Aston Villa last season, and United boss Amorim is actively seeking a difference-making attacker in the transfer window. You’ve got one right here, mate. Come on…kiss and make up.",

      "Last season, Fernandes was quite obviously the best player at United by some way, as he was directly involved in 19 Premier League goals during a 15th-placed season, and helped push them to the Europa League final with seven goals and four assists.",
      "This summer, he had the opportunity to head to Saudi Arabia, with Al-Hilal reportedly offering £100million for his services, but he turned it down.",

      "It is clear that United are a better side with Fernandes in, and they are fortunate that he was strong enough to turn down what was reported as a three-year contract worth around £200million.",
      "That sort of money is not likely to be offered within Europe, but if a big sum did come in from a club in the continent who are of a comfortably higher standing that United, there’s a chance the Red Devils would not have been so lucky.",
      "But whether anyone in Europe will come in with a big offer for him after he showed loyalty to United is a question in itself now, with the fact Fernandes is soon to be 31 also a potential barrier to a big move.",

      "England fans were so unimpressed by the drab win over Andorra that only two people wrote in about it – more were interested in defending Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been eviscerated in the Mailbox but there is plenty of time and space to thank Ange Postecoglou for making Spurs interesting again.",

      "12) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites… just.",
      "",
      "11) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nEven if Sesko is the man most wanted at Arsenal, the Gunners see an opportunity to get more bang for their buck with Gyokeres. The Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training next week. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres but Arsenal are working to their own timetable even if Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19.",
      "",
      "10) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nSpurs are reported to have piqued Mbeumo’s interest and the prospect of staying in London to play for a manager he trusts would certainly appeal. But now United have returned to Brentford with a second offer, how serious are Spurs about reuniting Mbeumo and Thomas Frank?",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nChelsea were linked with the Brighton striker but Newcastle always seemed most keen, which has led to a £50million offer. Brighton reportedly wanted £60million initially, but the forward has made it clear he wants to move on. We would expect the Magpies and Seagulls to find common ground soon. Pedro won’t be going to from the south coast to the North-East to play second fiddle. So what could that mean for Alexander Isak?",
      "8) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",
      "",
      "7) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nOnly the fact that United have made a second bid puts them ahead of Tottenham. We’re still waiting to see Spurs’ reaction and whether they counter – Brentford will pray they do something to prolong any bidding war. Apparently, United have been having conversations with the Bees so we have to assume they are confident this offer will suffice, but only if Daniel Levy and Thomas Frank don’t show similar intent.",
      "",
      "5) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "4) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – but Quansah won’t be heading to Germany until after he’s faced them in the European Under-21 Championship final.",
      "",
      "3) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nNice and easy, this, because of the £5million clause in his Chelsea contract. A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper. Apparently, Kepa has done his medical and put pen to paper on a deal that should give David Raya the heebie-jeebies.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. A medical is in the offing.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment six weeks ago but, finally, the midfielder is in London to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we expected an unveiling by now, but we may have to wait for next week."

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘politely declined’ the chance to sign a striker who scored just three goals last season, as his club attempted to secure a swap deal for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "United have already given up on Hojlund. The £72million striker looked positive in his first season at Old Trafford, with 16 goals in all competitions.",
      "Last term, though, his 10-goal return included just four strikes in 32 Premier League games, against higher level opposition than in the Europa League, where he scored six times.",
      "United are looking to get at least some of their original outlay back for Hojlund, and are welcoming offers.",
      "It’s been heavily reported that Inter Milan are making attempts to land the Dane, taking him back to Italy – where he played prior to signing for the Red Devils, with Atalanta.",
      "The latest report suggested that Inter had made a cheeky attempt to land Hojlund by offering up a faltering striker.",
      "Indeed, United In Focus reports the Manchester outfit ‘rejected’ a loan-to-buy offer from Inter, which brought about ‘another possibility’ of Mehdi Taremi heading to Old Trafford.",
      "After being offered the chance to sign the Iranian striker, it’s reported United ‘politely declined’ as they have ‘no intention’ of signing him. It is not hard to see why they would do that.",
      "Taremi scored just three goals in 43 games last season – his first one with Inter – and seems in no way a fair asset to swap places with a player who cost £72million.",
      "Hoping to remove the chances of other such offers, it’s said United ‘want a full sale’ and are ‘uninterested in swap proposals’.",
      "Whether Inter come back to the table with a transfer fee attached remains to be seen. In any case, it seems that although he had a very tough time last season and is on the chopping block now, Hojlund wants to fight for his place at United.",
      "He said recently: “I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I’m looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I’m fully dedicated to the project that’s underway.”",
      "It’s not clear yet whether United will receive the sort of offer they’d accept for Hojlund, so there’s a chance he remains if nobody comes to the table with enough money.",
      "Ruben Amorim has chosen between Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee if Man Utd must sell one. He is also targeting a midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been informed that they can sign Liverpool and Chelsea target Hugo Ekitike in a ‘flexible deal’ as they look to reduce his fee.",
      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund could be on the move in the transfer window and another Serie A club has ’emerged’ as an potential destination, according to reports in Italy.",
      "United paid £64m for Hojlund only two years ago but already look like they are willing to let the misfiring striker go.",
      "Former England manager Fabio Capello has suggested that a struggling Manchester United forward is a safer signing for Inter Milan than another option.",
      "Man Utd have turned down an approach from Inter Milan for Netherlands international Joshua Zirkzee, according to reports."

      "Gyokeres is one of two strikers along with Benjamin Sesko that Arsenal are said to be choosing between to lead their line next season.",
      "One report on Friday claimed Sesko is ‘ready to join’ while another a few hours later insisted Gyokeres ‘will sign’ for the Gunners. We don’t know what to believe and at this point would quite like Andrea Berta to sh*t or get off the pot.",
      "Transfer expert Ben Jacobs claimed earlier this week that United may well be feeding on Arsenal’s scraps in their bid to land a new striker – essentially, they can have whichever striker Arsenal don’t want.",
      "“It could be a scenario where whoever Arsenal go for it opens the door for Manchester United for the other,” Jacobs said.",
      "“The natural expectation is that if Gyokeres doesn’t join Arsenal he hasn’t rejected Manchester United, so he could be a possibility, but I’m told also not to discount a scenario where Gyokeres goes to Arsenal and Sesko comes back into Manchester United’s thinking as well because 12 months ago they made a strong pitch and Sesko decided to stay at Leipzig.”",
      "That scenario is at odds with reports earlier this month which claimed Gyokeres had ‘rejected’ United, but Romano backed up Jacobs’ claim, insisting that what is currently a ‘closed door’ could reopen for the Sporting striker’s move to Old Trafford should Arsenal decide to plump for Sesko.",
      "“The question for many United fans is has Viktor Gyokeres rejected Manchester United to go to Arsenal? Guys let me explain the Gyokeres situation – Gyokeres has not told ‘Man United no I’m not coming goodbye’,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",

So the priority of Viktor Gyokeres is to go to Arsenal – he would love to go to Arsenal for several reasons, including obviously Champions League football, but Viktor Gyokeres didn’t say no to Manchester United.",

      "But that’s now changed according to Alfedo Pedulla, who claims United are ‘ready to submit an offer of €40m’ for Carnesecchi, though Atalant have told them they want between €45m and €50m for the 24-year-old.",
      "Pedulla does though state that a ‘solution that pleases everyone’ could see United adding bonuses to their bid to make up the difference.",
      "The key ‘condition’ to the deal is said to be finding ‘accommodation’ for Onana, which will be required to free up transfer funds and space on the wage bill for Carnesecchi.",

      "The Club World Cup has been a breeze for Manchester City so far, and Juventus were the latest to be brushed aside — on a particularly enjoyable day for one summer signing.",
      "Man City have played an absolute blinder here. Rayan Ait-Nouri for £31 million is one hell of a bargain — one that should make Wolves supporters sick to their stomach and Manchester United fans wonder why they signed Patrick Dorgu and not this guy.",
      "We were quick to write off Rayan Cherki after one game, and we’re just as ready to declare Ait-Nouri the best left-back in the world after only his second game for the club.",
      "On a comfortable Orlando afternoon (rainstorm aside) for Pep Guardiola’s men, the Algerian left-back was absolutely fantastic. His decisive through ball to assist Jeremy Doku for City’s opener was sublime, leaving Juventus defender Alberto Costa for dead and Pierre Kalulu, for some reason, unaware that the Belgian would cut in onto his right foot.",
      "There was plenty of transfer narrative, with Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders thriving — and a couple of Premier League targets doing absolutely nothing of note on the other side. Dusan Vlahovic got his goal in the end, and it was very well taken, but didn’t do enough to convince potential suitors he’s their man, while City-linked stars Kenan Yildiz and Andrea Cambiaso both started on the bench.",
      "MORE: Wirtz, Delap, Cunha: Top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window",
      "It’s City’s new boys who started on Thursday that really stole the show. Reijnders and Ait-Nouri have added youth, energy and a much-needed injection of self-belief to a team that spent most of last season feeling sorry for themselves. Guardiola is treating this tournament as the start of 2025/26 — and who can blame him after the empty-handed mess that was 2024/25?",
      "It’s the right call — and with Ait-Nouri leading the charge, City purred in possession. But for all the early signs of a slick new core forming, there were also some pretty loud reminders that the old core is, well…getting older.",
      "They’re still comfortable trying to break down teams, but transitions look like a weakness. Ederson choosing this moment to gift Juventus an equaliser — right after telling the world he wants to stay at City — was not ideal. That might not be your decision, fella.",
      "Luckily for him, Kalulu had an absolute shocker to outdo it, scoring one of the most avoidable own goals you’ll ever see, handing City the lead back.",
      "It was tight going into the second half, with the first somehow played to a finish despite monsoon conditions. But one simple like-for-like change blew it wide open.",
      "There were acres of space all game between Juventus’ deepest midfielder and their backline, with Omar Marmoush camped on the defender’s shoulder with his back to goal. Bringing on Erling Haaland was the easiest tactical decision Guardiola’s ever made. Igor Tudor had to react, but no adjustment could stop City slicing through with the same defence-splitting passes every five minutes.",
      "Reijnders — who’s already looking like a monstrous signing — was the one to deliver a gorgeous through ball to Matheus Nunes, who, as it turns out, might actually be a bloody decent right-back. Haaland was left completely free to tap in his 300th career goal with one of the scruffiest finishes you’ll ever see.",
      "Juve chucked on some positive subs in desperation, but City were rampant. Soon it was 4-1 — Phil Foden tapping in after Haaland produced a silky first touch and perfectly weighted through ball to set up Savinho. His calm touch around Michele Di Gregorio left Foden with a walk-in.",
      "Then came the pick of the bunch: a thunderous long-range belter from Savinho that left Di Gregorio rooted as embarrassment for the Old Lady turned to outright humiliation.",
      "There was still time for Rayan Cherki to miss an absolute sitter, but overall it was a very productive afternoon in Florida for City. They’re the only team to win all three of their group games at the Club World Cup and should be the clear favourites to lift the trophy.",
      "While this tournament could yet take a toll on their domestic campaign through sheer physical and mental fatigue, winning it might also provide the boost they need. The pre-CWC signings already look like inspired additions, injecting fresh energy and belief into a squad that looked flat and on the way out last season.",
      "Reijnders and Ait-Nouri, in particular, are settling in brilliantly. And it’s a refreshing change of pace for City to have a natural full-back playing in, well, full-back. Ait-Nouri already looks like a serious weapon going forward, and his pace should go some way to easing those nagging concerns in transition. Doku, meanwhile, will only benefit from having someone alongside him who occupies defenders and offers an end product.",
      "We haven’t even mentioned Rodri yet. He’s very much in Like A New Signing territory, starting his first City game since last September in the 5-2 win.",
      "So far, City look like they’re absolutely nailing a crucial transfer window. We still can’t quite believe it. £31 million? FFS.",
      "The opening fixtures of the 2025/26 Premier League season will feature a number of early and potentially awkward reunions, including Arsenal at Old Trafford.",

      "England were a lot of things at Euro 2024 but spectacular wasn’t one of them. Reaching the final and getting within five minutes of winning the trophy speaks for itself and the Three Lions, gradually, found their way after a dull start. They were never exciting. They just found their way.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo was a big part of that small improvement. He barely played in a group stage that was worryingly tame but started all four matches of a more controlled, more effective knock-out phase.",
      "Mainoo turned 20 in April. He’s proven his worth in an England shirt. He’s a Stockport-born United academy graduate with 50 Premier League appearances under his belt. That his future isn’t completely certain this summer is an indictment not only of the club, but of football’s financial governance.",
      "Specifically, it highlights the flaws in football’s financial governance frameworks. In the Premier League, profit and sustainability rules (PSR) allow clubs to make a £105m loss in any given three-year period.",
      "Because teams are on an endless quest for improvement on the pitch, players need to be bought and sold. In the PSR era, those sales are increasingly coming from the ‘Do Not Sell’ pile.",
      "Profit from sales is booked immediately and transfer fees are amortised over the lengths of the players’ contracts. Clubs sell players with value to pay down their losses and replace them with expensive successors, whose futures will be subject to the same calculations down the line.",
      "United themselves are pertinent to the PSR debate – if debts aren’t part of the calculation and clubs have to sell players against their wishes on June 30 only to buy someone more expensive on July 1 to comply with allowable losses, is it really doing its job? – but the basic fact of the matter is this: Manchester United shouldn’t be considering the sale of Mainoo in a million months of Super Sundays.",
      "And yet they might. It’s the same with Alejandro Garnacho, albeit the winger’s departure would be welcomed more positively given his penchant for bridge-burning.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho did not command transfer fees on the way in but would on the way out, and that helps United equip Ruben Amorim with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Mainoo has been forced out of the spotlight through a lot of injury and a little under-use since shining in the latter stages of the European Championship. He started exactly half of United’s Premier League matches in 2024/25, five fewer than the previous season which he began injured.",
      "He might even have been slightly forgotten by the most casual football supporters beyond the ranks of Red Devils but he’s still an exciting prospect who will be looking ahead to 2025/26 with hopes of getting his fitness back on track.",
      "There have been reports that Mainoo’s wage demands could be a factor in his club’s calculation. His contract expires in two years; a decision would be made soon at a smart club and might be made soon at United too.",
      "His coaches speak of maturity, physical strength and imagination on the ball. Even at 20, his one-on-one skills are beyond doubt, proven at the highest level. Mainoo has the mentality and ability to be a part of what United need to become.",
      "Manchester United have been a dominant commercial force in football for decades. They’ve taken their brand, their sponsorship appeal, their global fandom, and turned it into varying degrees of success.",
      "They’re a colossus – a shadow of their despised and dastardly dominance nowadays, maybe, but they’re not wiped out on the mat just yet.",
      "United don’t just buy great players. They make their own. For all their spending in the transfer market, they almost always have at least one academy product in their first team. It’s kind of a thing.",
      "Clubs up and down the Premier League are looking to their player development as the magical route to blissful spending inside PSR compliance but United, perhaps more than anyone, know the intangible benefits of bringing players through for their own line-up.",
      "Consider where United are today.",
      "They finished a few places outside the Premier League relegation zone and might have been even lower if Aston Villa hadn’t laid an egg on the last day of the season. They spurned a last-gasp chance for salvation by losing the Europa League final. They were awful.",
      "United have backed their head coach after a poor season in which the tone was set by his predecessor and a club hierarchy that leaves an enormous amount to be desired.",
      "Amorim has been anointed as the rescuer of a club that needs to become Manchester United again. The Red Devils must bounce back and they haven’t got the time or margin of error they might think.",
      "Cunha is the embodiment of one strand of that rejuvenation but they need players like Mainoo too. United’s empire was built upon them.",
      "Mainoo can control and affect the game. He travels nicely with the ball and can influence the play by doing the simple things well in the middle of the pitch with the easy confidence of a player ten years older.",
      "David Beckham won’t look enviously into his passing toolkit but Mainoo is more than just a relaxed character in midfield. What he does there is technical.",
      "“It is how he prepares before he receives the ball,” former United academy coach Paul McGuinness told Adam Bate before the European Championships.",
      "“What he does off the ball makes it seem like he has time on it. To receive it, he has to look before it comes. Amateur players look up after they have received the ball and then decide what they are going to do. The top professionals, and that is a good phrase for Kobbie, they are efficient and everything they do has a flow to it.”",
      "One of the reasons Amorim will even make it as far as the start of the new season is that he adheres to a specific system and didn’t have the players to apply it mid-season with any degree of success – it’s almost like somebody should have said something.",
      "The outrageously talented tactical analyst and tea-maker Adam Clery recently filmed a video explaining why Cunha is the perfect signing for United’s system.",
      "In his illustration of Amorim’s 3-4-3, Clery defined the four players midfield players as follows: Flying Machine on the left behind(ish) an inverted winger, Inverting Enthusiast on the right behind(ish) a creative number 10, and a Ball Winner and Plays Everywhere in the centre.",
      "His energy and tenacity contribute to a midfield’s ball-winning ability too but that Plays Anywhere role is made for Mainoo.",
      "United’s recruitment should be defined entirely by the system if they’re to climb back up the table in any meaningful way and, in Mainoo, they have a player ready to develop into one of the most important spots.",
      "One year in every four, the decisions made by players take on a different hue. 2025 is a World Cup year minus one, the year in every World Cup cycle in which players either don’t move or seek a safe bet with the attention of their international managers in mind.",
      "There’s no obvious buyer for Mainoo but PSR can do funny things and Bruno Fernandes not going to the Saudi Pro League means that the chances of the midfielder leaving are higher than zero.",
      "One of the major problems with the way football finance is governed by the Premier League and other bodies in Europe is its dehumanising impact on players. In the very worst cases, they’re shuffled around like pawns on a chessboard. They are their book value and nothing more.",
      "But if Mainoo has a say, he should stay. He needs regular football in a familiar setting and that means both staying fit and staying put.",
      "If Mainoo were to leave it would be a big deal. As a United youth made good he’s part of a rich heritage and his premature departure would shine a light on PSR’s negative impacts. He is, culturally and tactically, where he should be.",
      "Yet there’s another pattern emerging. As United falter, exiled players and discarded pieces are demonstrating an ability to perform elsewhere.",
      "Marcus Rashford was loaned to Villa and took a big step back towards his best. Jadon Sancho at least did enough at Chelsea to get a move away from Old Trafford this summer. Antony might even have played himself back into Amorim’s thinking.",
      "Scott McTominay joined Napoli last summer and a year later he’s a Serie A champion, the league’s official MVP, one of the most successful Brits in Italian football history and a beloved adopted son of Naples.",
      "That’s not bad, but it’s not for Mainoo. Not yet. United is the right spot for the 20-year-old despite last season because he’s at a club that needs him, a club he loves, and a club where he will be able to continue his development – development he still needs – without the upheaval of a transfer.",
      "This article was originally published on High Protein Beef Paste, an entirely free weekly football newsletter to which you should subscribe immediately.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United transfer is off after Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho decided to pull the plug on the deal.",
      "As wind-up tactics go, wearing the shirt of another club next to a yellow Ferrari is a guaranteed way to annoy fans and burn bridges with one’s employer.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Ruben Amorim might finally have lost it at Manchester United; four players he is trying to sell won’t come on tour and he wants new signings fairly soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has told four “bad apples” at Man Utd that they won’t be coming on their tour of the United States in July if they haven’t already found a ...",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?"

      "Christian Norgaard to Arsenal appears very much like it might well be A Thing.",
      "Now we like Norgaard rather a lot. In our view, his has been an under-rated contribution to Brentford’s post-Toney attacking success, with his lower-key creative input significantly and understandably overshadowed by the more eye-catching Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.",
      "Point is, he’s a very good player available at a very good price and he might be just the thing. But…bit underwhelming, isn’t it? One thing Norgaard is not and never can be is the big-name striker Arsenal fans crave so desperately.",
      "But sometimes this precise kind of initially underwhelming transfer can obtain enormous significance come the final reckoning, like these five lads whose eventual contribution to title glory in their first season was far greater than the excitement that greeted their arrival.",
      "We’re talking specifically players who actually helped win their teams the title, not Ralph Wiggum-style helping. So no Federico Chiesa here, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "Manuel Akanji (Man City, 2022)\nOne of the problems with a feature like this is the fact that a vast number of Premier League titles have been won by Manchester United ages ago and Manchester City more recently, meaning any new signings – underwhelming, overwhelming or those that merely adequately whelm – are coming into teams already well used to winning titles by the sh*tload and thus making it harder to make decisive contributions.",
      "But if we try to do this feature without any contribution from Manchester we’re in very deep trouble, so we will have to make the best of it.",
      "And thus, Manuel Akanji is our man. There was little fanfare when he arrived right at the end of the 2022 summer transfer window to join two-time defending champions for whom Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias had formed an estimable first-choice defensive pairing with top-tier reinforcements in the shape of John Stones and Nathan Ake.",
      "At the very least it would be fair to say that of City’s two signings from Borussia Dortmund that summer, Akanji’s (for less than a third of the fee City threw Leeds’ way for Kalvin Phillips) was the lower profile.",
      "And while, yes, the very much not underwhelming signing of Erling Haaland certainly played its part in City’s continued success, so too did Akanji. He would end the season with more Premier League appearances than any of Ake, Dias, Stones or Laporte despite not making his debut in the competition until mid-September, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League knockouts and in every round of the FA Cup for the treble winners.",
      "Now Manchester City need an upgrade, but then he was an underrated revelation.",
      "",
      "Marcos Alonso (Chelsea, 2016)\nChelsea’s rollercoaster journey from 2014 to 2017 will always be one of the Premier League’s very best bits, with a pair of hugely impressive title wins under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte sandwiching a comically disastrous season that ended Mourinho’s second spell and resulted in a 10th-place finish.",
      "As well as appointing Conte, something else Chelsea did in the summer of 2016 was sign Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina.",
      "Now he had proved himself a very capable player for La Viola in Serie A, but here in England we have very correctly never really placed much stock in what a player might achieve in daft little foreign leagues like that one. It only matters what you’ve done here. And in Alonso’s case, that was ‘be a bit-part player in a relegated Bolton team and half-a-season of relegation-battling with Gus Poyet’s Sunderland’. In other words, nothing very interesting at all.",
      "Yet he was absolutely crucial to Chelsea’s success under Conte. We’ve all enjoyed the banters about the sorcery of Conte’s ability to win the league with Victor Actual Moses as his RWB – a magic trick matched only by Conte’s ability to regrow his own hair – but it’s easily overlooked now just how brilliant and integral Alonso was on the other side, and how that really was not something everyone knew would be the case at the time.",
      "As well as his defensive work, Alonso became a key progressive component of Chelsea’s dominant title-winners, more than doubling his career tally of top-flight goals in that one season.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante (Leicester, 2015)\nFeels like it’s a bit of a cheat to include anything at all from Leicester’s 2015/16 miracle, because for very, very understandable reasons not one soul on earth was talking about any Leicester signing of any xW (expected whelm) as being the one that might just propel them to the title after their escape from relegation in 2015.",
      "But equally it feels like you just can’t have this list without Kante given the sheer gulf between the lack of fanfare that greeted the arrival of a player on the back of one mid-table season in Ligue 1 with Caen and the mammoth significance of his contribution to Leicester pulling off the Premier League’s greatest ever madness.",
      "Such was his impact that he moved on to Chelsea after just one season – duly winning the season again as a signing that was in no way underwhelming – and his name remains to this day an instantly understood shorthand for a very specific and very special type of player.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick (Man United, 2006)\nIt’s one of those things that’s been largely memory-holed now by all involved, but at the time of Carrick’s move from Tottenham to Manchester United there were plenty of United fans who felt they’d been sold an overpriced pup by those wily southern chancers.",
      "The mood was febrile enough around Old Trafford back in the summer of 2006 on the back of a truly unthinkable three-year Premier League title drought. It seems hilarious to think of that now – largely because it is hilarious – but at the time United had never previously gone even two seasons of Barclays without winning the thing.",
      "Jose Mourinho had come along and ruined everything, the great Special prick that he was, and there was widely held suspicion about the idea a pretty-passing midfielder of such conspicuous pretty loser stock as West Ham and Tottenham could significantly change matters.",
      "Five Premier League titles and 316 Premier League appearances later, opinions had altered a bit.",
      "",
      "Jens Lehmann (Arsenal, 2003)\nGot to have a bit of Arsenal in here, haven’t we? And there really is only one contender when you look through the names.",
      "Now it’s not like Arsenal fans thought they’d signed a dud when Lehmann arrived, but he was a goalkeeper with a reputation for being something of a loon.",
      "As the man to replace the very safest of English goalkeeping hands in David Seaman, it was undoubtedly a bit of a punt. Yet a punt that led to Lehmann being an ever-present member of the first and still very much only unbeaten English league champions since the Victorian era.",
      "Look, fair play.",
      "According to reports, there was one key reason behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to favour Arsenal-bound Christian Norgaard over an alternative.",
      "Arsenal have reached an ‘agreement’ for their third summer signing as a replacement for a midfielder who looks to be Barcelona bound."

      "Newcastle are prepared to move heaven, earth and the Angel of the North to keep Alexander Isak from the prying hands of Liverpool, but it can backfire.",
      "While they face relegation if Isak is sold, speculation persists that Newcastle might be unable to resist the title-contending overtures of Arsenal and Liverpool.",
      "It seems unlikely either club can afford the requisite sums while persuading Isak to leave a club coming off the back of a trophy-winning, Champions League-qualifying season. But any player thriving outside the Big Six is destined to be linked to those in it.",
      "Newcastle still hold the cards with a full three years left on the contract Isak signed when he joined, but reports of the Magpies considering breaking their wage structure to make him the highest-paid player in the club’s history bring hope and warnings from the past.",
      "",
      "Arsene Wenger once said his principle on wages was “to pay something that makes sense and is defendable in front of every single player,” adding: “We make exceptions sometimes but they are not maybe so high. If you want to keep making profit you have to respect that.”",
      "He also said that “we have no players on £200,000 a week and I think other clubs will come down to us with financial fair play”.",
      "That remarkably optimistic and hilariously naive philosophy just about held up when Mesut Ozil joined on £140,000 a week eight months later, even if that deal, in the words of the Daily Telegraph at the time, meant Arsenal had ‘broken their wage structure’.",
      "But it was entirely obliterated when the German signed his next contract in January 2018. After some preposterously protracted and public negotiations it was decided that handing Ozil a reported £350,000 a week for three years was the “cheapest option” instead of losing him for nothing that summer and having to replace him.",
      "“On the other side all of our players are well paid. Very well paid. To feel sorry for them – I’m not sure that it’s the most objective assessment,” the manager added, lighting the ticking timebomb he had just carefully planted in a dressing room he would vacate months later.",
      "It is unknown whether Mikel Arteta or the club’s hierarchy agreed whether keeping Ozil was indeed the most economical choice possible when he a) refused to take a pay cut during a global pandemic, b) was paid in full until his departure for Fenerbahce in January 2021 despite not playing for the Gunners since March 2020, and c) still had 90% of his record Arsenal wage paid by the club during his first five months in Turkey.",
      "",
      "The line heavily pushed on Florian Wirtz this summer was that while his transfer fee shatters the club record, his incentivised salary will fall in line with the club’s highest earners – or at least those behind the Egyptian king.",
      "As far as basic wages go, Salah is the clear bar-setter at Anfield. Salah became the best-paid player in the club’s history on around £350,000 a week when he extended his deal in 2022, then when those terms were approaching expiration in April 2025 he agreed a rise of up to £480,000 if performance-related bonuses were triggered.",
      "Had that deal been sorted before that season he would have earned a fortune, but those 34 goals and 23 assists in 52 title-winning games provided a decent bargaining position during talks.",
      "“When you have someone as special as Salah the rule that you have to have in place you have to certainly bend them, maybe not necessarily break them but you have to maybe go closer to a position that maybe you don’t want to,” said Carragher at the time, dancing around the fact the Reds quite understandably felt compelled to make a significant exception to keep their best player.",
      "The usual Liverpool transfer exceptionalism notwithstanding, few could argue Liverpool were wrong to make Salah a pay-scale anomaly on either occasion.",
      "",
      "“I was a bit annoyed with the first offer put to me,” said Keane in August 1999. “Deep down they must have known it wasn’t something I could sign. Our dealings have to be realistic. I am not naive enough to settle for anything less than a reasonable valuation of my worth.”",
      "A £38,500-a-week deal would have made Keane the highest earner at Man Utd while remaining commensurate to his teammates. But with Juventus and Bayern Munich prepared to throw ludicrous and lucrative figures around in the age of fresh Bosman hysteria, the realisation quickly set in at Old Trafford that they stood to lose a prized asset for nothing.",
      "Keane was free to talk to those clubs and sign a pre-contract from January 1; his new £52,000-a-week Man Utd contract was signed on December 8, putting him on twice as much money as Ballon d’Or runner-up David Beckham mere months after the Treble – and making him the best-paid player in the Premier League.",
      "The BBC said Man Utd had ‘smashed their pay structure’, while The Guardian called it a ‘dismantling’. It also meant Keane was earning considerably more than Sir Alex Ferguson, who ensured after the Wayne Rooney deal fiasco in 2010 to get it in writing that no player at the club could be on a higher wage again.",
      "Keane being Keane and Man Utd being Man Utd, there was still controversy to be enjoyed as the ink dried.",
      "“I’m not one for holding grudges but this was a stupid mistake, a bad public relations exercise and something that should never have happened,” the Irishman said of a letter the club sent to supporters preposterously justifying an increase in ticket prices as a means to help pay Keane’s salary.",
      "Don’t give Sir Jim Ratcliffe any ideas.",
      "",
      "Before Isak came Kane, the modern standard-bearer for exceptional Premier League forwards operating outside the absolute elite, destined to forever be cast unrequited admiring glances from those within it.",
      "An unhealthy portion of Kane’s career at Spurs was spent linking him with a move to those clubs for unthinkably large sums while he excelled as an individual in a team tapping forlornly against a glass ceiling, and that fate has promptly befallen Isak.",
      "Daniel Levy happened to reach the same ingenious solution Newcastle have stumbled upon: paying something closer to the wages on offer elsewhere. With Kane already sitting alongside Hugo Lloris at the top of the Spurs pay structure that was easier said than done, but perhaps mindful of a potential World Cup-based boom in interest, the England forward secured a 100% pay rise in June 2018.",
      "Kane won the Golden Boot for the semi-finalists in Russia, but a new deal which forced Spurs to ‘rip up their wage policy’ in the words of the Daily Telegraph, had two significant knock-on effects.",
      "It perhaps contributed to Tottenham becoming the first team in Premier League history not to make a single signing across a summer transfer window. Mauricio Pochettino had challenged the hierarchy to be “brave and take risks” but likely had something different in mind.",
      "And that six-year contract with no exit clause effectively trapped Kane when his personal numbers continued to inflate at a time Spurs as a collective inevitably dropped off.",
      "If Isak does exploit the tedious Arsenal and Liverpool speculation his representatives will not make the same mistake – mainly because they have the experience of managing other clients and won’t be distracted by the motorbike and fake tyre tracks on his office floor.",
      "If Florian Wirtz triggers enough of his add-ons to become a Premier League record transfer then he may find himself among some fine Manchester United deals.",
      "Liverpool will hope Alexander Isak can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging.",
      "Harry Kane has basically joined Manchester United after an ‘Arsenal hijack’. It’s all happening…",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ivan Toney became the 35th and 36th players to be capped while playing for foreign clubs.",
      "Roy Keane has tipped an England player to be “fuming” at manager Thomas Tuchel for the role he gave him in the Three Lions’ 3-1 loss to Senegal on Tuesday.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
