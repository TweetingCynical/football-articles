      "Manchester United are edging closer to the Manchester Derby against Manchester City this weekend, with the international break now over.",
      "Ruben Amorim has had plenty of time to come up with his game plan for United's rivals following their 3-2 win over Burnley before the break. The United boss could be getting the trip across the city to the Etihad Stadium at the perfect time, with Pep Guardiola's side reeling after consecutive defeats.",
      "City are also riddled with injuries after losing to Tottenham and Brighton, giving United a real chance to come away with points on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United have a few injury worries as we move towards Sunday's derby against Manchester City. Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount both went off injured in the 3-2 win over Burnley and their status is unclear before Amorim gives an update in his pre-match press conference. However, Cunha has posted promising updates on social media.",
      "Diogo Dalot pulled out of playing for Portugal in the international break, due to \"muscle discomfort\" while Lisandro Martinez remains unavailable due to a long-term knee injury. It is definitely worse for City, who have lost Omar Marmoush to a knee issue sustained while playing for Egypt, while Phil Foden, Savinho, John Stones and Josko Gvardiol are among their doubts.",
      "Andre Onana has not been enjoying himself of late - and things didn't get better for him on international duty with Cameroon. The goalkeeper is heading to Trabzonspor on loan in the coming days following the £18million arrival of Senne Lammens at Old Trafford and his confidence it at rock bottom.",
      "Onana was clearly at fault for Cape Verde's winning goal against Cameroon in their World Cup qualifier as he stayed on his line, making Rocha Livramento's task easier. The goal saw Cape Verde qualify for the World Cup for the first time, but only served to further underline Onana's struggles.",
      "He is expected to complete his season-long loan to Turkey in the coming days and will be hoping to re-find some form in the Super Lig.",
      "Manchester United have finally found a club for Tyrell Malacia. The unwanted defender was a part of the bomb squad over the summer with Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, but is the only one of them still at the club.",
      "Thankfully, it seems Turkish side Eyüpspor have come to the rescue to take the 26-year-old. Malacia joined United in 2022 from Feyenoord for around £13m, but has made little to no impact at the club, with injuries a major issue for him.",
      "He had looked destined to leave for Elche, but that deal broke down on deadline day. Eyüpspor are now expected to seal the signing before the Turkish window closes on Friday, completing the exodus of Amorim's unwanted players.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wayne Rooney's 15-year-old son Kai has said 'life can't get worse' after suffering a painful injury while playing in Manchester United's development team. Rooney, 35, won numerous titles at Old Trafford and is hoping his eldest child can follow in his footsteps.",
      "Unfortunately, the only steps young Kai will be taking in the coming days will be on crutches. Before the setback, Kai was enjoying a lightning fast ascent at Rooney's old club.",
      "He was recently called up to the United-19s squad where he was playing with other prospects who are four years older than him. His call-up was then followed by a sweet goal he scored for the Under-18s, which saw him fire a left-footed volley into the top corner.",
      "Sadly, any positive momentum he has amassed will have to be rediscovered as he is set for a period on the sidelines. Kai uploaded a mirror selfie of himself showing off the protective boot he has on his right foot. In a caption overlaying the photo, he wrote: \"Life can't get worse\" alongside a crying emoji.",
      "It's a post which will invoke empathy from all footballers who have suffered a bad injury in their career. The nature of his injury or how long it will stop him from playing is currently unclear.",
      "However, the tone in his post suggests it may be a long time until he is playing for United again. While he is yet to wrestle the spotlight onto himself in the same way as his iconic father, there has been plenty of promise around Kai.",
      "He usually features in a central position for United, just like Rooney Sr, but he has also starred in the wider areas. Kai was particularly impressive while playing for the Red Devils in the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland earlier this summer.",
      "Wayne also starred in a similar tournament when he was a young and hungry prospect at Everton. Rooney cheered on his son's displays alongside wife Coleen and his youngest sons Kit and Cass.",
      "The former England skipper was recently asked to explain any influence he has had on Kai's youthful football career so far. Instead of peppering him with advice, the Reds all-time highest goal-scorer is allowing Kai to play the game in the way he sees fit.",
      "In a previous interview, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist. So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing.",
      "\"I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.",
      "\"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand off approach. I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",
      "Kai has been with the United academy since the age of 11. He joined the Red Devils youth set-up in 2020, where he his playing style has evoked memories of his famous father strutting his stuff at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana's recent struggles continued on Tuesday night as he was unable to prevent Cameroon from suffering a 1-0 defeat to Cape Verde.",
      "The two African nations faced each other on Tuesday night as they battled for top-spot in their World Cup qualification campaign. Onana, who is set to join Turkish outfit Trabzonspor, was in the headlines once again for the wrong reasons.",
      "In the 53rd minute, forward Rocha Livramento broke free of Cameroon's defence before driving towards Onana's goal. The United shot-stopper opted to stay on his line before diving the wrong way to concede.",
      "The defeat now means that Cameroon are in second place in Group D with two games remaining. They face having to settle for a possible play-off spot to earn their place at next summer's World Cup.",
      "After the game, a video circulated on social media of Onana seeming to shove a fan away following a pitch invasion. The spectator appeared to approach the goalkeeper as he made his way off the pitch, trying to record him.",
      "Seconds later, another fan appeared to throw a water bottle at the goalkeeper as he exited the shot. The Sun have reported that a source close to Onana has confirmed that the action was driven by concerns for his own safety.",
      "Onana, who cost United £47million, is expected to leave Old Trafford for Turkey in the next week after losing his place in Ruben Amorim's team. The United boss has opted to start Altay Bayindir in the first three Premier League games with Senne Lammens' deadline day arrival placing him further down the pecking order.",
      "Former United stopper Ben Foster believes bringing in Lammens is a risky move from Amorim. Foster said on his Fozcast podcast: \"Manchester United have got a kid from the Belgian league, who's never played for the Belgian first team.",
      "\"He's played about 60 first-team games in his career and they're expecting this guy to be able to adapt to not only the Premier League, but adapt to Manchester United as well. It just reeks of sticking a band aid (plaster) on it.",

      "Bruno Fernandes is reportedly open to leaving Manchester United next summer despite turning down a lucrative offer from the Saudi Pro League. The Red Devils captain was heavily linked with a move to Al-Hilal this summer, with the Saudi giants considering a £100million bid and a £700,000-a-week pay package for the Portugal international.",
      "Fernandes, who joined the Red Devils in January 2020, also turned down an approach from another Saudi team in Al-Ittihad, who held talks with Fernandes' representatives. But the 30-year-old midfielder rejected a three-year deal to stay in Manchester, prioritising playing in the Premier League ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "But the Middle-Eastern giants remain intent on signing him. And, according to talkSPORT, Fernandes is open to making the move to Saudi, America or another major European league at the end of this season, when he will have just a year left on his United contract.",
      "United may use the opportunity to cash in on their ageing star, having just forked out £130m on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to play in Fernandes' favoured No. 10 role.",
      "\"I know for the club it was tough to decide. Because on one hand I'm the club captain, I'm important for them, even if at times I've not been great, I've been performing and everything. I know that in the public eye it will be bad if things go wrong.",
      "\"But it would be very good if things go well – if they sell me and they get more players and whatever. But in my mind I've always said that this is the place I want to be.",
      "\"The dream of coming and playing in the Premier League, because for me it is the biggest league in the world and I want to fulfil my dreams of staying here and winning more things with the club. Obviously I know people will have different opinions – he's 30 years old, he's getting old…”",
      "He continued: \"It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course. Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career.",
      "\"She was someone who always supported me a lot. It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship. But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, and I feel capable of it.\"",
      "United legend Gary Neville was vocal in his praise for Fernandes following his decision to turn down a pay rise to represent the club once more. The pundit said: “Manchester United's star player - only player at times - for the last four, five, six years, has been Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"He's so important. The fact that he wants to stay, the fact that he wants to go through this and come out the other side, will endear him towards Manchester United fans even more.",
      "\"To turn that money down at a point where Manchester United are at their lowest ebb and say, 'No, I want to fight through this, I want to see it through the other side, I want to come out and achieve things,' I think it says a lot about him as a person, as a character. The club needs people who are going to run through a brick wall for them.\"",
      "Neville’s former team-mate Paul Scholes had a different view, however, believing the club should have cashed in on the player because the sum offered for him was too great. The 11-time Premier League champion said on The Overlap Fan Debate: “They are talking about £100m for him. Man United cannot say no to that.",
      "“You know when you talk about this system as well, I know he has been brilliant and carried the team on his back but where does he play? What is his position? Do you see him as a number 10? Do you see him as a holding midfielder?",
      "“He almost confuses the whole system because he doesn’t have that one position for him. I mean he has been brilliant don’t get me wrong. But when you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.”",
      "\"I understand it's a business. But I think he looks at this as pure, 'I've got unfinished business at United. There's stuff I want to do here. Yes, I've been paid well here. The fans love me.' But I think he's in the game of wanting to give back after all he's received. So I've got nothing but respect for him.",
      "“I would have understood him leaving if he left, 100%. But the fact that he stayed and said there's stuff for me still to do here. I think it's a testament to him as a person, but also another reason why managers comfortably give him the armband.",
      "\"If I was him, I think I'd have found it difficult to say no [to Al Hilal]. I've got to be honest.\" However, after rejecting Saudi advances in the summer, Fernandes could well leave United at the end of the season, which would no doubt upset some club legends if their previous comments are anything to go by.",

      "However, the 33-year-old remained one of Europe’s most high-profile players without a club, even beyond the start of domestic seasons. Without a new employer, Eriksen decided to train with Swedish club Malmo to maintain his fitness.",
      "But compatriot Thomas Gravesen wasn’t impressed with his plan and accused him of a lack of ambition. But just a few days later, his wait seems to have come to an end, with multiple reports saying he has signed a deal with Wolfsburg.",

      "\"If he wants to play for the national team, what signal does this send? What signal does going up and having fun with friends in Malmo send?”",
      "Eriksen signed with the Red Devils on a free transfer at the start of the 2022/23 season having rebuilt his career with Brentford following his cardiac arrest in 2021. In three campaigns, he appeared more than 100 times for United, winning the EFL Cup in 2023 and the FA Cup the following season.",

      "Roman Kemp first came up with the idea two years ago. Now, on World Suicide Prevention Day, after a lot of hard work and endless meetings and phone calls, the Sky presenter and broadcaster has seen it come to fruition.",
      "Arsenal fan Kemp has been profoundly affected by suicide as his best friend, radio producer Joe Lyons, took his own life in 2020. Kemp made a BBC documentary about the experience and has also revealed he had suicidal thoughts as a teenager.",
      "That has led him to being a campaigner to raise awareness and get people talking. It was two years ago when Kemp first talked to Vinai Venkatesham - who was at Arsenal then but has since become Tottenham ’s chief executive - about the plan.",
      "Latest data shows that one person in the UK takes their own life every 90 minutes and that a quarter of all people have had suicidal thoughts.",
      "All 20 clubs are backing the Premier League's “Together Against Suicide” initiative and 11 clubs are providing different forms of support for fans with messaging on advertising boards, match programmes and and on big screens at this weekend’s games.",
      "But a huge part of the plan is that it is not just a one-off but ongoing support as Tottenham have teamed up with Haringey Mind - they are the only club to join with a local community project - and Arsenal are organising a match day drop-in centre.",
      "Kemp is such a good ambassador because he is down-to-earth, is a genuine football fan who connects with those going to games and his own personal experience means it is very personal and powerful.",
      "Kemp said: “Football can make a difference. We are talking about the group of people who might be going through their own crisis but, once a week, they go to the football and they are focused on the pitch, looking forward and that’s the one thing they have in their minds.",
      "“If we can make that connection - and football fans are the demographic we are talking about of under 50s - then it can make all the difference.”",
      "Kemp also makes the campaign all the more powerful and relatable because of his friendship with Joe Lyons who continues to inspire him. “He was a huge Spurs fan,” smiled Kemp. “I never held it against him! But I’d go to visit the grave and I’m not someone who would go there and talk to the headstone or anything like that.",
      "“But I would always wind him up and say: ‘They’ve never won anything for years!’ Then suddenly they win in the summer and I went there and I said: ‘You’ve done it at last.’ That’s football. That’s the connection and maybe if it helps one person stay then it’s made the difference.",
      "“That’s why I am so proud to work on an initiative that puts compassion and connection at the heart of football and on something I really believe will make a difference to the fans that need it.”",
      "Other clubs doing initiatives are Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, West Ham United, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Southampton.",
      "It is very much seen as a pilot scheme to see what works best as all clubs are doing different things. Venkatesham is a brilliant football executive because he engages with fans, cares about a club’s community and also found the Premier League were so keen to help.",
      "Venkatesham said: “I’m sure that, as chief executive Richard Masters, gets about 50 ideas a day put his way and yet the Premier League were so supportive, every club is on board and, at this stage, it’s only 11 teams while we discover what works best in each scheme.",
      "“But it was very important that this was something not just as a one-off but for the long term and I am someone who believes football has got such a big role to play. We constantly ask so much of fans in terms of fixture changes, schedules and the demands of following your team home and away. We need to make sure we can help them when they need us.",
      "“We want fans to understand that one conversation can make all the difference, and that they can turn to their clubs for support when they need it most.”",
      "Tottenham will be one of 11 clubs delivering the pilot project during the 2025/26 season, working alongside Mind in Haringey. Staff from the charity will be based at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium during all Premier League matches across the season, beginning with the match against Wolves on Saturday 27 September, reachable at the end of a text service (available on WhatsApp 07399 928274) and available to meet confidentially with anyone who requires support on the day.",
      "The service will also be available outside of home matchdays, with fans directed to a dedicated hub on Mind in Haringey’s website for out of hours support.

      "Manchester United have reportedly struck a deal with Turkish outfit Eyüpspor for the transfer of former Feyenoord defender Tyrell Malacia. The left-back had failed to secure an exit from Old Trafford before the window closed in England.",
      "The Red Devils are set to loan out the 26-year-old, who has struggled to secure a regular spot in the starting line-up and has been plagued by injuries. Malacia joined United from Feyenoord in a deal rumoured to be worth around £13million plus add-ons.",
      "Since his move to Old Trafford in 2022, Malacia has only made 47 appearances, most of which were during his debut season under Erik ten Hag. He was limited to just four outings last term before being loaned out to PSV Eindhoven in the Eredivisie for the second half of the season.",
      "Upon his return from loan, Malacia was among five players instructed to train separately from the first-team squad - with England striker Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho all securing moves away from the club before the English transfer window slammed shut on 1 September.",
      "Despite the Premier League window being firmly shut, Super Lig clubs can still make signings, as the Turkish transfer window remains open until 12 September. Reşat Can Özbudak, a journalist at YS TV, shared on X (formerly Twitter): \"Eyüpspor has reached an agreement with Manchester United for the loan transfer of Tyrell Malacia The decision is awaited.\"",
      "Whilst United are on tenterhooks awaiting a final verdict, Andre Onana is poised to seal his move to the Super Lig. The Cameroonian goalkeeper has agreed to join Trabzonspor on a season-long loan after failing to win over Amorim.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is looking to kickstart his career at Chelsea following his move from Manchester United. The 21-year-old’s Old Trafford exit was on the cards ever since the winger expressed frustration at starting May’s Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur on the bench.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim took unkindly to that and Garnacho spent pre-season training away from United’s first-team, having expressed a desire to leave. Chelsea completed the long-expected signing of the Argentina international for £40million, with the Red Devils inserting a 10 per cent sell-on clause.",
      "Garnacho also had a tense relationship with Amorim’s predecessor, Erik ten Hag, once liking a negative social media post about the Dutchman. While few doubt his ability, there are question marks over his attitude, which Enzo Maresca will hope to iron out. Here’s a round-up of what managers, team-mates and pundits have said about the enigmatic Argentine…",
      "So exasperated had Amorim become with Garnacho that he reportedly told him he was heading out of the club in front of his team-mates. Ahead of the final league game of the season - before Garnacho's outburst about being left on the bench for the Europa League final - his boss told him during a training session: “You better hope you have a good agent this summer,” reported The Athletic.",
      "By that point, the dye had already been cast on his United career, with Garnacho angling for a move away from the club. The relationship between head coach and player then soured further when Garnacho spoke to the media after the devastating loss to Spurs in Bilbao, saying: “Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league.",
      "“We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.”",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes once delivered a less-than-complimentary verdict about Garnacho’s attitude after he scored the winning goal in a Europa League game against Real Sociedad in 2022.",
      "Fernandes told BT Sport: “He was good but he knows we expect a lot from him. He’s still really young, doing really well. At the beginning of the season, he was not at his best.",
      "\"On the [pre-season] tour he did not have the best attitude. That’s why he didn’t get his chance until now. He’s getting his chances because he’s training better, he’s having the correct attitude.”",
      "Given what has unfolded since, that performance proved to be a false dawn. Fernandes tried his best to nurture the obvious natural talent Garnacho possesses, but ultimately his pleas for professionalism fell on deaf ears.",
      "After sealing his move to Stamford Bridge, Garnacho watched the home clash with Fulham from the stands, where he was spotted scrolling on his phone just eight minutes into the game.",
      "Carragher complained: “You know what I didn't like? Did you see the game [against Fulham], when they go to the people in the stands and they are on their phones with the game going on?",
      "“I can’t stand it. And it's not just him by the way, but I can’t stand it. So it's a miss for that. For sitting on his phone during an important game for Chelsea.”",
      "Former United defender Paul Parker pulled no punches when it came to Garnacho following his Chelsea transfer, calling his conduct “disrespectful.” The former England full-back told MyBettingSites: “His conduct on and off the pitch was disrespectful.",
      "“All he wanted to do was score a goal or have a near miss so he could act like Ronaldo. Now he’s gone to a club where there’s a lot more ego. He will alienate himself or it’ll be a battle there.",
      "“United fans backed him when he was going through things both on and off the field. His brother was tweeting things and they backed him and he said nothing. He’s stuck two fingers up at the club that nursed him.”",
      "Garnacho will be looking to prove his critics wrong and defy the public perception of his behind-the-scenes behaviour as he embarks on a fresh start at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Recent Manchester United transfer target Denzel Dumfries has admitted he is open to a Premier League move. Dumfries has been a key player for Inter Milan since joining from PSV Eindhoven for £12.3million in August 2021.",
      "The Netherlands international quickly became one of the world’s most highly rated wing-backs under former Inter boss Simone Inzaghi, making a huge contribution last season in the form of 11 goals as the Italian giants reached the Champions League final.",
      "However, Inzaghi’s departure in the summer resulted in growing speculation over the 29-year-old’s potential exit, with reports claiming that he had a £21.6m release clause in his contract until mid-July.",
      "The Red Devils had been linked with a move for the Dutchman since 2024, with Dumfries being a perfect fit for Ruben Amorim’s favoured 3-4-2-1 formation, given his physical prowess on the right-flank and talent when attacking and defending.",
      "Those links re-emerged this summer, as Dumfries would have been a major upgrade on Amorim’s existing right wing-back options Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui. But United ultimately didn't end up submitting a bid for Dumfries and the defender has since played the full 90 minutes of Inter’s two Serie A fixtures, scoring one goal already.",
      "However, Dumfries has now made it known to potential suitors that he is open to a move to the Premier League in the future, should the opportunity present itself. Dumfries said after his goal in the Netherlands’ 1-1 draw with Poland last week: “The Premier League is a fantastic competition.",
      "“I’m happy at Inter, but I think I could also do very well in England. If there were a professional opportunity, I would certainly be interested.",
      "“The Premier League is known for its intensity, while Serie A is known for its tactical ability. These are two different approaches to football. The Champions League, however, always offers exciting clashes.”",
      "A move to the English top flight would see Dumfries come face-to-face with a number of his international team-mates, with 14 of the latest Dutch squad’s stars currently playing their football in England.",
      "One Dutch player not involved in the recent World Cup qualifiers was Jeremie Frimpong of Liverpool. Frimpong, also a highly-rated wing-back, was another target of United’s but joined the Reds of Merseyside for £29.5m this summer, dealing another blow to Amorim.",
      "Dumfries, meanwhile, has already been given a stamp of approval by none other than Gary Neville, the greatest right-back in United’s history.",
      "“With the way Man United are playing with a back-five and wing-backs under Ruben Amorim, I was thinking about that right wing-back,” the pundit said of Dumfries after Inter’s thrilling Champions League win over Barcelona last season.",
      "“I was thinking about Dumfries for United. I would like to see him in the Premier League, wouldn’t you? How good was he? He was unbelievable. He’s so good, so good.”",

      "Ruben Amorim demonstrated his ruthless streak by cutting no fewer than four players whose signings were questioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The Manchester United boss swung the axe in a sweeping summer of change at Old Trafford, where the departures were just as pertinent to the squad as those arriving at the club.",
      "One of the major priorities for minority owner Ratcliffe since coming through the doors at Old Trafford has been cutting waste. And the British billionaire namechecked five first-team stars earlier this year when referring to players who cost a combined £340million when joining United, in addition to some exorbitant salaries.",
      "Of those five players - Rasmus Hojlund (£72m transfer fee), Jadon Sancho (£73m), Antony (£81m), Andre Onana (£43m) and Casemiro (£70m) - only two are still at the club, with Onana on the verge of joining Trabzonspor on loan. And it shows a sense of urgency from Amorim and United's backroom team to bring the squad back into balance.",
      "Speaking to BBC Sport in March of this year, Ratcliffe spoke of player he and his team inherited from their predecessors who arrived on inflated wages and fees that perhaps weren't justified: \"If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn't buy, we're buying Antony, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying Onana, we're buying Hojlund, we're buying Sancho.",
      "\"These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we've inherited those things and have to sort that out. For Sancho, who now plays for Chelsea and we pay half his wages, we're paying £17m to buy him in the summer.\"",
      "Of that group, Sancho has again left on loan for Aston Villa, while Hojlund has joined Napoli on temporary terms and Antony has moved to Real Betis permanently. Onana is close to joining Super Lig outfit Trabzonspor on a season-long deal, while Casemiro looks set to see out what could be the final year of his United contract this term.",
      "The Brazil international is United's highest earner on £350,000 a week, a steep expense for a player poised to turn 34 in January. Loaning out Sancho (£250,000 a week) and Hojlund (£85,000 a week) will save the Red Devils more than £1million per month, while Marcus Rashford's loan to Barcelona has added another £300,000 or so to the weekly budget.",
      "The cost-cutting has come at a cost, however, both literal and in the sense that United's image has been hurt by certain money missteps in years gone by. The sale of Antony, for example, will remain a stain on their reputation after buying the player for more than £80m three years ago, only to sell him for just £19m this summer.",
      "The struggle to find a permanent suitor for perennial loanee Sancho is another indicator not everyone wants the assets United strained to sign in recent years. Not every major United expense in the modern era has been a failure, of course, but Ratcliffe is focused on siphoning out some of those poorer deals.",
      "\"Some are not good enough and some probably are overpaid, but for us to mould the squad that we are fully responsible for, and accountable for, will take time,\" he continued when speaking to the BBC earlier this year.",
      "\"We've got this period of transformation where we move from the past to the future. There are some great players in the squad as we know, the captain is a fabulous footballer. We definitely need Bruno, he's a fantastic footballer.\"",
      "Fans will hope star recruits Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko can soon join that list of verified transfer successes after remoulding their attack. And they'll have a big opportunity to do just that if they can perform in Sunday's derby showdown against Manchester City.",

      "It could be said that Alejandro Garnacho's time at Manchester United was dogged by inconsistency. Yet the one constant was his unique relationship with club captain Bruno Fernandes, who took on the role as the player's mentor through frequent bouts of tough love.",
      "From scoring award-winning goals and lifting the Carabao and FA Cup to being banished from the first team under United boss Ruben Amorim, Garnacho traversed some extreme highs and lows for the Red Devils. Signing from Atletico Madrid for just £420,000 in October 2020, United sold the 21-year-old to Chelsea this summer for £40million.",
      "The Argentinian endured a rocky final few months at Old Trafford following a plethora of behavioural issues. A breakdown in relations between player and club reached a tipping point after the winger publicly questioned Amorim's decision to bench him for the Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur in May.",
      "In November 2023, Garnacho scored a remarkable opening goal in United's 3-0 win at Everton, a stunning overhead kick that went on to win FIFA's Puskas award. Afterwards, Fernandes was careful to not shower the youngster with too much praise and, instead, focused on keeping the Argentine's feet on the ground after his biggest moment in a United shirt yet.",
      "After Fernandes had assisted Garnacho, then 18, against Wolves in May 2023, the United captain admitted he was trying to help nurture his team-mate, although the youngster's penchant for only listening to instructions when he wished was proving to be a stumbling block.",
      "\"What I have to say to Garnacho, I say to him at the training ground, whenever we are eating, on the training ground, wherever. If he wants to hear, he hears,\" Fernandes candidly said.",
      "\"If not, he doesn't, but I try to help. I think he did an interview talking about me trying to help him a lot of times, and that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "Fernandes was unafraid to publicly call him out when he felt his team-mate needed reprimanding. Garnacho didn't play a minute of any of United's four friendlies in Thailand and Australia in the summer of 2022 and he was rebuked by former manager Erik ten Hag for being late to team activities on several occasions.",
      "After Garnacho scored in a Europa League tie in November 2022, Fernandes conceded that his younger colleague's attitude was holding him back at the start of that season. He said: \"At the beginning of the season he was not at his best.",
      "\"In the [pre-season] tour he didn’t have the best attitude that he should have, and that’s why he didn’t get his chances until now. He’s getting his chances because he’s training better, he’s got a different attitude and he’s deserving his chances.\"",
      "While Garnacho may have left for Stamford Bridge under a cloud, he made sure to address his former captain on social media upon leaving Old Trafford.",
      "With a post that demonstrated just how significance Fernandes' guidance was to him, the now-Chelsea star posted: \"Thanks for everything you did for me, I love you [kiss emoji],\" accompanying an image from United's thrilling 3-3 stalemate with Galatasaray in November 2023.",
      "In a classy touch, the message also marked Fernandes' 31st birthday. Garnacho could now make his Chelsea debut on Saturday evening against Brentford at the G-tech Community Stadium. Fernandes, meanwhile, will continue to spearhead Amorim's attempted revival of his flailing United side, safe in the knowledge that he did all he could to help nurture Garnacho's talent, even if his pleas for professionalism failed to hit the mark as intended.",

      "Omar Marmoush will be unavailable for City after suffering a knee ligament injury during Egypt’s World Cup qualifier against Burkina Faso on Tuesday.

      "City released a statement on Wednesday which read: \"Initial results on a scan performed in Egypt indicate he will not be available for the Manchester derby on Sunday, and he will now return to Manchester for more assessment and to begin his rehabilitation. Everyone at City wishes Omar a speedy recovery.\"",

      "Haaland has already scored three times in as many Premier League games this term, but Pep Guardiola's side have just three points from a possible nine. They need to see off their local rivals this weekend and Haaland looks primed.",
      "The City marksman bagged three goals in 32 first-half minutes at the Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo to net his fifth hat-trick for his country. He would add two more in the second-half and also produce another two assists to keep the scoreboard rolling over. Rangers midfielder Thelo Aasgaard came off the bench to score four second-half goals.",

      "Arsenal star Odegaard admitted that it was a dream to play with Haaland, as he heaped praise on the City frontman: “It's a dream to play with him. I know he times the runs perfectly. Then it's just a matter of hitting, and then it mostly goes to the finish when he gets it.”",
      "Even compatriot and Fulham star Sander Berge confessed sometimes he sits back and simply enjoys watching the duo go to work: “These are two of the world's best footballers. When they do it in the Premier League, you almost expect them to do it when they get so much space. There are some sick goals of course, but they are on that shelf. Then you just have to enjoy yourself and watch.”",
      "Haaland scored the opening goal in City's last game before Brighton staged a late comeback to beat Pep Guardiola's side. It leaves them six points off league leaders Liverpool and they can ill-afford to drop any more points if they want to retain title ambitions.",

      "Andre Onana is closing in on his Manchester United exit but his spell away with Cameroon will not have filled him with joy following his part in Cape Verde's winning goal.",
      "The two African nations squared off in what was a top of the table clash in qualifying, but the shotstopper who is set to join Turkish side Trabzonspor, did little to cover himself in glory.",
      "His error came in the 53rd minute when Cape Verde striker Rocha Livramento won back possession as he shrugged off a Cameroon midfielder on halfway before driving through the heart of their defence. It eventually left him one-on-one with Onana.",
      "The goalkeeper decided to stay on his line, but his second mistake came as he dived the wrong way as Livramento's shot struck the back of the net. Cape Verde's victory saw them seal their place in a World Cup for the first time in their history.",
      "Cameroon though now find themselves in second place and may have to compete in a play-off to earn their place at the World Cup despite boasting some stellar names like Carlos Baleba and Onana's United team-mate Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Onana's move to Turkey is expected to be announced imminently and will bring be a pause to his error-stern time in Manchester. He was signed by Erik ten Hag two years ago and has largely remained the first choice under Ruben Amorim, but has continued to make a number of high profile mistakes.",
      "His latest blunder coming when he tried to claim a delivery into the box against Grimsby, only for the play to end with the ball in the back of the United net.The 29-year-old has incredibly managed to doubled his salary by agreeing to join the club and will travel to Turkey straight from Africa.",
      "United will not receive a loan fee and there is no option for the Turkish club to sign Onana permanently when his deal runs out, meaning he will return to Manchester when a decision will have to be made on his future. The goalkeeper had impressed at Ajax and Inter Milan previously, but hugely struggled in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim had rejected suggestions he would be moved on during the summer, but has started with Altay Bayindir for the three league games so far, albeit Onana was injured in pre-season. On deadline day the club also completed the signing of the 23-year-old Belgian Senne Lammens for £18.3million.",

      "However, with the Grangemouth oil refinery shutting its doors in April 2025, Brian Gilvary, the executive chairman of Ineos Energy, has admitted that further investment in the UK is now off the table.",

      "In simple terms, this would enable the American majority stakeholders to sell their entire shares of the club, including those of Ineos, to another buyer without Ratcliffe being able to prevent it.",
      "These clauses are typically included to stop minority stakeholders from holding the majority to ransom by refusing to sell. Ratcliffe has openly acknowledged this clause and hinted that he hopes it won't be triggered, but he could find himself in a sticky situation if Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani decided to renew his interest.",

      "While Casemiro could not feature against Bolivia in the early hours of Wednesday morning due to the number of yellow cards he has accumulated, the Daily Mail understands the midfielder requested his early release from the squad.",
      "It is believed that Casemiro was eager to return to United in order to be fighting fit for the Manchester derby this Sunday. The former Real Madrid now is thought to already be back at Carrington training ahead of the fixture.",
      "So far this season, Casemiro has been an integral member of Ruben Amorim's squad. He has started all three of United's opening Premier League matches after the Reds failed to strengthen in the centre of the park.",
      "And while Amorim is growing ever more reliant on the Brazilian midfielder, Ancelotti was similarly effusive in his praise. He said: “Looking for a midfielder with Casemiro’s characteristics is impossible.",

      "Trabzonspor are expected to foot the bill for Onana's wages - a major boost for United - and the goalkeeper will also enjoy a pay rise thanks to Turkey's 20 per cent tax rate for Super Lig players. Tyrell Malacia could also be jetting off to Turkey.",
      "The Dutch defender's loan move to PSV Eindhoven last season wasn't made permanent and a late transfer move to Spanish side Elche fell through. The 26 year-old has already caught the eye of clubs in Turkey and Saudi Arabia this summer.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been accused of taking a risk that no other Premier League manager would in signing Senne Lammens. The Belgian goalkeeper joined Manchester United on transfer deadline day after completing an £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Former Red Devils No.1 Andre Onana is now set to leave for a season-long loan with Turkish side Trabzonspor following a series of high-profile mistakes. It remains unclear if Lammens will be used as United's starting keeper straight away after Altay Bayindir began the season as Amorim's first-choice shot-stopper.",
      "However, he too has come under scrutiny for his role in Riccardo Calafiori's goal during United's Premier League opening day defeat to Arsenal. Despite the club's existing woes between the sticks, ex-United and Wrexham keeper Ben Foster has warned that Amorim will be making a dangerous decision if he expects 23-year-old Lammens to start games in the top flight.",
      "\"Manchester United have got a kid from the Belgian league, who's never played for the Belgian first team,\" Foster said on his Fozcast podcast.",
      "\"He's played about 60 first-team games in his career and they're expecting this guy to be able to adapt to not only the Premier League, but adapt to Manchester United as well. It just reeks of sticking a band aid [plaster] on it.",
      "\"I wouldn't expect any Premier League team to sign a goalkeeper from the Belgian league who's never played for the national team, not even a newly promoted team, and not as a starter. It's such a risk.\"",
      "Lammens only let in 32 goals across 30 appearances in Belgium's top flight for Royal Antwerp last term, registering seven clean sheets during the season. He also won the division's player of the month award twice, making 173 saves throughout the campaign, and believes he can bring stability to United's leaky defence.",
      "\"I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence,\" said Lammens. \"They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. Of course, I can improve in this because the next level is bigger, but it is one of my attributes that I am proud of and I try to improve.",
      "\"My parents are also really calm and collected, but [I also developed this mentality] from growing up, when I was in the youth team and I thought about the goalkeeper I wanted to become later in life.",
      "\"I think one of the best attributes you can have as a goalkeeper is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake or something. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Real Madrid and Belgium star Thibaut Courtois reckons United have signed a \"huge talent\" in Lammens. Courtois shared his thoughts on the move with Rio Ferdinand, who then relayed the keeper's verdict on his countryman via his YouTube channel.",
      "Ferdinand said: \"He let me know about Lammens because he's a Belgian player, and he was just giving me the heads up as to what he's like.",
      "\"He said he's a huge talent, obviously not experienced yet but he thinks his style will be well-suited to the Premier League as well. That's a recommendation from probably one of the best three goalkeepers in the world, Thibaut Courtois, so I'll take that.\"",

      "\"It’s funny with Sancho because he got the reputation with Borussia Dortmund,” said Carragher.",
      "“When you say he’s the worst Manchester United signing because of his ability… I’m not sure there’s much ability there. I think he’s okay, but I don’t understand what his thing is.",

      "Carragher was right and wrong with his Sancho assessment. He is entitled to his opinion and can refer to leaving him out of his hypothetical England squad as proof that he never rated him, but the numbers, data and eye test all confirmed Sancho had significant potential during his time at Dortmund.",
      "United can be criticised in 2025 for splashing £72.9million on Sancho, but that transfer fee felt like value at the time, especially with Manchester City signing Jack Grealish for £100m in the same summer.",
      "By his own admission, Carragher made his initial assessment of Sancho by watching small clips, and you can't form a true opinion of a player without watching them closely for a run of games.",
      "Anyone who watched Sancho properly in Germany saw a teenager brimming with talent, a fascinating English player who bravely decided to leave City to pursue a career in Europe.",
      "In the three seasons before Sancho signed for United, Raheem Sterling (110) was the only English player to record more goal involvements (goals and assists) than Sancho's 109). Harry Kane (106) and Marcus Rashford (94) came next.",
      "Of course, Sancho was producing those numbers in the Bundesliga, but he was a threat in the Champions League and seemed destined for the top.",
      "It's a massive shame that Sancho's career hasn't unfolded like everyone hoped it would. The 25-year-old has been majorly disappointing, but that doesn't undo his previous achievements.",
      "It is fair to criticise Sancho for the last few years. He faced the embarrassment of Chelsea breaking their obligation to sign him this summer, which cost the London club a £5m penalty charge, and he was fortunate that Aston Villa were in panic mode in the final days of the transfer window.",
      "Carragher argued he doesn't know Sancho's strengths. That is a fair comment based on his performances in the Premier League and United fans wondered the same when they took their seat at Old Trafford.",
      "That wasn't the case when Dortmund fans watched Sancho at Signal Iduna Park. He possessed flair, was exceptionally creative in tight spaces around the box and intelligently combined with teammates.",
      "With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps Sancho's skillset wasn't going to be a match for the Premier League, and he might still be on an upward trajectory if he'd continued plying his trade in Europe.",
      "Sancho's career has been on a downward spiral. He has regressed on the pitch and there have been concerns about his application at times. Sancho has been a shadow of his former self for a while.",
      "Proper recognition of the first part of Sancho's career is why his decline is so sad.",

In the end, we all made an effort, we did our part, and so did the player and United,\" he said. \"On Sunday, during the match against Athletic, the relationship was very tense. Around noon, United sent the draft contract and asked us to make the changes. It was clear that they were going to comply with our requests.",
      "\"In the early hours of Sunday morning, at 2:00 a.m., we received confirmation. In the morning, we closed the accounting for Antony’s future capital gains because we wanted to have the ability to recover the investment. It was one of the most problematic points, but we resolved it.",
      "\"Sunday at 2:00 a.m. is when the situation was unblocked, and we started looking for a plane so he could come on Monday afternoon. There was still a bit of stress because everything was agreed upon, but we had to wait for the Manchester United owners in the United States to sign, and they did so at 3:00 p.m. on Monday.",
      "\"We’ve launched a clothing line with Antony, we’re participating with him through royalties, and he’ll also have some non-sporting income from that merchandising. If he ends up being the world star he has been, we at Betis hope to recover the investment and even what it cost us the previous year. It carries a certain risk because this is locked in for five years and at a high cost, but you can potentially reap benefits.",
      "\"It’s the most difficult signing I’ve made as CEO because there was a lot of pressure from all the Betis fans. It was taken for granted that he was coming; everyone was asking when he was coming.\"",

      "I think Manchester United will try again for Baleba in 2026. Intensity in midfield is what Ruben Amorim keeps repeating in every meeting they have at Manchester United. I think they will go for that kind of player, with Baleba as a top target in 2026.",

      "Andre Onana furiously ranted at Harry Maguire when a slack pass from the defender gifted Borussia Dortmund a chance during Manchester United's final pre-season friendly in the USA in 2023.",
      "Maguire kept his cool while he was berated. Some fans said the reaction was unnecessary in a friendly, while other supporters were pleased to see Onana quickly lay down the law.",
      "Just weeks later, Onana was fortunate not to chuck away three points against Wolves on his debut when he crashed into Sasa Kalajdzic in the box and failed to make contact with the ball.",
      "Wolves were denied a blatant penalty and the PGMOL apologised to a dumbfounded Gary O'Neil.",
      "Onana got away with the huge error on his debut, but the episode foreshadowed his topsy-turvy stint at Old Trafford, which has culminated in Trabzonspor being on the cusp of signing him on loan.",
      "Onana signed from Inter Milan in a deal worth £47million and was expected to be a transformative signing. In reality, he has struggled to back up his vociferous nature with substance.",
      "The Cameroon international's performances in the Champions League group stage in his first season were error-strewn. And the first mistake Onana made came during a narrow defeat to Bayern Munich in September 2023, allowing Leroy Sane's tame shot to trickle through his fingertips.",
      "Onana requested to speak to the media following the final whistle, saying: \"I'm the one who let the team down. The team were good, but because of me, we didn't win this game, so we just have to move on. This is the life of a goalkeeper and if we didn't win today, it's on me.\"",
      "United fans respected Onana for taking responsibility for his error during the interview. Two clean sheets followed that night in Germany and it seemed like he'd turned a corner.",
      "But an awful performance in the Champions League against Galatasaray, in which he gifted the opposition a penalty and went down far too easily for the matchwinner, followed.",
      "There was redemption against Copenhagen, with Onana saving a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 1-0 victory, but United finished bottom of their group with just four points.",
      "Onana was partly to blame for the club's worst performance in the Champions League group stage.",
      "He began to improve in the winter, demonstrating impressive resilience to deliver strong displays in the Premier League. He notably kept a clean sheet in an ugly 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield in December 2023, becoming the first goalkeeper to do so that season. He ended his first season strongly and started 2024/2025 in the same vein of form.",
      "Onana won the Premier League's save of the month award for his double stop against Crystal Palace in September 2024 and somehow bettered it against Fenerbahce in October. Then it all started to go downhill for when United lost 2-0 against Arsenal in December.",
      "The Cameroon international conceded two goals from corners, which was followed by a mistake against Nottingham Forest and another error against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League.",
      "Then the Lyon debacle happened in April. Nemanja Matic said Onana was \"statistically one of the worst goalkeepers in Man United modern history\" before the first leg, and Onana was subsequently at fault for both goals.",
      "United pulled off a special victory against Lyon in the reverse match at Old Trafford and Onana sprinted to embrace Ruben Amorim on the touchline when Maguire got him out of jail.",
      "But fans lost patience with Onana last season and will be relieved to see him leave on loan.",
      "Erratic is probably the perfect word to describe Onana. He is not a goalkeeper who can be relied upon and can make embarrassing howlers at unexpected moments during matches.",
      "United allowed David de Gea to leave upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 because his mistakes had become too regular and some performances were indefensible.",
      "Onana has made a similar number of errors at United without having the previous credit that De Gea had banked. It was still the correct decision to allow De Gea to leave because United needed to sign a modern goalkeeper, but it's impossible to reject the suggestion that the succession was botched.",
      "Onana prepared for this season under the assumption he would remain at Old Trafford, but Amorim has axed him from his plans and a joint decision was made to send him on loan.",
      "Altay Bayindir has begun the campaign as first choice between the sticks. Onana was recalled to face Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and made a mistake for their second goal, which means he has made a shocking nine errors leading to a goal since the beginning of last season.",
      "Sources close to the player have noted he will receive a pay rise in Turkey, partly due to the low tax rate for Super Lig players and the signing-on fee he will receive. They are clutching at straws to try to find positives.",
      "Onana has suffered a spectacular fall from grace. He started in a Champions League final in June 2023, but will now play for a club that is not even considered among Turkey's traditional powerhouses.",
      "The failure to cut out mistakes has cost Onana his career in Manchester.",

      "Manchester United loanee Rasmus Hojlund has sent his support to Ayden Heaven after the centre-back shared a cryptic post of boxing legend Mike Tyson.",
      "Heaven has found game time hard to come by so far this season having only made a three minute cameo in the Premier League away at Fulham. When the Englishman joined in January, he was thrust straight into the spotlight of the first-team as injuries forced Ruben Amorim into playing the teenager.",
      "The former Arsenal man is still a firm member of the first-team squad but could lose his place on the bench once Lisandro Martinez returns from injury. With Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw's long-term futures most likely away from United, this may well be just a temporary setback for the promising defender.",
      "During the September international break, Heaven was called up to the England U20s squad which hosted Italy at Chesterfield's SMH Group Stadium. The defender played 65 minutes in North Derbyshire before being replaced in the 2-1 friendly defeat.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Now back with United at Carrington, the 18-year-old shared a few images from his time with the England set-up before ending the post with an image of Tyson sitting in his dressing room with his trainer Cus D'Amato watching over him. The reason behind including Tyson in the post is unclear but a number of United players responded to the post.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes, Matthijs de Ligt, Patrick Dorgu and Leny Yoro were among the United players to 'like' the post while Hojlund simply replied: \"Cool,\" in the comments section. The striker is currently on loan at Napoli after agreeing a summer transfer deadline day exit to the Italian club.",
      "After Benjamin Sesko was bought from RB Leipzig, it became clear that Hojlund's game time was going to become seriously impacted. Once Italian clubs started to show interest, the Dane leaned towards Napoli as they offered him long-term certainty.",
      "Hojlund has joined Napoli on loan but will make his switch permanent for £38m should certain conditions be met this season. As for Heaven, he will be hopeful of a place in the United squad on Sunday when they travel to Manchester City.",

      "Manchester United agreed to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers one day after their season ended this summer.",
      "Less than 24 hours after they concluded their post-season tour in Hong Kong, the club confirmed they had agreed to the signing, subject to visa and registration. United confirmed the transfer 11 days later on June 12, after Cunha signed a contract.",
      "That was the first time they signed a player in June for six years, dating back to Daniel James joining the club from Swansea City. United, though, will not be able to make moves at such an early stage of next summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Neither will any other clubs, because the summer window will not open until June 15. This year, the window began on June 1, the day United announced their agreement to sign Cunha, but that was an earlier date than usual due to the Club World Cup kicking off on June 14.",
      "As such, FIFA allowed for an extraordinary transfer window to run between June 1-10 before reopening on June 16. But with no Club World Cup this coming summer - the next edition is scheduled for 2029 - normal service will resume.",
      "The window will instead start during the early days of the World Cup across Canada, Mexico and the United States on June 15. Clubs, however, can still agree on signings before the market begins.",
      "It means that, in 2026, United will not be permitted to conduct activity as early as they did to sign Cunha. Instead they will be required to wait until the transfer window opens at a more regular time on June 15.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",
      "United director of football Jason Wilcox expressed the club's delight at being able to recruit Cunha so quickly this summer. \"Bringing in Matheus was one of our main priorities for this summer, so we are delighted to have completed his signing so early in the window,\" he said.",
      "The player also alluded to the advantage of signing before the players returned for training. \"I can't wait for the start of pre-season to get to know my team-mates and prepare for the season ahead,\" he said.",

      "Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo was seen consoling Carlos Baleba after the pair were on the receiving end of a shock result in the international break.",
      "The £71m signing and the Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder were representing Cameroon in the African World Cup qualification matches. The Indomitable Lions were heavy favourites against Cape Verde, who have never qualified for the competition in their football history.",
      "However, Dailon Livramento's second half goal saw the tiny African nation, which is located in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa, secure a shock 1-0 victory. Cameroon were left shell-shocked after the match, which has thrown a spanner in their hopes of qualifying for the competition in the USA, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The crowd at the Estadio Nacional de Cabo Verde was so stunned by the victory - which leaves them on the verge of guaranteeing automatic qualification for the 2026 competition - that a huge pitch invasion took place.",
      "Fortunately for Mbeumo, he had been substituted before the final whistle, which gave him an opportunity to seek out Baleba before the thousands of Cape Verdeans came onto the pitch.",
      "Mbeumo actions towards the United transfer target suggests he could be key if the club act on their interest in Baleba and attempt to bring him to Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim's side were linked with a move for the Seagulls midfielder, but did not put forward an official bid for his services.",
      "As Mbeumo was trying to calm Baleba, Hojlund offered Amorim a glimpse of what might have been. The Dane fell out of favour at United and left the club.",
      "Hojlund, 22, secured a loan move to Napoli, which will become a £38m permanent move if the defending Serie A winners qualify for the Champions League. During his time with Denmark, the £72m signing from Atalanta scored in his nation's 3-0 away victory over Greece.",
      "It was a significant goal from a United perspective, as Hojlund's goal came courtesy of an assist from Patrick Dorgu. With the latter often being one of the furthest players forward as a result of Amorim encouraging his wing-backs to attack, the United boss' first ever signing assisting Hojlund might have been a regular sight at Old Trafford had things gone differently.",
      "Despite his disappointment at being shipped out of United, Italian outlet Tuttomercatoweb claimed Hojlund was seen training with his new Napoli team-mates, less than 24 hours after returning from international duty. It's a clear sign he will be doing everything he can to prove United wrong.",
      "He said: \"It’s different now, obviously, as I come with more experience and I’m a better football player. I come with a lot of international experience, I played in the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, and in multiple countries. I come with a lot to prove.",
      "\"I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good. I always work hard, I like to say I want to die on the pitch, to give everything for the team, to score goals, create, and fight for everything.”",

      "Wayne Rooney's 15-year-old son Kai has declared 'life can't get worse' following a devastating injury for the Manchester United's youth player.",
      "The 35-year-old Rooney, who claimed countless honours at Old Trafford, harbours hopes that his eldest child might emulate his remarkable career.",
      "But Kai has picked up an injury, reports the Mirror. Prior to this setback, Kai had been experiencing a meteoric rise through the ranks at his father's former club.",
      "He had recently earned promotion to the United Under-19s squad, where he was competing alongside players four years his senior.",
      "The call-up was followed with a spectacular strike for the Under-18s, as he unleashed a left-footed volley that nestled in the top corner.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "But any upward trajectory he had built must now be rebuilt during an enforced spell away from action. Kai shared a mirror selfie displaying the protective boot encasing his right foot.",
      "Accompanying the image, he said: \"Life can't get worse\" complete with a weeping emoji.",
      "The exact nature of his injury or the duration of his absence remains uncertain.",
      "Nevertheless, the sentiment expressed in his social media post hints it could be considerable time before he wears a United shirt again.",
      "Whilst he has yet to capture public attention in the manner of his legendary father, he has significant potential.",
      "The youngster usually plays in a central position for United, mirroring Rooney Sr's role, but has also shown his versatility by performing well in wider areas.",
      "His standout performance came during the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland earlier this summer, a tournament in which his father also shone as a budding talent at Everton.",
      "Wayne, alongside wife Coleen and their youngest sons Kit and Cass, was seen cheering on Kai from the sidelines.",
      "When asked about the influence he has had on his son's burgeoning football career, the former England captain revealed that he prefers to let Kai find his own way in the game rather than inundating him with advice.",
      "In an interview with BBC Sport, Rooney said: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist. So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing.",
      "\"I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",
      "Rooney also praised the coaching staff at United, stating: \"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand off approach. I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",
      "Kai has been a part of the United academy since he was 11 years old. He joined the youth system in 2020.",

      "Manchester United's recruitment in recent years can best be described as embarrassing.",
      "The fact that you can count on one hand, potentially two if you are feeling generous, the number of new signings that have made a lasting and respectable impact on this squad in the last few seasons says all you need to know about the problems which Ruben Amorim is trying to fix. Too many United players have crumbled under the pressure of attempting to put this club back on its pedestal.",
      "Not all can be blamed. Many had little to no experience of playing for a club of this magnitude and struggled to handle the weight of expectation which comes with such a shirt.",
      "However, a new worrying trend which is starting to rear its head in recent times is players that leave United suddenly manage to discover some of their best form - perhaps of their career to date - away from Old Trafford. Take last season as an example for the theory.",
      "Scott McTominay at Napoli and Antony at Real Betis respectively, performed sensationally for their new clubs. While there is an argument to suggest that McTominay had shown signs of this incredible up turn before leaving, Antony looked far from the player he has become in Spain.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Brazilian flourished in La Liga and it is not simply a case that he is playing against lesser opposition now, he simply appears to be more confident on the pitch than he ever was at United. Now, Rasmus Hojlund appears primed to show the Reds exactly what they are missing in Italy.",
      "The Dane appears to be a man on a mission after scoring against Greece in World Cup qualifying this week. Less than 24 hours after that goal, the 22-year-old flew to Napoli to begin training with his new teammates.",
      "Hojlund will undoubtedly feel confident that he can perform in Serie A having done so for Atalanta previously but if he does, United must address why this keeps happening. Is the club fostering an environment which is detrimental to player performance?",
      "Are the coaches struggling to handle the rigours of the Premier League and this is being passed on to the players? Or, are United simply giving opportunities to players who would be better served at clubs lower down the pyramid?",
      "There needs to be a serious discussion surrounding this at United. It is no good just looking on and scratching their heads wondering how another player has shown their true potential at another club.",
      "I refuse to believe that United have consistently signed players that are not good enough to play for a club of this stature. There has to be a deeper reasoning behind it and until that has been figured out, United cannot expect to make the major steps to return themselves to the very top.",

      "United sit above City in the table and they know that a draw, while not the triumphant bragging rights that supporters crave, would be a positive result away from home. However, there is every reason for Reds fans to feel confident they can pick up all three points.",
      "City find themselves with an injury crisis heading into the fixture and United know that if Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot's injuries have cleared up, they shall be able to field Ruben Amorim's first choice team this weekend. What's more, United have two players who could be added to their strongest squad as soon as Sunday to boost their chances further.",
      "Defence may be one of the strongest areas of the pitch for United. The Reds are starting to look more comfortable in the three at the back system with their centre halves suiting Amorim's vision.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "But add to that selection dilemma Lisandro Martinez and suddenly it looks even stronger still. The Argentine has been out of action since February and there are no definite signs that he will be fit to make the squad against City.",
      "However, he has been back on the grass at Carrington and the hope is that he will not be too far off a return to the matchday squad. Were he be available for the derby, he would likely be among the substitutes at the Etihad Stadium taking Ayden Heaven's place in the squad.",
      "While potentially harsh on Heaven, Martinez has proven time and again that he gets United and has the right mentality to represent the club. Just having his voice back in the dressing room would be a huge lift for the club and undoubtedly make United stronger.",
      "From one area that has been coping well to another which hasn't - the goalkeeping department. Andre Onana is set to depart for Trabzonspor meaning his place will need to be taken in the squad.",
      "Fortunately, Senne Lammens was signed to replace the Cameroonian and it will be interesting to see if he is thrown in at the deep end or not on Sunday. Altay Bayindir has been the first choice in the Premier League this season but he has already made mistakes that have questioned his entitlement to start.",
      "Will Lammens be given the nod to start? Time will tell but the Belgian could well be handed a place in his first matchday squad at United for the game, even if he starts on the bench.",

      "Manchester United forward Matheus Cunha has suggested that his recovery from injury is progressing well and hinted that he could be fit for Sunday's trip to Manchester City in the Premier League.",
      "United fans were left holding their collective breaths before the international break when the Brazilian was forced off the pitch in the victory over Burnley. It appeared at the time that Cunha had suffered a hamstring injury, although that was not confirmed.",
      "Further worry was created when Cunha pulled out of the Brazil national team squad for the September international break, leading many to wonder whether he would recover in time for the clash against City. Fortunately, during the break, Cunha has remained in good spirits and has hit the gym hard to recuperate.",
      "On Sunday, Cunha took to Instagram to share a series of images from his gym session with his latest one that evening perhaps hinting that he could return this weekend. Pictured in good spirits, the 26-year-old captioned the post: \"Sunday's,\" with a smirking smile emoji.",
      "The meaning behind the post is, of course, up for interpretation. On the one hand, it may simply be a caption relating to the day of the week he was training.",
      "However, the emoji could lead to the interpretation that he is nearing full fitness again and that 'Sunday's' fixture against City will be his return to the field. If that is the case, it would be a welcome relief for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Cunha has been a mainstay in the strikeforce so far this season and Amorim will be hopeful of having the strongest team available to him for the fixture at the Etihad Stadium. In recent years, United have entered the derby as underdogs but could have grounds to argue that they are favourites this time round as they sit above their neighbours at this admittedly early stage of the campaign.",
      "As well as Cunha, Amorim shall also be awaiting promising news on Mason Mount, Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez's conditions ahead of the fixture.",

      "An Athletic Club player who faced Manchester United in the Europa League semi-final last season failed a doping test after the clash against Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "Yeray Alvarez, 30, started at centre-back for the La Liga heavyweights when United overcame them 3-0 in the first leg at San Mames. After the match, he was selected for a random drug test by officials at the stadium.",
      "Just over four months later, UEFA have released a statement revealing the defender tested positive for a banned substance and has since \"accepted a voluntary provisional suspension, having effect from that date.\" The Spaniard has since claimed the substance within his body has come from a treatment he used to combat alopecia.",
      "In their statement, UEFA wrote: \"On 1 May 2025, Athletic Club player Yeray Alvarez underwent an in-competition doping control carried out by UEFA following a UEFA Europa League match.",
      "\"The analysis of the player's sample by a WADA-accredited laboratory revealed the presence of Canrenone, which is a substance prohibited in- (and out-) of competition under the category S5. Diuretics and Masking Agents of the 2025 WADA Prohibited List.",
      "\"On 2 June 2025, the player accepted a voluntary provisional suspension having effect from that date. Following the opening of disciplinary proceedings against the player - on 10 June 2025 - two UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspectors conducted an investigation and the case was submitted to the UEFA disciplinary bodies for decision.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"At its meeting on 19 August 2025, the relevant UEFA disciplinary body decided to suspend the player for 10 months, starting from the date of the provisional suspension (i.e. 2 June 2025) and ending on 2 April 2026, for committing a non-intentional anti-doping rule violation.",
      "\"In accordance with Article 10.14.2 of the UEFA Anti-Doping Regulations, the player may return to train with a team or use the facilities of a club in the last two months of his period of ineligibility, i.e. as of 2 February 2026.\"",
      "Speaking on his social media page, Alvarez wrote: \"After studying the case, we have established that I tested positive because I unintentionally took a hair loss prevention medicine containing a banned substance.",
      "\"The disciplinary procedure is currently under investigation and subject to confidentiality - so I am provisionally suspended - and am not authorised to make any further public statements. I very much regret this situation but, with the support of the club, I am working on my defence in the belief that I will be able to return to the field of play as soon as possible.\"",
      "United comfortably overcame Athletic Club with goals from Casemiro and a first-half double from captain Bruno Fernandes. Amorim's side then followed up the away victory with a 4-1 triumph at Old Trafford, which saw Mason Mount score a brace and Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund get on the score-sheet.",
      "Alvarez has been at Athletic Club throughout his whole career, making 325 appearances for the Basque club. He played a huge role in his club's Copa Del Rey triumph in the 2023/24 campaign, the only major trophy he has won with his childhood club, so far.",
      "He will be unavailable for the majority of the campaign as a result of the failed test.",

      "Paul Pogba and Ravel Morrison led Manchester United to FA Youth Cup victory in 2011.",
      "The Youth Cup is the most prestigious competition in academy football and United have won it more than any other club. They last lifted the trophy at Old Trafford in 2021/22.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo helped to end a 10-year wait at United for more success in the competition, following a triumph from a supremely talented team in 2011.",
      "The Class of 2011 was considered to have so much promise, they were dubbed the next ‘Class of 92’.",
      "So where are the players now? We've taken a closer look at their respective career paths.",
      "The 32-year-old only completed a permanent move out of United in 2018 to join West Brom for around £6m. The goalkeeper had previously worked his way up the Football League during loan spells at Oldham, Scunthorpe, Walsall, Yeovil, Doncaster, Preston and Aston Villa.",
      "Johnstone had joined United in July 2009 and quickly became first choice for United’s youth team. The 6ft 4ins shot-stopper made over 150 appearances for West Brom before signing for Crystal Palace in 2022.",
      "He is now the second choice goalkeeper at Wolves and has won four caps for England.",
      "Keane had been at United since the age of 11, until he finally left to join Burnley in 2015 after a successful loan spell at Turf Moor. Keane's two years playing under Sean Dyche earned him plenty of attention and he joined Everton in 2017 for a fee that could rise to £30m.",
      "The centre-back is still an important player at Everton and has 12 England caps to his name.",
      "An Italian centre-half, Fornasier joined the United set up in 2009 from Fiorentina.",
      "Although he helped United lift the 2011 FA Youth Cup and appeared in the Under-21 Squad, he failed to make a first team appearance and headed back to Italy in 2013.",
      "Spells at Sampdoria, Pescara, Venezia, Parma, Trapani, Cremonese and Monopoli followed. Fornasier currently plays for Nardo in Serie D.",
      "A powerhouse of a defender, there were high hopes for Sean McGinty at United.",
      "Unfortunately, these failed to materialise and McGinty was sent out on loan to Morecambe, Oxford United, Carlisle United and Tranmere before finally leaving in 2013 to Sheffield United in search of first-team football.",
      "McGinty has subsequently played for Rochdale, Aldershot, Torquay United, Partick Thistle, Greenock Morton, Ayr United, Hamilton Academical and Airdrieonians.",
      "Another defender straight from the United academy who sadly couldn’t make the grade at Old Trafford. Although appearing for England at all youth levels, Thorpe struggled for appearances at Rotherham United, where he joined after leaving United permanently in 2015.",
      "After spells at Bradford, Bolton and ATK of the Indian Premier League, Thorpe had a break from professional football. He last played for Greater Manchester club Stalybridge Celtic in 2024.",
      "After making his United senior debut in a cup game against Newcastle in 2012, Tunnicliffe famously won his father £10,000 after he bet £100 at 100/1 that his son, aged nine at the time, would make a first-team appearance for the Reds.",
      "Sadly, it did not progress much beyond that for the Bury-born midfielder and he left the club in 2014 to join Fulham, signed by former United coach Rene Meulensteen. Tunnicliffe went on to make 59 appearances, scoring twice for the Cottagers.",
      "Loans at Wigan and Blackburn came next, followed by a free transfer to Millwall in 2017. Tunnicliffe then played for Luton and Portsmouth before signing for Australian club Adelaide.",
      "Where to start with Paul Pogba?",
      "He became United's record signing after leaving United for Juventus in 2012 under acrimonious circumstances before re-signing in 2016 for £89m.",
      "Pogba had been promoted to the first team by Sir Alex Ferguson for a FA Cup game against Crawley Town in 2011, however, first-team opportunities would later be hard to come by, with Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick ahead him.",
      "He would make three first-team appearances in the Premier League and Europa League before his free transfer to Juve.",
      "Pogba's second stint in Manchester did not hit the heights that were expected, although he did win the League Cup and Europa League during his six-year stay.",
      "He returned to Juventus in 2022, but he was suspended in September 2023 due to the failure of a drug test. Pogba's contract was ended by mutual consent at the end of last year and he made his return to football with Monaco this summer.",
      "Lingard joined United at the age of seven and as a reward for winning the FA Youth Cup, he was handed his first professional contract in the summer of 2011. He was soon sent out on loan, and Leicester City was the chosen destination, with Lingard going on to make his competitive debut at The Foxes.",
      "Lingard was again sent out on loan in 2013 by David Moyes to Birmingham and Brighton, while finally managing to break through to the first team in 2014.",
      "He famously scored the winning goal in the 2016 FA Cup final and he also scored the opening goal in United’s 2016 FA Community Shield win, while also netting in the 2017 League Cup Final.",
      "The forward hit his peak in 2018 where an impressive season for United was followed by his key role in England's fourth-placed finish at the 2018 World Cup. Lingard was excellent during a loan with West Ham in 2020/21, but he remained at United for another season and left permanently for Nottingham Forest in 2022.",
      "Lingard has been playing for South Korean K League club FC Seoul since his surprise move in February 2024.",
      "Arguably the key man in the Class of 2011, Morrison overshadowed fellow teammates Pogba and Lingard with his pace, flair and vision. United legend Gary Neville described Morrison as 'a Paul Gascoigne-type who could beat men and score some incredible goals'.",
      "But off-field issues undermined his talent and United reluctantly let Morrison go. In 2012, he joined then Championship side West Ham and after spells at QPR, Cardiff, Lazio, Club Atlas and Ostersunds, Morrison returned to England with Sheffield United in 2019.",
      "Morrison only made four appearances for the Blades. He joined Dutch club ADO Den Haag and later signed for Derby County, which was followed by a move to reunite with Wayne Rooney at D.C. United.",
      "The 32-year-old midfielder currently plays for Precision FC in Dubai.",
      "After starting his footballing career at Ajax, Van Velzen became one of the youngest players in the FA Youth Cup winning team after joining in 2010. The tricky forward signed a professional contract in 2012 and was sent out on loan to Royal Antwerp in Belgium.",
      "He returned a few months later but by the summer of 2013 the decision was made to release Van Velzen from his contract. Van Velzen returned to the Netherlands and played for FC Utrecht, FC Volendam and Roda JC in the Eredivisie before a return to England in the summer of 2019.",
      "Van Velzen signed for League Two side Crawley, but he only made five appearances for the club and he went back to the Netherlands, where he still plays for VVSB.",
      "The lanky forward was United’s target man, becoming top scorer for the youth team with 16 goals including eight in their FA Youth Cup winning campaign.",
      "Keane made his first-team debut in late 2011, coming on in a defeat to Blackburn Rovers, but a knee ligament problem ruled him out of the entire 2012/2013 season.",
      "With a few unsuccessful loan spells away from United, Keane eventually left to join former Reds assistant manager Mike Phelan at Hull City in 2016. It took him two years to score his first goal for the club, coming in a 5-0 away win to Burton Albion in April 2018.",
      "Keane currently plays for Preston North End after stints with Ipswich Town and Wigan.",
      "Blackett left United permanently in 2016 after a loan spells at Blackpool, Birmingham and Celtic.",
      "He made over 100 appearances for Reading before representing Nottingham Forest, FC Cincinnati and Rotherham, but Blackett has been without a club as a free agent for over a year now.",
      "Cole joined Fulham along with Tunnicliffe in 2014. He currently plays for Warrington Town.",
      "Coll joined Derry City after being released from United, but his spell there only lasted half a season and he stopped playing professional football.",
      "Cofie worked his way around the lower reaches of the Football League and non-league circuit, adding 12 clubs to his name after leaving United. He entered coaching at the age of 27 in 2020.",
      "Centre-back Massacci returned to Italy following his release from United in 2012. He dropped out of football after leaving ASD Valentino Mazzola in 2017."

      "He broke into their first team as a 17-year-old and has already made an impression at United, training exclusively with the first team since his arrival.",
      "Leon featured throughout pre-season for United and impressed enough to be retained with the first team squad beyond the summer window.",
      "Fellow teenage left-back Harry Amass, who made seven appearances for United last season was shipped off on loan to Championship side Sheffield Wednesday instead.",
      "Certainly Ruben Amorim has been impressed. \"He did really well, he's learning things, he's powerful,\" the United boss said of Leon back in July. \"He's going to be a very good player.\"",
      "It means Leon is back-up to Patrick Dorgu and the challenge now facing the talented teenager is getting into the United side.",
      "He made his debut for the under-21s in their friendly against the PFA free agents' XI in midweek and will likely feature for them more regularly while he waits for his chance in the first team.",
      "But the hype around his potential in Paraguay is huge. Cerro Porteno chairman Juan Jose Zapag described him as 'a left-back like no other in the world, the kind that's rare to find'.",
      "And his motivation now will be to try and force his way into his country's thinking ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "La Albirroja's 0-0 draw with Ecuador was enough to secure their place in the World Cup for the first time in 16 years and that led the country's president, Santiago Pena, to declare a public holiday.",
      "Leon has been capped at under-20 level but if he can force his way into the United side this season, he will fancy his chances of having a late run at being included in the squad for next year's showpiece in the USA, Canada and Mexico.",
      "Junior Alonso of Atletico Mineiro and Agustin Sandez of Rosario Central are the two men standing in his way but if he needed extra motivation to succeed at United then he has just found it.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United failed with a ‘crazy attempt’ to sign a Liverpool target ‘in the last two days’ of the summer transfer window.",
      "Man Utd were very active in this summer’s transfer window. They were largely focused on overhauling their attack as they signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also signed Senne Lammens to be their new No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "The Red Devils also looked to offload deadwood as Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho moved elsewhere.",
      "Lammens was their last summer signing, but they were also linked with other potential signings as it was reported that their next priority was to sign a centre-midfielder.",
      "Despite this, a new report from Foot Mercato claims Man Utd made a ‘crazy attempt’ to sign winger Malick Fofana from Lyon at the eleventh hour.",
      "READ: Marmoush out of Manchester derby: What his injury means for Man City against Man Utd (very little)",
      "20-year-old Fofana has been heavily linked with several Premier League clubs in recent months, with it reported that he has been on Liverpool’s radar as a long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah.",
      "Fofana grabbed five goals and four assists in 29 Ligue Un appearances for Lyon last season, with the report claiming Man Utd tried to ‘snatch’ him ahead of Liverpool and others.",

      "‘While the Belgian international was tempted by the idea of ​​joining MU, the English club was just waiting for a signal from the player’s father to start hostilities. A signal that never came and which sealed Fofana’s future between Rhône and Saône.’",
      "Interestingly, Kevin De Bruyne has likened Fofana to one of his former Man City teammates.",
      "“If you look at how modern football is played, there are more man-to-man situations,” De Bruyne said.",
      "“If you have players who can dribble past opponents or create space for others, then that’s only a good thing.",
      "“It’s all the better for us that another youngster like Malick is joining us. A Jeremy Doku type? Yes, they’re both wingers, quite small, quick.",

      "The England international’s career at Man Utd got off to a great start as he enjoyed a brilliant breakout season in 2023/24, while he also shone at the 2024 European Championships.",

      "The talented midfielder has attracted interest from Chelsea and several European clubs in recent months, with it revealed before the summer transfer window closed that he had requested to leave on loan.",
      "This request was submitted after Mainoo was an unused substitute in Man Utd’s opening two Premier League games of this season.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd refused to let their academy product leave as they have limited midfield options and did not have much time to secure a replacement.",
      "Earlier this month, Fabrizio Romano revealed co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe was “involved” in the decision on Mainoo’s future.",

      "‘A loan move to Napoli was mapped out and United said no, though there’s a possibility it could be resurrected in January if Mainoo’s situation hasn’t changed. United would need a replacement, which is always tough to do mid-season.’",

      "Kean, who scored 19 Serie A goals last season for Fiorentina, was ‘offered to’ Man Utd in the summer after the Red Devils ‘launched a full-blown search for a striker’ with the Red Devils ‘seriously considering’ a move for the Italian.",
      "Former Man Utd midfielder Nicky Butt reckons the Red Devils are “making the same mistakes” with Sesko as they did with Hojlund, who signed from Atalanta in 2023.",
      "Butt told BetMGM: “I hope I’m wrong but I really hope they aren’t making the same mistakes with [Benjamin] Sesko as they did with Rasmus [Hojlund].”",
      "He continued: “Honestly, for what it would have cost, I would have gone and brought in someone like Ollie Watkins, someone to help and pull the young strikers out of a bad patch.",
      "“When young players are just coming into the club, when the onus is on them to score goals, if they’re having a few bad games they have to have the safety net of being pulled out of the firing line. Ollie Watkins, or someone like that, would be who I would have been looking to bring in.”",
      "Slovenia team-mate Andraz Sporar insists Sesko will come good if Man Utd stick with the striker, despite him failing to score for club or country so far this season.",
      "Sporar said: “What does he bring to United? Everything. He has speed, power, intelligence, good football IQ.",
      "“I believe he can be a complete striker in the next two or three years. But he’s still young. He will help Manchester United a lot, they just need to be patient. I believe he’ll score the goals and every year he will be better and better.”",
      "A former Manchester United star fears the Premier League giants have made the “same mistake” in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "‘There is still plenty going on at Old Trafford’ apparently, and that includes the Manchester United news that big Benjamin Sesko has shown his ‘true colours’.",
      "Florian Wirtz as PFA Player of the Year? Sunderland going down? Idiots. We’ve had another bash at the pre-season predictions after the transfer window closed.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund ‘considers himself better’ than summer signing Benjamin Sesko after signing for Napoli on loan, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United’s current woes are being left at the feet of pretty much everyone. Can this all be Ruben Amorim’s fault?",
      "Only Andre Onana was rated lower than the £74m signing who waited until the very end to take his penalty in the shootout."

      "Manchester City have confirmed that Omar Marmoush will miss Sunday’s derby against Manchester United after sustaining a knee injury whilst on international duty with Egypt.",
      "Pep Guardiola’s side confirmed in a statement on Wednesday afternoon that Marmoush will not be available for the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "A club statement read: ‘Manchester City FC can confirm that Omar Marmoush has sustained a knee injury whilst on international duty with Egypt.",
      "‘The City striker suffered the injury in the early stages of Egypt’s World Cup qualifying match with Burkina Faso on Tuesday evening.",
      "‘Initial results on a scan performed in Egypt indicate he will not be available for the Manchester derby on Sunday, and he will now return to Manchester for more assessment and to begin his rehabilitation.",
      "‘Everyone at City wishes Omar a speedy recovery.’",
      "READ: Man City ‘gain something substantial’ from APT settlement; ‘significant development’ to ‘set precedent’",
      "The extent of the issue is not disclosed, but whenever you see it’s a knee injury, you can’t help but fear the worst.",
      "Losing a player of Marmoush’s quality should be a blow to any team, but thankfully for Guardiola, he has plenty of options in attack and the Egyptian wasn’t even guaranteed to start against United.",
      "Erling Haaland and Marmoush are the only players listed as ‘forwards’ on the Man City website, which indicates that they’re viewed as strikers and not wingers, which is obviously the case with the former, while the latter has more versatility.",
      "On matchday one against Wolves, Guardiola’s front three was Oscar Bobb, Jeremy Doku and Haaland, while Bernardo Silva, who is capable of playing wide, was in a midfield three.",
      "Despite winning 4-0 at Molineux, the Spanish manager switched things up for the visit of Tottenham, starting Haaland up front by himself in a 4-1-4-1, with Marmoush and Bobb out wide.",
      "Spurs won 2-0, which led to further changes for City’s trip to Brighton, mainly in shape, but not attacking personnel as Marmoush played left wing, Bobb was on the right with Haaland through the middle.",
      "Judging by the first three matches of 2025/25, Marmoush is Guardiola’s preferred option on the left, which means Doku is the most likely to start against Ruben Amorim’s men.",
      "However, Savinho and Phil Foden could also be in contention, with Bobb capable of moving over to accommodate one of those two players.",
      "Foden has only played 15 minutes this season as he continues to be hampered by an ankle problem, while Savinho hasn’t been included in a matchday squad amid transfer interest from Spurs.",
      "Guardiola has told reporters that the Brazilian has been dealing with a knock suffered in pre-season, but we’re not convinced.",
      "If the Spaniard, for whatever reason, wants my opinion: Bobb should start on the left and Foden on the right. Young Phil loves a goal against United after all.",
      "If Foden isn’t fit enough to start, it has to be the same front three that smashed Wolves to pieces: Bobb, Haaland, Doku."

      "The 47-year-old former England international gave Sancho both barrels.",
      "“It’s funny with Sancho because he got his reputation from his time at Borussia Dortmund,” said Carragher.",

      "“We hadn’t seen Sancho play too much. He was at Dortmund and doing really well in the Champions League and we didn’t put him in our squad, and I remember on social media, everyone was saying, ‘How could you not put in Sancho?’ Everyone was just in on Sancho.”",

      "Sancho, now 25, was a deadline day signing for Emery and Villa, who sorely needed an addition capable of playing on the left side of their attack after the summer departure of Jacob Ramsey to Premier League rivals Newcastle United.",
      "His loan signing was quickly followed by the acquisition of Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott, who joined Villa on Monday on a loan with an obligation to buy after just ten appearances.",

      "READ: Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers from Chelsea ace to Liverpool flop",
      "Man Utd were sporadically linked with Stiller for most of the window, though they did not land his services amid reports that they are willing to wait to sign Baleba in January or next summer.",
      "Still, a report from Caught Offside claims Man Utd had a ‘last-minute bid fall through’ for Stiller before the summer transfer window closed as they and Stuttgart remained apart on the midfielder’s valuation.",
      "It is noted that the Bundesliga side wanted as much as £52m for their prized asset and Man Utd are no longer at the front of the queue for his signature.",
      "This is because, according to The Express, Arsenal are ‘leading the race’ to sign Stiller as they are the ‘frontunners’ to secure his services ahead of the winter transfer window.",

      "There are said to be two factors behind Stiller’s decision to favour Arsenal over Man Utd.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘With United’s bid rebuffed, the Gunners are now seen as the frontrunners to secure the German international’s signature. Mikel Arteta’s project is thought to appeal to Stiller as it prioritises young talent and offers regular playing opportunities.",

      "Three games into the Premier League season feels like as good a time as any to rank summer signings and we’ve done just that with the 20 most expensive of them this summer.",
      "We’re all thoroughly looking forward to the prospect of Alexander Isak being the flop of all flops but have limited this list to those who have played in at least two of the games so far.",
      "So you can look forward to an updated version of this which includes Isak and his sulking compadre Yoane Wissa, along with Nick Woltemade, Eberechi Eze, Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho, but for now it’s just the 14.",
      "",
      "Probably not the worst performer of everyone listed here, but all things considered – the cost, his reputation, a full pre-season – he merits bottom spot, with Liverpool arguably winning all three of their opening three games in spite of him.",
      "Maybe it’s a coincidence that they’re struggling for attacking fluency but BILD’s report of Germany’s shock World Cup qualifying defeat to Slovakia which stated that Wirtz ‘couldn’t live up to the demands placed on him’ feels equally applicable to the start of his Premier League career. Poor lad ‘has forgotten his joy’.",
      "MAILBOX: Everybody makes the same point about Florian Wirtz and Kevin de Bruyne…",
      "",
      "Four off-target shots in 80 minutes of Premier League football off the bench following a £66m move to solve Ruben Amorim’s goalscoring woes probably isn’t exactly what he had in mind, and he did himself no favours by stepping up tenth in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town having put a stoppage-time chance over the bar from roughly four yards out to ensure the game went that far.",
      "",
      "Feels nailed on to be the next talented forward Chelsea can’t be arsed to develop before flipping for profit, or at least for no great loss within the next two years. Started the opening-day draw with Crystal Palace but was hooked early in that one before two brief substitute appearances ahead of the signing of Alejandro Garnacho to provide further competition for his already limited game time.",
      "READ: Chelsea’s successful transfer model not the one football needs, but the one it deserves",
      "",
      "Really quite unfair to judge a guy signed to create chances for a striker Newcastle haven’t had for the opening three games of the season, but it’s all we can do. There’s plenty of room for improvement.",
      "READ: Newcastle fleeced for extra £90m as Liverpool stung for Alexander Isak",
      "",
      "The calls for Andrew Robertson’s return to the starting line-up aren’t yet widespread, but there have certainly been suggestions that Arne Slot may revert to the tried and tested left-back, at least before a better outing for Kerkez against Arsenal, after some worrying signs that he’s one of the new breed of defenders who don’t really like defending.",
      "",
      "The scorer of Manchester United’s Goal of the Month for August, which was revealingly described as ‘well-worked’ rather than a hoof, flick-on, bumble to the byline by Diogo Dalot and simple finish from Mbeumo. The alternatives options were two own goals or a Bruno Fernandes penalty.",
      "Mbeumo scoring a decent goal against Grimsby before missing the crucial penalty feels like a decent summary of his Red Devils career to date – about par. We’re none the wiser.",
      "",
      "Two goals in three games is a start we’re guessing both he and Mikel Arteta would have taken after an incredibly long build-up to him joining Arsenal and then a short pre-season because of that dragging of feet. That first goal against Leeds was so perfectly Gyokeres – direct and powerful before a top finish – while it’s also nice to get off the mark from the penalty spot. Plenty more of those to come, we suspect.",
      "But he did also look like a but of a lump in the games against Manchester United and Liverpool to grant some early doors flat-track bully theories.",
      "",
      "Given we may never have been more invested in an Arsenal player doing well we briefly wondered whether the #NOTOMADUEKE petition was actually signed by a bunch of genius Gunners seeking support from the masses for one of their big summer signings.",
      "We gave our heads a wobble and reverted to our previous opinion of them a bunch of unthinkable tw*ts lacking any sort of human decency, which will allow us to continue to enjoy Madueke’s performances after a promising start to his Arsenal career.",
      "",
      "Who needs Kevin De Bruyne? Oh, we do. One excellent performance against Wolves was followed by two hugely uninspiring displays for City’s new midfielder.",
      "",
      "He’s not off the mark yet like his fellow United inverted winger summer signing, but has still looked as though he will be the better addition as we suspected before the season started. Got a ways to go to prove he’s some sort of Eric Cantona regen, mind.",
      "",
      "We’ve not really noticed him and while we accept the argument that that’s sort of the point with players of his ilk who sit at the base of midfield, keeping things ticking along while allowing others to attack and express themselves, it got to a point with Rodri before his injury where we couldn’t keep our eyes off him.",
      "It may be a slight concern that Zubimendi has looked far, far better for Spain in their World Cup qualifiers than he has done for Arsenal, but then maybe it’s time for us all to accept that Arsenal are not Spain.",
      "",
      "Suspicions that those questioning Kudus’ price tag after a very ordinary output of five goals and three assists last season were missing the obvious ‘but he was playing for West Ham caveat’ have been confirmed through his displays for Spurs.",
      "He put the willies up PSG in the Super Cup, got two assists on the opening day win over Burnley and there’s been plenty of other evidence besides that the 25-year-old will be able to more effectively combine his enviable skill, speed and power to reap reward this season compared to last.",
      "He’s in the Premier League XI of the season so far.",
      "",
      "Ekitike said what all players must when asked about competition for places on the back of Alexander Isak’s deadline-day arrival from Newcastle, insisting he’s looking forward to the challenge rather than frankly a bit f***ed off that after three goals and an assist in four games for Liverpool he may soon be watching from the bench, though maybe not that soon.",
      "But such is his form that it’s now assumed by many that Arne Slot will look to crowbar him into the team on the left, though that also feels very unfair on Cody Gakpo, who’s arguably been the Reds’ best player so far this season.",
      "",
      "Quite clearly the best of the 427 signings BlueCo made this summer and possibly already one of the best since the takeover just over three years ago. He’s got two goals and two assists already to provide genuine hope that Chelsea have finally found a close to fully-formed striker to lead their attack. No ifs, buts, maybes or time to bed-in required for the 23-year-old bodes very well indeed.",
      "A former Arsenal star has claimed that Viktor Gyokeres will prove to be a better signing than Liverpool newbie Alexander Isak would have been.",
      "Jude Bellingham has not kicked a ball since early July but the best and biggest England win of the Thomas Tuchel era must be about his ‘intimidatory ego’.",
      "England finally delivered a statement performance under Thomas Tuchel, but for all their ease in qualifying there will be more World Cup disappointment.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "We had the top 10 summer overpays so it’s only fair that we salute the bargains. Not so many Premier League signings on this one.",
      "Nottingham Forest’s decision to sack Nuno Espirito Santo has not gone down well, while we have more Florian Wirtz chat."

      "It’s been a summer of ludicrous spending by Premier League clubs and some of the figures have been truly eyewatering.",
      "Of the 20 biggest transfers in the world this summer, 15 were made by Premier League clubs. And of the 10 biggest overpays of the summer transfer window, seven were made by Premier League clubs.",
      "The market values and the fees are taken from transfermarkt; the former are usually on the low side anyway and the fees are the initial ones before add-ons. So it’s not gospel but it’s a guide to which clubs paid rather more than they should have done…",
      "",
      "Benfica never sell on the cheap, especially when they owe a sell-on fee to Manchester United. Real Madrid were more than happy to pay slightly over the odds for a left-back, after getting one of the world’s best right-backs for very, very little.",
      "",
      "To sell Noni Madueke to Arsenal for a sizeable profit after two-and-a-half underwhelming years was some phenomenal business from Chelsea, which is becoming something of a habit for Chelsea Transfer Club.",
      "There were petitions from Arsenal fans against the signing of yet another Chelsea reject; TM suggest they should have paid far closer to £35m than £50m for the England winger. He was good against Andorra, mind.",
      "",
      "He’s in the Premier League team of the season so far, so you would struggle to find any Spurs fans moaning that they have overpaid for Kudus, even if TM have him pegged as being worth around £40m. His performances in 2024/25 for West Ham had been poor, but although he was worth nowhere near his reported £85m release clause, West Ham were never going to do business for less than £55m.",
      "",
      "As we wrote at the time: ‘Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Only to Newcastle but that’s what matters.’",
      "Elanga was an upgrade in the one position – at the time – that they really needed an upgrade, and Nottingham Forest were never going to be forced into a transfer for the £40m he would have been worth to any other club.",
      "",
      "We are as shocked as you that Benjamin Sesko is not on this list, though he does have youth on his side. Brentford played hardball with Manchester United over Mbeumo just as they did with Newcastle over Yoane Wissa and they emerged with an initial £65m with very achievable add-ons that are likely to take the deal past £70m.",
      "But the idea that anybody would pay more than £50m for the Brentford winger they signed for relative pennies would have seemed ludicrous just six months before.",
      "",
      "Having already sold Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, the only way Bournemouth were going to sell his defensive partner to PSG was if they came in with more than £50m. In the end, the offer was too good for club or player to turn down.",
      "",
      "It now feels almost quaint that a Saudi Arabian club made an offer that could not be turned down, but it’s fair to say that no European club was offering £56.3m for Serie A’s top scorer from last season.",
      "",
      "Worth less than Florian Wirtz according to the algorithms, but there was a Premier League and a Newcastle tax to pay for Isak. Many will agree that Liverpool have overpaid for Isak despite his obvious talents, but it was clear very early this summer that Liverpool were going to have to break the British transfer record to sign the Swede. Now they have to win the Premier League. Simple as.",
      "",
      "With just one year remaining on his contract, it is close to ridiculous that Newcastle United felt like they had no choice but to pay £50m for a 28-year-old who has only once scored more than 12 goals in a top-flight season. But Brentford absolutely had Newcastle over a barrel.",
      "",
      "As Bayern Munich’s honorary president Uli Hoeness said: “We would have liked to have Nick Woltemade. We offered 55 million, Stuttgart wanted 75. Now they’ve apparently sold him to Newcastle for almost 90 million euros. But what Newcastle is doing has nothing to do with football. It’s like Monopoly – advance to Schlossallee, then some sheikh will come along, and then you can buy.”",
      "He scored 12 Bundesliga goals last season. But by this point Newcastle were about 427 miles past desperate.",
      "Jude Bellingham has not kicked a ball since early July but the best and biggest England win of the Thomas Tuchel era must be about his ‘intimidatory ego’.",
      "England finally delivered a statement performance under Thomas Tuchel, but for all their ease in qualifying there will be more World Cup disappointment.",

      "We had the top 10 summer overpays so it’s only fair that we salute the bargains. Not so many Premier League signings on this one.",
      "Nottingham Forest’s decision to sack Nuno Espirito Santo has not gone down well, while we have more Florian Wirtz chat.",
      "It’s not like the Daily Mail to kick a young man when he’s down; it’s his fault that England are rubbish even in his absence."

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who now once again finds himself top of the list nobody wants to top.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either. But against Arsenal they showed the ‘mettle of champions’.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brings back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of the season. The latter months of the season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that, even if Potter is far from out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "Casemiro has been one of the very few success stories at Man Utd under Ruben Amorim, with his future more secure than expected.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘set their sights’ on their ‘top target’ to replace current head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a key “decision” to prevent a “problem” at the club.",
      "After an incredibly depressing England admission in his press conference on Friday, Thomas Tuchel could really do with a favour from Ruben Amorim and Man Utd",
      "A ‘significant U-turn’ suggests Manchester United already regret a £100m transfer decision, which has exposed ‘furious’ Ruben Amorim…"

      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on Deadline day.",
      "There were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",
      "Dublin's iconic Croke Park will welcome the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings on Sunday September 28, before the latter stick around to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham the next week.",
      "The Denver Broncos then take on the New York Jets at Tottenham followed by the Los Angeles Rams against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley, before the Indianapolis Colts host the Atlanta Falcons at the Olympiastadion and the Washington Commanders meet the Miami Dolphins at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.",
      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles return as defending Super Bowl champions after dethroning the Kansas City Chiefs in a 40-22 victory in New Orleans in February, denying Andy Reid's side a third straight championship.",
      "Josh Allen's Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens resume their pursuit of a Super Bowl berth in the face of Kansas City's monopoly on the AFC, while Jayden Daniels leads a new era for the Washington Commanders. The Detroit Lions loom as one of the league's most prolific offenses as the Minnesota Vikings seek to maximise a Championship-calibre roster, while Micah Parsons prepares to alter the NFC entirely after his blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers.",
      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""

      "Premier League clubs spent a record £3.19bn in the summer window; Liverpool and Chelsea broke spending and selling records; clubs targeted Premier League-ready signings; Sunderland had a net spend twice as high as European champions Paris Saint-Germain",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 13:06, UK",
      "Manchester United finally offloaded most of their 'bomb squad' as Antony completed a permanent move to Real Betis, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho joined Napoli and Aston Villa on loan respectively.",
      "The club had begun Transfer Deadline Day with Antony, Hojlund, Sancho and Tyrell Malacia exiled from Ruben Amorim's squad - with only the latter remaining at Old Trafford until January at least.",
      "Antony's return to Betis ended a summer of speculation over whether he would end up back in LaLiga, having spent the second half of last season at the club and racking up seven goal contributions in 17 games.",
      "He joined them for £21.7m, a loss of £64m from when Man Utd paid Ajax £86m for him in 2022.",
      "Jadon Sancho, who had been a target for Roma, joined Villa as one of a number of late additions to Unai Emery's squad, with Rasmus Hojlund making a temporary move, which could become permanent, to Napoli, who have been seeking further striking reinforcements all summer.",
      "Few incomings were expected after Brighton rejected an offer for Carlos Baleba last month, with Senne Lammens the only arrival in an attempt to solve the ongoing goalkeeping issues at Old Trafford.",
      "Andre Onana has not featured for Man Utd in the league all season and was at fault for one of Grimsby's goals in their shock Carabao Cup defeat last week, with Altay Bayindir also faltering in his place in United's opening three Premier League games.",
      "Lammens joined from Royal Antwerp on a five-year deal for a fee of around £18.2m, including add-ons. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez had been discussed, but it was decided internally that Lammens was a better option.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",

      "Antony had made no secret of his desire to avoid returning to Old Trafford at the end of last season, including a tearful interview while on loan at Betis where he said he had fallen out of love with football at United.",
      "In the end, he got his wish - but he had to wait right up to the end of the transfer window for it to happen. He leaves Old Trafford having played 62 Premier League games across three seasons, but contributed just eight goals and assists.",
      "He arrived at the club in 2022 as one of the major signings of the summer, following former boss Erik ten Hag from Ajax, but never managed to recreate his Eredivisie form for United.",
      "A number of clubs had been interested in bringing in Sancho this summer, including Chelsea, where he spent last season on loan and featured heavily in their run to the Conference League title. But, having failed to agree terms with the Blues, he returned to Old Trafford - and they paid a £5m fine as per the terms of his loan.",

      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",

      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",

      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
