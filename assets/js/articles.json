      "Keely Hodgkinson has her sights on adding another gold medal to her collection as she prepares for the 800m final at the World Championships in Tokyo. The 23-year-old triumphed at the Paris Games last year and looks to have quickly returned to her best after an injury-hit campaign.",
      "Hodgkinson sent a warning shot to her rivals last month as she clocked an impressive 1:54.74 in her first race for 376 days, finishing just 0.13 seconds shy of her national record. The two-time World Championships silver medalist is hoping to finally clinch first place in Tokyo and has even set her sights on eventually challenging Jarmila Kratochvilova's 1:53.28 world record, which has stood for an astonishing 42 years.",
      "After progressing through her 800m heat earlier this week, Hodgkinson confessed that winning at the World Championships would be even more significant than her Olympic gold. “It definitely means a lot, round by round I'm hoping it goes my way,” she told BBC Sport. “It would mean even more than last year, I'm just trying to embrace it all.\"",
      "Hodgkinson appears to be embracing the pressure as she chases her first world title. Mirror Sport looks closer at the 800m star’s life away from the running track.",
      "The Team GB star rose to fame following her Olympic victory last year and even clinched the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. However, she did suffer a setback in her personal life at the beginning of 2024, revealing that her three-year relationship with a fellow runner had ended due to struggling with long-distance.",
      "“He lived in Texas for a bit, then in Italy, then London. There was always a distance and, because I do what I do and put that first, we could go weeks, months and not see each other,” she told The Times last October. \"I'm not really interested in dating right now,\" she added. \"I've never been on the apps. I like meeting people in real life.\"",
      "Hodgkinson is not the only sporting success story from Fred Longworth High School in Tyldesley. Despite being a couple of years younger, Hodgkinson struck up a close friendship with future England and Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, who has won two European Championships with the Lionesses and was part of the team that reached the 2023 World Cup final.",
      "\"We are just two young girls living their dreams,” Hodgkinson said in 2022. “Ella and I went to school together. She was two years older but somehow we ended up getting on really well.",
      "\"I was always referred to as the 'mini Ella' growing up at school. So we kept in touch from that and she was in Tokyo last year as well. We are just two young girls living their dreams.\"",
      "While it now seems that Hodgkinson was destined for sporting greatness, she was forced to overcome a major obstacle during her teenage years. It was discovered that Hodgkinson required ear surgery to remove a type of tumour that left her with long-term hearing loss and temporarily unable to walk due to the impact on her balance.",
      "“Now that was quite scary for a 13-year-old girl to think that could happen, but the bones were already crushed anyway so they tried to save them but that turned out why I had a lot of hearing problems growing up.\"",
      "She added: \"I couldn't walk - which is weird to think - because it's in your ear, your balance and things like that. But luckily it all went to plan. They got rid of it and I'm just left with missing hearing. It's not too bad.\"",

      "Manchester United may have invested heavily during the summer transfer window but the Red Devils face a long journey back to the top of English football. United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe saw the club splash out on a new frontline and goalkeeper Senne Lammens, but the new signings have not brought instant success to Ruben Amorim’s side .",
      "Prior to their match against Chelsea on Saturday, United had averaged a point per league game since the start of Amorim’s reign last November. Last season’s Europa League finalists also squandered an early chance for silverware with their shock defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. Speaking at a Q&A, United’s director of football Jason Wilcox has given an update of when the club can expect a return to their glory days.",
      "Meanwhile, two former United stars are embarking on new chapters in their careers. United legend Ryan Giggs has reportedly stepped down from his role at Salford City while ex-Red Devils striker Anthony Martial has signed for a new club.",
      "There was plenty of excitement surrounding United when the club signed Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to improve their attacking options. However, United’s director of football has warned the club hierarchy and United supporters that his work is far from finished.",
      "”This club is just a wonderful football club and I'm extremely privileged,” Wilcox said at a gala dinner for the 40th anniversary of the Association of Manchester United Players, as per ESPN. “I just pray that we get the opportunity to turn it around. I really feel that it's not 'will we win again,' it's 'when we are going to win again.'",
      "\"It's going to take time, it's not a quick fix, especially now with the [profitability and sustainability] regulations. We needed to change the playing squad. We've now made some really good additions this summer. Sometimes taking players out of the squad is just as important as the players that you bring in.",
      "\"We've got to try and bring the culture and the respect back to Man United,” Wilcox added, having stepped up to the job in December 2024. “Whether you work for Man United or you play against Man United, you feel like you're part of something special.",
      "\"That's what we're trying to bring. I'm extremely proud, I'm extremely privileged, but I'm extremely frustrated as well because we can't fix it quick enough.\"",
      "The Sun reports that United hero Giggs has left his role as Salford City’s director of football. It is claimed that Giggs has left his position overseeing the club’s football operations, as well as helping manager Karl Robinson on matchdays, as he searches for a return to management.",
      "Giggs was most recently in charge of Wales, guiding his country to Euro 2020 qualification, but was placed on leave in November 2020 following his arrest on assault charges; Giggs eventually stepped down in June 2022. In 2021, Giggs was charged with assault as well as coercive and controlling behaviour, with the United icon denying all charges. A jury was unable to reach a verdict and Giggs was later cleared of all charges after a retrial was abandoned in 2023.",
      "The 51-year-old shared his aspirations to return to management earlier this year. “I had the stint as Wales manager and loved it,” he told BBC Radio Manchester in January. “Eventually, I’d like to get back into management. On matchday, I still get as excited as ever, probably more than ever.”",
      "Anthony Martial became the most expensive teenager in world football when he signed for United from Monaco for £36million in 2015. While he showed glimpses of his true potential at Old Trafford, he ultimately fell short of expectations. A decade on from his record-breaking transfer, Martial is once again creating headlines after completing his move to Mexican club Monterrey.",
      "However, fellow Liga MX side Pumas believed they had already finalised a move for Martial. Following the 29-year-old's move to Monterrey, a member of Pumas’ recruitment team has called on him to apologise.",
      "\"It's not the agent who decides, it's the player. I don't know if it is because of money - maybe he analysed other situations and had every right to make his decision,” Miguel Mejia Baron told Mexican TV channel TUDN, as per talkSPORT. “Maybe what he lacked was an apology.\"",
      "Remarkably, Pumas sporting strategy director Eduardo Saracho admitted that the club only realised they had missed out on the striker when he was announced as a Monterrey player. \"We started discussing Anthony's situation weeks ago,” Saracho told TUDN. “We entered into negotiations with his club, they allowed us to talk to AEK Athens, we had a couple of Zoom meetings and phone calls, working out a deal.",
      "\"We reached a preliminary agreement, it was a formal proposal, in writing, we were getting everything ready. And then, just as you found out, there was this awkward silence. You get to this point where you have an agreement in principle, then this silence, and then 'Boom', the announcement from Monterrey came out.\"",

      "Robert Sanchez has issued a heartfelt apology following his red card during Chelsea's defeat to Manchester United in the Premier League. The Blues endured a disappointing 2-1 loss to the Red Devils at Old Trafford on Saturday evening, with Trevoh Chalobah scoring a consolation for Enzo Maresca's squad.",
      "Nevertheless, the defender's late strike proved insufficient to overturn first-half strikes from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro for the home side. Sanchez received his marching orders from referee Peter Bankes just five minutes into the match, prompting Maresca to introduce Filip Jorgensen whilst substituting Estevao Willian and bringing on Tosin Adarabioyo for Pedro Neto in a tactical double change.",
      "Shortly after the final whistle, Sanchez turned to social media to express his regret over the red card in the early minutes of Chelsea's defeat in Manchester, reports football.london.",
      "\"On me today guys, big sorry for that, team put a massive effort in the second half but couldn't get there,\" Sanchez posted on his Instagram story on Saturday night.",
      "Sanchez will now face a one-match suspension after receiving his red card for preventing a clear goalscoring opportunity, with Bryan Mbeumo attempting to win possession before being tackled by the Chelsea goalkeeper..",
      "The shot-stopper will be absent for the Carabao Cup third-round tie against Lincoln City at Sincil Bank on Tuesday evening, with the ban including both the League Cup and Premier League competitions.",
      "Jorgensen is anticipated to get the nod for Chelsea when they travel to face Lincoln during the week, whilst Gaga Slonina is an alternative between the sticks for Maresca. Sanchez's ban will be lifted in time for the goalkeeper to be available for Chelsea's upcoming Premier League match against Brighton next weekend.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has ignited a discussion about the Reds' early season form following their 2-1 win against Chelsea at Old Trafford. United went into the clash desperate for a win and got off to a flying start when Robert Sanchez saw red for bringing down Bryan Mbeumo outside the box.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side quickly capitalised on their numerical advantage, with Bruno Fernandes tapping in after Patrick Dorgu nodded the ball towards goal. United had Chelsea on the back foot now and doubled their lead in the 37th minute through a Casemiro header.",
      "But the Brazilian's night took a turn when he received his marching orders for a second yellow card just before the break, evening out the numbers on the pitch. Amorim's team seemed set for a comfortable win until Trevoh Chalobah's late goal threatened to spoil the party.",
      "Nonetheless, United clung on to claim a vital three points. After the match, Ferdinand reached out on X to gauge his followers' opinions on United's start to the season, hinting that he was pleased with the points haul.",
      "\"After five games playing Arsenal/Manchester City/Chelsea, are we satisfied with seven points,\" he queried. As previously noted, the Reds have already squared off against three of the traditional 'Big Six' this season, with losses to Arsenal and City preceding their triumph over Enzo Maresca's squad.",
      "Outside of the 'Big Six', United remain undefeated in the Premier League. The Reds clinched a victory against Burnley in a rollercoaster match, following a lacklustre 1-1 draw at Fulham.",
      "A penalty shootout loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup has piled on the pressure for Amorim, a sentiment echoed by United fans in response to Ferdinand's query. The majority of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the current points tally, but there wasn't a significant outcry for Amorim's dismissal.",

      "Ruben Amorim refused to stick the boot in on Casemiro but admitted the midfielder \"will suffer\" after as he comes to terms with his red card in Manchester United's win over Chelsea",
      "The Red Devils were in cruise control before the Brazilian got himself sent off just before half-time to give the Blues a glimmer of hope ahead of the second half. The former Real Madrid man had scored United's second to put them 2-0 ahead but, whilst being on a yellow card, made another risky challenge and saw a second yellow brandished by the referee. It halted United's momentum and prevented them from being as dominant.",
      "The second-half was much more even and Trevoh Chalobah scored late to set up a tense final ten minutes. And while United survived, Amorim feels Casemiro's experience means that the blunder will stick with him. He told BBC Sport: \"He's [feeling] worse than me. We won so I will forget a little bit and he will suffer because he's a top professional. He understands what he did. He is experienced enough that that play should not be played like that. He cares too much.",
      "\"We suffered in the end but we deserved the win. Our crowd, our fans are easy to please. If you give everything they will be there. That is something our players need to understand. To have the crowd with us we just need to run, to fight and tackle. With this win we have to forget the good feeling of winning the game and get back to the urgency of feeling we need to win the next game.\"",
      "Amorim joked that his side \"like to complicate our game always but it was a good day\" whilst he admitted it was on the hosts to \"finish the game off sooner\" with Chelsea themselves going down to ten men after just five minutes when Robert Sanchez was sent-off.",
      "The win eases the pressure on the Portuguese head coach, who saw his side dominated in the Manchester derby last weekend. Amorim met with Sir Jim Ratcliffe in midweek and retains the support of the hierarchy despite his dire record since taking charge.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, who scored his 100th goal for the Red Devils to open the scoring, hailed the team's defensive effort as they dug in for the three points. He said: \"We had one more man on the pitch before Casemiro was sent off. We defended really well and even conceding one goal, we got the result that we wanted at the end.\"",
      "United now have seven points from their opening five games, which includes fixtures with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea. The win over the Blues leave Amorim's side sitting in tenth as things stand.",

      "Manchester United kept up their record of not losing to Chelsea at Old Trafford in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era as they downed the Blues on Saturday night. It was a morale boosting win for Ruben Amorim, who became the latest Red Devils boss to beat the west Londoners.",
      "Chelsea's last victory on the red side of Manchester came in Ferguson's final season when Juan Mata scored the only goal of the game in May 2013. Since then the Blues have endured disappointment after disappointment on their travels.",
      "The likes of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ralf Rangnick have all avoided defeat, drawing their only games against Chelsea. However Amorim joined the likes of Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in beating the Blues on their own patch.",
      "United have largely struggled against the Premier League's big six since Ferguson's retirement, enduring some embarrassing losses at home and on the road. But facing Chelsea on their own patch has proved a successful fixture.",
      "On a rain-soaked evening Amorim, who had endured a difficult start to the season, saw Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro both scored in a 2-1 victory. A late goal from Trevoh Chalobah gave Chelsea hope, but they couldn't find an equaliser as their wait for a win at United extends beyond 12 years.",
      "He also added: \"The season is still early, we have done well so far this season. We will be ok. For us the most important thing for us is how clinical we can be and defending our box.\"",
      "Ferguson's tenure remains the benchmark for the managers at Old Trafford with the Scot the last man to deliver the Premier League title. He did so weeks before calling time on his managerial career - and the club have not replicated that success since.",

      "The swirling rain that fell relentlessly from foreboding skies over Old Trafford felt like an ominous portent for embattled Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "United's early-season form has been as bleak as the filthy weather that provided a miserable backdrop to a game Amorim knew he could not afford to lose, after such a sluggish start. But with the pressure having built on the beleaguered United boss, his players dug deep for him to produce a vital win that could yet prove the catalyst to finally kickstart their campaign.",
      "Amorim's technical area may have been flooded by the persistent rain, but there were no slip-ups from the United boss, who can breathe a little easier after such a significant victory.",
      "On the eve of the game, Amorim said not even the Pope could make him change from his controversial 3-4-3 formation, but the United boss was surely praying for some divine intervention to help seal this triumph after Chelsea scored late on to ensure an anxious finale for the hosts.",
      "Even when they lost their one-man advantage with the dismissal of goalscorer Casemiro in first-half added time and conceded with 10 minutes left, United's players kept their heads, their discipline and ultimately hauled themselves over the winning line.",
      "There were heroic displays from several players in sodden red shirts, including skipper Bruno Fernandes, who opened the scoring, and defenders Matthijs De Ligt and Luke Shaw, both of whom were found wanting in United's meek 3-0 derby defeat a week ago, but redeemed themselves here.",
      "This was the first of a three-game run, before the next international break, that would determine Amorim's United fate, despite the club hierarchy letting it be known he retained their full backing. Yet had United lost this game to Enzo Maresca's world champions, the pressure would have intensified on the 40-year-old Portuguese, ahead of next Saturday's lunchtime trip to Brentford.",
      "As United's form has worsened, Amorim's programme notes have become increasingly sparse, his pre-match message ahead of the Chelsea game amounting to just 125 words.",
      "Despite such brevity, the pertinent message from Amorim, after such an underwhelming start to the new season, was nonetheless succinct: “Now is the time for action, not words.”",
      "In the wake of their abject defeat at Manchester City, United chiefs were on a mission to spread the message that data proved the team were getting better under Amorim, not worse.",
      "The United hierarchy were keen to point out Amorim's side ranked first in the Premier League for total shots and touches in the opposing box, second for expected goals and open-play xG, fourth for shots on target and fifth for passes played into the box, all categories significantly up on last season.",
      "Those figures may well be true, but unfortunately for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, the only stats that matter are results, which is why this – only a ninth win for Amorim from 32 Premier League games – was so important.",
      "United began the game in 17th place in the table, a spot above the relegation zone but are now looking upwards, rather than over their shoulders at the teams and the danger lurking below them.",
      "The hosts needed a break after such a wretched start to the season and it came after five minutes, with the dismissal of Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez for taking out Bryan Mbeumo. United's one-man advantage allowed them to build a two-goal lead, but that came under threat with Casemiro's red card and Trevor Chalobah's late goal.",
      "With Chelsea threatening to equalise, there was a palpable sense of collective relief among 70,000 United fans when substitute Matheus Cunha was brought down just outside the Chelsea penalty area in the penultimate minute of added time.",
      "That allowed United's bedraggled players to run down the clock and see out the game for a win that may yet turn out to be a crucial turning point in Amorim's troubled reign.",

      "This means United will be without the Brazilian for their journey to Brentford for Saturday's early Premier League kick-off next weekend. Casemiro will then return to United's plans the following weekend when they take on AFC Sunderland on October 4.",
      "Earlier in the match, Chelsea found themselves a man down when goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was sent=off for bringing down Bryan Mbeumo outside the box. The stopper was shown a straight red card, but will only serve a one-match suspension as the decision was made for denying a goal-scoring opportunity.",
      "His ban will come into effect midweek when Chelsea head to Lincoln City for their Carabao Cup clash. That means there will, ultimately, be no Premier League punishment for him.",

      "Manchester United produced the ideal response to their derby humbling by seeing off ten-man Chelsea to record their second victory of the season. Bruno Fernandes got the ball rolling on a rain-soaked night as the pressure valve was eased, momentarily, on Ruben Amorim, who had to endure a tense final few minutes.",
      "The Portuguese star survived a VAR check as he reacted first to a flick on, finishing first time. His midfield partner Casemiro then got in on the act as he headed home at the back post, only to be sent-off before half-time as the sides were evened up.",
      "Robert Sanchez was dismissed four minutes into the contest when he was beaten to the ball by Bryan Mbeumo as the United forward raced through on goal. He narrowly avoided giving away a penalty, but it was the end of his evening as Enzo Maresca opted for an immediate change in approach.",
      "He hauled off both his wingers - Estevao and Pedro Neto - as the visitors set out their defensive intentions, albeit they didn't last long. Fernandes scored nine minutes after the red card and that began the constant wave of attack on the visitor's goal.",
      "Casemiro doubled their lead just before the 40 minute mark after Cole Palmer was hauled off with more defenders bought on by Maresca. However the Brazilian had his night ended prematurely when a foul on Andrey Santos landed him a second yellow card, making it 10 vs 10.",
      "United's one-way traffic eased as the two teams played with equal personnel in the second-half. Wesley Fofana thought he had given Chelsea a fighting chance when he headed home from close range, only to be denied by the offside flag.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho remained on the subs bench throughout the contest on his first return to Manchester with his new side struggled to create in the final third. However they set up a tense finish when Trevoh Chalobah scored with Chelsea's first effort on target after 80 minutes. Maresca's side continued to press but couldn't create a final opportunity as they sought an equaliser.",
      "Altay Bayindir 5 - He was barely tested such was the state of the game and will be frustrated to miss out on his clean sheet. Dealt well with a James cross in stoppage time.",
      "Patrick Dorgu 7 - Continued to show great energy down the left. Chelsea's lack of attacking threat allowed him to be more effective in the final third.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt 6 - Had little to combat by way of a Chelsea threat but kept things tight for the most part and was keen to get on the ball in more advanced positions.",
      "Harry Maguire 6 - More was required of the English centre-half in the second-half when the teams were level on players but largely marshalled the backline well. They looked less assured when he went off.",
      "Luke Shaw 6 - The United backline were rarely tested but held up well apart from the goal and the veteran defender continues to play his part in a back three.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui 6 - Still doesn't look comfortable as a wing-back and struggled to have a meaningful impact in the attacking third, but did hold up Pedro when he broke through on goal, making a vital tackle.",
      "Bruno Fernandes 8 - Marked the evening with his 100th goal for the Red Devils and, given the hosts were a man up, the playmaker was able to adopt more of attacking role, which ultimately suits his qualities. Showed his usual blend of skill and desire.",
      "Casemiro 5 - Came up with his third goal against Chelsea as he headed home in the first-half and looked far more comfortable in a team that were able to dominate possession. However showed a complete lack of experience when he was shown a second yellow in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo 7 - Often looks like he can make something happen in the final third. His pace and trickery make him a constant threat. May well have scored had he not been hauled down by Sanchez as he ran through on goal.",
      "Benjamin Sesko 4 - The pressure will soon be ramped up on the new striker, who is still having a limited impact. He's yet to score his first goal and was hauled off at half-time. Few players had less touches than the United frontman.",
      "Amad 6 - Didn't enjoy the same impact as Mbeumo on the other flank but was a willing runner throughout. Failed with an audacious effort at the back post in the second-half when he was unmarked.",
      "Subs",
      "Manuel Ugarte 5 - Bought on to bring some control to the midfield and was able to snuff out some of the Chelsea attacks.",
      "Matheus Cunha 6 - Made his return from injury and his class was immediately evident, especially as the hosts managed the final minutes.",
      "Leny Yoro 4 - Came into a settled situation but saw a cross goes over his head before Chalobah scored.",
      "Mason Mount 5 - Managed to land the bragging rights against his former club.",
      "Kobbie Mainno N/A",
      "Robert Sanchez 1 - Spent four minutes on the pitch, making one routine save, before he came running out of his goal, only to foul Mbeumo as he beared down on goal with a red card quickly being shown.",
      "Marc Cucurella 4- Another of Chelsea's backline to pick up a booking. He struggled with the constant pressure in the first-half and couldn't have an impact in the final third when the teams were evened up.",
      "Wesley Fofana 5 - The Frenchman was handed another injury setback when he was forced to leave the game on the hour mark. Had a hard time halting the United onslaught early on.",
      "Trevoh Chalobah 6 - Played Fernandes onside for the game's opening goal and was unable to put up much of a fight early on when Chelsea were under the cosh, but did come up with the goal that got Chelsea back into the contest.",
      "Reece James 6 - Produced a stunning early block to deny Dorgu minutes into the game, but spent much of the evening trying to keep the scoreline down.",
      "Enzo Fernandez 4 - Battled throughout the night and his frustration was evident at times, but struggled to gain much control in the middle of the park with the hosts on the front foot. Booked for a nasty challenge.",
      "Moises Caicedo 5 - Has enjoyed an electric start to the year, but he and Fernandez were outnumbered. Tried to get things going but it was his night.",
      "Pedro Neto N/A - Somewhat cruelly withdrawn on the four minute mark as the red card forced a change in system from Maresca.",
      "Cole Palmer 2 - Touched the ball once before he was the third Chelsea player to be taken off inside 20 minutes as Maresca continued his reshuffle.",
      "Estevao N/A - Was the man sacrificed four minutes in once Chelsea were down to ten men with Jorgensen coming on as his replacement.",
      "Joao Pedro 5 - Starved of service throughout the evening. Saw a VAR check waved away when he appealed for a first-half penalty, but continued to put in the effort, even if he was largely playing United's back four by himself.",
      "Subs",
      "Filip Jorgensen 4 - Conceded soon after coming on.",
      "Tosin Adarabioyo 4 - Was bought on to add some defensive solidity, but Chelsea conceded twice in the first-half",
      "Andrey Santos 5 - Showed some ambition but was playing hampered for half the contest.",
      "Malo Gusto 5 - Tried to inject some quality from outwide but United's backline had all the answers.",
      "Tyrique George 4 - Showed plenty of endeavour but was booked for a late challenge on Bayindir.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Chelsea's Cole Palmer could only shrug his shoulders and give a bemused look as Enzo Maresca hauled him off after 20 minutes against Manchester United. The playmaker grabbing his coat and walking straight down the tunnel.",
      "Palmer was the third Blues player to be subbed off in the opening 20 minutes as their head coach set about changing his entire approach after Robert Sanchez was sent-off after four minutes. He took off Estevao to bring on a new goalkeeper in Filip Jorgensen.",
      "But at the same time ended Pedro Neto's evening and introducing Tosin Adarabioyo. United soon took the lead and were looking dominant with Maresca then choosing to bring off arguably his most influential player - much to Palmer's dismay.",
      "Maresca had hinted that he had several players with fitness issues before this match and Palmer is known to be nursing a groin issue. He was later seen with an ice pack.",
      "Palmer had made a goalscoring return in midweek, notching in the Champions League loss at Bayern Munich. He has been central to much of Chelsea's good work in the final third, but was surprisingly sacrificed at Old Trafford.",
      "It left Joao Pedro as the only main attacking threat with his three attacking midfielders all withdrawn early on. Chelsea had arrived in Manchester with an unbeaten record for their opening four Premier League games, but that was soon under threat. Making three substitutes inside the opening 20 minutes had never been done before in Premier League history, underlining the extent to which Maresca had overhauled his entire line-up.",
      "Palmer has previously enjoyed some of his best moments against the Red Devils. In his debut season the ex-Manchester City man scored a hat-trick to down United, producing two goals in stoppage time at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Amid all the early changes ex-United man Alejandro Garnacho remained on the bench. He swapped Manchester for Chelsea in the summer after pushing for the exit door.",

It immediately felt like Sanchez was in big trouble and, after taking a moment to gather his thoughts, referee Peter Bankes flourished a red card to reduce the Blues to 10 men.",

But the changes couldn't prevent the 10-men of Chelsea from going 2-0 down when Casemiro made the most of some slack defending in the penalty area to head home at the back post.",

      "Manchester United's director of football Jason Wilcox has appealed to minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe for the time to orchestrate a turnaround at Old Trafford. Mounting pressure has started to weigh on United boss Ruben Amorim, alongside Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, following last weekend's loss to Manchester City.",
      "The minority shareholder held talks with Amorim regarding the 'data around the team', with the Portuguese manager emphasising he retained complete support from ownership. Wilcox has now made his own appeal for patience during a rare public outing this week.",
      "Addressing guests at a gala dinner marking the 40th anniversary of the Association of Manchester United Players, he declared: \"I just pray that we get the opportunity to turn it around and I really feel that it's not will we win again, it's when we'll win again.",
      "\"It has been a rollercoaster! I came in last April, around 18 months ago, and it's been a real challenge I can't lie. I thought the club was in a much better place than it was. We had no football identity, we lacked alignment between ownership, the CEO, football and the academy and we've just been working so hard behind the scenes.\"",
      "In the interview, which was shared by Man United the Religion's YouTube channel, Wilcox added: \"The football club needed to go through a period of transformation without doubt. Forget the redundancies. The whole structure of Manchester United needed to change. It's really important we have a leaner workforce that provides accountability and responsibility... now we've got a platform to rebuild.\"",
      "Despite disappointing results, there's a sense amongst some that the club is heading in the proper direction, regardless of external scrutiny surrounding Amorim. During his press conference this week, the United manager quipped that Ratcliffe had presented him with a fresh contract, before revealing details of their discussion.",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract!\" Amorim joked. \"No, it's normal things just to show the support, explaining that it's a long project.",
      "\"He said many times this is my first season. For me, it's not. But normal things. I spoke with him, with Omar, with Jason, just trying to see all the data around the team. A normal meeting and we had several. But in this moment, it's normal people pay attention to that.",
      "\"This is the club with the most pressure in the world. We want to win and, again, you can say whatever. I think last year I was very critical of the way we play.\"",

The 21-year-old, who completed his £40million transfer to Stamford Bridge in the summer, is set to return to Old Trafford when United face Chelsea in the Premier League.",
      "His three-year spell in Manchester was filled with controversy - outlined by disputes with both Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim. His most public disagreement with Amorim came after he reacted angrily to being named on the bench during the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Amorim was displeased with his reaction, leading to Garnacho spending pre-season training away from United's first-team. He subsequently signed a lucrative seven-year contract at Chelsea, with the Reds securing a 10 per cent sell-on clause. While his talent is rarely questioned, doubts remain about his mentality.",
      "The Sun reports that during his fallout with Amorim, several senior players, including Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, and Harry Maguire, tried to persuade him to focus more on the team rather than just himself, reports The Express. However, Garnacho seemed to ignore his team-mates' advice, leading Amorim to conclude that he was creating a negative atmosphere in the dressing room.",
      "The former Sporting Clube de Portugal head coach was reportedly irritated by his frequent social media posts and comments in the mainstream media. Like the rest of the United team, Amorim was, initially, eager to work with the winger when he took over at the helm in November.",
      "However, after observing Garnacho's behaviour in Plzen in December, his attitude shifted. The Portuguese manager also grew weary of Garnacho's attitude when things didn't go his way. In the end, a separation was inevitable while sources close to Amorim have disclosed he has never regretted his decision.",

      "Manchester United legend Bryan Robson believes the club should give Ruben Amorim three years to impart his vision on the Red Devils. Amorim, 40, arrived at the club in November but already appears to be under pressure.",
      "The Portuguese manager had a reputation for being one of the brightest young managers in Europe when he replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag. However, his time at the club has only bought eight Premier League victories in 31 matches, in which three were against relegated Leicester City, Southampton and Ipswich Town.",
      "United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe recently flew into Manchester to inform Amorim he needs to qualify for European football if he wants to hold onto his job. Despite the poor results under his reign, Robson, who won two Premier League titles while playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, believes Amorim needs three years to succeed at the club.",
      "Speaking to the Telegraph, Robson said: \"We have changed managers that many times (since 2013), I feel you have to stick and say, 'No, we are not sacking the manager. We are not blaming.’",
      "\"When you have a little bit of money and the club are going to allow you to change your squad, you need three years to get the team right. For me three years at Manchester United should be enough.",
      "\"Look at the money we spend. It's up to you to go around the world and get top players who are going to improve you.”",
      "Since Ferguson left the club, the manager who enjoyed the longest reign was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who oversaw the Red Devils from December 2018 to November 2021. Amorim has only overseen 31 Premier League matches but has already lost 16 matches.",
      "Their 3-0 away defeat to Manchester City was also damning, as Pep Guardiola's side were far from their best. United spent big money this season bringing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens to the club for more than £200m.",
      "Only Mbeumo has found the net for the new United attackers, who are yet to find their feet on the red side of Manchester. While many issues have been dumped at the manager's door, Robson also believes too many of their signings have not been ready to compete in the Premier League.",
      "The former midfielder added: \"The other thing I think we went away from is getting good experienced Premier League players. So when they get to 28, you bring them on board if you can.",
      "\"There have been loads of players who have left clubs. I think five years ago, some of the players we bought were just not good enough to be Manchester United players.",
      "\"It's an accumulation of that. When I was in management, I believed that if you bought average players you got an average team.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has revealed Manchester United do not have a designated number one goalkeeper.",
      "United brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day for £18.2million, including add-ons, but the 23 year old was named among the substitutes for the Manchester derby.",
      "United permitted Onana to move to Trabzonspor on a season-long loan deal earlier this month, leaving them without an established first-choice goalkeeper.",
      "\"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",
      "Summer acquisition Benjamin Sesko remains without a goal for United following five appearances.",
      "Sesko was handed his first league start in the 3-0 defeat at City after drawing a blank in two outings for Slovenia during their World Cup qualifiers this month. The 22 year old was the 10th outfield player to step up for a penalty in the 12-11 shootout loss to Grimsby Town in the League Cup second round, despite battling cramp at the end of 90 minutes.",
      "Sesko revealed during the international break that he required time at United. The former RB Leipzig forward is three months younger than his predecessor, Rasmus Hojlund, who netted three goals in his final 35 outings for United before joining Napoli on loan.",
      "United have registered the most shots at goal in the Premier League this season, have struck the woodwork more frequently than any other side and Bruno Fernandes has crafted more opportunities than any other player.",
      "Amorim admitted that Sesko was too cut off in the derby. \"I think, if you remember Arsenal, I think we missed a lot. Burnley, I think we missed a lot. Fulham in the beginning, I think we missed a lot. We have four games and I said three.",
      "\"And then there is the thing that you say is not a big opportunity. The first play (against City), Amad has the ball between the lines. It's four against three and we put the ball out. It's not a big opportunity. It should be. So all these things.",
      "\"But if you ask me, against City, Sesko looks like he's alone in the box, I agree. He was always alone. So the guys were around, near the box. But in the final third, we get there many times.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"But I also said that, I think, in the end of the game. When I look at the box, Ben was alone. We cannot score in that way. So I think it's not the same team in that department compared to last year.",
      "\"He's at a different club. He's taking it all in and he's a professional. So you can feel that. He wants everything for tomorrow and we have to balance that.",
      "\"But he's doing the job. And again, guys, we can talk about all the things here. The system: if one ball goes inside the box, we win one game and two, this will change.",
      "\"The important thing is that last year, I said to you, I think I was really clear: we cannot play well. We cannot create chances. This year is completely different. We can avoid all the goals that we are suffering. Yes, it's our fault. So let's work on that and try next week and next week and next week.\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has confessed there are moments when he longs to be back in the Manchester United dugout. The iconic boss stepped down 12 years ago, yet his desire to help steer the club remains.",
      "Ferguson secured 13 Premier League crowns, five FA Cups and celebrated two Champions League victories, among other trophies, throughout his remarkable 26-year reign at Old Trafford. In 2013, he guided United to their 20th league title before drawing the curtain on his illustrious career.",
      "It's likely that Ferguson would have always experienced moments when he yearned to stay involved at United. However, the club's issues under Ruben Amorim and his predecessors in the post-Ferguson years can only have fuelled the Scotsman's occasional longing to be in charge of the Red Devils.",
      "\"People don't seem to realise, I've been retired 12 years, you know,\" Ferguson told the BBC when questioned whether he was ever enticed to return to football management.",
      "\"I picked the right time - I thought, at the time. Sometimes you watch the games and you think, 'I wish I was back in there for five minutes.' You know what I mean, but it is what it is.\"",
      "He continued: \"I had a great career. I was a manager for 39 years. From 32 years of age to 71.\"",
      "Ferguson claimed an extraordinary 28 major honours, excluding the Community Shield, during his spell at United. The club has found it challenging to replicate the success achieved under Ferguson, with Amorim being the sixth permanent manager since the legendary Scot's retirement.",
      "Amorim nearly clinched the Europa League title in his early days at the helm, only to be defeated by Tottenham Hotspur in the final. The Red Devils had previously lifted the trophy under Jose Mourinho in 2017 and were runners-up four years later under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, losing to Villarreal in a penalty shootout.",
      "However, even if Amorim had won the Europa League and secured a Champions League spot, it wouldn't have disguised United's poor league performance. The team ended up 15th in the table, their worst position since returning to the top-flight in 1975.",
      "Despite splashing out over £200million in the summer transfer window to bolster the squad, United have failed to live up to expectations this season. They've managed to scrape together just four points from four league matches and suffered an embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "While Sir Alex might wish he could still influence United's fortunes from the dugout, the 83-year-old now has a new focus. He serves as an ambassador for the Playlist for Life charity, promoting the benefits of familiar music for people living with dementia—a cause close to his heart.",
      "\"I have a situation myself, with my brother [Martin],\" he explained to BBC Sport. \"It's not easy. I have to be in touch with him a lot. He recognises me [but] the memory's not great.",
      "\"But he's not bad. He's not getting any worse, let's put it that way, which is very encouraging.\"",

      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire has called for the club's fan base to be patient towards 'really young' Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens. At the age of only 22, Sesko joined the Reds in a massive £66.4million deal plus £7.3m in add-ons from RB Leipzig during the summer.",
      "However, he's been largely sidelined so far, with manager Ruben Amorim favouring Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Towards the end of the window, the Red Devils also wrapped up a move for goalkeeper Lammens, 23, who was signed from Royal Antwerp for £18.2m, including add-ons.",
      "The young Belgian is also being gradually introduced to the team, with Altay Bayindir remaining the first choice despite his shaky form this season. With United lagging behind their rivals, Maguire conceded it might take some time before fans see the best of Sesko, Lammens and the rest of United's new signings.",
      "\"I'm sure he is probably finding a lot of pressure on his shoulders already, because that is what happens when you play for this club. I think everyone needs to realise he is a young player.",
      "\"He might take time to find his feet. But he's got all the attributes, the physicality, the mentality to be a success at this club.",
      "\"I've been really impressed with him in training. His finishing is excellent. I believe he is going to score goals for this club for many years.\"",
      "He then turned his attention to Lammens, who has similarly caught his eye during training sessions. Yet he swiftly began discussing the keeper's tender years, saying: \"I've been so impressed with him in training.",
      "\"I think he has all the fundamentals to be a really, really top class goalkeeper. He's great with his feet, he's a big presence, he's a really great shot-stopper.",
      "\"I think he's got all the fundamentals to be excellent. Again he's another young boy. He's coming to such a big club with lots of pressure. But I know he will deal with it and I'm sure he's going to have a long future at this club.\"",
      "Amorim refused to confirm who his No. 1 goalkeeper is, insisting Lammens will have to fight with Bayindir for the position. In his press conference previewing the clash against Chelsea, the Portuguese boss said: \"No, nobody has a place that is his place.",
      "\"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, at the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs is plotting a return to management after stepping down as director of football at Salford City. The 51-year-old had been part of the backroom staff at the EFL side.",
      "He often got himself back into a tracksuit and stood alongside Ammie's boss, Karl Robinson. From a management point of view, Giggs has not been on a touchline since October 14, 2020, when his Wales side overcame Bulgaria 1-0 in the Nations League.",
      "Giggs successfully guided Wales to Euro 2020 but could not manage his country in the competition. He stepped aside in November, after being arrested on suspicion of assault, before officially resigning from the role in the summer of 2022.",
      "With Euro 2020 being delayed by a year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Giggs was not able to manage his side in the tournament.",
      "Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on the assault charges and charges of coercive and controlling behaviour. A retrial was subsequently abandoned when his former partner, Kate Greville, the alleged victim, refused to testify.",
      "Giggs was succeeded by Robert Page, who led Wales to the knockout stages of Euro 2020, only to be defeated 4-0 by Denmark in the round of 16. Page also took Wales to the World Cup, where they failed to progress from a group featuring England, the USA and Iran.",
      "A matter of years after he had to walk away from Wales, the Sun reports Giggs will no longer be involved with Salford, a club he once held a stake in until a consortium led by David Beckham and Gary Neville bought him out in May. The report goes on to claim that the former winger is keen to get back into management.",
      "In January, Giggs confessed to BBC Radio Manchester he was relishing his role at Salford but was also eyeing a return to the dugout.",
      "He said: \"I had the stint as Wales manager and loved it. At the moment I'm enjoying being at Salford as director of football and enjoy watching the team, happy where I am.",
      "\"But eventually I would like to get back into management. On matchday I still get as excited as ever, probably more so than ever.\"",
      "Giggs donned the Welsh jersey 64 times during his career, netting 12 goals. His only other managerial experience was a brief spell at United, stepping in for four matches when David Moyes was dismissed.",
      "He led the team to victories over Hull City and Norwich City but suffered defeat against Sunderland and managed a 1-1 draw with Southampton. He then served two seasons as Louis van Gaal's right-hand man at Old Trafford before leaving the club in 2016 when the Dutchman was dismissed.",
      "As a player, he clinched 13 Premier League titles under Sir Alex Ferguson, as well as two Champions League titles, four FA Cups and four League Cups.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United legend Edwin van der Sar has revealed details about the brain haemorrhage he suffered in 2023. The Dutchman admits he is now embracing a more tranquil life, and insists he wasn't afraid he would die.",
      "Van der Sar joined Old Trafford during the summer of 2005, following an impressive stint with newly-promoted Fulham. A reported £2million fee secured his signature.",
      "The Dutch shot-stopper instantly became Sir Alex Ferguson's number one and delivered exceptional performances. He guarded the goal for the Red Devils until 2011, racking up more than 250 appearances. He claimed four Premier League crowns and one Champions League trophy with United.",
      "Following his retirement 14 years ago, Van der Sar made a fleeting one-game comeback for his childhood team, VV Noordwijk, in 2016 and remained involved in football, latterly serving as an executive at Ajax. However, in July 2023, he was rushed to intensive care in Croatia following a brain haemorrhage and remained hospitalised for a fortnight.",
      "Van der Sar has now revealed insights into the frightening experience and acknowledges his life has transformed dramatically for the better, and he did not fear he would die. He told Gazzetta dello Sport: \"Was I afraid of dying? Honestly, no.",
      "\"I was helped immediately; the ambulance took me straight to the hospital, where the best doctors looked after me. When I returned home, my family and a physiotherapist were always by my side.",
      "\"Now my life is much calmer, when my phone was always ringing and I had to make important decisions and support the team and manager. Now I enjoy time with my family, travel, play padel and go cycling.\"",
      "The 54-year-old was initially admitted into an intensive care unit after suffering a bleed around the brain whilst on holiday in Split. He was later moved to his home country, where he continued to receive treatment and was discharged after a fortnight.",
      "It was in the Netherlands with Ajax that Van der Sar embarked upon his footballing journey, after being recruited to their reserve side by former United head coach Louis van Gaal. He claimed Dutch Football Goalkeeper of the Year in his debut full season in Amsterdam, and following years of loyalty, found himself linked with a transfer abroad.",
      "However, circumstances could have unfolded quite differently for Van der Sar. He acknowledges that Liverpool were amongst the possibilities he had when he departed Ajax in 1999, but he instead opted for Juventus.",
      "\"I had two options: Liverpool or Juventus. I spoke to both clubs, but my heart led me to Italy,\" continued Van der Sar, who featured 88 times for the Old Lady before transferring to Fulham and then United.",
      "\"Serie A was the best league in those years. I was intrigued by the idea of playing for a team where a legendary goalkeeper like [Dino] Zoff had made his mark. Do I regret it? No. I didn't play my best football, but criticism is part of the game. It was still a wonderful experience to live and play in Italy.",
      "\"The summer I arrived, my team-mates would always take me out for dinner. The food in Turin's restaurants was fantastic: at the end of the evening, I'd get my credit card ready, but I never paid.\"",

      "Trevoh Chalobah scored with 10 minutes to play but United held on for the win.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Had to keep himself warm in the first half to ensure he was not caught cold by Chelsea. No chance for Chalobah's goal. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Made the most of Sanchez's expulsion by breaking into the final third to supplement the attack and he was defensively dominant. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Recalled for his first league start of the season and United were better off with Maguire. Relished the duels with Joao Pedro. Should not have come off. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "A contentious starter yet Shaw threw his body at the ball to make the second goal possible and his physicality restricted Chelsea. Great recovery tackle. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "A big improvement on the derby. Mazraoui is usually a reluctant attacker but was ever-present in the final third and key to build-ups. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "His goal was bookended by two yellow cards. Needlessly fouled Enzo Fernandez and brainlessly pulled back Andrey Santos to get sent off. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His role won't be talked about after this performance. Timed his run perfectly to put United ahead and proactive with the ball. Another inspirational performance. 8",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Had a better understanding with Amad than at City and his superbly-guided header was converted by Fernandes. Defensively slack at times. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Magisterial from the start. Almost scored before he secured the numerical advantage of Sanchez's dismissal and Chelsea could not get the measure of him. 8",
      "Amad",
      "Had a better understanding with Dorgu than at City and his movement caused Chelsea problems. Switched to a wider role in the second half. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Great flick on for Mbeumo that led to the red card. Sesko's movement was impressive and he pinned Chelsea defenders until his tactical withdrawal after Casemiro was sent off. 7",
      "Subs",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Came on to fill the Casemiro void. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Industrious. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Worked hard and took the game away from Chelsea. 7",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Allowed Chalobah to score from a corner. 5",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Late cameo. 6",
      "Manager",
      "Seven defensive players did not instil much confidence but United started like a house on fire and the first half was perfect until Casemiro got sent off. Should not have taken Maguire off but most of the changes were logical. 7",

      "The ball was so seldom in the Manchester United third in the first half that Altay Bayindir exercised to stay warm to ensure he would not be caught cold.",
      "A comedown of a second half should not overshadow the near-perfection United served up in the first. All but five minutes of it were played against ten men yet United had Chelsea on the back foot from the first whistle.",
      "The real United has turned up across their three home matches, each one more progressive than the previous. With this triumph they have laid down a marker against one of the Premier League's Champions League participants.",
      "United were eventually caught cold by Trevoh Chalobah's header from a corner. Substituting Harry Maguire a day after Amorim referenced Chelsea's threat from crosses felt remiss with a quarter of the match remaining.",
      "\"Seven!\" shrieked the United supporters at the number of added minutes in the second half. They celebrated the additional nine in the first half, back when victory seemed a formality. Yet this is a club that feels like it is obliged to quicken the heart rate of its supporters.",
      "\"Oh United, we love you,\" roared their supporters as the clock ticked towards the 97th minute. Amorim paced nervously around the technical area, glanced at his staff and issued the odd instruction. United held on.",
      "This has to be the turning point in United's season. They were better than Chelsea in every conceivable department, from the stands to the pitch. United supporters belted out 'Take Me Home' with more gusto than ever since its introduction shortly before kick-off. The players fed off the atmosphere, enhanced by the evening kick-off time.",
      "United used the Mancunian rain to their advantage. Benjamin Sesko's flick on skidded perfectly into the path of Bryan Mbeumo and Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez fell into the trap. The Chelsea analysts had issues connecting to the network. It was soon Sanchez who malfunctioned.",
      "The Stretford End was so buoyed by Sanchez's fifth-minute red card they aired Amorim's chant before United scored. Bruno Fernandes got the goal a mere nine minutes later.",
      "There was more biblical rain at Old Trafford but Amorim's ark has not flooded. He will not be the second Premier League manager to be sacked this season. That is bound to be Graham Potter.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was United's catalyst in his best game yet for his new club. He went close to scoring before Sanchez's expulsion and earned a standing ovation when Matheus Cunha was ready to replace him. Amorim had a rethink and Mbeumo stayed on. He elicited a second round of applause when he eventually made way minutes later.",
      "The winger's importance is such that Fernandes, usually in his element ordering new teammates around, was borderline deferential towards Mbeumo during the electric first half. Mbeumo's name was chanted by the Stretford End as he headed back to the dugout, his route doubling as a lap of honour. Amorim clasped hands and patted his head.",
      "United fans put their hands together twice for Maguire, too. He was presented with a commemorative shirt to mark his 250th appearance before the game and the United defence was better off with him back on his first Premier League start of the campaign. Maguire only made way midway through the second half to manage his workload, a costly change.",
      "This was an evening United supporters could scarcely have believed when the teamsheets were printed. Amorim picked seven defensive players in a must-win home game. Alas, United seldom defended. Their first half was one of their most accomplished and pleasing until Casemiro reignited a contest against a seemingly condemned Chelsea.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui embarked on his own celebration after Casemiro made it 2-0 and received a hug from Amorim's assistant, Carlos Fernandes. More bonhomie seemed inevitable.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was instructed to warm up after Casemiro was booked in the 17th minute. Mainoo was the only substitute limbering up, a sure sign Amorim and his staff knew Casemiro would not last the duration.",
      "Casemiro has walked a tightrope before and got away with it. Erik ten Hag hooked him at half-time against Luton two seasons ago after he was fortunate to avoid a second yellow card. Casemiro could not hold his nerve until half-time as he cynically halted Andrey Santos' getaway.",
      "Fernandes' position has been disputed regularly and here he was arriving late to connect with Patrick Dorgu's header. The linesman called it impeccably by keeping his flag down as only Fernandes' arm was offside. A Chelsea analyst, optimistic that they had a case for offside, smacked his hand against his forehead upon the final outcome.",
      "This was another inspirational effort from Fernandes. Shortly before his removal, he embarked on a superhuman run and unleashed a testing shot that was parried by Filip Jorgensen. Fernandes immediately turned to the Stretford End and implored them to continue with their backing. They obliged.",
      "Fernandes was back on the pitch at full-time, pointing out to Manuel Ugarte and Patrick Dorgu where they went wrong. The United captain's mentality remains unmatched.",
      "United have rarely had a better first 20 minutes on their own patch. They were a man up and soon a goal up. Then Cole Palmer became Chelsea's third substitution, enforced by injury. Palmer chucked his gloves on the floor, claimed a coat and skulked down the tunnel. \"City reject,\" crowed the United supporters. Palmer re-emerged with a bag of ice against his thigh.",
      "Only a handful of former United players are booed on their return at Old Trafford and it cannot be a coincidence that four of them are Argentinian. Alejandro Garnacho copped it before kick-off and the Stretford End dusted off its old ditty about Carlos Tevez that starts with \"Who's that t**t from Argentina.\" The Chelsea contingent vainly chanted \"Viva Garnacho\".",
      "Garnacho was ordered to warm up in the 53rd minute and received an embrace from Kobbie Mainoo on his approach to the Stretford End. Garnacho had the nerve to run past the corner flag and observe some caustic sign language.",
      "Garnacho's bleached barnet was distinguishable before he pulled his hood up when he emerged for kick-off. The focus was soon off him when Sanchez upended Mbeumo. Garnacho never got off the bench.",
      "He stayed in the cold.",

      "Ruben Amorim said Manchester United \"complicate our lives every time\" after the win against Chelsea.",
      "United were handed an advantage just minutes into the contest against Chelsea when goalkeeper Roberto Sanchez was sent off.",
      "Sanchez fouled Bryan Mbeumo and received his marching orders. Bruno Fernandes then opened the scoring for United and Casemiro extended the lead with a headed goal in the 37th minute.",
      "United were cruising to the interval against 10-man Chelsea, but Casemiro was shown a second yellow card just before the break. Chelsea set up a nervous end to the game when Trevoh Chalobah scored with 10 minutes remaining, but United defended bravely to secure a 2-1 victory.",
      "Speaking at his post-match press conference, Amorim said of the win: \"It was really important. I think we deserved it. But we complicate our lives every time. I think we started the game really well, with the aggression and showing the opponent we were there.",
      "\"Of course, the sending off for the goalkeeper helped us a lot, but we were in control, scored two goals. And with everything going well, we complicated it with the sending off.",
      "\"The second half, I think we managed well, but in the end like the last 15 minutes was tough for us. They scored a goal, we suffered together and we managed to win.",
      "\"I think the players showed that [desire], but we also showed when everything is going well, we do something to make it difficult. But again, just the way we start the game, the first and second ball, I remember when we scored the first one we had many situations, three against one, three against two, goalkeeper outside of the box, with the last pass we are not being perfect in that moment.",
      "\"And that can help us a lot to control the games and to win games, but we suffer together in the end and that was a good thing. If you look at the game, we deserved to win.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he saw the \"aggression\" that he discussed in his pre-match press conference and said: \"I think if we try to remember the game, you can feel it, especially in the beginning. It's 11 vs 11 and I don't remember the big player we did. It's not about that in this moment.",
      "\"It's about the second ball, the first ball, the aggression and speed. Even Casa' with the sending off, he was really aggressive. Of course, he needs to do better in that moment, but we show today we wanted to win really, really bad.\"",
      "When asked about complicating the game, Amorim responded: \"That they [the players] are trying to do things a little bit too much, making a tackle that maybe we shouldn't? It's hard to say, because that is the pressure.",
      "\"The guy [Casemiro] has five Champions League. I feel more pressure in some young guys sometimes. But maybe it's because Casemiro cares. We score one and he has that tackle.",
      "\"And then they had maybe one time that they passed half of the pitch and we want to win the ball right away. So I think sometimes it's not the pressure, they wanted too much in that moment. That is not a bad thing.\"",
      "Amorim said on Friday he would not change formation even if the Pope asked him to. \"I was a joking,\" laughed Amorim. \"And you like it guys, so don't complain. You love it that way. Let's try to win the next one and I will give you another one.\"",

      "He said: \"We spoke a lot before the game about winning, that was the most important thing today. You could see how much we wanted to win. The whole team defended really well and we're happy with the three points. We started the game really well, really sharp and physical. We can punish teams with the chances we have created.",
      "\"The season is still early, we have done well so far this season. We will be ok. For us the most important thing for us is how clinical we can be and defending our box.\"",
      "The ball was so seldom in the Manchester United third in the first half that Altay Bayindir exercised to stay warm to ensure he would not be caught cold.",
      "A comedown of a second half should not overshadow the near-perfection United served up in the first. All but five minutes of it were played against ten men yet United had Chelsea on the back foot from the first whistle.",
      "The real United has turned up across their three home matches, each one more progressive than the previous. With this triumph they have laid down a marker against one of the Premier League's Champions League participants.",
      "United were eventually caught cold by Trevoh Chalobah's header from a corner. Substituting Harry Maguire a day after Amorim referenced Chelsea's threat from crosses felt remiss with a quarter of the match remaining.",
      "\"Seven!\" shrieked the United supporters at the number of added minutes in the second half. They celebrated the additional nine in the first half, back when victory seemed a formality. Yet this is a club that feels like it is obliged to quicken the heart rate of its supporters.",
      "\"Oh United, we love you,\" roared their supporters as the clock ticked towards the 97th minute. Amorim paced nervously around the technical area, glanced at his staff and issued the odd instruction. United held on.",

      "It will be a minor miracle if Chelsea get anything from this. Even when Joao Pedro does something impressive, he is totally devoid of support. Bayindir has had to do some stretches to keep himself warm.",
      "Nine minutes of added time after a red card, two goals and three subs.",
      "This is going marvellously for United. Chelsea are all at sea. Everything about their defending is calamitous at the moment. The corner came from Jorgensen getting his lay-off wrong in the first place.",
      "United have been fabulous to watch this half. They have beaten Chelsea in every single department you could think of.",
      "Casemiro loves a headed goal. Shaw deserves huge credit for reacting quickly and winning the ball. He could have done better for each of City's goal last weekend, but that was impressive.",

      "Mbeumo has been magisterial out there. Fernandes is in the right role and United are penetrating Chelsea time and again when they look to play the ball into the final third. Sesko is asking a lot of questions of the Chelsea centre halves.",
      "Palmer has come back out, pressing a bag of ice against his thigh.",
      "Mainoo is the only one warming up and that has to be down to Casemiro. He is not finishing this game, having already been booked, and he has come off early before when walking a tightrope.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Manchester United do not have an outright number one goalkeeper.",
      "United signed Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day for £18.2million, including add-ons, and the 23-year-old was on the bench for the Manchester derby.",
      "Altay Bayindir has started in all four of United's Premier League matches this term, having arrived for £4.3m from Fenerbahce as back-up to Andre Onana on deadline day in September 2023.",
      "United allowed Onana to join Trabzonspor on a season-long loan earlier this month, leaving them without a clear and obvious first-choice 'keeper.",
      "When asked whether Bayindir was the new United number one, Amorim replied: \"No, nobody has a place that is his place.",
      "\"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",
      "Summer signing Benjamin Sesko is yet to break his duck for United after five games. Sesko made his full league debut in the 3-0 loss at City after failing to score in two starts for Slovenia in their World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "The 22-year-old was the tenth outfield player to take a penalty in the 12-11 shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the League Cup second round, though he was suffering from cramp at the end of the 90 minutes.",
      "Sesko said during the international break he needed time at United. The former RB Leipzig striker is three months younger than his predecessor, Rasmus Hojlund, who managed three goals in his final 35 appearances for United before he joined Napoli on loan.",
      "United have had the most attempts at goal in the Premier League this season, have hit the woodwork more times than any other team and Bruno Fernandes has created more chances than any other player.",
      "Amorim acknowledged that Sesko was too isolated in the derby. \"I think, if you remember Arsenal, I think we missed a lot. Burnley, I think we missed a lot. Fulham in the beginning, I think we missed a lot. We have four games and I said three.",
      "\"And then there is the thing that you say is not a big opportunity. The first play (against City), Amad has the ball between the lines. It's four against three and we put the ball out. It's not a big opportunity. It should be. So all these things.",
      "\"But if you ask me, against City, Sesko looks like he's alone in the box, I agree. He was always alone. So the guys were around, near the box. But in the final third, we get there many times.",
      "\"But I also said that, I think, in the end of the game. When I look at the box, Ben was alone. We cannot score in that way. So I think it's not the same team in that department compared to last year.",
      "\"He's at a different club. He's taking it all in and he's a professional. So you can feel that. He wants everything for tomorrow and we have to balance that.",
      "\"But he's doing the job. And again, guys, we can talk about all the things here. The system: if one ball goes inside the box, we win one game and two, this will change.",
      "\"The important thing is that last year, I said to you, I think I was really clear: we cannot play well. We cannot create chances. This year is completely different. We can avoid all the goals that we are suffering. Yes, it's our fault. So let's work on that and try next week and next week and next week.\"",

      "Garnacho was named on the bench and came out late to warm up. He was booed by each corner of the crowd and chants of \"who's that t*** from Argentina\" started as the match kicked off.",
      "Chelsea fans have stolen United's chant for Garnacho and aired \"Viva Garnacho\" before the break, which seemed like a request for Enzo Maresca to introduce him for the second half.",
      "Garnacho was heckled again when he prepared to come on - but Maresca decided against bringing him on. Garnacho is a United academy graduate, he provided some brilliant moments for the first team and scored the opening goal in the 2024 FA Cup final, but the circumstances that led to his departure to Chelsea mean he won't be remembered with much fondness.",

      "An evening kick-off felt like the perfect chance to deliver a spirited display and that's exactly what the players produced. United showed intent from the first whistle and showed the \"aggression\" that Amorim wants.",
      "United were not complacent after going two goals ahead and battled hard to win duels. There was even one moment when Harry Maguire won a slide challenge and tapped Joao Pedro on the chest to rub it in.",
      "That was followed by Amad smashing the ball into the stands to thwart a Chelsea attack. Amad whipped up the crowd by waving his arms and United supporters lapped it up, responding with huge cheers.",

      "The England international left the pitch by the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand and received rapturous applause as he walked around to the bench. \"Ohhh Harry Maguire,\" the Stretford End chanted as Maguire applauded back.",
      "Maguire was great last season but has been forced to be patient to make his first league start. The 32-year-old vindicated his selection and is essentially playing for a new deal now he's entered the last year of his contract.",
      "Before the game, Maguire was gifted a framed shirt for making his 250th appearance for the club. He will be hoping he can reach 300 appearances, but that means he will have to earn a new deal.",
      "Amad was delighted",
      "Chelsea have not won at Old Trafford since May 2013 and they had a mountain to climb to end that run when Sanchez received a red card just four minutes into the contest.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did brilliantly to flick on a header to Bryan Mbeumo, who was brought to the ground outside the box by Sanchez. The referee was left with no choice but to show Sanchez a red card for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity, and Amad jumped on Mbeumo to celebrate while he was still on the floor.",
      "The red card handed United an opportunity they could not squander. Old Trafford was in fine voice from the first whistle and the noise cranked up another level when Sanchez trudged off the pitch.",
      "United fans did their bit from the stands to spur the team on to a much-needed win.",
      "Ratcliffe finally watches a win",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a split allegiance for United and Chelsea, so it was no surprise to see him in attendance on Saturday. Ratcliffe held a meeting with Amorim on Thursday and it felt likely he would stay in Manchester for another two nights to watch the clash in the directors' box at Old Trafford.",
      "Ratcliffe was spotted chatting with Sir Alex Ferguson before the game. Then the monitors in the press box showed Ferguson mouthing \"he has to go\" when Chelsea goalkeeper Sanchez fouled Mbeumo.",
      "Ratcliffe attended the Manchester derby and was pictured with his hands on his head, a familiar sight since he invested into the club. Fortunately, Ratcliffe was present for a victory this weekend, which was crucial for Amorim after a week of headlines and speculation about his future.",

      "Manchester United icon Rio Ferdinand has sparked a debate surrounding the Reds' start to the season after a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford.",
      "United headed into the game needing a victory and they started off brilliantly when Robert Sanchez was sent off for fouling Bryan Mbeumo outside of the penalty area. Shortly afterwards United made their one-man advantage count as Bruno Fernandes poked home from close range following Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "The Reds had Chelsea on the ropes and added a second in the 37th minute as Casemiro headed home. However, the Brazilian went from hero to zero when he was sent off in first half stoppage time for a second bookable offence leaving the two teams poised at ten men apiece.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side looked to be cruising to victory until Trevoh Chalobah's header set-up a grandstand finish. Fortunately for United, they managed to hang on and secure a precious three points for the hosts.",
      "Post-match, Ferdinand took to X to ask his followers for their thoughts on the opening to the season with the insinuation from the former defender being that he was content with the points picked up. \"After five games playing Arsenal/Manchester City/Chelsea, are we satisfied with seven points,\" he wrote.",
      "As mentioned, the Reds have already faced three of the traditional 'Big Six' this season with defeats against Arsenal and City preluding the victory over Enzo Maresca's men. Outside of the 'Big Six' United are unbeaten in the Premier League.",
      "The Reds beat Burnley in a topsy-tervy game after drawing 1-1 at Fulham in an underwhelming display. Defeat on penalties to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup has mounted the pressure on Amorim and the consensus among United fans to Ferdinand's question reflected this.",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Brentford in next Saturday's lunchtime fixture.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho's brother was sitting in the Old Trafford directors' box and burst into tears when his sibling crossed the white line for his Manchester United debut against Chelsea in April 2022. No tears were shed over Garnacho's departure to Chelsea.",
      "Garnacho and his on-off girlfriend, Eva Garcia, made several trips to London throughout last season. One of Garnacho's agents, Enrique de Lucas, played for Chelsea and De Lucas and Carlos Cambeiro were at Stamford Bridge in January.",
      "Some have speculated that Miss Garcia could return to England now that Garnacho has relocated to the capital. It is a transfer he was warming up for as far back as the winter window.",
      "Come his final participation as a United player in Hong Kong, Garnacho was sullen and contemptuous of the post-season tour. He fulfilled the post-match meet-and-greet commitment at Hong Kong Stadium but Garnacho never broke into a smile for the selfies.",
      "He looked happier to be away from the club, revelling in the attention from a paparazzo in Hale in July. At Carrington, Garnacho was persona non grata, albeit not the only one as a member of the five-man bomb squad.",
      "Although Garnacho was in the United academy from the age of 16, he never seemed likely to be a one-club man, having arrived from Madrid. His association with the club ultimately lasted less than five eventful years, beginning with a period of quarantine due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Garnacho was isolated again in his final months at the club.",
      "Garnacho vacated his Cheshire mansion earlier in the year but was still forking out for the rent while he resided in downsized accommodation. United were keen to stress at the time that Garnacho's change of residence was unrelated to a future transfer and that his parents and brother had returned to Spain.",
      "Another move was inevitable when Garnacho was omitted from the Europa League final starting XI. He should have seen it coming. Ruben Amorim used the Friday night fixture away to Chelsea as a dress rehearsal, with Mason Mount starting and Garnacho on the bench.",
      "Garnacho naively thought nothing of it. He had his hair bleached for the showpiece in Bilbao. At San Mames stadium, a disconsolate Garnacho was the only United player on the pitch when the teams were announced. He distracted himself by catching up with former teammate Sergio Reguilon.",
      "In less than a year, Garnacho's status was downgraded from untouchable to undependable. During a press conference on the post-season tour, Amorim started chuckling when Amad was asked if he hoped that Garnacho could somehow end up staying. The dye had been cast for the bleached blond.",
      "\"Garnacho is not our player,\" Amorim said on Friday. \"I’m really happy with Mason and (Matheus) Cunha returning. The rest you have to talk with the Chelsea manager.\"",
      "When pressed on Garnacho in the second section, Amorim started laughing again. \"Guys, I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who plays for the opponent, what people are going to say in the end, if the other player is going to play well. They are good players and they will play well if things happen.",
      "\"I'm just focused on winning the game. That is my only concern.\"",
      "The 2022 FA Youth Cup final was one of Garnacho's most celebrated evenings at Old Trafford. A record crowd of 67,492 for the competition was present for United's first triumph in the competition in 11 years.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo recorded a motivational message for the squad that was played in the dressing room before kick-off. Garnacho, who idolised Ronaldo and mimicked his celebrations, scored twice in the 3-1 victory.",
      "As United players took it in turns to pose with the trophy, Garnacho draped the Argentina flag around him and there was the first rendition of \"Viva Garnacho\" from the Stretford End. Garnacho offered some cursory applause and afforded himself a quick smirk amid the impromptu adoration.",
      "He was never fazed by the hype or the demands. Garnacho was immortalised on the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year plaque at Carrington and angled for the number seven shirt after his first season. It went to Mount, also cursed by the number. Garnacho got a seven in his new upgraded squad number of 17.",
      "Without him, United would still be on 12 FA Cups. Garnacho was worthy of the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award in 2023-24, a campaign that he indefatigably played through without succumbing to injury. He played 50 times and started in 38 in succession. Garnacho has been injury-free since March 2023, a remarkable stretch for a winger who is a magnet for hatchet men.",
      "His performance against Liverpool in that quarter-final for the ages was not one of Garnacho's best but he had a pivotal role in all four goals. Garnacho had been managing a hamstring injury in the days leading up to the tie and played more than two hours in the epic, collapsing deliriously when Amad steered the ball past Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "Unlike some other wingers, Garnacho never went into hiding. He always demanded the ball and had a work-rate reminiscent of David Beckham. Consider the added-time comeback against Brentford in October 2023, a game that possibly spared Erik ten Hag of the sack 12 months early. It is the game-changer Garnacho who twists and turns on the byline before diverting the ball in for Scott McTominay to eventually equalise.",
      "Garnacho's immediate reaction is to sprint back into his own half. There is time for a winner. It is that attitude and those memories that make his brief time in the United first team (his full debut was less than three years ago) so regrettable. He was a throwback to the United wingers of yore yet also a modern winger",
      "Maybe there was too much, too young. Garnacho's overhead kick at Everton and celebration against West Ham United were central to the script for the stirring Adidas Originals trailer fronted by Barry Keoghan to launch last year's white away shirt.",
      "Like Marcus Rashford before him, Garnacho did not appreciate having his nose put out of joint by a new manager. Ten Hag read Garnacho the riot act a couple of times over some tardy timekeeping on his first pre-season tour and a passive-aggressive reaction on social media. But the dynamic changed irrevocably under Amorim.",
      "Player and manager tried to make it work after Garnacho and Rashford were dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby last year. Amorim felt Garnacho was inattentive when he issued him instructions at Viktoria Plzen three days earlier. Rashford never played for United again. Garnacho was back in the squad and back on the pitch four days later at Tottenham.",
      "Whereas teammates had tired of the Rashford drama, they were more invested in the younger Garnacho. Bruno Fernandes took Garnacho under his wing but was also prepared to clip Garnacho's wings. He unloaded at him over Chelsea's winning goal in May.",
      "Arsenal, Tottenham and Atletico Madrid backed off on possible moves for Garnacho after conducting due diligence. One of his most accomplished performances for United was at Chelsea, overshadowed by their extraordinary stoppage-time implosion from 3-2 up to 4-3 down in April 2024.",
      "At £40million, Chelsea got Garnacho on the cheap. United attempted to portray the transfer as a positive, that Garnacho was the club's fourth-highest sale. He left for £2.5m more than Omari Hutchinson, the former Ipswich Town winger who joined Nottingham Forest.",
      "United are going through a change of identity, most glaringly with the absence of pure wingers in their starting XI. Amorim has seen off Garnacho, Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho. Garnacho is the only one who could be missed, though his antagonistic attitude should ensure some boos back at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The United academy is quick to pat itself on the back when there is a first-team breakthrough yet they are conspicuous by their absence if problems surface with a graduate. Garnacho, Rashford and, most gravely, Mason Greenwood have all caused strife at United. Club sources admitted Garnacho's loudmouth brother, Roberto, was a problem.",
      "Garnacho's transgressions were the most frivolous yet United need to buck the trend of academy poster boys developing an inflated sense of entitlement before they have turned 21.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur in May, midnight was looming and the skyline pitch black. Garnacho emerged from the dressing room sporting some shades and walked through the mixed zone without breaking his stride.",
      "Amorim was sat at the front of the team coach. Garnacho removed the sunglasses before he boarded it. He would not have been concealing tears over his impending exit.",
      "He wanted it.",

      "Amorim has used the 3-4-2-1 system in all 47 matches he has taken charge of at United but the team have won only eight out of 31 in the Premier League.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited United's Carrington training complex on Thursday but there was no puff of white smoke. Ratcliffe reassured Amorim after a galling start to the season in which United have won one of their five matches and were humiliatingly eliminated from the League Cup by fourth-tier Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim will continue to use the 3-4-2-1 system he swears by in United's Premier League home fixture against Chelsea on Saturday night and clarified he does not intend to change United's shape now.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" Amorim replied when asked if the formation was mentioned with Ratcliffe. \"No one, not even the Pope will change… This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.",
      "\"But I will change the system, there will be an evolution, but we need to make all the good steps. If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure, it doesn't matter if he's all around the world, is saying, 'you need to change the system' and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way.",
      "\"So, everything, when you think about the impact that any decision is going to have on the team, everything is important. So, I will say the same thing: this will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way.",
      "\"But it will change. So, I hope to have the time to change! But it will change.\"",
      "Amorim expressed encouragement at United's performance progression, citing their second-place status for the expected goals metric. United are first for most attempts at goal and efforts that have hit the woodwork in the Premier League.",
      "However, United have scored one goal from open play in six hours in the league so far this term. Apart from Bryan Mbeumo's second-half strike against Burnley, United have scored two own goals and Bruno Fernandes converted an added-time penalty to beat Burnley.",
      "Champions Liverpool have won all five of their league and Champions League games with a goal scored in the last ten minutes or in added time. Amorim feels Liverpool have the belief United are lacking.",
      "\"I think it's everything,\" he opined. \"It's belief. It's confidence. It's aggression. It's everything. And sometimes, what we call luck is the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"So I think it's Liverpool. It's winning all the games. It's something about the teams that are winning that something is going to happen, to have that feeling. And sometimes, with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well, but something is going to go wrong in some moments.",
      "So, we need to change that, but it's just with wins. I can do whatever. They can do whatever. But, if you look at the goals against City, Fulham, all these moments, we scored against Burnley. We are good in the game and then we take the draw.",
      "\"All these moments, I think we can do better. It's our fault. So, we work on that during the week to improve for the next.\"",
      "Amorim was fleetingly linked with a return to Lisbon as Benfica manager early in the week. Reports in Portugal suggested Benfica presidential candidate João Noronha Lopes was keen on bringing Amorim in to replace Bruno Lage, who was sacked after the Champions League defeat to Qarabag in midweek.",
      "Instead, incumbent Benfica president Rui Costa appointed Amorim's mentor and former United manager, Jose Mourinho, as Lage's replacement. Former Sporting coach Amorim clarified that there was no contact with Benfica and that whenever he leaves United he will require a break.",
      "\"No guys, no contact,\" Amorim added. \"I'm Manchester United manager. Until something changes, and after that, for sure, if it's next month, tomorrow, in ten years, I will rest because I deserve it.",

      "Peter Schmeichel believes Ruben Amorim was wrong to suggest Manchester United need to sack him if they want change.",
      "Speaking after the Manchester derby defeat, Amorim was asked whether he would change his approach after United's worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/1993.",
      "Amorim responded: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "United's head coach has stuck by his system, but Schmeichel thought Amorim made a mistake in his post-match press conference because he 'put himself above the club'.",
      "In an interview with Sky Bet, Schmeichel reacted to the Manchester derby defeat, which increased the pressure on Amorim's shoulders at a time when he needs to secure positive results.",
      "Schmeichel explained: “You always have to look at what the manager’s job is; you’re employed to win football matches. At Manchester United, that also means winning trophies, and right now he’s not doing that.",
      "\"His win percentage is around 36%, which is the worst performer of any United manager since World War II. Sticking by his guns obviously isn’t working. Bruno Fernandes said after Sunday’s game that it’s very difficult to play in midfield when you’re always one man short, because you can’t cover the ground.",
      "\"The system might look good when it works, but it hasn’t worked yet. And I don’t think the system itself can be the most important thing. For me, the art of coaching is to get the maximum out of the players you have available. Right now, it’s clear not all of them are playing to their potential.",
      "\"They look confused, sometimes disorganised, especially at the back. That’s where the manager has to take a look and change something.",
      "“I say this because I was at United during a rebuilding phase, when we were moving towards winning trophies and the Premier League. Certain standards were always in place.",
      "\"The main one was simple - no one is ever bigger than the club. That applied from the manager down through the players and staff. If someone tried to go their own way and it didn’t work, it couldn’t continue.",
      "\"That was drilled into us every single day. Sir Alex Ferguson gave us a framework that was very simple and easy to understand. It started with not conceding goals, and then it was about recruiting players who could both defend under pressure and take risks going forward.",
      "\"Guys like Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, myself behind them, Paul Parker and Denis Irwin as attacking full-backs. It worked because it was simple, and because of the mentality and quality of the players.",
      "“Right now, I don’t think we’re getting the quality out of the players we have. They can do more. The manager has to change his ways. I didn’t like what he said the other day – 'If you want change, you have to change the coach'.",
      "\"I like him a lot, I like his leadership qualities, and he came in during a very difficult period with unwanted players and dealt with it well. But as a Manchester United person, I don’t like that sentence. That’s putting yourself above the club and I don’t like that.”",
      "Schmeichel continued: “You only have to look at Sunday’s game at Manchester City to see how unhappy Bruno Fernandes was. He can look frustrated at the best of times, but this was different – he was really unhappy.",
      "\"And understandably so, because Manchester United were outnumbered in midfield throughout the game. The thing about Bruno is simple - why do we have him? Because he’s a world-class player on the ball.",
      "\"He creates, he spreads play, he scores goals. But you don’t score goals from deep. I’d much prefer to see him higher up the pitch. He’s never been a number six, he hasn’t got the legs for it, and it’s unfair to ask him to do that job because it takes away from his real strengths.",
      "“Now, I know people sometimes complain about former players being critical, and I hold my hands up – I’m one of them. But I’ve been there. I know what it takes, how much you have to invest, how much you need to be at 100% in everything you do.",
      "\"Nobody likes criticism, but this isn’t personal. When we talk about these things, it’s about suggesting what could make it better. It comes from love for the club, not for the headlines.",
      "“Bruno is the captain, and he speaks for the players, so of course it’s uncomfortable when there’s this kind of debate – but it’s necessary. United have new people in charge – Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Christopher Vivell – all of them new, without deep Manchester United knowledge.",
      "\"That’s why voices like mine, Roy Keane’s, Gary Neville’s, Paul Scholes’s matter. We’ve been there, we understand what it takes, and when we see things going in the wrong direction, it’s important we speak up to help, and at least make the people in charge think about it.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford made it clear that his former Manchester United teammates are not far from his mind after his Champions League masterclass.",
      "The United academy prospect was given his first start in Europe for Barcelona against Newcastle United. After a difficult first half, Rashford exploded upon the restart with a spectacular brace at St James' Park.",
      "He opened his account for the Catalans with a sumptuous header, before firing in a blistering 25-yard effort, which proved to be the vital goal for Hansi Flick's side. His former United teammates, Bruno Fernandes and Jadon Sancho, wasted no time in posting their admiration for the England international.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Both players recorded his goal on their phones and uploaded them to their Instagram stories - with stunned emojis overlaying his strike. Rashford showed both players are not far from his mind by reposting their Instagram stories to his 20.6million followers shortly after the final whistle.",
      "The England international, now 27, was frozen out by United head coach Ruben Amorim - who signed off on a loan spell to Aston Villa last January and the temporary move, with an option to buy, to Barcelona. It also demonstrated Rashford still considers Fernandes to be an ally at Old Trafford.",
      "The United captain has been a loyal servant to Amorim - who is the one that might have ended Rashford's career at Old Trafford for good. Meanwhile, Rashford's decision to also repost Sancho's Instagram story also demonstrated he is still showing solidarity with the winger.",
      "While it was Erik ten Hag who decided to send Sancho on loan to Chelsea last summer, Amorim did not try and reintegrate the ex-Borussia Dortmund forward into his plans upon his return. Sancho was also quickly confined to the 'bomb squad' with Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, before he secured a loan move to Aston Villa.",
      "After the match, Rashford admitted he couldn't be happier playing under Hansi Flick's exciting Barcelona team. He said: \"It's going good, learning a lot, it's a new way of football but I'm enjoying it all - and I think that it's making me a better player.",
      "\"So that's what I'm here to do, I'm here to help the team win but improve and be the best I can.",
      "\"I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona - people my age have watched them from when we was younger - amazing football, amazing players and we want to win as much as possible.\"",
      "When asked to explain his thrilling second goal, Rashford added: \"It was a split second, I seen [saw] the far post, I thought I'd get a shot off.",
      "\"When you're going away from goal it's difficult to generate the power to keep it low, I thought try to aim high and I knew when I caught it, it would take some doing for the 'keeper to stop it.\"",
      "Rashford's display against Newcastle followed his performance in Barcelona's recent 6-0 demolition of Valencia - where he whipped in a fine assist for Raphinha to score. He will now be eyeing up the Catalans' next clash against Getafe on Sunday, September 21 (8pm).",

      "Manchester United legend Bryan Robson believes Ruben Amorim needs to be tactically flexible.",
      "Amorim oversaw the worst season at Old Trafford for 51 years following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon in November. Amorim needed to start the new campaign well, but United have made their worst start to a season for 33 years and speculation has begun about his future.",
      "United suffered a 3-0 defeat against Manchester City last weekend, which means Amorim has the worst win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "Amorim said: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "Some fans believe Amorim's system was never a good fit for the club, while others have suggested the 40-year-old change his formation to secure results and ease pressure.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United legend Robson spoke to OLBG and shared his verdict: \"I feel as a manager you have to have a few tactics up your sleeve. Otherwise people know how to set up against you.",
      "\"If you're playing the same way week in, week out, the opposition, and especially with all the technology and everything nowadays, you can go out on the training pitch and you set yourself up to do well against a team. That's why I feel he's got to be a bit more flexible.",
      "\"Most top teams in the Premier League now are nearly always playing with a back four and so for me, if you’re playing with four at the back instead of three, you can mix it up a little bit more as well.",
      "\"Some people think about the old fashioned 4-4-2 but then I quite like 4-3-3 when you’ve got good forwards. I think United are still capable of doing that, going with the back four.",
      "\"Whatever the manager wants to set up, if it's with the back five, you have to get off to a good start and score the first goal and then counter attack against teams. I think it's a good system then.",
      "\"If you're chasing the game, I always feel that you're lacking a midfield player or a forward so you're short in numbers because you've got the five at the back.",
      "\"I would like to see him be a bit more flexible but it looks like he's got his mind and he said it all last season that he's got his mind set on the back five so it's up to him and the players to show that they really can play in that system.",
      "\"They need to take on board what the manager's trying to achieve and pick it up as the season goes on because it is still early in the season and we have played against two very good teams who are going to be up there challenging for the title. So it has been quite a difficult start.\"",
      "Robson is one of the finest midfielders to have represented United and he also shared his thoughts on Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "\"Back in my days, Paul Ince was an underrated player and great to play with because Ince was quick, he could tackle, he was a really good passer of the ball and I think Ince was a very underrated player,\" said Robson.",
      "\"Why he was underrated is because the United fans were not pleased that he fell out with Sir Alex and then he went to Inter and he came back and played for Liverpool, so all the Man United fans didn’t like that, a Man United player who's done really well going to Liverpool.",
      "\"I definitely do (think Mainoo could be the next Ince). When I heard that Mainoo might be leaving the club, I was really against it. I think he's a real talent. Last year, he had quite a few injuries and couldn't get going but the year before that, he was outstanding and he looked as if he had great potential.",
      "\"As long as he keeps his feet on the ground and works really hard at it, he could be a really good player. I know he's more attacking but Mainoo can do the defending if you put it on him, and that's what he's got to do.",
      "\"He's got to get his overall game a little bit more established and then I think he would go really well with Bruno being the more advanced midfield player.\"",
      "Last season was stop-start for Mainoo due to a few small injuries and concerns about where he fits into Amorim's system. Amorim played the midfielder in different positions, even using him as a false nine.",
      "Mainoo relocated to the deeper midfield role in pre-season this summer, but Amorim raised eyebrows when he said Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes for a start.",
      "The youngster subsequently requested to leave on loan in the final days of the window, which was denied.",

      "Manchester United may seemingly already be putting plans in place for the January transfer window. One area of the squad has been the subject of plenty of speculation following the defeat to Manchester City in the Manchester derby.",
      "United may have signed three new forwards, a left-back and a goalkeeper during the summer transfer window, but a lot has been said about the need to sign a new midfielder. Brighton star Carlos Baleba was heavily linked with signing for United, but a move never materialised with the Seagulls reportedly demanding a fee in excess of £100million for the Cameroon international.",
      "With the summer transfer window now closed, a fresh report has now emerged claiming that United are interested in Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves. A report in the Daily Briefing has claimed that a €20million (£17million) deal could be on the cards with Neves apparently keen to return to Europe.",
      "This is not the first time that United have been linked with signing Neves. Reports first emerged back in 2018 claiming that United were interested in signing the Portugal international during his time at Wolves.",
      "Neves signed for Wolves in 2017 and helped the club secure promotion to the Premier League, before eventually playing a key role in helping the Molineux outfit also qualify for the Europa League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Neves made 253 appearances for Wolves, scoring 90 goals, and has since featured 60 times for Al-Hilal since making the switch to the Saudi Pro League back in 2023. A move for Neves now would come seven years after United were first linked with the midfielder.",
      "United would certainly benefit from a new option in midfield. What will be key is how determined United are to sign Baleba, and if they have a realistic chance of getting a deal over the line.",
      "If the answer to that is 'no', then the club will consider their options - and links to Neves may stick around. Neves has already outlined his desire to return to his former club Porto before he retires.",
      "\"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive: that's my big goal,\" he said last month.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28 years old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club, it's something I want to give them and experience [for myself].",
      "\"I used to go to the Aliados to celebrate Porto's titles but now I want to be on the other side and want to see my family celebrate.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted on the halfway line trying to get Bayindir's attention. Mbeumo was screaming at his goalkeeper, trying to tell him to keep his head up, and he eventually got the message across.",
      "Ruben Amorim confirmed at his pre-match press conference that Bayindir would start, despite making mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. That backfired because Bayindir was shaky from the first whistle.",
      "He was a bundle of nerves and went down to the ground far too easily for Haaland's first goal. Mbeumo sensed he was low on confidence after conceding City's third and tried to encourage him.",

      "\"Crying from the Stretford End... He'll turn the Reds around,\" they taunted before reverting to \"Old Trafford is falling down, Amorim is a f****** clown. Glazers staying 10 more years\".",
      "There was a debate on a radio station about whether United and City are still proper rivals, but you only need to listen to matchgoing fans to know that was a stupid suggestion.",
      "United fans who work with City supporters will dread going to work this morning.",
      "United need more leaders",
      "Noussair Mazraoui went down with an injury just outside the City box at the start of the second half and Doku approached him to gesture that he was exaggerating the extent of the issue.",
      "City fans whistled at Mazraoui while he took his time to get back to his feet. Leny Yoro began to make his way over, seemingly looking to protect his colleague from Doku's rant.",
      "Yoro was the only United player to offer protection to Mazraoui. The dressing room needs more characters like Yoro.",
      "The midfield is a problem",
      "The decision to start Ugarte raised eyebrows. The midfielder had been hooked at half-time against Grimsby Town after failing to track back for their first goal and was an unused substitute against Burnley.",
      "Amorim was expected to continue with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but he handed another chance to Ugarte because he felt the 24-year-old's pressing ability and energy would be valuable.",
      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",
      "The midfield is a problem for Amorim, but United didn't believe that area was a priority in the summer.",
      "Beautiful tribute for Hatton",
      "The death of legendary boxer Ricky Hatton was announced on Sunday morning. Hatton was a lifelong City supporter and was expected to attend Sunday's derby.",

Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",

But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",

      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",
      "It was an inexplicable game from the Chelsea coach who seemed to think there were no problems in publicly discussing afterwards how his panicking basically consigned them to defeat from as early as the fifth minute.",
      "Perhaps he owed Amorim a favour and wanted to ease the situation Manchester United.",
      "",
      "1) From openly defying hypothetical papal tactical demands one day to actively personifying the ‘call an ambulance…but not for me’ meme the next, it feels like whatever ultimately comes of this absurd reign of Ruben Amorim he has at least embraced the innate box-officeness of a Portuguese Manchester United manager.",
      "These are still foundations built out of water on a bouncy castle made from quicksand while wearing a blindfold and boxing gloves, but that Manchester United supporter is as close as he has ever been to getting a haircut and Amorim is delivering with interest on the promise he made upon his appointment.",
      "",
      "2) It should have been considerably easier. As the first half reached a crescendo of ludicrousness it became a case study in the importance of confidence in elite sport.",
      "These are ultra athletes who have every microscopic detail of the game fine-tuned by the finest minds around. But while Manchester United had the advantage in terms of numbers it was little more than 11 players with a collective belief surging through them against ten disjointed, shell-shocked individuals trying to survive.",
      "That sort of momentum never carries through over 90 minutes and it is crucial to adjust to those shifts in energy. It would have done Manchester United the world of good to win by three or four goals but the fortitude they displayed to hold on might actually be more beneficial in the long run.",
      "",
      "3) Even for Amorim personally it was far better game management than usual.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was unfortunate to be sacrificed at half-time but Manuel Ugarte helped ensure the midfield battle remained even on one of his better performances. Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro were more like-for-like replacements which introduced fresh legs. And Bruno Fernandes coming off was surprising, even before taking into account who was replacing him.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is still having his minutes bizarrely rationed but a cameo in which he won a free-kick and a corner while running down the clock was encouraging. He brought belated control to a game defined by chaos.",
      "",
      "4) Enzo Maresca, as the scriptures dictate, must adopt the crisis baton. And good lord was this a full-blown mid-life crisis.",
      "Robert Sanchez being sent off in the fifth minute was not ideal. Being critical, Robert Sanchez playing at all for a player trading entity which has spent £427billion on signings in the last three years is sub-optimal.",
      "But we’re splitting hairs and never has a single human been more bald than when Maresca responded by removing two of his forwards to chuck on a keeper and another centre-half, thus shedding more than a quarter of his starting XI within seven minutes of kick off.",
      "It does appear that an injury had befallen Cole Palmer, who himself was removed in the 21st. Yet Maresca himself said after the game that the England international had undergone fitness tests in the morning and “was not 100%”, so quite why Estevao Willian, Pedro Neto and any semblance of Chelsea’s pace and width had to also be abandoned is a mystery.",
      "Becoming the first manager in Premier League history to make as many as three substitutions in the opening 21 minutes of a game almost entirely because of a single mismanaged red card is hilariously damning.",
      "",
      "5) Maresca even openly and apparently without a modicum of professional shame admitted after the game that “all the plan went in the bin after the red card”, as if that isn’t a massively embarrassing indictment on him as the coach.",
      "It is honestly difficult to recall a worse example of management in an entire half of Premier League football.",
      "",
      "6) It transmitted a message of panic to the players, a collective headloss from which they could not fully recover.",
      "In the 13 minutes between the first two substitutes coming on and Palmer going off, Chelsea’s combined pass success rate was 53%. Every defender and keeper Filip Jorgensen was guilty of ceding possession in dangerous areas under pressure from an invigorated Manchester United as such a wholesale change of shape and personnel evoked a sense of hysteria and doubt.",
      "At one point in the first half a remarkably Italian voice could be heard screaming “eh, eh, eh, Reece take the throw-in” when Wesley Fofana had the ball in his hands on the halfway line. It epitomised a side being micro-managed into oblivion.",
      "The red card created the sort of problem coaches tend to try and alleviate. Maresca exacerbated it.",
      "",
      "7) It was a lightning quick Manchester United start. In the opening couple of minutes a cross barely evaded Sesko in the area, skidding across the turf and onto the head of Bryan Mbeumo to force a save from Sanchez.",
      "Soon after, a long Altay Bayindir kick was flicked on by Sesko for Mbeumo to chase, round Sanchez and elicit the red card.",
      "There was a sense at that point that Manchester United had to capitalise on their ascendancy. A desperation, even, summed up by Matthijs de Ligt shooting from range in the 11th minute as if trying desperately to break a low block in second half stoppage time.",
      "But then a fine move culminated in Noussair Mazraoui crossing for Patrick Dorgu’s clever head back into the centre as Bruno Fernandes timed his run impeccably to convert.",
      "Dorgu is bafflingly important in terms of the attacking structures of a club which spent £200m on new forwards this summer, but early on he was excellent and there is hope that, at 20, those fundamentals can eventually be polished and harnessed.",
      "",
      "8) Casemiro going through the back of Enzo Fernandez near the halfway line as both the Argentinean and Chelsea as an entity posed precisely zero threat had an immediate air of the foreboding seemingly random brief highlight on Match of the Day.",
      "The second yellow about half an hour later for an arguably soft but ultimately completely avoidable and entirely stupid foul on Andrey Santos confirmed it.",
      "If a 33-year-old 78-cap Brazil international five-time European champion doesn’t realise he can’t slide tackle from behind or grab people and fall over then he probably can’t be relied upon consistently in a competent midfield, never mind this Manchester United one.",
      "",
      "9) There was at least a parting gift as Casemiro headed Manchester United into a two-goal lead shortly before indulging in the sort of foolishness which really ought to be beyond his years.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is presumably still watching and waiting for that ball to come down into the gaggle of players while forgetting he has the slight in-built advantage over them in being able to use his hands.",
      "It was atrocious goalkeeping and Chelsea will remain completely unserious while they steadfastly refuse to acknowledge that having a good, even just reliable presence between the posts is quite important.",
      "",
      "10) A couple of minutes after that goal, Manchester United should have had another. Amad won the ball from Fofana in Chelsea’s defensive third and raced towards goal with Jorgensen venturing comedically and pointedly far off his line to close the angle.",
      "Sesko was waiting unmarked in the middle but the ball never came, with Casemiro’s red ultimately falling on the Slovenian’s head.",
      "Another goalless game will delight the growing critics but his flick-on for the Sanchez red proved decisive and there were some bright moments of link-up play from a striker whose development cannot have been aided by these stop-start beginnings.",
      "",
      "11) It did seem at one point as though Chelsea’s best hope would be for the game to be abandoned due to a waterlogged pitch.",
      "Or beyond that, maybe for them to have a semblance of an attacking idea beyond just giving the ball to Joao Pedro and expecting him to dribble past five or six players before scoring.",
      "Even when Casemiro was sent off and parity in terms of numbers was restored, Chelsea were in no position to capitalise after those perplexing early changes. It’s almost like giving up all hope on a game after five minutes because of one setback is unnecessary.",
      "",
      "12) Maresca did still have two substitutions left, so obviously brought on Tyrique George and Malo Gusto – a forward they tried to sell this summer and a full-back when theoretically chasing a result.",
      "It meant £48.5m Jamie Gittens, £40m and incredibly motivated Alejandro Garnacho and Marc Guiu, who has not played since being recalled from his loan at Sunderland almost three weeks ago, remained on the bench.",
      "The game management was poor but that man management is diabolical.",
      "",
      "13) The one positive to come out of this game for Chelsea was the performance of Reece James at right-back. A few of his deliveries were exceptional, including the cross Trevoh Chalobah converted late on.",
      "It doesn’t feel like that will be enough to convince Maresca it might be worth deploying the very good right-back at right-back more often but still.",
      "",
      "14) Manchester United were excellent defensively, with De Ligt continuing to grow into his leadership role. The hosts wouldn’t have held out without him. He’d have even given Gabby Agbonlahor and Gary Taylor-Fletcher a challenge in this mood.",
      "",
      "15) That is a bruising week for Chelsea, their first run of three winless games since February.",
      "Maresca does have credit in the bank through Champions League qualification and some lesser trophies but it has been an underwhelming start to the season with an even shorter title challenge than the one the Italian spent most of last season writing off anyway.",
      "He was right when he said these players were “not ready” to compete for that level of silverware; there needs to be a degree of introspection in accepting that the same should be said of him too.",
      "",
      "16) This was the first Premier League game Manchester United have won without scoring in the second half since March 2024. It inherently feels more sustainable than relying on stoppage-time penalties and late individual heroics to get through.",
      "For a team and a coach basically learning how to win together it was potentially transformative how they did it. They could also entirely feasibly follow this up with defeats to Brentford and Sunderland before the international break, because ultimately inferring anything about this club based on a single result or performance is really stupid and only the sort of thing their billionaire owners should indulge in.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Premier League Sack Race. But who will be next? Not much cover for Ruben Amorim now…",
      "Facing a Chelsea side doing everything in their power to save Ruben Amorim’s job, even Man Utd couldn’t mess that one up, despite Casemiro’s best attempts.",
      "Paul Merson has made a prediction relating to Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, while Wayne Rooney has raised one “big question” about the game vs Chelsea.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has made three significant decisions for Manchester United’s game against Chelsea on Saturday evening.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United stars ‘privately’ gave a ‘withering verdict’ on Alejandro Garnacho before he joined Chelsea in the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has “decided” to “die on his sword” at Manchester United and there is no road back for the head coach after his latest excuse…"

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who only really has misery and Graham Potter for company.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either. But against Arsenal they showed the ‘mettle of champions’.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brought back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "It’s not been awful, but it’s really not been great either. Being above Manchester United is not the boast it used to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There is some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there could be more on the wagon.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of the season. The latter months of the season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone – draws with Burnley less so – but it is an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat when not playing Wolves is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. The win over Chelsea is not a turning point; they’ve run out of those.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that. Then any renewed optimism was dashed by exposing defeats to Tottenham and Crystal Palace.",

      "Facing a Chelsea side doing everything in their power to keep Ruben Amorim in a job, even Manchester United couldn’t mess that one up, despite Casemiro’s best attempts.",
      "First things first, that was an astonishing game of football. The first half between Manchester United and Chelsea was one of the most manic, ridiculous halves of football you will see all season. The second 45 didn’t have quite as much drama, but it still delivered some ridiculous Barclays.",
      "Robert Sanchez was sent off for taking out Bryan Mbeumo on the edge of the box with only five minutes on the clock, prompting Enzo Maresca to make an early double change, hooking Estevao and Pedro Neto for Tosin Adarabioyo and goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen in a bizarre ploy that removed all of the pace from his attack and the majority of their threat on the break.",
      "Nine minutes after Sanchez’s red, United took the lead through Bruno Fernandes. VAR then threatened to disallow it for offside. Chelsea continued to be absolutely shambolic thanks to some terrible in-game management from Maresca, while Cole Palmer was brought off with what was hopefully an injury. With 70 minutes remaining, Amorim’s men were up against 10 men, all over the place, without their best player and without the ability to counter-attack effectively. Even they couldn’t f**k this, right?",
      "Well, it got better when Casemiro scored in the 37th minute, until he went from unlikely hero to likely villain. With both teams down to 10 and Alejandro Garnacho on the bench, there was the potential for the most hilarious outcome ever.",
      "In the torrential rain that the Old Trafford roof definitely couldn’t handle, there were fouls left, right and centre and the ball was slowing down in puddles while Amorim wished he had his wellies for the paddling pool in his technical area.",
      "As we say, it was a mad one.",
      "Tactics were thrown out of the window with both teams — especially Chelsea — incredibly open, as Maresca continued to make things up as he went along. In a game Amorim desperately needed to win with United 17th in the Premier League at kick-off, he managed it much better than the Blues boss and has bought himself some time with a crucial win against a team doing their best United-under-Amorim impression.",
      "From the three early changes made by Maresca, it was surprising that Wesley Fofana was not one of the players he hooked, even with a natural defender in Tosin replacing a winger. But there was always a chance that United would go full United and throw away the most glorious opportunity to beat a ‘Big Six’ rival. At least they ended up not having to worry about Garnacho influencing a comeback after Maresca used his last substitution with 26 minutes left. His brother’s Instagram story will be interesting.",
      "One of those to come on was Tyrique George, who finally provided some pace out wide for the visitors. We’re very surprised it wasn’t Garnacho. And Fofana was eventually brought off as well. Were they the worst five substitutions made by a manager in a single Premier League game?",
      "Despite some questionable management, Chelsea were able to grow into the game by knocking it around, but their ability to unlock the United defence was restricted as Palmer watched from the bench. One moment of quality set up a big last 10 when Reece James’ pinpoint cross was met by Trevoh Chalobah’s forehead for Chelsea’s first effort on target — and a goal that Altay Bayindir could do nothing to stop.",
      "Chelsea pushed for an equaliser that they didn’t deserve and which would have made Casemiro public enemy number one in Manchester, having thrown away United’s control with a stupid second yellow card, but United held on and successfully navigated the closing minutes.",
      "Thankfully for Amorim, his players held on for a first home win against a ‘Big Six’ rival under his watch. Chelsea, on the other hand, end an abysmal week with one of their most dysfunctional and calamitous performances under Maresca. They threw it away at Brentford last weekend, were thumped by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, and now they’ve lost to the most beatable United team since, well, last season, giving them little choice but to take advantage and earn a fat, juicy win.",
      "United will take what they’re given and try to beat what’s in front of them. This victory gives Amorim more time to get his players used to a formation that hasn’t been working and shows he can beat teams deemed direct rivals, even if 11 places separated them last season.",
      "He’s clearly still working things out, continuing his 100% record of changing his back three every single game this season as Matthijs de Ligt was again the only centre-back to start and finish a Premier League match.",

      "Despite having two transfer windows to build his squad, Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation remains ineffective in both defence and attack, with it obvious that a change to 4-3-2-1 is necessary to get the more out of a struggling side.",
      "So, it will be infuriating for Man Utd fans that Amorim once again insisted on Friday that he “will not change” as he fears a U-turn could make his players “look at him differently”.",

      "Amorim is a head coach with a specialised system, but his bullish refusal to adapt at all will ensure that he will not “have the time to change”, because he is judged on wins and he cannot get away with being 14th in the Premier League for much longer.",
      "The reason for Amorim’s clear stance is that he doesn’t want to lose face in the dressing room, but recent reports have indicated that the squad are giving up regardless, so this risk is necessary as a final Hail Mary to save his job. Without it, there is no road back for the head coach…",

      "“When he first joined, there wasn’t too much expectation on him, but that has changed after he’s shown what he can offer on the pitch. You hear a lot about ‘second season syndrome’, where players struggle to live up to the expectations that have been set on them after a strong run of performances – I think that is what has happened to Kobbie.",
      "“I’d love to see him back in the team, playing at his full potential. I’m happy that Ruben Amorim kept him at the club this season, rather than sending him on loan; I believe he can force himself back into the starting lineup.”",

One of Ferguson’s early fledglings, Russell Beardsmore, enjoyed a five-year stay at Dean Court after leaving Old Trafford.

Like many of that era, Manley was deprived of his prime years but resumed playing for the Bees in 1946. Had he stayed at Old Trafford his experience could’ve helped new manager Matt Busby lift the title in his first season, with the Red Devils finishing just one point behind champions Liverpool.",

Andy Ritchie departed for Brighton shortly before his 20th birthday when he could’ve played well into the Alex Ferguson era.",

It wasn’t long before Eagles faced his former team-mates, helping the Clarets to a famous 1-0 win over the Red Devils at the start of the 2009/10 season. If Ferguson’s men had taken all three points that day, they would’ve retained the title and become the first English club to win four in a row, long before City did it.",

      "Ferguson wasn’t to know Mark Hughes would continue playing top-flight football well into his late 30s but the Welshman’s experience and grit may have come in handy during the 1997/98 campaign. Eric Cantona’s retirement, Teddy Sheringham’s initial struggles as his replacement and captain Roy Keane’s season-ending injury saw the Red Devils lose their Premier League crown to Arsenal.",

Neville, Tim Howard and Darron Gibson all featured for Everton in the bonkers 4-4 draw that cost United top spot in the 2011/12 season.

The Argentine forward helped the Red Devils to two Premier League titles, an EFL Cup and a Champions League triumph in his short stay at Old Trafford. However, Tevez then ended up on the blue side of Manchester and despite going on strike in the 2011/12 season, he returned to help deliver a first top-flight title to City since 1968.",
      "",
      "Playing for the red and blue sides of both Manchester and Merseyside is unusual but what’s even more bizarre is Ron Atkinson’s decision to let a young Peter Beardsley go so soon after signing him. One of England’s finest players in the late ’80s and early ’90s, Beardsley was behind the likes of Whiteside, Stapleton and Macari in the pecking order at Old Trafford, but given his ability to be far more than an out-and-out marksman it remains a mystery that he only featured in one match for the Red Devils.",

      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "In this summer’s transfer window, the Red Devils proved that, despite their prolonged on-field woes, they retain immense pulling power purely on name value.",
      "Man Utd were a thorn in the side of Newcastle United as they beat Eddie Howe’s side to Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while Senne Lammens opted for Old Trafford over Galatasaray.",
      "Still, limited finances prevented Man Utd from getting everyone they wanted, as they did not have the necessary funds to sign top midfield target Carlos Baleba from Brighton.",
      "United were reportedly quoted around £100m for Baleba, who could have made a transformational impact and turned Ruben Amorim’s side into a credible European contender.",
      "It was even reported that Baleba was keen on the move, thus proving that their pull remains, but this deal was too good to be true as Man Utd could not finance a deal after investing around £200m on overhauling their attack.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Arsenal v Man City, Liverpool, Ollie Watkins, Ruben Amorim",
      "Man Utd’s ‘dream’ move for Baleba was certainly ambitious, but it has a far greater chance of happening next year, once he and a No.6 is their overwhelming transfer priority, and it has already been reported that they ‘will return’ for him in 2026.",
      "However, Man Utd’s failure to land Baleba at the earliest opportunity opens them up to future heartache, and with Liverpool lurking in the background, this saga is likely to end in tears for INEOS.",
      "Liverpool have just put together an all-timer transfer window, investing £414.5m as this summer’s biggest spending club to sign Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.",
      "This further cemented the Reds as a leading global superpower and it gives head coach Arne Slot a near-perfect squad, which has only a couple of weak spots.",
      "One such area is at centre-back, which will be fixed once they land long-term target Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, while the absence of quality competition for Ryan Gravenberch in the No.6 role is another issue.",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n👉 Arsenal’s elite finishing, Man Utd just shoot, Spurs’ unsustainable start: one xG nugget per Premier League club\n👉 Arsenal second XI would finish in top six as Premier League back-ups ranked\n👉 Premier League prize money table revealed with Chelsea taking top spot after November picks",
      "This is why their reported interest in Baleba makes a lot of sense, with a report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claiming Man Utd are ‘shellshocked’ at the very real possibility of missing out on the Brighton standout to Liverpool.",
      "Jones explained to TEAMtalk: “Manchester United were the first club to make a move for Baleba in the summer and they still see him as a key target for their long-term rebuild under Amorim. There was intent behind that approach, wanting to show the player and club how serious they are.",
      "“But the concern is that Liverpool’s admiration could turn into something more concrete.",
      "“They’ve already shown this year they’re not afraid to splash out big money on the right player, and if they decided to push for Baleba, United would suddenly find themselves in an unwanted situation. No one wants to go head-to-head with Liverpool – on or off the pitch.”",
      "As Jones says, “no one wants to go head-to-head with Liverpool” on the pitch or at the negotiating table.",
      "Given the state of each club, it would be a no-brainer for Baleba to choose the current Premier League holders over Man Utd, who face the nightmare of seeing a perfect signing head to their biggest rivals and to be left chasing their tails for a far less suitable alternative.",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Liverpool are making ‘serious moves’ to land a star Manchester United midfield target in the January transfer window, according to insider Indy Kaila.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’.",
      "Man Utd will look to make a new signing in the January transfer window with INEOS ‘desperate’ to bring in a defensive midfielder, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘preparing’ a record ‘offer’ for Brighton star Carlos Baleba as they look to make an ‘historic signing’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already been dealt a ‘huge’ blow as they consider whether to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton in January."

      "Rashford has had a mixed start to life at Barcelona and there were even some “bulls**t” rumours that they could terminate his loan early – but his stunning brace against Newcastle in the Champions League showed what the Man Utd loanee can do.",
      "But Amorim preferred to focus on Hojlund’s debut goal for Napoli over Rashford’s double at St James’ Park. When asked about Rashford’s brace, Amorim replied: “Rasmus scored, I am happy for Rasmus also.",
      "READ: Three games to save Man Utd job? Chelsea could end Amorim in one…",
      "“It is the same thing with him guys. You are so tough on Rasmus but he scored also, so let’s notice that.”",
      "Man Utd also sold one of their most talented young players over the summer with Alejandro Garnacho joining Premier League rivals Chelsea.",
      "But Amorim has dismissed suggestions that their decision to sell Garnacho to Chelsea – who Man Utd play on Saturday – could backfire on the Red Devils.",
      "Amorim added: “I am not concerned about that – I just want to win games.",
      "“I don’t care who plays for the opponent or what people are going to say in the end if a player is going to play well.",
      "“They are good players and they will play well if things happen. I am just focusing on the game and my players – that is my only concern.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez has returned to training following a serious injury and when asked what that might do for the Man Utd defender mentally, Amorim replied: “It’s really important [to be on grass]. When you have that injury, you have that time where you recover a lot of things really fast, then there is the boring part, it looks like you don’t go to the next step.",
      "“We miss a lot Licha, especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him, but he’s always there in every meeting, in every training, he sometimes finishes his and stays to watch the training. We need Licha in this team.”",

      "When a manager enters ‘X number of games to save his job’ territory, he rarely emerges from it on firm ground. Ruben Amorim has reportedly been given the next three matches, but the first of that pre-Anfield run on Saturday feels more decisive than the two that may or may not follow.",
      "United welcome Chelsea to Old Trafford on Saturday evening. Despite the sh*tshow that has unfolded since Sir Alex Ferguson left, the Red Devils have never lost to the Blues at home in the Premier League under all the managers that followed. Should Amorim become the first, the writing won’t be on the wall so much as highlighted in illuminous marker and ringed in red.",
      "He could not claim to have not had the time to prepare for what’s coming. The slither of positivity, should you squint to see it, from their European absence was said to be all the time Amorim would have with his players on the training pitch.",
      "United will have had Monday to Friday to work on the flaws ruthlessly exposed by Manchester City in the derby. As Amorim suggested, the Red Devils enjoyed more control at the Etihad than they have on most of their visits in recent years. The manager’s problem, though, is control means little without the moments. And the flaws they demonstrated at key times cannot really be fixed in a single working week.",
      "That isn’t enough time to impart upon Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro or Kobbie Mainoo the freakish mobility necessary to cover all the ground required of midfielders in Amorim’s system. It is definitely not long enough to turn Bruno Fernandes into a No.6, not that any coach in their right mind should ever want to.",
      "Nor is five days enough to give his players the confidence and technique necessary to make the moments matter. City, in both boxes, definitely did. Which leaves United’s belief in themselves, but more worryingly their manager’s methods, shredded before Chelsea turn up.",
      "Fernandes was candid when after the derby, as ever, he faced the inquest interviews. The skipper admitted United were too easy to outnumber in midfield, especially when the centre-backs are not feeling ‘brave’ enough to jump out and help.",
      "That would have been music to Enzo Maresca’s ears had the Chelsea boss not already spotted the bleedin’ obvious.",
      "Maresca’s whole schtick is creating overloads in the exact areas the Red Devils are vulnerable. Without some tweaking to Amorim’s precious system, even subtly, it is hard to envisage how Cole Palmer won’t find the space to make United dance to his tune.",
      "But Amorim will not change. We know that because he has freely told us so on a twice-weekly basis. And so defiant he has been over sticking to his principles, he would be harshly judged for changing them now by the exact people who have lobbied him to do so.",
      "Chelsea, though, have yet to show the consistency that might have Amorim pre-emptively packing his bags before the weekend. They play in fits and starts, and while Maresca comes to terms with juggling his many, many players around a heavy workload – in stark contrast to United – there remains too great a difference between what they are capable of and what they often produce.",
      "Their set up, while posing opponents many problems in possession, does offer up opportunities, especially on the counter. If United can muster up just a hint of the ruthlessness they have lacked so far this season, they ought to get the chances to showcase it.",
      "Without that, and a midfield solution that no-one outside Carrington can foresee, Amorim might not make it to Brentford, let alone Liverpool.",
      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",

      "At the time, Serie A giants Napoli looked to sign Mainoo on loan, but this move was blocked by INEOS and Amorim, who felt they could not let him leave as his exit would have left them short on midfield options.",
      "READ: Kobbie Mainoo is crushing Ruben Amorim in fight for Manchester United future",
      "Subsequently, Amorim has eased Mainoo into the fold, and he was a bright spark in an otherwise dour afternoon as Man Utd lost 3-0 to Man City last weekend.",
      "However, it still remains to be seen whether Mainoo’s long-term future is at Man Utd, as he has also attracted interest from Real Madrid.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Real Madrid have ‘set their sights on finding successors to Luka Modric and Toni Kroos’ and Mainoo is their ‘main target’.",
      "Though it is also noted that a ‘deal will not be easy’ as Man Utd’s ‘clear stance’ on Mainoo’s future is a ‘bombshell’, because ‘if anyone wants to sign their star player, they’ll have to pay €90 million’ (around £78m).",
      "Man Utd can demand a sizable fee for Mainoo as he is under contract until 2027, though this reported price is higher than the £40m they requested in the summer.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘The most surprising thing is that the player himself is not going through the best of times at United. This situation has caused discontent in the player, who, according to various reports, has already expressed to those close to him his desire to change teams in the upcoming transfer window.",
      "‘Even so, Manchester United doesn’t seem willing to facilitate his departure. The English club’s strategy is to leverage the midfielder’s contract, which runs until 2027, to secure a multi-million-dollar transfer. Real Madrid, aware that it needs new blood for its midfield in the medium term, has made it clear that it will consider the deal, but always within financial parameters they consider reasonable.’",
      "Man Utd have made a bid of €50m plus Kobbie Mainoo in an attempt to convince Real Madrid to part with Federico Valverde, according to reports.",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United have been told to sell Bruno Fernandes and build around Kobbie Mainoo, but they face the ‘most excruciating’ outcome.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim will reportedly be sacked on one condition as Kobbie Mainoo’s situation at the club has baffled his Red Devils team-mates.",

      "Ruben Amorim is doomed at Manchester United as he’s been set an ‘ultimatum’ that everyone was aware of before this afternoon’s ‘exclusive’ was released…",
      "As usual, Amorim and Ratcliffe have been in the headlines as the INEOS chief has ‘flown in’ to hold ‘talks’ with the Man Utd head coach.",
      "This comes amid a dire start to the 2025/26 campaign for Man Utd, who look no better this season than they did in 2024/25 as they sit 14th after four games.",
      "Their situation is not helped by Amorim still refusing to budge from his favoured 3-4-3 formation, despite it being clear for all to see that it is not working and doesn’t suit this group of players.",
      "All indications are that Amorim is bullishly insisting that his tactics are not the problem, even though he suggested on Friday that his side is “playing well until the boxes”, which indicates a pretty major flaw regarding system and/or personnel.",
      "Alan Shearer reckons Amorim will continue to stick to his current tactics and “die on his sword” at Man Utd, and it’s hard to look past this being the outcome of his sorry saga at Old Trafford.",
      "READ: Rashford U-turn confirmed after Amorim somehow receives ‘pointed message’ from ‘toxic’ star",

      "‘However, returning to some form of European football is seen as essential by the United hierarchy.’",
      "First of all, it is pretty bold of talkSPORT to label this as an ‘exclusive’, because everyone knows that Man Utd’s minimum aim in any season is to qualify for some European competition, with this especially the case following another summer of huge spending.",
      "This is just common sense, but it does mean that Amorim is doomed, as a seismic change brought about by a change of formation and/or a couple of marquee signings in January is required to give Man Utd any hope of anything more than back-to-back bottom-half finishes in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim and Man Utd would have a greater chance of achieving an upturn in results and performances if there is a transition to a far more suited 4-2-3-1 formation, as the head coach is yet to come close to getting the maximum out of this squad.",
      "However, Ratcliffe’s assertion that this Man Utd side is ‘capable of a top-five finish’ is naive beyond belief and exposes his lack of know-how.",
      "The squads of Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea are far superior to Man Utd’s, while they can also make a strong case that Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United are better.",
      "So Man Utd may have earned ‘record revenue’ despite themselves, but the frailties of Amorim and Ratcliffe leave them miles behind their main rivals on the pitch, and there is more pain to come before INEOS gets the club back on an upward trajectory on the pitch.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £53.1m",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the November selections with four more games each:",

      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",

      "Saturday 20 September 2025 23:12, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",

      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he hopes to get the time to show how his system will evolve, but insists not even the Pope will make him change it right now for fear of what the players will think of him.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" he said. \"Not once [have I thought about changing]. Not even the Pope [can make me], it will not change.\"",
      "Amorim has maintained he will stick with his 3-4-2-1 formation despite having the worst win percentage of any United boss since the Second World War and overseeing their worst start in the Premier League for 33 years.",
      "United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference - since Amorim was appointed last November.",
      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",
      "However, he is concerned about what his squad would think if he changed now and hopes he will be in charge long enough for it to happen.",
      "\"If I'm a player and I have a coach with a lot of pressure to change the system and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"When you think about the impact of any decision on the team, everything is important.",
      "\"This will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way. It will change, I hope to have the time to change.\"",
      "One of the issues with Amorim's system has been in midfield where Bruno Fernandes has played in a deeper role. Amorim believes he is still having an impact higher up the pitch and is integral in making them dominate games.",
      "\"Bruno wants all the freedom in the world but even when he played a No 10 role, it's getting the ball back,\" he said. \"Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box but he's getting there and is near the box and can have shots.",
      "\"I want Bruno to be more deep to have more possession to try and control more of the game. We are doing that. Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit in front, maybe because (Matheus) Cunha is not there. I'm trying to balance the team and imagine the game.",
      "\"I see Bruno [doing] well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further but he has a job to do. The important thing is not Bruno playing well, it's the team playing well and winning football games.\"",
      "Amorim believes the data is showing improvement although believes they lack belief compared to Liverpool, who have been winning games late on.",
      "He said: \"It's belief, confidence, aggression. It's everything. Sometimes what we call luck. It's the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"Liverpool are winning all the games in the 90th minute, it's something about the teams that are winning to have that feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well but something is going to go wrong.",
      "\"We need to change that but just with wins. If you look at the goals against Man City, Fulham, we scored against Burnley, we are good in the game but then we draw. All these moments I think we can do better. It's our fault.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho returns to Old Trafford for the first time since his £40m move to Chelsea after being told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.",
      "Asked if the transfer could backfire on Man Utd, Amorim said: \"I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing for the opponent, [or] what people are going to say in the end if the player plays well. They are good players and they play well if things happen. My only focus is winning the game.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has played down the significance of a meeting with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe at the club's training ground this week, insisting their talks were \"normal\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract,\" Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe's visit.",
      "\"No, it's normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it's a long project. He said many times, 'This is my third season.' For me, it's not. But normal things.",
      "\"I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.",
      "\"So, a normal meeting, and we had several, but in this moment, it's normal that people pay attention to that.\"",
      "Amorim is under scrutiny having only won one of Manchester United's first four games of the season and also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town.",
      "\"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win,\" he said.",
      "The 40-year-old insists he sees improvement in their performances but admits they need to improve at both ends of the pitch.",
      "\"Last year I was very critical of the way we played,\" Amorim added. \"I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "Amorim has had a free week with his players to prepare for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on the training pitch and says they have focused their efforts on being more effective in the boxes.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and the next game, and to prepare different things,\" he said. \"We are playing well until we reach the boxes.",
      "\"We need to be more clinical. The number of shots and the xG are good, but if you don't score, it doesn't matter.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games.",
      "\"We have to maintain the way we're playing and improving in our box and the opposition's box - that was the focus of the week. Especially against Chelsea, when they cross, they are the side with the most players in the box.\"",
      "The Manchester United boss confirmed he will be able to call on Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Chelsea but Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot are unavailable.",
      "Amorim bemoaned the absence of Martinez, who is edging towards a return to fitness having not featured since suffering a knee injury in February.",
      "\"When you recover from that injury, you have time where you recover a lot of things fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step,\" he said.",
      "\"We've missed him a lot. Especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does. But he's always there, in every meeting and when he finishes he stays to watch training.",
      "\"We need him in this team.\"",

      "Between the Lines returns with an in-depth look at Ruben Amorim's system and the reasons why Man Utd are struggling to make it work; Sunday's 3-0 loss to Man City leaves them with a worse record than any ever-present Premier League side since last year",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Tom Stitson",
      "Saturday 20 September 2025 17:07, UK",
      "Manchester United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City in Sunday's derby increased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim and raised more questions about his favoured 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",
