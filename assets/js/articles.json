      "Real Betis are confident Manchester United will 'give in' on their transfer demands for Antony, as the La Liga side plan to take advantage to sign the winger who impressed on loan last term. Betis are prepared to be patient to come to another loan agreement, per AS, and the club are more than hopeful of coming to a deal should no 'high-flying' offers arrive.",
      "The Red Devils want to sell the Brazil international after he was unable to break into Ruben Amorim's plans following the Portuguese coach's arrival. Betis are interested in a deal after Antony became a key player in taking the team to the Conference League final.",
      "The ex-Ajax star will need to be prepared to take a pay-cut to secure the move after feeling at home in Spain working under Manuel Pellegrini. But a deal may have to wait until nearer the end of the window as United try to secure a fee for a permanent move.",
      "Antony scored nine goals and produced five assists in 26 appearances for Betis after joining the club. A transfer has seen little progress thus far, despite a willingness on all sides to see an Old Trafford exit.",
      "Speaking this week, Real Betis president Angel Haro spoke to Cope Sevilla, per Sport Witness, and suggested the move was outside of their control. Haro stressed Antony’s return depends 'on Manchester United, Antony and on Betis being willing to pay the transfer fee”.",
      "“He’s a fantastic player; he’s given us a lot in the last six months, but we have to get everything right; we can’t go crazy. We’re working on that path because it’s not easy,\" said Haro.",
      "“We’re very imaginative when it comes to approaching this type of transaction, but it’s complex. It involves the player, who loves Betis, but he also has to consider his own interests.”",
      "Betis are expected to raise some funds through Johnny Cardoso's move to Atlietco Madrid this summer. The Spanish side could bring in £26m to aid any offer for Antony.",
      "Antony is among a number of United players the club are attempting to facilitate permanent exits for. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are all yet to find a new club despite the 13-times Premier League champions deciding they want to part ways.",
      "Sancho is said to be in talks over a possible move to Juventus after Chelsea paid a £5million fee in order to cancel turning the star's loan into a permanent deal. Rashford meanwhile could have renewed hope of a move to Barcelona after their target, Nico Williams, extended his stay at Athletic Bilbao."

      "The defender made over 300 appearances for Celtic and won 15 major trophies, including six Scottish league titles. Clark was also part of the famous Celtic team who became the first British club to lift the European Cup in 1967, beating Inter Milan in Lisbon.",
      "Clark's funeral mass was held at St Mary's Church in the Calton area of Glasgow. Afterwards, the funeral cortege travelled down The Celtic Way outside the club's stadium.",
      "Multiple stars, including the entire Celtic first-team squad, were in attendance. Keane and Wright both played for Celtic at the latter end of their respective careers, and they paid their respects to Clark.",
      "Also pictured in attendance was Rangers CEO Patrick Stewart. Stewart, a former member of Manchester United's board, left Old Trafford in July 2024 and joined Rangers last December.",
      "Rangers commented on Clark's passing, posting on social media: \"Everyone at Rangers passes on their condolences to the Clark family and all Celtic at this sad time.\"",
      "At the chapel, a number of Portuguese flags were on display. It was a nod to both the scene of Celtic's European Cup triumph as well as honouring the tragic deaths of Liverpool forward Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva, in a car crash on Thursday.",
      "Celtic said ahead of the funeral: \"John Clark was a Lisbon Lion, a cornerstone of our greatest ever team and a dedicated servant to Celtic. We come together to honour his incredible legacy.\"",
      "Manager Brendan Rodgers paid a heartfelt tribute to Clark, saying: \"Greatness is a word people throw around, but for John Clark it is a very fitting tribute. John was instrumental in delivering our greatest day ever and his achievement is forever etched in Celtic’s proud history.",
      "\"John's continued presence at Celtic across so many decades I know served as an absolute inspiration to so many players, managers and staff, including myself very much.",
      "\"To have him with us, as part of the club for so long has been a tremendous privilege for us all, it meant so much to us. Through his knowledge, his wisdom and his true love for Celtic, John has made such an important contribution to the club.",

      "Former Manchester United star Gabriel Heinze once was regarded as a legend in the making at the club. Joining the Red Devils from PSG in 2004, a Premier League title followed as the Old Trafford faithful adored his full-blooded commitment on the pitch – until he tried to leave United under hugely controversial circumstances.",
      "Heinze's next move was viewed as self-sabotage of the highest order as the Argentinian star set fire to his United legacy when he attempted to force a move to Liverpool in the summer of 2007.",
      "In doing so he subsequently broke one of English football's most sacred yet unwritten rules: players not move from United to their bitter rivals and vice-versa.",
      "Heinze, now 47, is now set to join Mikel Arteta’s coaching staff at Arsenal ahead of the new season as the Gunners are in the midst of a coaching reshuffle, with former assistant Carlos Cuesta having departed for Parma.",
      "Heinze's return to the Premier League will no doubt ignite memories of one of English football's most brutal transfer sagas of when the Argentinian was seeking to traipse the M62 divide and join then-manager Rafa Benitez at Liverpool.",
      "The controversial switch would have made him the first player since Phil Chisnall in 1964 to move directly between the two sides. Yet the union of Heinze and Liverpool will always be a case of 'What if?' Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson spectacularly dug his heels in to ensure that the defender would never get his wish.",
      "It began as Heinze's agent, Roberto Rodriguez, was reportedly informed by United's then-chief executive David Gill that he could leave for £6.8million. Yet United never foresaw that the full-back would clamour for a switch to their greatest rivals.",
      "An offer matching United's valuation was then indeed lodged by the Reds. However, the Red Devils knocked back Liverpool's proposal, to Heinze's dismay, and so lawyers were consulted.",
      "The legendary United boss also claimed United were in the driving seat over the move. Benitez however was left stunned by United's refusal to play ball.",
      "\"It’s clear he’s a player we like and he’s a very good player,\" Liverpool's Spanish boss said. \"That’s the reason why they don’t want him to leave for us.\"",
      "In another twist to one of the Premier League's bloodiest transfer tussles, it later emerged that Crystal Palace were offered the chance to buy Heinze by a South American-based agency, and then sell him to Liverpool straight after.",
      "This would allegedly pocket the Eagles £1m in compensation, as revealed by former Palace chairman Simon Jordan in his memoir, Be Careful What You Wish For.",
      "\"My stance was no way were we getting involved and I told Alexander to contact David Gill, Manchester United’s chief executive, and tell him of these attempted shenanigans, which he duly did,\" Jordan wrote.",
      "Heinze and his agent eventually took the case to a Premier League arbitration panel in a bid to engineer the move. However, Jordan's evidence was later used in the hearing which saw United prevail.",
      "After losing the right to move to Liverpool, Heinze told the Daily Mail: \"My fight is for the freedom to negotiate with any club. United never wanted me to leave for one of the big clubs, but this anti-Liverpool clause is incredible.\"",
      "Liverpool were reportedly expecting Heinze to appeal. Yet a late charge never materialised from the player as United accepted a bid from Real Madrid.",
      "\"I don't have many regrets from my career as a footballer, but that episode with Ferguson [has] to be one of them,\" Heinze later said of the ordeal. \"I spent three years in Manchester and had some great moments and I regret [leaving the club] a lot.\"",
      "After United, Heinze went on to play for Madrid, Marseille and Roma. The ex-Argentina international called time on his career in 2014 and has since ventured into management, however he has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Arteta and Heinze previously played together at PSG but they will now reunite at the Emirates Stadium. It's fully expected that Heinze's journey to work at another of United's fierce rivals will be without drama this time around."

      "Marcus Rashford’s chances of moving to Barcelona have been improved after Nico Williams sensationally turned down a transfer. The Athletic Bilbao star was strongly linked with a switch to Catalonia this summer.",
      "Barcelona had identified him as a prime target this summer, with it being revealed that they were considering paying a £50m release clause written into his contract. But the move is now off the table after Williams put pen to paper on a stunning new deal with his boyhood club.",
      "Williams, 22, has signed a new 10-year contract with Bilbao that will extend his stay with the club until at least 2035. The fresh deal has also seen Williams’ release clause rise by 50% to around £75m.",
      "Speaking after his new contract was announced, he said: \"When decisions have to be made, for me, what weighs most is the heart. I'm where I want to be, with my people, this is my home. Aupa Athletic!\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bilbao have even sweetened the deal by offering Williams the club’s iconic number 10 shirt. Speaking about the switch, he said: “It looks great. Love it. It was Muniain’s number. I asked him for it. I’m proud to get this number 10 shirt from Muniain. And to make history as he did.”",
      "And while Barcelona will be left frustrated by the news that Williams will not be signing for the club, it might see them look at alternative targets. Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has already been linked with a move to Spain.",
      "United chiefs expect Rashford to leave on loan this summer after his fall-out with Ruben Amorim. A move to the Premier League also appears to be off the cards, with Rashford ruling out a switch to London, while he does not want to take a cut to his lofty wages.",
      "And speaking recently, he hinted that he would be open to signing for Barcelona. Asked if he would like to play alongside Lamine Yamal, he said: \"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best. So hopefully, we'll see.\"",
      "When asked about a switch to Barcelona, he cheekily replied: “We’ll see.” Rashford added: “Spain is nice, not too far from home. If I train here for a long time, it’s good, because my family can come and see me for a few days, it’s only a three-hour flight. The weather is nice here.”",
      "Rashford has three years left to run on his contract with Man United. But he appears to have no future at Old Trafford so long as Amorim remains in charge.",

      "The Serbian left United to join Inter Milan in 2014, one year after Sir Alex Ferguson retired as manager. Vidic established himself as one of the toughest centre-backs in the Premier League and took his no-nonsense mentality into training.",
      "Former team-mate Ben Foster described him as 'scary' and 'horrible' during sessions but Vidic insists that he only ever had one bust-up inside the dressing room. Speaking to Gary Neville on The Overlap, he revealed that Brazilian midfielder Anderson was the team-mate in question.",
      "\"At Manchester United, I had one bust-up in the changing room and that was with Anderson,\" Vidic explained. \"It was something on the pitch then it got transferred to the dressing room. It was no big deal.\"",
      "Some United fans will be surprised by the 43-year-old's claim, as Patrice Evra is on record claiming that Vidic refused to speak to him for three months. The pair's fractious relationship even prompted Ferguson to move Rio Ferdinand to the left centre-back role so that Vidic wouldn't be near Evra.",
      "In 2021, Evra told United's official podcast: \"To be honest, we also fought. We had a fight, me and him, and didn't speak for three months.",
      "\"We played together and we didn't even say a word. I never told him to go left or go right. He was the same. Ferguson had to swap Rio Ferdinand to play on the left side with me.",

Discussing what the future holds for him a decade after hanging up his boots, Vidic said: \"If I was to manage or coach anyone, it would have to be Manchester United.

      "He also reflected on the family atmosphere at home and the subject of footballing expectations placed on his children.",
      "\"In my house, we don't really talk much about football,\" Vidic said. \"We don't talk about how many trophies I won – I'm not much in the media. People are always saying, 'Your son has pressure' – I don't think he has any pressure. He has an advantage.",
      "\"Everyone knows who his dad is and the first thing they are going to do is compare and see how good he is. So, people will come to watch you, and if you are good, you are good.\""

      "Benni McCarthy has shed light on Jadon Sancho's struggles at Manchester United, suggesting that his introverted nature was misinterpreted as having a bad attitude. Sancho was signed from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for £73million after a lengthy transfer saga.",
      "However, he failed to replicate his form from Germany at Old Trafford, scoring a mere 12 goals during his hugely underwhelming stint with the club.",
      "He later fell out with then-Red Devils manager Erik ten Hag in September 2023 over his commitment levels in training and refused to apologise for publicly criticising the Dutchman's comments on social media. That led to him being frozen out from the first-team squad.",
      "It also resulted in the 25-year-old being loaned out twice in succession, first to Dortmund and then to Chelsea last season. Although he didn't make a significant impact at Stamford Bridge, he did score in the Europa Conference League final victory.",
      "At the end of the 2024/25 season, Chelsea opted to pay United a £5m fee rather than fulfilling their obligation-to-buy clause and signing the winger permanently for £25m.",
      "Current United head coach Ruben Amorim has shown no signs of wanting to bring the Englishman back into the fold, indicating that Sancho is likely to leave this summer as a failed signing.",
      "Now, McCarthy, who served as a first-team coach under Ten Hag for two years from the summer of 2022 to 2024, has come out in support of Sancho's character. The South African, currently managing Kenya's national team, says he wasn’t the most sociable team-mate at United and would often head straight home after training, which may have been misconstrued from the outside.",
      "McCarthy told betonlinepromocodes.com: “I couldn’t fault Jadon in training. He brings unbelievable quality, ability and skills. He can make you stop in awe and ask yourself just how he can do things. He brought unmatched quality.",
      "“I think what didn’t help Jadon was that he’s a very closed-off person. He keeps to himself, and from the outside it looked like he wasn’t trying to make friends with his team-mates. He might not have joked around but really he was just quiet, and I don’t think you should judge players on who he gets on with or not.",
      "“Based on his ability and craft, I never saw any problems in his relationships. He was quiet-natured, and so when training is done, he doesn’t stay to talk, he heads home. He’s very private. I think a bit of an introvert, which isn’t the opinion he gets branded with in the press.\"",
      "However, he went on to comment on Sancho’s main struggles with consistency, adding: “I think that when it came to Erik, he wanted to see Jadon at his best everyday. Monday to Friday, no days off. I think that’s what the manager would expect from his players, and so it’s up to the players to give it to him. If you can’t do that, you’re going to have problems, and I think the differences and problems then surfaced.",
      "“For me, I don’t have a bad thing to say about Jadon. I loved him, he was unbelievable, sometimes he was unplayable. I don’t want to rush to judgement on players if they’re reserved.”",
      "Sancho might be on the verge of a permanent exit from Manchester this summer. Juventus have been linked with the Englishman and reports suggest they could be ready to meet United's valuation of around £25m.",
      "But the Turin-based club are not willing to do the same for Sancho's hefty wage demands, which reportedly exceed £300,000 per week as talks continue with his representatives. A swap deal could be on the cards too",
      "It's claimed that the Italians have offered Douglas Luiz, Tim Weah and Dusan Vlahovic to sweeten a deal for Sancho. United reportedly have not yet responded to that proposal and could prefer straight cash amid attempts to boost Amorim's budget.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "The attacking midfielder, born in Wrexham, was plagued by injuries following his move from Derby County to Ibrox in 2022. Despite the setbacks, the 31-year-old managed to make 65 appearances and netted 11 goals during his three-year stint in Glasgow.",
      "He's now on the hunt for a new club, with Wrexham, owned by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, said to be interested in acquiring his services. While Lawrence has reportedly attracted interest from clubs in the Middle East and Turkey, the Mail reports that the prospect of playing for his hometown club is an appealing one.",
      "The Red Dragons, who clinched promotion from League One to the Championship in April, have already signed one local talent in the summer transfer window. The North Wales outfit announced the signing of goalkeeper Danny Ward on a two-year deal on Tuesday, following his release from Leicester City.",
      "If they manage to secure Lawrence's signature, Wrexham would be adding a player who honed his skills under some of the best in the business during his time at Manchester United.",
      "He joined the Premier League heavyweights at just seven-years-old and had the privilege of learning from Manchester United legends such as Sir Sir Alex Ferguson and Paul Scholes, as well as his hero Giggs.",
      "Highlighting the impact this had on him in an interview last year, Lawrence told the Sun: \"I was at United from the age of seven until I was 20. So the number of figures that helped me out along the way, I couldn't name them all.",
      "\"What I will say is that you looked up to those who were in the first team at the time, the likes of Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. Coaching-wise Paul McGuinness and Warren Joyce helped me massively.",
      "\"I am really thankful to them all. There were role models everywhere. It was just all about standards, it makes you have those standards from such a young age.\"",
      "He added: \"Sir Alex Ferguson was one for big standards and you couldn't mess up. That grounding never leaves you. When you grow up hearing that you just get used to doing the same high level standard stuff every day. It's instilled in you.\"",
      "Despite his lengthy tenure at United, Lawrence's first-team outings were limited to a single senior match in May 2014 against Hull. At the time, Giggs was juggling roles as United's player-manager when Lawrence played most of the game.",
      "In a poignant moment, Giggs replaced Lawrence on the pitch with 20 minutes to go, marking his final appearance for United.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Lawrence said: \"He was a big hero growing up, there were a few of them. But he gave me my Manchester United debut so I'll be forever grateful. Nothing will ever come close to that.",
      "\"I had been out on loan and got recalled. I played a game at Anfield for the under-21s and I played well. The first team played a few days later and I got a call to say I was in the squad.",

      "It’s not easy getting a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line - just ask Brentford technical director Lee Dykes. The Cameroon star remains at the top of Manchester United’s wish-list as Ruben Amorim strives to pep up his forward line following a dire season at Old Trafford.",
      "United have seen several bids, including a £60million offer, rejected but remain hopeful of getting their man, having already snared Matheus Cunha from Wolves. Brentford signed Mbeumo from French side Troyes in 2019, although their pursuit of the striker was far from straightforward. It was a big moment for Dykes, who had recently joined from EFL side Bury.",
      "“I felt big pressure because I walked into a function where I was trying to take forward some of the good work that had already been done,” he told the Bees’ website in December 2023.",
      "“Coming into Brentford, I’d never really spent a lot of money. I’d always worked at League One and League Two level.",
      "“The most I’d spent was £50,000 on a player, and then six weeks later we are paying €5million for Bryan Mbeumo. So obviously you start to think, ‘Wow, this is big money.’ But, at the end of the day, it’s just different money, same process.”",
      "Dykes, co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen and head coach Thomas Frank made a whistlestop trip to France in an effort to complete a deal Mbeumo, only for those initial talks to come to nothing.",
      "“We were figuring that there was a possibility to sign Bryan,” said Dykes. “We had cleverly sourced that information, having been told that he wouldn’t entertain the Championship.",
      "“It became quickly apparent that we had to get in and out of France in a day as Thomas (Frank) had his training commitments because it was near to the season starting.",
      "“Where the meeting was going to take place, there was no airport close enough we could find from London or a route to do in one day, so we didn’t know if we could make it work.",
      "“I remember Rasmus just calling me up saying, ‘I spoke to Matthew (Benham, club owner) and he said he’ll fire up a jet and we’ll get over there’ - at that point, I was just thinking, ‘Wow!’",
      "“But that’s when I started to feel the pressure. I’d lined it all up with Troyes, as well as the agents that were involved, so me, Thomas and Rasmus got on this jet.",
      "“We got there, it was one of the hottest days of the year, it had reached about 43°C when we landed. It was a 60-minute journey and the air conditioning wasn’t working in the taxi we got in!",
      "“We had the meeting, spoke with the player, the club and the agent, but the deal broke down. So, I had convinced everyone to fly over to France to get this deal done - I thought it was going to get done - but it had broken down.”",
      "A bad day then got even worse for Dykes before a deal for Mbeumo was eventually revived. He added: “On the way back, and I’m not a good flier in general, the pilot turned to us and said, ‘It’s chaotic weather in London, it’s snowing, there’s thunder, there’s lightning.’ I was thinking, ‘What? It was 43 degrees when we left France.’",
      "“And the journey back was horrendous - I could see the pilot avoiding the dark spots on the radar. I was bricking it!",
      "“But, fortunately, we landed safely and, more importantly, managed to turn around the deal a few days later and eventually sign him. So, Brentford fans must know that I risked my life to sign Bryan Mbeumo!”",

      "Manchester United have a little under two months left of the transfer window - and the Red Devils really need to get down to work. They have already sealed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "But the spending is unlikely to stop there. United are in dire need of a new forward to potentially solve their goalscoring issues and appear to have identified their man.",
      "A new midfielder, left-back and winger could all be set to arrive before the window closes on September 1. But before that, exits might have to be the first port of call as United attempt to gather funds after missing out on a spot in Europe for next season.",
      "And there are already a few candidates to leave Old Trafford, with some potentially worth millions. Where does the land lie right now though?",
      "It’s fair to say that the Brentford forward is right at the top of United’s shortlist of signings. They’ve already had two bids turned down for the Cameroonian and while it appears that the Bees are open to selling, they will only let him go for a price they deem suitable.",
      "As it stands, United chiefs remain confident of reaching an agreement before the end of the week. They might want to move a bit quicker to get everything rubber-stamped but all the signs are pointing to this one getting done.",
      "From Brentford to Aston Villa now, United are interested in adding an out-and-out striker to their squad. Having been linked with a host of options, it appears that Villa star Watkins is now the outstanding candidate.",
      "United reportedly held talks with Villa regarding a deal in January only for nothing to come of their initial discussions. But they are now making a concerted effort to sign the England man despite Villa’s £60m asking price.",
      "One reason that United have turned their attention to Watkins is the ongoing furore surrounding Viktor Gyokeres. The Sporting Lisbon striker was thought to be at the top of United’s list, only for him to prioritise a move to Arsenal.",
      "Even then, a deal has proven to be difficult, with Gyokeres accusing Sporting of upping their demands, threatening strike action and even turning down clear-the-air talks. It’s all gotten a bit messy but it appears that the Gunners are inching closer to an agreement, putting United out of the race in the process.",
      "One deal that is a lot easier to do is a move for young defender Diego Leon. He is set to fly to the UK this week to undergo pre-season testing.",
      "Leon has already suggested that he is ready to fight for his place at Old Trafford. He said: \"I'm really happy, I think every player dreams of this. When you're a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity.",
      "\"Everyone thinks I'll go out on loan, but I don't have that mindset. I'm going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I'll already be playing with them.\"",
      "Over recent days, United’s interest in Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Fabian Ruiz emerged but a deal looks somewhat tricky to do. The Spaniard has two years left on his contract in the French capital, while manager Luis Enrique apparently wants to keep him around.",
      "Ruiz would be a quality addition to their midfield options but this one just appears to be speculation for now.",
      "While Enrique wants to keep hold of Ruiz, the same could certainly not be said of Ruben Amorim and Marcus Rashford. The forward was exiled to Aston Villa last term, the Midlands side recently confirming that they will not be activating their option to sign him.",
      "Rashford has already made his preference clear having ruled out a move to London, while he also does not want to reduce his £300k-per-week pay packet. He has also expressed interest in a move to Barcelona, who are interested in a move despite their imminent capture of Nico Williams. It looks like this one could rumble on for some time.",
      "With Rashford primed for an exit, he could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho, who has also fallen out with Amorim. Serie A champions Napoli were reportedly interested but that has not progressed.",
      "A potential swap deal with Chelsea involving Christopher Nkunku was touted but that looks slightly unlikely right now. The Blues could still move for him but again, that might be another one that gets more clarification later in the window.",
      "Sticking with Chelsea, they have already dealt a considerable blow to United’s transfer window this summer. The Blues had a £25m obligation to buy former loanee Sancho but paid a £5m penalty clause to back out of that agreement.",
      "He is now set to return to Old Trafford. Juventus have recently emerged as potential suitors in a sensational swap deal, while Napoli and Fenerbahce have also been linked in the past. It’s clear that Sancho won’t be a United player next season, it just depends on where.",
      "Fellow forward Rasmus Hojlund could also depart over the coming months. The Danish forward endured a woeful second season at Old Trafford, with it being suggested that United were happy to cut their losses.",
      "Inter Milan looked to be the most likely to move for him but they have since cooled their interest in the former Atalanta man. It was reported that United would only move for Watkins should Hojlund leave so his future could potentially be key to how the rest of the window plays out at Old Trafford.",
      "Brazilian winger Antony has been a disastrous signing at Old Trafford and he looks sure to leave. All the suggestions are that Real Betis will make a renewed move for the former Ajax man following his successful loan move last season.",
      "But the Spanish side would struggle to match United’s current demands. Reports in Spain suggest that an agreement over a move is still some way off despite Antony making his desire to return to Seville abundantly clear.",
      "Amorim has a decision to make over United’s number one position. Andre Onana has struggled to convince during his time at Old Trafford and according to reports, United would be open to letting him leave on loan.",
      "Ligue 1 side Monaco emerged as suitors for his services but have since cooled their interest. The Red Devils have picked out a few potential replacements but Onana will need to leave before anything progresses.",

      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa after falling out with boss Ruben Amorim, and Garnacho's provocative stunt was seen as him taunting the United boss after he, too, suffered the same fate as the England forward.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for United's 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao, prompting the winger – who turned 21 yesterday – to publicly criticise Amorim over the decision and reveal he was considering his future.",

      "“It’s the type of things we see from new generations. To be honest, I can’t only blame Garnacho. The way the squad has been built, it’s why Garnacho thinks he has the right to do something like this.",

      "“He already thinks he’s a top player, already makes demands, acts without respect. It’s a shame, but there are other factors than just the player. The club and the squad, they’ve already lost the leaders. The bad influences have already taken over. They think they’re bigger and better than they are.",
      "“Keane, Rio Ferdinand, David Beckham, Gary Neville, they would all make sure you understand what wasn’t allowed. They wouldn’t give players the luxury to act like this. He’s been let down because he’s been given too much responsibility for a player who hasn’t earned it yet.",
      "“It’s fine if you’re playing like Wayne Rooney. If you score 20 or 30 goals a season, do what you want, demand what you want. Garnacho has five goals and he’s carrying on like this. It’s crazy.”",
      "Asked if a potential swap deal involving Garnacho and Chelsea striker Christopher Nkunku would be a good move, Saha said: “Everyone can benefit from the move. It’s a win-win. United want players who are dedicated, work hard, are eager to play and who have talent.",
      "“We want players who want to play well, and there’s extra motivation in the year of a World Cup. I think Nkunku knows if he plays well, he can get back in the French squad for the summer. At the same time, he’s not the kind of player who disrupts the dressing room.",
      "“As for Garnacho, if he wants to go, get rid of him. I used to be a huge fan, but that’s over. Anyone like this, if they want to go, go. Even if you lose money, it doesn’t matter, because you can bring in a player who can behave as they should.”",

      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are among those who have all returned from loan spells away. They were all on hefty wages and two of the three were signed for big money. It makes them hard to shift and the club may have to take major financial hits to get rid of them.",
      "No European football may prove to be a factor but it hasn't stopped the club spending in the market and Mbeumo's signing could see their spending exceed £100m. Here's the latest from Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils continue to negotiate with Brentford over the transfer of Mbeumo but are confident they can reach an agreement by the end of the week after seeing two bids rejected. They have made the Bees forward their top target at present as they eye their second summer arrival.",
      "The west Londoners have played hardball as they look to maximise their profit on Mbeumo, who has just enjoyed his best season yet, scoring 20 times, and Ruben Amorim believes he can perfectly suit the system he's trying to implement. United will go back in with a third bid after their latest in the region of £60m was rejected.",
      "The Daily Mail now reports that the Red Devils will table an offer of £65m which they believe will hit Brentford's valuation of the player and complete the deal. Those in the capital have already begun making plans for Mbeumo's departure.",
      "Juventus have stepped up their attempts to sign Jadon Sancho and are even said to have offered the Manchester outfit three different players in a bid to strike an audacious swap deal.",
      "Dusan Vlahovic is the first name mentioned. United have previously been interested in the Serbian striker, who was heavily linked with Arsenal before moving to Turin having previously impressed with Fiorentina.",
      "Douglas Luiz, the former Aston Villa midfielder, is another player who United could have in exchange for Sancho and Timothy Weah is the third player United have been made aware is available to leave the Old Lady. The winger was recently the subject of transfer interest from Nottingham Forest, however, Weah rejected a move to the City Ground.",
      "Diego Leon, the club's newest signing, is eager to make a name for himself in pre-season - and has no interest in going out on loan as he underlined his confidence that he can cement a spot in Amorim's squad for the upcoming season.",
      "The teenage left-back signed for United in the January transfer window but due to his age, was unable to join his new club until the summer. The MEN state that there's still no concrete plan regarding Leon's role in the first team for this season however.",
      "\"I'm really happy, I think every player dreams of this,\" the young defender said to Paraguayan press. \"When you're a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity. Everyone thinks I'll go out on loan, but I don't have that mindset. I'm going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I'll already be playing with them.\"",

      "Viktor Gyokeres has been the subject of non-stop speculation this summer as the striker continues to be linked with a transfer to Manchester United or Arsenal. The forward has caught the eye since joining Sporting CP two summers ago, where he has developed into one of the most clinical No. 9s in the world.",
      "Gyokeres’ incredible tally includes 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting on his way to winning two Primeira Liga titles. United have developed an interest in the 27-year-old, partly because of their need for a goal-scorer and partly because Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim was the man who brought the best out of Gyokeres when he signed him from Coventry City.",
      "Yet, they face fierce competition from Arsenal, who are in search of their own striker after being left with no recognised centre-forwards for the second half of last season. The Gunners have been negotiating deals for both the Swede and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko in the hope they can complete the transfer that offers the best value.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe delivered the bombshell news on Tuesday that Arsenal were on the verge of reaching a verbal agreement with the striker over personal terms. It was reported that the agreement would be a five-year deal.",
      "After negotiating at length for the Slovenian’s move again this summer, the deal is now seemingly on the backburner. It is Gyokeres, rather than Sesko, who looks to be Emirates-bound, despite suggestions that Arteta and his staff preferred the latter due to his younger age and experience playing in a tougher league.",
      "Another key character in the ongoing circus surrounding Gyokeres this summer has been Frederico Varandas. The outspoken Sporting president first took issue with a claim made by Gyokeres’ agent, who said he had a gentleman’s agreement in place whereby the club had promised to let the forward leave for a fee of £59m - considerably less than his £85m release clause.",
      "But Varandas has now handed Arsenal and United a potential boost by admitting there is a \"strong likelihood\" Gyokeres will leave the club this summer - and for a possible discounted fee - saying: \"Sporting is calm regarding this matter. Secondly, Sporting does not need to sell Viktor Gyokeres. Fortunately, we have moved past the phase of selling our main asset.",
      "“However, we remain sensitive to Viktor’s dreams or those of any other athlete. Sporting has made a commitment that, after weeks of meetings, we will not demand the full amount of the clause; we will be reasonable regarding the amount requested for Viktor.\"",
      "Hinting at a potential new price tag, he added: “Today, there is a strong likelihood that he will leave. I won’t disclose the amount, but the player knows what it is. I can say that Viktor will not leave for 60+10m (euros). He won’t leave, absolutely not.",
      "“In recent weeks, we have been paying attention. I saw a player, [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go [potentially to Arsenal] for £55m, and I saw Matheus Cunha move to Manchester United for around £62.5m.",
      "\"We are talking about players who are 26 years old. I believe Viktor could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world, which I don’t believe, as his agent is one of the best in the world.”",
      "In another boost to both Arsenal and United’s hopes that Gyokeres will leave Sporting, the Portuguese champions now appear to be looking to replace him. The Lisbon club have reportedly set their sights on Union Saint-Gilloise striker Franjo Ivanovic in the past week.",
      "As reported by Germanijak.HR, Sporting have lodged a bid of around £17m, which is short of the Belgian club’s valuation of £25.6m. Besiktas and Frankfurt, plus teams in Italy, are also said to be interested in Ivanovic, who netted 20 goals for his side last season.",
      "Sporting landing a striker with a strong goal-scoring record for less than £30m may also help Arsenal and United in their negotiations for Gyokeres, who has been vocal in his frustrations towards the Sporting hierarchy over his price tag until now.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United transfer target Ollie Watkins admitted that he was 'fuming' after being left out of the Aston Villa starting line-up in place of Marcus Rashford. Watkins, 29, was only a substitute for both of Villa's Champions League quarter-final clashes with Paris Saint-Germain last season.",
      "Now the England international could be team-mates with Rashford again. United are making a concerted effort to sign Watkins from Villa, who'd want around £60million.",
      "Unai Emery had taken a liking to Rashford after signing him on loan from United during the January transfer window and the Villa manager thought that he was better suited to starting against PSG. Villa ultimately went out, losing 5-4 on aggregate, and Rashford failed to score in either game.",
      "Watkins, meanwhile, was given just 25 minutes across the two legs, as he spent much of the contest on the bench. The striker couldn't hide his frustration in the days following Emery's decision and responded in the best way possible.",
      "\"I played 20 minutes against PSG in both games, so I'm not going to lie - I was fuming I wasn't playing,\" Watkins admitted. \"I let him know that. He's the manager at the end of the day. I respect his decision. But I'm not one of the players happy to sit on the bench.",
      "\"It's something I haven't experienced before, missing out on the biggest stage. You always want to play, especially in the Champions League. Me and a few others are disappointed we didn't start the game, but like I said, it's the manager's decision... Rather than let it hinder you, you have to use that anger as motivation.\"",
      "Emery took ownership of his decision and explained: \"It was my selection, tactically. We are adding more competition, more matches and we are hitting another level. Of course, Watkins is very, very important for us. He's scoring goals for us, and last Saturday, his impact was fantastic.",
      "\"On Tuesday [against PSG], it was difficult for him to read the match and show his power. But he worked, he is ready. I am so, so happy with him, and I want to win tomorrow [away to Manchester City]. As players, they can be sad at not playing or angry at not playing - I prefer angry.\""

      "Manchester United are stepping up their interest in Aston Villa and England striker Ollie Watkins. United had hoped to land Sporting Lisbon forward Viktor Gyokeres, who played under Old Trafford boss Ruben Amorim in Portugal.",

      "Watkins became unsettled last season after falling behind on-loan United striker Marcus Rashford in the second half of the campaign. With Villa having missed out on Champions League football on the final day of last season, losing 2-0 at United, Watkins is said to be open to a new challenge elsewhere.",
      "It is understood United have held tentative talks with Villa about signing Watkins, who Amorim sees as the ideal player to lead his attack - given his proven goal scoring prowess. Villa would want around £60million for Watkins, who has three years left on his contract, but United are unwilling to pay that much, given his age and lack of resale value.",
      "United were willing to offer Rashford as part of a swap deal involving Watkins, but Villa decided against signing the 27-year-old for £40m once his loan deal was up. One obstacle to United's pursuit of Watkins is their inability to offer European football, following their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May.",
      "United also need to off-load the likes of Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony to raise money to fund new signings. Watkins signed a new long-term contract with Villa in October 2023, keeping him at the club until 2028.",
      "But the England international wasn't a guaranteed starter last season, competing with Jhon Duran and later Rashford. Villa boss Unai Emery, however, is a big fan of Watkins.",
      "\"But even when he's not doing both, he's working for the team. Defensively, the commitment was always high. He is in the press to the opponent. His commitment and behaviour is always a very good example for others. His power is his mind. His mentality is the best quality he has.\""

      "Former Manchester United star Gabriel Heinze was on track to be a legend at the club.",
      "After joining the Red Devils from PSG in 2004, he helped secure a Premier League title and won over the Old Trafford faithful with his passionate performances – until he attempted to leave United under highly contentious circumstances.",
      "Heinze's subsequent actions were seen as a major betrayal of his legacy as he tried to engineer a move to Liverpool in the summer of 2007. In doing so, he violated one of English football's most respected unwritten rules: players do not transfer directly between United and their fierce rivals.",
      "Now 47, Heinze is set to join Mikel Arteta's coaching team at Arsenal ahead of the new season, as the Gunners undergo a reshuffle following the departure of former assistant Carlos Cuesta to Parma.",
      "Heinze's return to the Premier League will undoubtedly stir memories of one of English football's most intense transfer sagas, when the Argentinian sought to cross the M62 divide and join then-manager Rafa Benitez at Liverpool.",
      "The move would have made him the first player since Phil Chisnall in 1964 to transfer directly between the two clubs. However, the potential union of Heinze and Liverpool remains a 'What if?' scenario, as former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson firmly put his foot down to ensure the defender never got his wish.",
      "The saga started when Heinze's representative, Roberto Rodriguez, was allegedly told by United's then-chief executive David Gill that his client could depart for £6.8million. However, United hadn't anticipated that the defender would push for a move to their biggest rivals, reports the Mirror.",
      "Liverpool then submitted a bid matching United's asking price. The Red Devils rejected the Reds' approach, much to Heinze's frustration, prompting legal action to be considered.",
      "The iconic United manager also insisted his club held all the cards regarding the transfer. Benitez, however, was bewildered by United's refusal to negotiate.",
      "\"It's clear he's a player we like and he's a very good player,\" Liverpool's Spanish manager said. \"That's the reason why they don't want him to leave for us.\"",
      "In a further twist to one of the Premier League's most bitter transfer battles, it subsequently came to light that Crystal Palace had been approached by a South American-based agency to purchase Heinze, before immediately selling him on to Liverpool.",
      "This arrangement would supposedly have netted the Eagles £1m in fees, as disclosed by former Palace chairman Simon Jordan in his autobiography, Be Careful What You Wish For.",
      "\"My stance was no way were we getting involved and I told [CEO Phil] Alexander to contact David Gill, Manchester United's chief executive, and tell him of these attempted shenanigans, which he duly did,\" Jordan wrote.",
      "Heinze and his representative took their case to a Premier League arbitration panel in an attempt to force the move. However, Jordan's testimony was later utilised in the hearing, resulting in a win for United.",
      "After being denied the transfer to Liverpool, Heinze said to the Daily Mail: \"My fight is for the freedom to negotiate with any club. United never wanted me to leave for one of the big clubs, but this anti-Liverpool clause is incredible.\"",
      "Liverpool were anticipating an appeal from Heinze, but it never came to pass as United accepted an offer from Real Madrid instead.",
      "\"I don't have many regrets from my career as a footballer, but that episode with Ferguson [has] to be one of them,\" Heinze said years on. \"I spent three years in Manchester and had some great moments and I regret [leaving the club] a lot.\"",
      "Post-United, Heinze's career saw him at Real, Marseille and Roma before retiring in 2014. The former Argentina international has since moved into management, although he has been without a role since November 2023.",
      "Arteta and Heinze, former team-mates at PSG, are set to reunite at the Emirates Stadium. It is widely anticipated that Heinze's move to another of United's bitter rivals will proceed smoothly this time around."

Players who didn't partake in international fixtures immediately after last season finished are due back, including new signing Matheus Cunha, Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Garnacho will also be one of those players after he didn't receive a call-up to the Argentina squad. The forward was a key member of Amorim's squad last term; however, his behaviour since United's Europa League final defeat in Bilbao has left the club no choice but to cash in.",
      "After venting his frustration at being named on the bench against Tottenham, Garnacho's future appears away from Old Trafford. It's understood that the club wants to get rid of the 21-year-old to raise funds for future sales.",
      "Chelsea and Napoli have both been credited with interest in the winger, but neither have entertained United's hefty price tag. It's been stated previously that a fee in the region of £60m-£70m is what United want, but it's widely expected that around £45m could be enough to accept.",
      "With United lining up a third bid for Bryan Mbeumo and set to move for a new striker, Garnacho's possible sale is one that the club are desperate to complete. This week, Give Me Sport have claimed that intermediaries have been appointed to help get a deal over the line, with Chelsea at the forefront of their mind.",
      "However, there's an obvious answer to the problem with Garnacho that feels right for so many reasons. Newcastle have spent the first part of the transfer window throwing everything at improving Eddie Howe's attack. The Magpies will return to the Champions League next season, and it's understood that they want to add more firepower.",
      "They look set to miss out on Mbeumo to United and have failed with an opening bid for Anthony Elanga. Reports on Thursday claimed that they were pushing to sign the ex-United star with a new offer worth more than £50m, but it remains to be seen how keen Nottingham Forest are to sell one of the best players.",
      "After also missing out on Joao Pedro, who joined Chelsea, Newcastle are running out of options, and Garnacho could be the answer to their solution. At 21, the United winger has Premier League experience and plenty of untapped potential.",
      "The £55m bid for Elanga is yet to be answered, and while he is the better option due to his attitude and past 12 months, Garnacho is available. It's understood the forward wants to stay in the Premier League, and at Newcastle, he would be one of the main players.",
      "Frustration has reached close to boiling point at St. James' Park after watching pursuits of Mbeumo, Pedro, Antoine Semenyo and Malick Fofana either collapse or go quiet. That's around £280m worth of talent being missed out on. Elanga remains their priority, with players like Edon Zhegrova, Mohammed Kudus and Jack Grealish all linked recently.",
      "But Garnacho is no closer to securing a move away from Old Trafford as we speak, and the longer the window goes, Newcastle will be desperate to bring in a new attacker before their first game of the season.",
      "It almost feels like a deal we've seen so many times before with United. A player isn't deemed good enough to play in red, is sold to relocate funds elsewhere, and he hits the ground running. Newcastle would be the perfect move for him to flourish in the Premier League."

      "“Man United have been watching him, my sources tell me, and they think he is still capable of playing at the top level, plus he’s not even 30 yet so he’s got years left in him.",
      "“He’s one they’ve liked for a while, even when he was at Brentford, so it might be a surprise to see them interested again but there aren’t a lot of strikers of his level available. From what I’m told, he would be interested in a return to the Premier League.",
      "“He might have to take a cut from what he’s getting paid out there, but he wants to play at the highest level and United could give him that chance. They see him as a definite upgrade on what they’ve got, so it’s a possibility.”",

      "While Garnacho returned for the next fixture against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, Rashford remained absent with Amorim claiming that his attitude towards training was not where he needed it to be. The England international would make just one more appearance in a matchday squad before being loaned to Aston Villa for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "In the west Midlands, Rashford was showing signs of improvement before an injury cut his season short. Since then, MEN Sport understands that United have listed the forward as being available to leave Old Trafford.",
      "Villa had agreed a £40m option to buy but that currently looks unlikely to be activated. Barcelona has been at the top of Rashford's wishlist this summer and their sporting director Deco has expressed his fondness for the 27-year-old, at this stage no formal bid has been placed.",
      "Bayern Munich emerged this week as a reported option for Rashford but, on the eve of pre-season, there are currently no imminent plans to sell the United academy graduate. As such, The Independent understands that Rashford will report to Carrington on Monday with the rest of his teammates for the start of pre-season.",

      "Since Ten Hag was sacked and replaced as head coach by Ruben Amorim, United have switched to a 3-4-2-1 formation using two wing-backs.",
      "Dumfries would be adept in a wing-back role but while United would ideally like to add more quality in that position, it is less of a priority than signing a new forward, attacking midfielder, central midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer.",
      "That being said, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Dumfries is said to have a €25million (£21.5million) release clause written into his contract until mid-July.",
      "For a player of his quality, that is an opportunity many clubs should be jumping on and Barcelona are said to be considering a deal. At 29, he may not have great resale value but he would bring top class quality in his peak years.",
      "While it may not be United's number one priority, it will be interesting to see whether such a bargain price rekindles their interest."

      "It was a mystery as to why a top club hadn't signed Jonathan David, and the striker has finally got his move.",
      "David announced in May that he would be leaving Lille when his contract expired this summer and fans implored Manchester United to make a move.",
      "The 25-year-old has been one of the most prolific strikers in Europe across the last few seasons and Juventus are about to complete a deal that will see him sign on a free transfer.",
      "David scored 109 goals in 232 appearances for Lille, putting him second in the club’s list of all-time top scorers, and he has netted an impressive 34 goals in 63 appearances for Canada.",
      "The striker has been plying his trade in Ligue 1 since 2020, which is probably the weakest division of Europe's top five leagues. However, he has carried his domestic form into the Champions League, finding the back of the net against Juventus, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Liverpool and Feyenoord last season.",
      "United have been linked with David over the last few years, but he was never close to moving to Manchester.",
      "Even though he was never a genuine target for United, his move to Juventus means a top-class striker has been taken off the market as United look to sign a prolific goalscorer.",
      "Victor Osimhen joined Galatasaray on loan for the 2024/25 season and signed a one-year contract extension with Napoli until June 2027 so that his value would be protected during his stint away.",
      "That means Napoli still have some negotiating power when it comes to selling Osimhen after the conclusion of his Galatasaray loan, but every club knows they want to sell him and that has to be a factor in any potential deal.",
      "Napoli were entertaining bids in the region of £70million for Osimhen before talks collapsed with Chelsea last summer and he only turned 26 in December so should be coming into his prime. Yes, Osimhen is a big name and would demand large wages, which goes against Ineos' policy, but he is a prolific centre-forward.",
      "Osimhen scored 37 goals in 41 games for Galatasaray - an undeniably impressive record, even in a weaker division - and he would be the dream centre forward signing for many United fans.",
      "So why hasn't Osimhen found a new club yet? The answer is probably wage demands. They have appeared to be a stumbling block so far in this window in talks with other clubs and United will not break their wage structure.",
      "Having said that, United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season and Osimhen would be the perfect solution to Ruben Amorim's biggest problem, so perhaps a compromise could be found.",
      "The longer the transfer window goes on, the more United and Osimhen might need each other and a compromise could possibly be reached.",
      "Osimhen needs a move away, just as much as United need to sign a prolific centre forward."

      "Antony's time at the club was coming to an end as the 25-year-old struggled to adapt to new roles as a central attacking midfielder or as a wing-back.",

      "Since then, the desire from Real Betis has been to keep hold of Antony for the forthcoming campaign and beyond. Now, speaking to Estadio Deportivo, the Spanish club's president Angel Haro has provided an update on their pursuit of the Brazilian, stressing that a move can only happen if the player reduces his wages.",
      "\"We’re talking to the player because coming to Betis entails a considerable reduction in salary, because we have to maintain our financial discipline and we don’t want to break it,\" Haro explained.",
      "\"He’s a fantastic player; he’s given us a lot in the last six months, but we have to get everything right; we can’t go crazy.",
      "\"We’re working on that path because it’s not easy. We’re very imaginative when it comes to approaching this type of transaction, but it’s complex.",
      "\"It involves the player, who loves Betis, but he also has to consider his own interests.\" From United's side, there is a desire to sell the winger.",

      "Manchester United launched their new training kit range for 2025/26 without a sponsor, and it may be a little while yet before they get one.",
      "Across the last three years, Tezos has been a visible partner for United, and a valuable one too, occupying one of the key pieces of the club’s sponsorship inventory. The club are working on a replacement, but there will be reasons why it takes a little longer than it may have otherwise done.",
      "It is a similar situation to the one that Chelsea found themselves in last season when it came to a front-of-shirt sponsor. The West London side had been wanting to achieve a figure in line with what some of their rivals had been able to bring in but a lack of competitive success and Champions League exposure meant that the value of the deals available weren’t as strong as hoped for.",
      "Instead of taking a lesser amount and tying themselves into it for a long period of time, the club opted to go without, instead partnering with Dubai real estate agents DAMAC for the final weeks of the season in a multi-million pound deal.",
      "United’s approach will be similar. They will know that accepting a lower fee than they have previously been able to would weaken their leverage when going to future deals. They want to ensure that they are not only holding the current value, but three years on from the initial Tezos deal, and taking into account inflation, they will want more than what was on offer to ensure that commercial revenues are growing and not diminishing.",
      "That is the challenge that is posed by a lack of Champions League football and the reputational damage that such a bad domestic campaign inflicted last season. United remains a globally recognised brand, but it isn’t associated with competitive success at the moment, nor does it look like that corner will be turned immediately, and getting major brands to part with significant sums of cash for training wear apparel exposure is a greater challenge than it previously has been.",
      "The club, without access to money from European football this coming season, needs to strike a good deal when it comes to renewing or bringing on board new commercial partners so as not to further impact what may be a challenging financial year during a period when they will be required to strengthen the squad in order to return themselves to Europe’s elite knockout club competition."

      "The Belgian striker switched from Everton to Old Trafford for a hefty £75million fee after an impressive stint at Everton, where he netted 87 goals in 166 games. Lukaku's first season at United started promisingly with 27 goals, but his form took a dip during the second season as he scored only 15 times and subsequently moved to Inter Milan.",
      "Lukaku candidly admitted his preference for the Blues over United, stating that despite informing everyone of his intention to move to Chelsea, Jose Mourinho's intervention and his then-agent Mino Raiola's influence swayed his decision. Speaking with Koolcast Sport and reported by Het Nieuwsblad, he said: \"I had already told everyone: I'm going to Chelsea. But suddenly, Mourinho called me to say that Manchester United had made an offer.",
      "\"I came back from vacation and suddenly there was an agreement with Everton. I said to Mino: 'I don't want this', and then I decided now I'm doing everything myself.\"",
      "Lukaku found his stride again post-United, scoring 64 times in two seasons for Inter, before eventually securing his sought-after transfer to Chelsea. His stay at Stamford Bridge was short-lived, however, leading to another term at Inter on loan and a subsequent spell with Roma, reports the Mirror.",
      "Lukaku, currently plying his trade with Napoli, contributed to them clinching the Serie A championship last season. His arrival in Italy could have occurred even before his permanent switch to Everton, prompting him to question the trust he placed in agents.",
      "\"It actually started in 2014. I signed with Everton at the time, but I could also go to Juventus, Wolfsburg and Atlético. That didn't happen,\" said Lukaku.",
      "\"I ended up at Everton, no problem, but when I saw certain figures in my contract, I thought: something's not right here. I started digging and then everything came out. A year later, De Bruyne moved to Manchester City and also started discovering everything. And then everything came out in the media.\"",
      "Bound to Napoli until 2027, Lukaku is set for a reunion with Kevin De Bruyne in Naples next term.

      "It would complete a remarkable journey that began in the Channel Islands for Maya Le Tissier should she help England retain their Euros title in a landlocked country.",
      "The defender has shown leadership qualities beyond her still tender years, with the 23-year-old one of the youngest players named in Sarina Wiegman’s squad.",
      "That will definitely help should the Manchester United captain be called upon in Switzerland, although she has already made history just from being there.",
      "Le Tissier is the first player from Guernsey – male or female – to be selected by England for a major tournament and it is back home where she began to develop into the player she is today.",
      "Island life",
      "It did not take Le Tissier long to get into football back home in Guernsey as she started playing aged just four for the boys’ team at St Martin AC, who are based on the south of the island.",
      "Her first coach was her father, Darren, who had played semi-professionally while serving in the Royal Air Force and she continued playing for the club until she was 16.",
      "However, there were no girls’ teams in Guernsey, with its location meaning Le Tissier would have to travel further than practically anyone else to find one.",
      "She told England football: “I started travelling over to England to play for girls teams around the age of 11 or 12.",
      "“I remember I went away with Guernsey and I wasn’t actually meant to be on the tour at U11s and we went to play the Southampton boys’ academy team. I remember one of their coaches was like ‘you need to come over here and see if you can get into a team’.",
      "“So, my mum and dad found Hampshire and I played for them for two years when I was about 11 until 13 and flew over twice a month. I would fly over on Thursdays and miss school to train and then play Saturdays.",
      "“I did that once or twice a month for two years, but I was still missing too many sessions and games so we had to stop. I was so gutted at the time.”",
      "Determined to help their daughter keep playing in England, Le Tissier’s parents, with the help of the FA, found the South West Regional Camp.",
      "Now part of a scheme for players who didn’t always have access to a club, Le Tissier travelled over one weekend per month and ended up earning a call-up to England U15s.",
      "It was with the camp that she met Katie Robinson, herself now a Lioness and someone Le Tissier has shared a pitch with on many occasions with the friendship extending to their respective families.",
      "Eventually, she attracted the attention of Brighton & Hove Albion, who she signed for as a 16-year-old in the summer of 2018 which meant she had to move away from Guernsey. She would now be on ‘the mainland’ full-time.",
      "Soaring seagull",
      "It wasn’t long before Le Tissier was thrown into action at Brighton, who were managed by former Lionesses boss Hope Powell.",
      "Five months after signing for the Seagulls, she made her debut in a Women’s League Cup match against Crystal Palace and four days after that she was facing the might of Chelsea in the Women’s Super League.",
      "From that point, she was a regular starter in Brighton’s defence, to the point where set a new record of WSL appearances for a teenager (53) when she played against Arsenal in March 2022.",
      "It was in the 2021/22 season that Le Tissier attracted praise for consistently producing composed performances that players far more experienced than her would have been pleased with.",
      "It led to a nomination for the PFA Women’s Young Player of the Year award and although she lost out to future Lionesses team-mate Lauren Hemp, a huge honour was just around the corner, as was a big move.",
      "Red Devil and Lioness",
      "In the summer of 2022, Le Tissier signed for Manchester United and enjoyed a debut to remember for her new club as she scored twice in a 4-0 win over Reading.",
      "It continued to get better for her that autumn when she earned her first call-up into the senior England squad.",
      "Le Tissier made her debut for the Lionesses in a friendly draw against Norway in November 2022, playing alongside players who not long ago had become European champions.",
      "She was on the standby list for their 2023 Women’s World Cup squad, but the call to head Down Under never came and she watched from home as Wiegman’s side reached the final, ultimately losing to Spain.",
      "Given competition for her place has included Leah Williamson, Millie Bright and Alex Greenwood, Le Tissier has had to be patient for her chances and has eight caps at the time of writing.",
      "Her stock continued to rise at United, however, as she helped them win their first major trophy as Tottenham were beaten 4-0 in the 2024 Women’s FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "Following the departure of fellow Lioness Katie Zelem that summer, Le Tissier was handed the captain’s armband at the still tender age of 22.",
      "It’s an honour that’s hardly weighed her down, however, as she was a rock at the back and managed to contribute five goals as United finished third in the WSL and qualified for the Women’s Champions League last season.",
      "How fitting that she also became the youngest player to make 100 WSL appearances when she faced her former club, Brighton, last November.",
      "Grateful for Guernsey",
      "Her performances meant Le Tissier fully earned her place in England’s squad for this summer’s Euros in Switzerland as the Lionesses look to defend the title so memorably won on home soil three years ago.",
      "The connection to Guernsey remains, although it’s worth repeating that she is not related to the island’s most famous footballing export despite sharing a surname with ex-forward Matt Le Tissier.",
      "That’s not to say there’s no link to the Southampton legend, however, as the two families know each other through her dad playing football with him.",
      "Le Tissier still trains at St Martins to keep fit during Christmas while she stays with her parents and is proud of her Channel Islands roots.",
      "She told England Football: “I had so much support from back home.",
      "“Guernsey is a great place in terms community spirit and helping raise sponsorship and things like that, so I was very lucky and thank you to everyone who has supported me and I hope they can see that it has paid off.",
      "“Now a couple of other Guernsey girls have been to the South West Regional Camps, which is really nice to see, and there has been another Guernsey girl in the Brighton U21s, so it's nice to see the path being used and hopefully it's one which helps the boys as well.",
      "“It's really good to be a role model for girls and boys back in the Channel Islands because they don’t get that many opportunities to show what they are about.",
      "“Obviously Matt Le Tissier did it quite a while ago, but there wasn’t really a pathway so hopefully they see that I've done it and know that they can do it too.”",
      "Le Tissier is aiming to become the second product of St Martins to lift silverware this summer after Alex Scott did so with England at the European Under-21 Championships.",

      "Securing a deal for Bryan Mbeumo is no walk in the park, as Brentford's technical director Lee Dykes can attest.",
      "The Cameroon forward remains at the top of Manchester United's list of targets as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his attacking options. Despite having a second bid turned down, United are still hopeful of landing Mbeumo after submitting another offer of more than £60million.",
      "Mbeumo joined Brentford from French club Troyes in 2019, but it wasn't an easy chase for Dykes, who had just moved from Bury FC at the time. He told the Bees' website in December 2023: \"I felt big pressure because I walked into a function where I was trying to take forward some of the good work that had already been done.",
      "\"Coming into Brentford, I'd never really spent a lot of money. I'd always worked at League One and League Two level.",
      "\"The most I'd spent was £50,000 on a player, and then six weeks later we are paying €5million for Bryan Mbeumo. So obviously you start to think, 'Wow, this is big money.' But, at the end of the day, it's just different money, same process.\"",
      "Dykes, along with co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen and head coach Thomas Frank, made a rapid visit to France to try and finalise a deal for Mbeumo.",
      "\"We were figuring that there was a possibility to sign Bryan,\" recalled Dykes. \"We had cleverly sourced that information, having been told that he wouldn't entertain the Championship.",
      "\"It became quickly apparent that we had to get in and out of France in a day as Thomas (Frank) had his training commitments because it was near to the season starting.\"",
      "There were logistical challenges to overcome ahead of the meeting, as Dykes explained: \"Where the meeting was going to take place, there was no airport close enough we could find from London or a route to do in one day, so we didn't know if we could make it work.",
      "\"I remember Rasmus just calling me up saying, 'I spoke to Matthew (Benham, club owner) and he said he'll fire up a jet and we'll get over there' – at that point, I was just thinking, 'Wow!'",
      "\"But that's when I started to feel the pressure. I'd lined it all up with Troyes, as well as the agents that were involved, so me, Thomas and Rasmus got on this jet.",
      "\"We got there, it was one of the hottest days of the year, it had reached about 43°C when we landed. It was a 60-minute journey and the air conditioning wasn't working in the taxi we got in!\"",
      "Despite that effort, initial talks came to nothing. Dykes said: \"We had the meeting, spoke with the player, the club and the agent, but the deal broke down. So, I had convinced everyone to fly over to France to get this deal done – I thought it was going to get done – but it had broken down.",
      "\"On the way back, and I'm not a good flyer in general, the pilot turned to us and said, 'It's chaotic weather in London, it's snowing, there's thunder, there's lightning.' I was thinking, 'What? It was 43 degrees when we left France.'",
      "\"And the journey back was horrendous – I could see the pilot avoiding the dark spots on the radar. I was bricking it!\"",
      "However, the Mbeumo chase had a happy ending. Dykes added: \"But, fortunately, we landed safely and, more importantly, managed to turn around the deal a few days later and eventually sign him. So, Brentford fans must know that I risked my life to sign Bryan Mbeumo!\""

      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has had ‘no contact’ with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim since their falling out, according to reports.",
      "Rashford left Old Trafford in the January transfer window as Aston Villa took him on loan for the remainder of the season after a falling out with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Man Utd forward was directly involved in ten goals in 17 matches at Villa Park in a successful loan spell that has once again boosted his reputation around Europe, to the delight of the Red Devils.",
      "It is clear that Rashford has to leave this summer unless there is an incredible U-turn from Amorim, who publicly stated in January that he’d rather play his goalkeeper coach than the Man Utd forward.",
      "When asked why Rashford wasn’t being selected, Amorim replied in a press conference: “It’s always the same reason: the training, the way I see a footballer should do in life. It’s every day, every detail.",
      "“If things don’t change, I will not change. It’s the same situation for every player, if you do the maximum and right things we can use every player.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Man Utd to move for Watkins, Arsenal given Rodrygo boost",
      "“You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench. But I would put [Man Utd goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn’t give the maximum every day.”",
      "Amorim did admit that he was “really happy” to see Rashford doing well on his loan spell, he commented in April: “All players on loan will return and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season. The talent of Rashford, Antony… we are really happy because if you put players on loan you want them to perform.”",
      "But the Daily Mail now claim that there has not been ‘any contact between Amorim and Rashford after the United boss dropped the England star over his alleged attitude in training’.",
      "After Aston Villa decided against taking up their £40m option to buy him, Rashford is now ‘expecting to play a full part in Manchester United’s pre-season programme when he reports to Carrington for training on Monday morning’.",
      "Sources close to Rashford have told the Daily Mail that ‘he has no issue returning to the club and will “give 100 per cent” in training’ despite his issues with Amorim.",
      "Rashford is attracting interest from La Liga champions Barcelona and elsewhere but it’s understood that ‘there has so far been no direct communication between United and the Rashford camp over talks with other clubs’.",
      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Man Utd and Newcastle should be taking notes…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘offered’ at least two Juventus players ‘in exchange’ for Jadon Sancho.",
      "Amad and Lisandro Martinez are both among the highest scorers in Premier League games against the Big Six in the current Manchester United squad.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly made a new enquiry for Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins after private talks over a potential swap deal for Marcus Rashford.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford is now ‘closer’ to sealing a move to Barcelona after Aston Villa chose not to take up their option, according to reports.",
      "Bayern Munich have reportedly joined the race to sign Marcus Rashford from Man Utd this summer after Aston Villa decided not to take up their option."

      "We’ve used science and data and all that good stuff to predict precisely who some clubs will sign next.",
      "Don’t get angry with us about these absolutely nailed-on prognostications. Get angry with science, if you must, but fair warning, that makes you look like a crazy person.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: Vito Mannone\nMikel Arteta is obsessed with buying goalkeepers. It’s kind of his thing. So while Arsenal might hope or expect to see a lovely central midfielder or even, bless, their hearts, an actual centre-forward arrive through the training ground doors, pure logic and playing the odds tells us it’s far more likely to be a goalkeeper.",
      "Even though Arsenal already have a very good goalkeeper and have already signed another goalkeeper this summer. That just shows how much they like signing goalkeepers. Even if you count Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus as centre-forwards, then Arteta has still signed twice as many goalkeepers as centre-forwards as Arsenal manager.",
      "Again, using nothing but the very purest and definitely non-mental of logic, that means they MUST sign one more goalkeeper this summer if they wish to procure one number nine. It’s very simple.",
      "Having established that Lille are Arsenal’s favourite club to buy from, how about this for a possible solution to a goalkeeper problem that doesn’t actually exist at the Emirates? Bring back Vito Mannone.",
      "It’s not technically buying from Lille because he’s now out of contract and thus available on a free. But that’s even better, isn’t it? Free! Free stuff can only ever be good news.",
      "And frankly, if your major issue here with any of this is ‘Re-signing Vito Mannone wouldn’t technically be Arsenal buying another player from Lille, actually’ then you should be taking a long, hard look at yourself.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Viktor Gyokeres\nWe know. We’re as surprised as you that this one is actually quite reasonable. It might even actually happen, we haven’t really checked too closely where exactly we currently sit today on the never-ending blows-and-boosts Gyokeres news cycle.",
      "But it is a very on-brand Manchester United signing for so many reasons. Buying a player from the manager’s former club? Tick. Spending huge money on a striker? Tick. Spending huge money on a striker who’s never actually done the business in a top league before? Tick.",
      "The only possible question-mark here is whether, if this did end up happening, United would have ended up paying the full Man United Tax, or merely the more bog-standard Premier League and bidding war tax.",
      "The idea of a ‘cut-price’ deal here despite talk of it actually coming in below the release clause still feels a bit misleading to us. It’s going to be a very full price.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Absolutely anyone and everyone from the upcoming Lyon firesale\nSpurs bloody love a transfer bargain that doesn’t actually turn out to be a bargain. If football transfers were a supermarket, Spurs would do 73% of their shopping in the middle of Lidl before spunking whatever cash they’ve got left on bullshit ‘picky bits’ from Waitrose.",
      "Lyon are already a club Spurs like to work with, presumably because back when Jean-Michel Aulas was in charge there was a healthy mutual respect between him and Daniel Levy as the transfer game’s two most notoriously difficult bastards. It genuinely is a wonder they ever managed to get a deal done, but we suspect every time they each walked away certain they’d pulled the other’s pants down.",
      "Aulas definitely won with Tanguy Ndombele and Clinton Njie, but we will have to give Hugo Lloris to Levy.",
      "But with Lyon now booted into Ligue 2 – obviously pending an appeal – there is presumably some kind of whoops aisle apocalypse in store. Everything must go, and Spurs cannot resist that orange sticker.",
      "No idea who they’ll end up with, of course, because to try and predict that would be an attempt to impose order on a club that exists in permanent chaos. Three slightly shop-soiled right-backs, probably. Can never have too many, can you? And those best before dates are a scam, actually, cooked up to make you throw stuff away and buy some more.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Jarrad Branthwaite\nVilla and Everton have been cosy transfer bedfellows for the longest time now – even before there was mutually beneficial PSR chicanery definitely and absolutely not involved.",
      "Villa’s serendipitous and entirely coincidental sale of their women’s team to themselves for an eye-watering price has sorted out any PSR concerns this time, so that’s nice, even though actually of course that wasn’t actually in any way a motivating factor actually, and thus the spending can continue from a club that likes to buy itself expensive treats these days. Even if sometimes they can only borrow them for a bit.",
      "Villa are the social-media influencer trying to project an image of extreme wealth that doesn’t quite match the reality, in a way.",
      "But while missing out on another crack at the Champions League is a disappointment and financial impediment, they can surely still shop at the Everton store for at least one more summer.",
      "Villa are in need of a centre-back with their Other January Loan, Axel Disasi, heading back to Chelsea, so why not Jarrad Branthwaite from their favourite shopping spot? Well, several reasons. But ignore those.",
      "It’s an undoubted step up for a player who might just need it to get himself the attention that could drive greater international opportunities, one that gives him a chance to play alongside some pretty handy defenders and under a very decent manager, all without the greater risks of a move to a fully-fledged giant where the danger of being swallowed up and spat out are very real indeed.",
      "Villa’s foundations may be slightly shaky, but they do remain an ideal ‘next step’ kind of club for players of Branthwaite’s ilk. Big enough and successful enough to definitely not be a sideways step, but without the laser focus and goldfish bowl existence and instant rushes to judgement that come by jumping straight to even loftier ground.",
      "What’s in it for Everton is much less clear, but this isn’t about them. Even if we do give this one about a 0.1% chance of actually happening.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Kaoru Mitoma\nThere are two types of players Chelsea bloody love signing: tricky wingers they surely don’t need any more of, and Brighton players.",
      "Frankly we’re just surprised that nobody else has really gone for this absolutely perfect example of how two plus two equals four before. It is an absolute David Brent hand gesture of a perfect cosmic and footballing alignment.",
      "Apart from the fact we really rather like Kaoru Mitoma, and he doesn’t deserve any of this.",
      "",
      "Newcastle United: Mikel Oyarzabal\nA very obvious and definitely correct rule of transfer dealings is that something that worked last time will absolutely always work again the next time you try it.",
      "Which is obviously why Newcastle’s next move in the transfer market should be buying a striker from Real Sociedad.",
      "The foolproof plan is this:",
      "1 – Sign Mikel Oyarzabal from Real Sociedad",
      "2 – Sell the last striker you bought from Real Sociedad",
      "3 – Profit",
      "Honestly, this whole transfer caper is far simpler and far easier to crack than these daft teams so often make it look."

      "And now Brazilian outlet UOL have claimed that Man Utd are ‘back in’ for Botafogo goalkeeper John after his fine performances at the Club World Cup.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Man Utd to move for Watkins, Arsenal given Rodrygo boost",

      "The report adds: ‘A representative from the English team was present at the match against Palmeiras, but the situation changed after the game against PSG, where John ended up as one of the standout players.’",
      "The Red Devils are expected to try and offload Onana ‘to create a spot for a new goalkeeper’ with the Premier League side ‘monitoring the goalkeeper since the end of last season’.",

But at the same time, I feel sometimes the pressure has been immense. Maybe he’s not handled it the best way, but at the same time, he still comes back, the manager still puts him in.",
      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold. There’s a lot of factors. And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",
      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "Arsenal remain active in the transfer market with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke the most prominent names linked in recent days.",
      "The departure of Carlos Cuesta, who left to take charge of Parma, has created space in Arteta’s coaching setup. That role is now expected to be filled by former Man Utd defender Gabriel Heinze.",
      "Heinze, 47, is set to return to the Premier League in a very different capacity, joining Arteta’s backroom ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The pair have known each other since their time as teammates at Paris Saint-Germain, and Arteta has made no secret of the influence Heinze had on him as a young player.",
      "Speaking in a past interview, the Arsenal manager named Heinze alongside Mauricio Pochettino as one of the senior players who “were guiding me in everything I had to do in my professional life… and they were inspirational to me.”",
      "Heinze’s playing career was as uncompromising as it was decorated. He made 72 appearances for Argentina, featured at two World Cups, and lifted domestic titles in England, France, Spain and Argentina.",
      "MORE ARSENAL COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Real Madrid ‘open to selling’ £77m Arsenal target with ‘suitable offer’ to seal transfer\n👉 Fabrizio Romano confirms ‘new round of talks’ with Chelsea star ‘open’ to Arsenal move\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Man Utd to move for Watkins, Arsenal given Rodrygo boost",
      "After joining Man Utd in 2004, he was voted the club’s Player of the Year in his debut season, becoming a cult hero among fans at Old Trafford.",
      "His time in Manchester ended less harmoniously, with Heinze pushing for a controversial move to Liverpool after falling down the pecking order under Sir Alex Ferguson. That move was blocked, and he left for Real Madrid instead.",
      "Since retiring, Heinze has held several head coaching roles in South America, including at Newell’s Old Boys, Argentinos Juniors and Velez Sarsfield. He also had a short spell in MLS with Atlanta United but has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Heinze will now slot into an Arsenal setup that already includes Albert Stuivenberg, goalkeeping coach Inaki Cana and set-piece specialist Nicolas Jover — all of whom signed new contracts last season to align with Arteta’s own deal, which runs until 2027.",
      "With pre-season preparations now underway and Arsenal due to tour Singapore and Hong Kong later this month, Heinze’s arrival is expected to be made official in the coming days."

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nBack in the power ranking after The Athletic reported that Madrid are ‘open to selling’ the Brazilian winger, who is apparently the Gunners’ ‘dream target’ this summer. David Ornstein says Arsenal are keen, but that a transfer is unlikely if Gabriel Martinelli isn’t sold. Welp.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites.",
      "",
      "18) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "17) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs have apparently cooled their interest in Eberechi Eze to prioritise a move for Kudus, who has an £85million clause active for the first 10 days of July. But the feeling is West Ham would be open to offers in the region of £60million since they need to generate whatever they wish to spend this summer. Not £50million, which was apparently Spurs’ opening low-ball offer.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. And Berta, evidently, hasn’t sufficiently seduced the striker’s agents. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca like Luis Diaz but Liverpool are either keen to keep the Colombian or they will only sell for money Barca don’t have. Which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars. But reports this week suggest Watkins is now at the top of their striker list.",
      "",
      "13) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThe stumbling block around any move for Sancho is always going to be the enormous salary that Manchester United are contracted to pay him for another year. Juve cannot afford those sums, but they seem to be serious about finding a solution. If they do, Sancho should be thanking his lucky stars.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Thierno Barry – Villarreal to Everton\nThe France Under-21 striker has a £34million release clause but the Guardian reckons Everton are close to securing a hefty discount to sign a replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin for £27million. Barry bagged 11 goals last season.",
      "",
      "11) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £17million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nAnother we reckon is buried rather deep on Arsenal’s list of targets, somewhere behind Eberechi Eze, Nico Williams and Rodrygo. But Rodrygo might be too pricey; Williams seems to be staying in Bilbao; and Eze could be signed separately. Romano reckons more talks have taken place, but seemingly not between the clubs.",
      "",
      "8) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more before a deal is done next week.",
      "",
      "7) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United. Reports suggest United are confident of getting a deal before next week.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nAfter having a £45m bid rejected by Forest, the Magpies have come back with a £55m bid, which will be very hard to refuse. It looks like Newcastle will get their man.",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nThe Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres and Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19. It’s looking very positive on that front…",
      "",
      "3) Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London almost a fortnight ago to complete his move, but if we know anything about Arsenal this summer, it’s that they won’t be rushed."

The Australian goalkeeper didn’t see eye to eye with Fergie and, hours after his Manchester United deal was ripped up, he joined Chelsea.",

The Japanese international only played six minutes across the entire 2024/25 campaign after being unable to shake a knee problem. He’s still injured after undergoing surgery and not expected back for at least another five months.",

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Manchester United should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers. And attacking midfielders.",
      "10) Heung-min Son (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThe South Korea and Spurs captain endured a difficult 2024/25 campaign but still ended up with 11 goals and 12 assists in 46 matches, including 17 goal involvements in 30 Premier League appearances. Those numbers mask what was a disappointing season overall, with it increasingly clear that Son is in sharp decline.",
      "That being said, it could simply have been an off year, and there’s a growing willingness at Spurs to part ways with one of their greatest-ever players. His respectable output last season, combined with elite numbers in years gone by, makes Son an intriguing potential target for clubs abroad.",
      "",
      "9) Malick Fofana (Lyon)\nLyon were prepared to sell Fofana amid interest from clubs like Liverpool and Bayern Munich, but their financially-influenced relegation to Ligue 2 means there’s now no chance the young Belgian sticks around.",
      "His sale could help Lyon retain their Ligue 1 status, but there’s no immediate rush on Fofana’s part to leave. Nottingham Forest had a bid accepted and are on the brink of selling Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United for £55million, but Fofana wants Champions League football. Chelsea are an option but have already signed Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, while Borussia Dortmund have confirmed Jamie Gittens’ move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "What is clear is that, at just 20 years old, Fofana is one of the most intriguing prospects on the market this summer.",
      "",
      "8) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling, while Gabriel Martinelli’s availability is up for debate (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed have been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was so exciting to watch at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "7) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham)\nSpurs and Newcastle are in the frame for Kudus, who is available this summer as West Ham boss Graham Potter looks to rebuild the squad and correct the missteps of Julen Lopetegui’s 2024 summer recruitment.",
      "Kudus is coming off an underwhelming season following an impressive debut Premier League campaign in 2023/24, but he’s still attracting plenty of interest. That first season alone is enough for the Hammers to believe they can command a significant fee.",
      "Versatile and devastating on his day, Kudus could be a top-class signing for any Premier League side.",
      "",
      "6) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "5) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. Scott McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "His salary is the crucial stumbling block; only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal. We say should, but Brentford have other ideas.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked. Surprisingly, he wants to join the Red Devils over the other two clubs. Thomas Frank to Spurs has potentially thrown a spanner in the works.",
      "Mbeumo is clearly an elite talent, capable of scoring goals from the right. It’s no wonder United have made two bids for him already. But Brentford are standing firm.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nWilliams has signed a new long-term contract at Bilbao, but the release clause still exists. Oh, and by ‘long-term’, we mean 10 f***ing years.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Gittens, Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "His performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, is expendable.",

      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Man Utd to move for Watkins, Arsenal given Rodrygo boost",
      "Osimhen has ‘expressed his willingness to join the Red Devils’ new project led by Rubén Amorim, despite the fact that the English club will not be playing in the next edition of the Champions League’.",
      "The Napoli striker ‘fits’ the profile that Man Utd are looking for this summer and for Amorim ‘his arrival would be a luxury addition to revive the team’s attack’.",
      "But it ‘is not a done deal’ and the Red Devils ‘will have to adjust its accounts’ to fit Osimhen in as the player’s wage demands are very high.",
      "Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is not convinced that Osimhen would thrive in the Premier League and remains unconvinced that the Nigerian would hit the ground running in England.",
      "When asked whether Chelsea should have signed Osimhen on John Obi Mikel’s podcast, Hasselbaink said: “I know he’s your countryman but I’m not convinced of Osimhen for the Premier League.",
      "“For Spain, for Italy – yes. For the Premier League? I’m not 100 per cent sure.”",
      "But former Arsenal and Chelsea defender William Gallas insists that Osimhen “has the right profile” to become a Premier League star.",
      "Gallas told Prime Casino: “I think Victor Osimhen can become a star in the Premier League, he has the right profile. He can stretch play and stretch the backlines. Another attacker can run into the space he makes, and he could be useful for any club in the Premier League. He’s always learning, but at the same time, how long will he need to adapt to a new situation?”",
      "Gallas added: “We’ve seen foreign players before, it’s often difficult for them in the first season. The second season they step up, so it’s not unusual at all. Even Ronaldo, in his first season he wasn’t the Ronaldo we know now, but in the second season there were signs.",
      "“It all depends which club. If Arsenal need results straight away, they need to win the Premier League next year, then they need one player who can do it straight away. They don’t have time.",
      "“If we talk about Manchester United, from where they are now, they don’t need to win the league. They’re looking to be top four or top five, so maybe they can give Osimhen the time he needs.”",
      "Liverpool have made their decision on which striker to pursue this summer amid claims they are still looking to sign Alexander Isak, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s moves for three strikers worth around £218m combined have been ruled out for three reasons.",

      "",
      "Stewart Downing’s underwhelming Tottenham career\nThose couple of years at White Hart Lane really did sum up the lost potential of Downing’s career. He really did seem to have the world at his feet, but for neither the first nor last time, Spurs got in the way.",
      "Of course, as always with Spurs, managerial changes got in the way. Signed by Harry Redknapp six months before he left the club, Downing never truly got over Andre Villas-Boas’ early suspicions, and that was that.",
      "Managing just three Premier League goals and a handful of assists, he – like so many others before him after being chewed up by Spurs’ ridiculousness – sought solace at West Ham, because they are very, very, very slightly less ridiculous.",
      "We all remember it now, don’t we? Except it never happened. We can picture Downing, a look of exasperated frustration on his face and a cockerel on his chest, so clearly that we do actually worry about the deeply uninspiring nature of the things our brain imagines.",
      "The West Ham bit is true, though. He did end up at West Ham. Which makes us wonder whether on some level even Downing himself feels like he experienced an underwhelming 18 months at Spurs. We bet he does.",

      "Roy Keane, Blackburn manager\nCome on. You remember. Don’t act like you can’t immediately conjure this in your mind’s eye. Keane, bearded but only flecked with grey at this time, eyes narrowing with rage, Kappa-tracksuited, yelling furiously at Junior Hoilett or perhaps David Dunn. Sharing a knowing look with Ryan Nelsen about these lazy fancy dans. Telling Roque Santa Cruz that scoring goals is ‘just his job’ and nothing all that impressive.",
      "Blackburn didn’t even have Kappa kits at the time of this absolute nonsense we’ve invented in our heads. We are not well.",
      "",

Should have won stuff, shouldn’t they? Didn’t, did they? They also never once lined up with this starting XI, despite it containing all the key ingredients of the era.",
      "Now, we’ve obviously committed a significant mischief in sticking Wayne Rooney here, because he’s not strictly speaking Golden Generation, but did play alongside all of them.",
      "When you stop and think about it properly, this team never happening starts to make plenty of sense. Start doing the maths of Rooney’s emergence and Rio Ferdinand’s, ahem, forgetfulness and Paul Scholes’ early international retirement and it all comes together.",
      "But at first thought we’d confidently expect each and every one of you to just go right ahead and assume this team played together a bunch of times. Yet even if you take away one layer of mischief and replace Rio with Sol Campbell and it’s still only four games together.",

It’s beguilingly easy to imagine Roy Keane in a Blackburn tracksuit, or Stewart Downing in an Under Armour Spurs kit, or Younes Kaboul stumbling around Loftus Road.",
      "There is no real reason for any of those things or anything like them to come to mind so easily, but there’s just something about those combinations of man and club that feel right, so your brain does the rest.",
      "These next few come from a slightly different place. These ones are things that did happen, but not the way you necessarily remember them. Now we fully expect the comment section here to be full of ‘Well I never thought that’ and hurrah for you, but we guarantee that while you may not have misremembered or conflated these specific incidents, you will have done it with others. Like Denis Law relegating Man United.",
      "This one we reckon, if we’re honest, almost all of us have at some point or other got muddled up in our heads, even if we subsequently go ‘Oh no, those were separate hilarities’. And that’s the point, they were hilarities.",
      "It must be hard to imagine for younger fans now, but there was a time when Manchester United losing a game of football to a team they shouldn’t really lose to was an event of national importance. There’s a reason ‘Hated, adored, never ignored’ came to be a United call to arms, and it’s far more powerful than the ‘Hated, adored, occasionally viewed with something approaching pity’ that would now apply.",
      "Anyway, Back in the mid-90s, Manchester United did two hilarities at The Dell. And they are two of the more infamous United hilarities of the time. They lost a game 6-3, which even now would be notably funny, and they also infamously lost a game where they changed their grey kit at half-time because it had apparently rendered the players invisible to each other yet not, weirdly, to the Southampton players. Worst. Invincibility. Cloak. Ever.",
      "But these two now frequently conflated events happened on two entirely separate occasions. United were in blue and white for the 6-3 paddling at the hands of a Southampton team managed by Graeme Souness, which itself feels like a candidate for this feature until you remember that he was the manager for that whole Ali Dia caper and then somehow it becomes something that could somehow belong in both this feature and its sibling about things that did happen but feel like they couldn’t possibly have and we’re not going to lie our brain really hurts.",

Manchester United did come from 3-0 down at half-time to beat Spurs 5-3 in 2001 and Sir Alex Ferguson did once issue a team-talk comprising the words “Lads, it’s Tottenham.”",

      "Let’s accept, though, that he did say “lads, it’s Tottenham”. But what he definitely didn’t do was say it to inspire a comeback from 3-0 down at White Hart Lane.",
      "Former Blackburn manager Roy Keane gives the full context in his telling of the story, and it makes it obvious it couldn’t possibly apply to a situation in which United are 3-0 down at White Hart Lane because it’s a) at home, b) pre-match and also about how easy it is to just sort Spurs out which wouldn’t really ring true at 3-0 down.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘offered’ at least two Juventus players ‘in exchange’ for Jadon Sancho.",
      "United are trying to offload Sancho after Chelsea paid a £5million penalty not to sign him permanently for £25m following his loan spell during the 2024/25 season.",
      "He has plenty of interest — mainly from abroad — but his £275,000-a-week wages are stalling transfer negotiations.",
      "Fenerbahce had been linked, but that move has been ruled out. Italian giants Juventus and Napoli, as well as Sancho’s former club Borussia Dortmund, are all in the frame.",
      "Sancho isn’t the only one available — United are also desperate to shift Marcus Rashford.",
      "The 27-year-old is being considered by Barcelona and Bayern Munich and is valued at £40m, but like Sancho, his £315,000-a-week wages are a colossal stumbling block.",
      "MORE: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Sancho, Antony bottom five, Ronaldo 7th; Mbeumo next?",
      "A report from the Daily Mail claims Rashford could leave on loan again after spending six months at Aston Villa, while Juventus’ efforts to sign Sancho include offering two players in a swap deal.",
      "Journalist Chris Wheeler reports that Rashford’s camp have been in ‘talks’ with La Liga champions Barcelona, while the Old Lady ‘are unlikely to cover even half’ of Sancho’s salary.",
      "To get around that issue, Juve ‘have offered several players in exchange, including Douglas Luiz and Dusan Vlahovic’.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is chasing a new centre-forward and could be tempted by Vlahovic in a swap for Sancho, who clearly has no future at Old Trafford.",
      "It’s also claimed that Dortmund are ‘considering’ Sancho as a replacement for Chelsea-bound winger Jamie Gittens.",
      "Another player who appears to be on his way out is Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "Garnacho is seen as United’s ‘best chance of a big transfer fee’ this summer, after Bruno Fernandes turned down Al Hilal.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s transfer team have set an ambitious £60m asking price for the Argentina winger. Napoli are described as ‘long-time admirers’, while ‘Chelsea are one of three Premier League clubs showing an interest after Spurs also enquired in January’.",
      "There are also updates on the futures of Antony and Tyrell Malacia:",
      "Antony rediscovered his form on loan at Real Betis and wants to join the Seville club permanently. However, it might be another loan with an obligation to buy and United want more than Betis are currently offering – believed to be around £30m – for a player who cost £86m from Ajax three years ago.",
      "Malacia is also back at United after PSV Eindhoven decided not to make his loan move permanent for £8.3m, but he is unlikely to figure in Amorim’s plans.",
      "All of these players are due back for pre-season training on Monday, but shifting them won’t be easy — especially after Amorim made it clear he wants Rashford and Garnacho to leave.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has had ‘no contact’ with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim since their falling out, according to reports.",
      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Man Utd and Newcastle should be taking notes…",
      "A former Man Utd coach has opened up on where things went wrong for an ‘unbelievable’ talent pushed out by Erik ten Hag.",
      "Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has revealed a Man Utd player is in direct contact with a European giant to explore a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amad and Lisandro Martinez are both among the highest scorers in Premier League games against the Big Six in the current Manchester United squad.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly made a new enquiry for Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins after private talks over a potential swap deal for Marcus Rashford."

      "Man Utd are closing in on a crucial moment in their pursuit of Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, according to a report, which outlines their next steps if a third bid is to be rejected.",
      "After a turbulent 2024/25 campaign, Man Utd are eager to strengthen their attacking options ahead of the new season under manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Mbeumo, the Cameroon international, has made it clear he wants to join Utd, but talks between the clubs have been slow and complex.",
      "Utd’s initial offer of £45 million plus £10 million in add-ons was rejected, and a second bid of £55 million plus £7.5 million in add-ons also failed to meet Brentford’s valuation.",
      "The west London club believe Mbeumo’s worth exceeds the amount the Red Devils recently paid for Matheus Cunha, intensifying the standoff. Cunha’s £62.5 million transfer clause was triggered in June, and the fee will be paid to Wolves over two years.",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed that talks restarted recently, with Utd carefully reviewing how far they can push their offer. He said:",
      "“So constant contacts between the two clubs to reach an agreement for Bryan Mbeumo. There is still no here we go, but may United keep working on that, United keep advancing, United keep their confidence and their optimism to make the deal happen.”",
      "The club are thought to be aware that an overpayment could set a dangerous precedent in the transfer market, especially given criticism from owners INEOS and internal calls for more disciplined spending.",
      "For that reason, according to GiveMeSport, club officials are prepared to walk away from the deal entirely should their third bid fail to meet Brentford’s valuation.",
      "An internal deadline reportedly looms, aiming to have the deal concluded before the start of pre-season training. However, with no agreement yet in place, that timeline appears increasingly optimistic.",
      "Mbeumo’s Premier League statistics underline why United are so keen to sign him. The 25-year-old finished last season as Brentford’s top scorer with 20 goals in 38 appearances, leading the squad in key passes per game and match ratings.",
      "His ability to unlock defences with pace and precision has made him one of the league’s most dangerous forwards.",
      "Although there’s growing hope he could line up in a Brentford shirt next season, the club is preparing for the possibility that their star player will leave this summer. The financial realities facing the Bees, combined with Mbeumo’s desire to play on a bigger stage, suggest the transfer could be imminent.",
      "Man Utd are closing in on the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with the deal set to “speed up soon”, according to an insider.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is “happy to stay to stay at Brentford” according to the Bees’ director of football as Man Utd ‘make contact’ with Aston Villa over their £60m forward.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘much closer’ to landing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo as they have set a deadline to ‘wrap up a deal’.",
      "Manchester United have a rare chance to end a ‘vicious cycle’ with their transfers, while there is praise for Sir Lee Carsley and his ‘mustard’ England U21s.",
      "According to reports, Man Utd have made a shock £30m ‘offer’ for a Bryan Mbeumo alternative as the club bosses deem Brentford’s demands ‘excessive’.",
      "Including Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo and Liverpool star Harvey Elliott, these 11 Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer."

      "“I couldn’t fault Jadon in training. He brings unbelievable quality, ability and skills,” McCarthy told BetOnline. “He can make you stop in awe and ask yourself just how he can do things. He brought unmatched quality.”",
      "But the former forward also pinpointed a key issue: Sancho’s reserved nature off the pitch, which may have given Erik ten Hag and his Utd team-mates the wrong impression.",
      "“I think what didn’t help Jadon was that he’s a very closed-off person. He keeps to himself, and from the outside it looked like he wasn’t trying to make friends with his team-mates.",
      "He might not have joked around but really he was just quiet, and I don’t think you should judge players on who he gets on with or not.”",
      "McCarthy emphasized that the winger’s quiet personality shouldn’t overshadow his talent or work ethic.",
      "“Based on his ability and craft, I never saw any problems in his relationships. He was quiet-natured, and so when training is done, he doesn’t stay to talk, he heads home. He’s very private. I think a bit of an introvert, which isn’t the opinion he gets branded with in the press.”",
      "But when it came to consistency, McCarthy explained where the cracks began to appear.",
      "“I think that when it came to Erik, he wanted to see Jadon at his best every day. Monday to Friday, no days off. I think that’s what the manager would expect from his players, and so it’s up to the players to give it to him. If you can’t do that, you’re going to have problems, and I think the differences and problems then surfaced.”",
      "Despite the difficulties, McCarthy reserved praise for Sancho’s moments of brilliance.",
      "“For me, I don’t have a bad thing to say about Jadon. I loved him; he was unbelievable, sometimes he was unplayable. I don’t want to rush to judgement on players if they’re reserved.”",
      "Sancho’s time at Man Utd has been a rollercoaster. After a mixed loan spell at Chelsea, who reportedly paid to opt out of signing him permanently, he’s nailed on to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Reports now suggest Juventus have offered three players to Utd in a swap deal as they eye Sancho’s signature.",

      "The Red Devils have already secured the signing of Matheus Cunha to bolster Ruben Amorim’s attacking options after triggering his £62.5m release clause to sign him from Wolves and have been pushing to add Mbeumo to their ranks after the Frenchman’s 20 goals and eight assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "Brentford rejected an opening bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons from United and then knocked back an improved offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons last week, but their remains optimism a deal can be completed for the Cameroon international amid reports the Bees are holding out for £65m.",
      "But United are also keen on signing a new striker and although they have held ‘talks’ with Aston Villa over a move for Ollie Watkins, they aren’t in a position to pay his £60m asking price and a report last week claimed they’ve instead made a move for Toney.",
      "The Al Ahli striker, who moved to the Saudi Pro League side from Brentford for £40m last summer, has ‘aroused interest’ at United as ‘they believe that his previous experience in the Premier League, his scoring sense and his physical strength make him a very valid bet to lead the attack’.",
      "The report claimed that with his Transfermarkt value ‘dropping to £21m’, United have ‘put on the table an offer that could be very attractive of €30m [£26m] plus €5m [£4.3m] in add-ons’, with ‘first contacts made between the club’s and the player’s environment’.",
      "And now Football Insider claim ‘Toney wants to join Manchester United’, with Mick Brown, who worked as a United scout for over a decade during the club’s most successful period and remains very well-connected there, revealing the Red Devils see him as a “definite upgrade on what they’ve got”.",
      "“Toney is an interesting one for United,” he told Football Insider.",
      "“Whatever you say about him, he’s got a proven track record of scoring goals in the Premier League.",
      "“He’s gone out to Saudi Arabia and continued scoring goals.",
      "“Man United have been watching him, my sources tell me, and they think he is still capable of playing at the top level, plus he’s not even 30 yet so he’s got years left in him.",
      "“He’s one they’ve liked for a while, even when he was at Brentford, so it might be a surprise to see them interested again but there aren’t a lot of strikers of his level available.",
      "“From what I’m told, he would be interested in a return to the Premier League.",
      "“He might have to take a cut from what he’s getting paid out there, but he wants to play at the highest level and United could give him that chance.",

      "Manchester United have been handed a golden opportunity to sign Inter Milan star Denzel Dumfries for a cut-price fee this summer.",
      "The Red Devils bosses are currently purely focused on securing the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford after their opening two offers for the Cameroon international were rejected.",
      "Their latest reported bid of £62.5m, to match the fee paid to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves, came close to the Bees asking price, which is said to be £65m.",
      "There’s ‘confidence’ a deal will be imminently struck between the clubs, with Mbeumo ready to make the move to Old Trafford.",

      "There’s not so much talk over moves for wing-backs, which feels odd given Amorim’s reliance on them in his 3-4-3 system, though the news that Dumfries is available for just €25m [£21m] should light a fire under United’s recruitment team.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano wrote on X: ‘Denzel Dumfries has €25m release clause into his contract at Inter, valid until mid July. Understand Barcelona have been showing interest in the recent months but no formal proposal or official approach made.’",
      "United have had a long-standing interest in Dumfries with Erik ten Hag said to be a big admirer of the Netherlands international, while a report on April claimed the Red Devils were plotting ‘a mega offer’ of €100m for the 29-year-old and German centre-back Yann Bisseck.",
      "The report claimed:",
      "‘Manchester United, which is preparing to start yet another technical revolution, is preparing a mega offer of 100 million in total for the two players: 40 for the Dutchman, 60 for the Teutonic. Marotta is preparing to seriously evaluate everything…’",

      "In a week in which Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro from Brighton as Manchester United decide whether to overpay for Bryan Mbeumo while Tottenham and Arsenal make plays for Mohammed Kudus and Eberechi Eze, we’re faced with two troubling realities: one old, one new.",
      "Big Six clubs poaching the best of the rest has been commonplace for at least the last two decades. But this summer does feel particularly poignant in what has been a 21st century Premier League d*ck-measuring contest given the sheer number of these pillagings and because two of the raiders were worse last season than the teams they’re looting: United finished 14 points behind Brentford; Tottenham finished five points behind West Ham.",
      "It doesn’t seem fair, but then neither does the Small 14 being able to plunder potential future Big Six stars from every other club in Europe outside your Real Madrids, Barcelonas and Bayern Munichs.",
      "All of these players being targeted by the top (or formerly top) Premier League clubs are of a type. Managers, sporting directors, whoever’s making key decisions at football clubs these days, want forwards whose first thought is to dribble rather than pass. Matheus Cunha is another example and we suspect interest in Anthony Gordon and Morgan Rogers isn’t about to go away any time soon for the very same reason.",
      "The desire to have these sorts of footballers in top teams isn’t what’s troubling – the opposite if anything. Who doesn’t want to see Eze or Kudus diddling defenders with the ball at their feet before letting fly from 25 yards? Yes please. It’s the impact of what’s clearly becoming a bit of an obsession on your classic playmaker that’s disturbing.",
      "It’s the guys who have a picture in their head before the ball comes to them in a tight space and manoeuvre away from a defender before delivering a killer through ball, rather than drifting past or barrelling through them, that we’re concerned for. We’re looking at you, Martin Odegaard. And you, Bruno Fernandes.",
      "We’re of course looking forward to the irony of Manchester United turning down £100m from the Saudi Pro League for their 30-year-old captain in the summer when by Christmas, after a year of Ruben Amorim trying to fit Fernandes into his entirely unsuited system, he’s sitting on the bench watching Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro in the pivot with Mbeumo and Cunha ahead of them as his value plummets, but we would much rather be watching a United team with Fernandes in it.",
      "We got a taste of what Arsenal would be like without Odegaard last season – both when he was and wasn’t injured, as he wasn’t the same Odegaard we enjoyed the season before – and it wasn’t pretty. It was robotic. We knew what each and every player was going to do on that pitch before they did it.",
      "MORE ARSENAL COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Arsenal now ‘well advanced’ on £68m fifth signing from PL club as next three targets are named\n👉 Arsenal get huge boost over ‘dream target’ as £75m transfer takes shape after exit update\n👉 Advantage Spurs in north London with one Arsenal star ‘jealous’ amid new Gyokeres ‘blow’",
      "We like a bit of that. We like that full-backs essentially know Bukayo Saka is going to run at them, jink inside and get a shot away because them being powerless to stop him is a thoroughly enjoyable display of his brilliance. But we would also like some mystery, some guile, some head-on-a-swivel-how-the-f***-did-he-see-and-play-that-pass stuff.",
      "Odegaard must be concerned by Arsenal’s push for Eze; aware of the turning tide away from players like him as we are. It would have been unthinkable a year ago to imagine an Arsenal side without Odegaard, but amid this increasing desire for players who dribble past opponents to create overloads after a very poor season by his standards, there won’t be too many surprised to see a midfield three of Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice and Eberechi Eze next term.",
      "Hope for the future is retained in the hybrids – your Cole Palmers, Morgan Gibbs-Whites and Florian Wirtzs – who can dribble with the best of them but whose eye for a pass sets them apart.",
      "But in a season in which Odegaard and Fernandes could lose their formerly nailed-on places we may be left thinking wistfully of Cesc Fabregas and David Silva, and wondering whether their regens will ever again be given the opportunity in a Premier League now valuing forward mobility over subtle craft.",
      "Teddy Sheringham has praised Bruno Fernandes for staying at “big club” Manchester United while they “aren’t at the top of their game.”",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "England fans were so unimpressed by the drab win over Andorra that only two people wrote in about it – more were interested in defending Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been eviscerated in the Mailbox but there is plenty of time and space to thank Ange Postecoglou for making Spurs interesting again.",

That makes the signing of an elite left-winger the dreamiest of scenarios, and Real Madrid superstar Rodrygo is our pick over Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams.",
      "Rodrygo was an unused substitute in Madrid’s Club World Cup last-16 win over Juventus, making it one start out of a possible four and just 88 minutes played in the United States. This saga should rumble on into the closing weeks of the transfer window, but Arsenal are there and ready to pounce for a genuinely outstanding forward. Rodrygo can take this lot to the next level.",

With Chelsea signing Jamie Gittens, and Arsenal and Liverpool targeting other options, the Portuguese international might just settle on a slightly less ambitious move to Aston Villa.",
      "The Villans are hardly lacking ambition themselves and could feasibly qualify for the Champions League in 2025/26 after narrowly missing out last season. That, combined with the lure of the Premier League, could tempt Leao into making the surprise switch to Villa Park.",

Dean Huijsen says hello. Milos Kerkez says hey. Illia Zabarnyi also says hi, amidst interest from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Andoni Iraola is a superb manager for any young, ambitious player and is desperate for a new centre-back after selling Huijsen to Real Madrid. Furthermore, Hato can play right or left-back, and Iraola has just lost Milos Kerkez – albeit he has signed a replacement in Adrien Truffert – while an ancient Adam Smith remains his first-choice right-back.",

      "Mbeumo is wanted by Manchester United, but there’s no agreement between the two clubs. The Cameroonian winger isn’t causing a fuss and is open to staying at Brentford if a deal can’t be struck, with the Red Devils already failing with two bids. He’s probably playing the long game, knowing he can leave for less next summer or for nothing in 2027, with a tasty signing-on bonus and salary.",

      "Chelsea sold Guehi to Crystal Palace for £18m in July 2021 and have been linked with him quite a bit since then, the fools that they are. This would be a hilariously typical Blues signing but a fantastic one that would massively benefit them and England.",

      "Oliver Glasner wants a new centre-back with Marc Guehi attracting serious interest, and Sporting’s Diomande is right at the top of his wish-list. We like it. We like it a lot.",
      "A dominant presence with pace, power and a ridiculous ceiling, Diomande would be a statement signing.",
      "",
      "Everton: Mohammed Kudus\nExtending Jarrad Branthwaite’s contract is huge for Everton, who have a pretty settled centre-back partnership in the 23-year-old and James Tarkowski. A couple of full-backs wouldn’t go amiss, but hardly ‘dreamy’. David Moyes could also do with a new defensive midfielder, but we reckon an X-factor on the right wing would make the biggest difference, especially with Villarreal striker Thierno Barry set to join and Iliman Ndiaye leading the Toffees’ attack in 2024/25.",
      "Picking between Mohammed Kudus, Johan Bakayoko and Antonio Nusa was tough. Ultimately, we went for Kudus, who might have to swallow his pride to agree a move from West Ham to Everton.",
      "He’s been linked with Tottenham, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, but it’s unclear how keen those big boys really are after a season with just five goals and three assists in the Premier League. For the Toffees, though, playing under his former manager Moyes, Kudus could thrive and help the club kick off their new era at the Hill Dickinson Stadium in style.",

      "Fulham: Ivan Toney\nWillian was tempting, you know, for s**ts and giggles, but Toney to Fulham feels just realistic and ambitious enough to qualify as a ‘dream signing’.",
      "Toney might have been disappointed to end up at Saudi club Al Ahly last summer, but his bank account certainly wasn’t. That said, he could easily follow the growing trend of players ditching the Saudi Pro League after a year – or six months in Jhon Duran’s case.",
      "The obvious stumbling block is his current salary, which no Premier League club will match. But if Toney’s willing to take a modest pay cut, he could do a lot worse than Fulham…and Fulham would struggle to do much better than Toney.",

      "",
      "Liverpool: Alexander Isak\nThis transfer is unrealistic, mainly because of Newcastle United’s eye-watering asking price. But there is an asking price. If Liverpool decide Isak is worth £130m, they’ll get him. Simple as that.",
      "The Reds have already smashed their record transfer fee this summer with Florian Wirtz, and after being stingy in recent windows, they’re clearly ready to spend big now, especially after realising they’ve replaced Jurgen Klopp with an elite, title-winning head coach.",
      "Having already signed an attacking midfielder, right-back, and left-back, Liverpool’s priority is now moving on Darwin Nunez and bringing in a ready-made replacement. Interest in Isak is genuine (and terrifying) for Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, and most of all Newcastle, who are understandably reluctant to lose a player who’s scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances.",
      "But when money talks, £130m+ will be impossible to turn down.",

      "Manchester City: Gianluigi Donnarumma\nA new goalkeeper feels like the next natural upgrade for City. Ederson’s reliability has dipped, and while Donnarumma isn’t quite as comfortable with the ball at his feet, he’d be a fantastic replacement.",
      "The Italian is expected to extend his PSG contract, but as it stands, his deal runs out in 2026, and Pep Guardiola is keeping an eye on things.",
      "Ederson continues to attract interest from Saudi Arabia and fittingly made a howler in a Club World Cup win over Juventus just hours after insisting he wanted to stay. It might not be your call, fella.",

      "After scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season, Gyokeres is a wanted man. United’s interest seems doomed to failure as the striker waits for Arsenal to pull the trigger, but with his old boss Ruben Amorim now at Old Trafford, there’s just enough hope to keep the delusion alive.",
      "United are desperate for an actual goalscorer. Rasmus Hojlund clearly isn’t that. And nobody knows what Joshua Zirkzee even is.",
      "United would undoubtedly find a way to United all over Gyokeres’ output, but even if he bags half of last season’s total, he’d still be a colossal upgrade on what Amorim currently has to work with.",

      "Newcastle United: Raphinha\nSince leaving Leeds United in 2022, Raphinha has been furiously linked with a move away from Barcelona. Arsenal and Chelsea have been mentioned plenty, but Newcastle are very much in the picture. As are Manchester United; but only for clicks.",
      "Raphinha has been in Ballon d’Or form for Barca but won’t be thrilled watching his bosses chase Nico Williams and Liverpool’s Luis Diaz. Competition’s healthy, sure, but the 28-year-old will be wondering why they’re bothering after him and Lamine Yamal combined for 102 goal involvements in 2024/25.",
      "With Barca targeting a left-winger, Raphinha could be on the move. Newcastle desperately need a right-winger, and the Brazilian would be a genuinely sensational signing, even if he turns 29 this December and would cost a fortune.",

      "That would have been incomprehensible this time last year – but with Forest heading for Europe and Vlahovic struggling in Italy, it suddenly feels very realistic. The Serbian has been offered to Manchester United and former suitors Arsenal, but neither have batted an eyelid. That says plenty, especially about the former.",
      "Chris Wood has been a fantastic player for Forest, but he turns 34 in December and scored just twice in his last 11 Premier League appearances in 2024/25 as his side bottled Champions League football. Vlahovic has similar physical attributes, is eight years younger, and still has the potential to become one of Europe’s best strikers.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Gustavo Hamer\nWe’re back in familiar territory: the Burnley conundrum. Sunderland have already made two excellent, and expensive, signings in Habib Diarra and Enzo Le Fee, so splashing out again might seem excessive. But improving their attack should still be the priority.",
      "Promoted clubs need a forward capable of winning games on their own – but short of that, they could do a lot worse than Hamer. He went down with Sheffield United last year, but this would be a top-class addition.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Xavi Simons\nA game-changing forward is exactly what Spurs need, with Harry Kane long gone and Heung-min Son’s world-class ability also nowhere to be seen.",
      "Kudus has been strongly linked, and new Spurs boss Thomas Frank reportedly wants to reunite with Mbeumo, but the prospect of a world-class talent arriving from abroad is too good to ignore. A Rodrygo hijack would be sexy, but RB Leipzig attacker Simons is our man for Spurs.",
      "He’s one of the best available players around and can operate as an attacking midfielder or on either wing. We’d love to see him in the Premier League, and Spurs would benefit massively from making it happen.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Piero Hincapie\nGraham Potter wants to rebuild this West Ham squad using the Kudus funds, a year after Julen Lopetegui did the same with signings that felt ambitious at the time but quickly became questionable at best.",
      "An elite centre-back accustomed to playing in a back three would be absolutely perfect, though the Hammers also need reinforcements up front and in central midfield.",
      "Hincapie is an outstanding talent, and Bayer Leverkusen will want a huge fee. The 23-year-old Ecuadorian has been linked with plenty of big clubs, but the clout mid-table Premier League sides now carry has never been stronger. This would potentially go down as the signing of the summer.",

      "Transfermarkt value the 27-year-old at €60m (£51.5m), which is slightly less than Cunha fetched from Manchester United. Wolves have been pretty reluctant to spend big in recent years due to the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules, but could find themselves in relegation bother if their former talisman isn’t properly replaced.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
