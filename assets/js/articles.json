      "Manchester United are never far from full-blown crisis - and this season it has taken just two matches. After a summer that has seen them spend in excess of £200m, the Red Devils languish in 16th in the Premier League.",
      "They've got one point and scored just one goal and even that strike came off of Fulham striker Rodrigo Muniz. It's certainly not been the start that anyone at United will have wanted.",
      "Of course, it's still early days. Only two games of the season have been played so there's plenty of time left for Ruben Amorim to turn the ship around.",
      "But United's current form follows a worrying trend under the Portuguese coach, having won just seven Premier League games since his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "It's been a poor start to the season for United, there's no getting around it. But there would be no reason to sack Amorim quite yet.",
      "His new signings are still getting bedded in and the transfer window remains open. And let's be fair to the Red Devils, they've not had the easiest starts to the season.",
      "They gave title contenders Arsenal a real run for their money - and could have claimed at least a point - while Fulham look an outside bet for a European spot so a draw away at Craven Cottage is not the end of the world. You also have to remember simply how bad United were last season.",
      "Amorim will not fix all of those issues overnight. He needs time. And that's exactly what he should be given by United chiefs. Let him get to at least November and then you can re-evaluate. If United are still struggling to string wins together then by all means pull the trigger but to even think of sacking him any time soon would be nonsensical.",
      "The fact that we’re talking about the future of a manager after two games of a new season tells you all you need to know about the extent to which Manchester United’s struggles get everyone talking. This isn’t anything like Graham Potter’s situation, with the West Ham boss under pressure after two games, two defeats and eight goals conceded - and even that has been deemed too early by some.",
      "United have lost narrowly to a title contender and drawn an away game which they might have won in other circumstances. The word crisis is only being thrown around because the bar for that term is lower for the 13-time Premier League winners than for any other club in this country.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked by United because things were patently getting worse, and there was a case for getting rid in May 2024. Last season’s Europa League run showed Amorim has found a path to improvement, and to throw that all away should take a lot more justification than what we have seen so far this term.",
      "United should certainly give Amorim more time, but the signs look ominous. In their next handful of fixtures they face a trip to Manchester City and a home clash against Chelsea and you do wonder how things are going to get better.",
      "The next games against Grimsby and Burnley have to be two easy wins. Anything less and there will be some serious feelings of unease inside the fanbase - and the board. Every manager needs time to implement his strategy and new signings need to gel. But you do look at his 3-4-3 system and wonder if it's the best fit for the players he's got. We're yet to see Mbeumo and Cunha being the dangerous attackers they were tipped to be at Old Trafford, while the midfield situation looks like a real issue.",
      "The facts don't lie. Amorim has won only seven times from 29 Premier League games. He's drawn seven and lost 15. It's a results business and if things are still looking bleak by October or November, United might have to just accept this isn't going to work out.",
      "With a full pre-season behind him, Ruben Amorim would have hoped for a faster start but there is no need to panic. Under Erik ten Hag, United actually lost their first two Premier League games of the 2022-23 season and went on to finish third, albeit a fair distance behind winners Manchester City and runners-up Arsenal.",
      "There have been promising spells during the defeat at home to the Gunners and the draw at Fulham and a tally of 32 attempts on goal suggests this is a team that will create more chances than it did last season.",
      "Converting more of those chances is clearly the main issue for Amorim to sort and not starting with Benjamin Sesko has been a bit of a head-scratcher, even if there are doubts about his match fitness.",
      "But a front three of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo will score plenty of goals when they get to know each other well. Sure, the opening couple of matches has shown there is still a host of problems that Amorim needs to solve but those problems were so deep-rooted that he will need a lot more time to re-establish United as a serious Premier League force.",
      "You'd have thought that the positive thing about appointing a manager who is wedded to one system and one system only would be that over time that system would become fine-tuned, and the players would almost know exactly where their team-mates are without a second thought.",
      "That might end up being the case for Ruben Amorim, but given the changes in United's attack this summer things have almost gone back to square one as new players learn the way, the only way, the manager wants them to play.",
      "Of those new players Matheus Cunha looks lively but he isn't prolific, Benjamin Sesko will take a while to get up to speed and I have my doubts that Bryan Mbeumo was the right addition to play in this formation as a right sided No.10.",
      "All of which means United are back at a point where results are in danger of getting away from them, just as they did for most of last season.",
      "Amorim's job shouldn't be under immediate pressure now, but things can quickly get out of control. Burnley at home on Saturday is huge for him, with Manchester City and Chelsea to come after the international break.",
      "Manchester United have to hold their nerve. They cannot press the panic button because this season has got the potential to be a game-changer for the club.",
      "The front line looks so exciting with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. But in spending £206m on forwards, they have neglected other key areas: namely the keeper and a holding midfielder.",
      "But if they can do a deal for a keeper and get a better balance in midfield, I am still convinced they can have a decent season under Ruben Amorim.",
      "They better had - I’ve tipped them for top four! That is all based on that forward line because that front three is so exciting and is packed with goals.",
      "United have to improve elsewhere but they were never going to solve all their problems in one transfer window. And they still can’t and won’t.",
      "But we have seen enough, change and panic at Old Trafford to remind everyone they cannot do it again. They have to try and find a couple of solutions this week but either way this will be a better season for United despite the early bumps in the road.",
      "One point from two games isn't the rip-roaring start that Manchester United or their fans would have been seeking this season but it shouldn't be all doom and gloom. They were genuinely impressive - and unfortunate - in defeat against Arsenal and looked so much better going forward in patches against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "There's no getting away from the fact that Ruben Amorim's record in the Premier League has been poor since his arrival last November, but United have just committed more than £200million on a new-look attack. It would be insanity to hit the panic button anytime soon, particularly as other problem areas - namely the goalkeeper situation and midfield - are not issues of Amorim's making.",
      "The cold hard truth is that there is no magic fix for United after recording their worst-ever Premier League finish last season. There could be more pain before they turn a corner and Amorim's refusal to deviate from his favoured formation has split opinions.",
      "But he deserves a fair crack at turning things around that will take far long than just two transfer windows. I think there have been enough glimpses of promise in United's opening games to suggest that better times are coming.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has given a three-word reason for Benjamin Sesko’s early Manchester United struggles amid scathing criticism from Gary Neville. The £74million signing from RB Leipzig has come off the bench in United’s two Premier League games so far but made little impact, with Neville saying “he's nowhere near in terms of fitness.”",
      "Sesko is likely to make his first start for the club in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup tie at League Two Grimsby Town, where he will be hoping to top up his match sharpness and open his account for the club.",
      "Head coach Amorim has naturally jumped to Sesko’s defence. Speaking after the 1-1 draw at Fulham, where the 22-year-old replaced Casemiro early in the second half as part of a tactical switch, Amorim said: “He needs time.”",
      "The head coach added: “It's not easy to come off the bench when the game is really fast. He is learning the game is faster than the Bundesliga but he had some good connections with his team-mates.”",
      "“Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him. Last week, I was saying, 'Look, let's just get him straight in.’ He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.",
      "\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football. What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "“The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.”",
      "Asked why he kept Sesko on the bench for the second straight game, Amorim explained: “We tried to imagine what is going to happen during the game.",
      "“Our team needs to be consistent in the way that we control the game and we need to have options to play a different game on the bench. Sesko has had two weeks for us, he is trying to understand everything. We need to wait a little bit to help the player. We just want to win the game and try to help all of our players.”",

      "As the summer transfer window races towards its September 1 deadline, the next few days could be crucial for Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Manchester United. Both wingers are at the centre of a complex web of negotiations, valuations and rival club strategies, with Chelsea playing a key role in how the saga plays out.",
      "The plot thickened when United turned down a bold proposal from Chelsea: a swap deal involving Garnacho and 19-year-old winger Tyrique George. For Garnacho, who has fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim, the move would have offered a new beginning at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Once touted as the next star of United's attack, Garnacho has become disenchanted with life under Amorim, who has shown little inclination to reselect the 21-year-old since their relationship soured. United, however, are not prepared to let him go on the cheap.",
      "They initially priced him at around £70m, while Chelsea have been pushing for a significantly lower fee of nearer to £30m, citing his strained relationship with Amorim as justification for a discount.",
      "United, though, have made their stance clear: if Chelsea were happy to shell out £55m for Jamie Gittens earlier this summer, then Garnacho - who has more Premier League experience - should command at least a similar price.",
      "This disagreement has brought talks to a standstill, with Chelsea reluctant to part with cash until they've finalised several key departures. While Garnacho has other suitors, he's got his sights set on Chelsea.",
      "For the Blues, Garnacho is just one piece of a larger puzzle. Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, and Tyrique George are all expected to leave before the transfer window slams shut, but their exits are still in the works.",
      "Whether Chelsea can generate funds and free up squad space could ultimately determine if either Garnacho or RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons - who has already agreed personal terms - end up in West London.",
      "Nkunku's situation is perhaps the most complex. Injuries have hampered him since his move to Chelsea, but his technical prowess continues to draw attention. Bayern Munich are interested, though they favour a loan deal, while Chelsea are adamant about a permanent sale.",
      "Aston Villa have also thrown their hat into the ring, with boss Unai Emery eager to inject some attacking diversity into his squad. A return to RB Leipzig is also a possibility, with Chelsea reportedly offering the Bundesliga side the chance to re-sign their former star as part of their bid to secure Simons.",
      "Jackson's future at Chelsea is also hanging in the balance. Despite a reasonably impressive goal record in England, the Senegalese forward has found himself pushed down the attacking pecking order following the arrival of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "Both Aston Villa and Newcastle are interested in Jackson, who is keen on a reunion with Emery, his former boss at Villarreal. However, Chelsea's hefty £70m price tag is proving to be a stumbling block, with potential buyers hoping for a reduction as the transfer deadline looms.",
      "Meanwhile, young talent George could be heading for an early exit from Stamford Bridge. With Pedro, Gittens, Estevao - and possibly Garnacho and Simons - joining the ranks, his chances of breaking into the first team are slimming.",
      "Initially, Chelsea intended to send George out on loan, but now a permanent move seems more likely. Roma have emerged as the favourites, eyeing him as their top winger target after missing out on Sancho.",
      "Sancho's transfer window has been fraught with disappointments and setbacks. United had reportedly struck a deal with Roma earlier this summer, but the England international turned down the Italian side's offer.",
      "This decision appears to have backfired. With Roma now focusing on George, Sancho is left scrambling for other options, while United are keen to offload the player, who spent the previous season on loan at Chelsea but failed to make a significant impact.",
      "Roma haven't completely dismissed the idea of reigniting their interest in Sancho, but their focus on George suggests that United's chances of offloading him are dwindling. Unless a late suitor comes into the picture, Sancho could find himself stuck in a rut at Old Trafford once again.",
      "Chelsea's ambitions stretch far beyond Garnacho and Simons, but the success of their plans depends on shifting players out. If deals for Nkunku, Jackson and George come to fruition, the Blues will have the funds and squad flexibility to make a strong push.",
      "If not, Garnacho might have to stay put - at least until January. It could even force Chelsea into a situation where they have to choose between Simons or Garnacho.",
      "For United, the situation is equally precarious. Garnacho remains a valuable asset that could generate a substantial fee that could be reinvested before the deadline. But their refusal to accept Chelsea's initial offer has slowed progress, leaving them at risk of being left with two disgruntled wingers and no financial uplift.",
      "As the clock ticks down, the futures of Garnacho, Sancho and several Chelsea attackers remain interconnected. The resolution of Chelsea's outgoing business may ultimately determine whether United can cash in - and whether two of their most unsettled players finally find fresh starts elsewhere.",
      "What transpires in the coming days could reshape squads at both Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, and send ripples across the European market.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has expressed concern over new signing Benjamin Sesko and admitted \"I don't know what he is\" after two substitute appearances.",
      "United bought Sesko from Red Bull Leipzig for £72million this summer but the Slovenian international is yet to make his first start under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He played the final 25 minutes of their 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on the opening day and was sent on for 37 minutes in the 1-1 draw at Fulham on Sunday, failing to make an impact in either game.",
      "Amorim has been desperate for a reliable new striker who can guarantee his United side a steady supply of goals but in both games so far he has used Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount in attack. None of them are out-and-out forwards.",
      "Former United defender Ferdinand said he couldn't understand why Sesko wasn't receiving the ball more to help him show off his true ability, saying it was hindering his progress at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Get the ball into him,\" he told his Rio Ferdinand Presents show on YouTube. \"He isn’t going to be an easy day’s work. Get it into him and make them defend. But we are playing it around him. Sometimes it’s like really basic, fundamental things.",
      "\"Get it into someone who can cause problems but we go against that. So that was my main concern, you are not getting to see who he is.\"",
      "Ferdinand said it would be better to get Sesko on the ball even if he makes mistakes because it was difficult to see what kind of player United have signed.",
      "\"I would rather you play it into him and he look rubbish so we know what we’ve got because, right now, I don’t know what he is or what he’s doing. I’m not pointing the finger but you have got to help your team-mates find their feet in the team.\"",
      "Sesko - who scored 21 goals last season - was tipped to replace Rasmus Hojlund, who has suffered some poor form since his own big-money move to United in 2023. Sesko will hope to get more minutes in the coming games against Grimsby and Burnley.",
      "Ferdinand was also critical of United's performance in general against Fulham, claiming Amorim's side failed to make their dominance count and accused his old team of \"letting them off the hook\".",
      "He added: \"I would have thought every Fulham fan, player and member of staff would have been going, 'What’s happening here? This isn’t the Manchester United we were expecting to see'.",
      "\"At those moments there, the best teams punish the weak. They put their foot on their throat and say, “Stay there”, and that’s what we didn’t do. We let them off the hook.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo could consider leaving Manchester United this summer after falling down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim. Mainoo, a graduate of the Red Devils academy, has seen his options limited this season.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder has twice been named on the bench this season but has not played a single minute. And it now appears that a lack of minutes could force the youngster to look elsewhere.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Mainoo would consider quitting Old Trafford should United receive an acceptable offer for his services. Chelsea have previously been linked with a swoop, while the midfielder himself is reportedly open to the prospect of moving abroad.",
      "Mainoo has just under two years remaining on his contract with United. It was previously thought that Red Devils chiefs were keen on tying him down to a new contract but there remains a big gap in salary expectations.",
      "Mainoo was reportedly looking for around £150,000 per week to sign a new deal, an amount that is unfeasible for United at the current time. Should Mainoo move on then any fee that the club receives would be considered as pure profit in their PSR calculations for the forthcoming financial year.",
      "Asked why he left Mainoo on the bench against Fulham, United boss Amorim revealed that the youngster was now competing with captain Bruno Fernandes. He said: \"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno.",
      "“And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. [Sometimes] he’s going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he’s fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "Meanwhile, United icon Gary Neville has not ruled out the prospect of Mainoo falling even further down the pecking order in the immediate future. “In central midfield, they have to do a piece of business now,” he said on the Gary Neville podcast.",
      "“I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it is quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim isn’t having him. He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and he then brings Ugarte on in front of him. That tells you he is almost fourth choice really.",
      "“That means they are going to have to get something sorted because it is going to be a problem. The two in there really do get exposed when the front three are a little bit higher and the back five sometimes get pushed back a bit, those acres of space seem to open up a bit.",
      "“I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he is going to have to sort it out. I think Man United will have to get a goalkeeper and look at getting a central midfield player.”",

      "United ended last season in 15th place in the Premier League and are currently in 16th place after starting the new campaign with a defeat at home to Arsenal and a draw at Fulham.",
      "Wing-back Dorgu, who joined United in January, started both games and admitted there is no hiding place for Ruben Amorim and his players after last season's humiliating showing.",
      "“Everyone has a point to prove this season,” said Dorgu. “We need to get back to Europe, so I feel like if we are as a group, we are ready to perform on the pitch.",
      "“We need to stick together, be happy, positive, and try to do what the coach asks. We definitely understand more. We understand what he [Amorim] wants us to do and obviously, now we're not in Europe, we have more training.",
      "“So he has more time for us to really understand his ideas and stuff. Obviously we want to go back to playing many games. Now we have the time to do it and then we need to perform this season.”",
      "One of the positives from Sunday's 1-1 draw at Fulham was the performance of £62.5million summer signing Matheus Cunha, who twice came close to opening his United account.",
      "Forward Cunha hit a post and had a goalbound effort saved by Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno, with Dorgu revealing the Brazil forward has settled in quickly at United.",
      "“Cunha is a really, like, public guy, like he talks a lot and he's really funny,” said Dorgu. “He's trying to engage with everyone, so it's easier to talk with him because he has a lot of energy.",

      "“Obviously, there are other players as well. It's not only on the left side, we need to attack on both sides. It helps getting Cunha in, because he's really good at what he's doing and he's going to help the team.”",

      "As we enter the final week of the summer transfer window, there are a few big deals yet to be concluded. Some loose ends are being tied up, though, with Eberechi Eze the latest player to get his move after joining Arsenal.",
      "We've now had two weeks of Premier League action, leaving teams with a better idea of what they might need. Indeed, some clubs who might have felt happy with their business in early August are now realising more work could be necessary.",
      "Reigning champions Liverpool cruised to the title last term with very little in the way of outlay, but things have changed for them this term. They have broken the British transfer record to sign Florian Wirtz, and they might not be done.",
      "At the other end of the table, newly promoted Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland have been busy to varying degrees and all three have started the campaign with a home win and an away loss. James Justin is poised to be the latest in a long line of new additions for the promoted sides, leaving Leicester for Leeds.",
      "As Newcastle prepare to welcome Liverpool on Monday night, plenty of the talk will be about Alexander Isak. The striker maintains his career on Tyneside is over, though it'll take a league record bid for Liverpool to bring him to Anfield.",
      "\"What I can tell you is not a lot. And if someone else is going to ask that question, it is going to be the same answer,\" Slot told reporters on Thursday.",
      "\"As I have said so many times and it has been shown, I could even impact the game on Friday with the players we had on the bench. It would be much nicer to talk about the players that we have. I understand why you have to ask the question.\"",
      "Chelsea's discussions over an Alejandro Garnacho move appear to have been productive, at least when it comes to getting the player on side. It's a different story as far as the fee is concerned, though.",
      "The Blues are believed to value the winger at around £25million. United still want more, though - even if the £70m being mentioned back in January would be a tall order.",
      "Last year, Chelsea left it until the very last minute to sign Jadon Sancho on loan from United. This could be another one which goes right to the wire.",
      "Earlier in the window, it was suggested that Sancho had turned down Roma. Now, though, Giallorossi boss Gian Piero Gasperini has denied that is the case.",
      "Bayern Munich have also been linked with the winger, though reports in Germany suggest that might not be a goer. Bayern have lost Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman this summer, but it appears they may go after different targets to Sancho.",
      "After sitting out Manchester United's pre-season tour, Sancho doesn't appear to have an Old Trafford future. The question now concerns where he might end up.",
      "With Manchester United closing in on Senne Lammens, it appears Donnarumma won't be off to Old Trafford this summer. However, the Italian could yet move to the Premier League.",
      "Manchester City have already signed one keeper this summer, with James Trafford returning to the club. He had a nervy game against Spurs on Saturday, costing his term a goal, but feels like one for the present and future.",
      "That said, City could sell two keepers in the coming week, and that would leave them in need of another new face. If Ederson and Stefan Ortega both leave, Donnarumma may well be battling it out with Trafford for a starting spot.",
      "AC Milan's pursuit of Rasmus Hojlund may be back on, after Victor Boniface failed a medical over a San Siro move. However, they're not the only Serie A side in the mix.",
      "Napoli have money to spend after cashing in on Victor Osimhen over the summer. Kevin De Bruyne has already joined on a free, and now it's time to find someone for the Belgian to feed.",
      "According to reports in Italy, former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has been attempting to talk Hojlund into a move to Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. This will certainly be one to keep an eye on.",
      "Unlike some of the other players on this list, Simons has continued to play for his club despite mounting speculation over his future. The Dutch international played in RB Leipzig's opening day defeat to Bayern Munich, and also got an outing in the cup.",
      "Chelsea have had a busy summer already, with Estevao and Jamie Gittens both arriving to bolster the attack. However, they might not be done, with sales - including the imminent exit of Carney Chukwuemeka - helping raise funds.",
      "Another player who could yet leave Stamford Bridge this summer si Nicolas Jackson. The Senegal star is behind Liam Delap and Joao Pedro in the pecking order, and Newcastle might be able to offer him a route out.",
      "We finish back with Liverpool. The Reds were left wanting at the back against Bournemouth in their league opener, and Giovanni Leoni - who signed on the afternoon of that game - might not be the only centre-back to join this month.",
      "Crystal Palace captain Guehi has been a long-time target for the Reds, and is now in the final year of his contract in South London. Liverpool's initial offers fell short of Palace's valuation, but it remains to be seen whether that value will be reduced to ensure he doesn't run down his contract and leave for nothing last summer.",
      "In the meantime, Guehi has continued to skipper the club. He hasn't missed a minute yet this season, playing both league games and helping Oliver Glasner's side claim a 1-0 first leg win in their Conference League play-off against Fredrikstad.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Lineker slammed the penalty decision in the draw between Manchester United and Fulham on Sunday, claiming he couldn't tell which team was getting the spot-kick. The Red Devils were awarded a penalty in the first-half of the visit to Craven Cottage, after it was determined that Calvin Bassey had fouled Mason Mount in the goalmouth during a corner.",
      "However, the typically reliable Bruno Fernandes skied his 12-yard striker over the bar, with no goals coming until the second half of the game. Leny Yoro looked to have opened the scoring in the 58th minute with a glancing header - but this was later ruled a Rodrigo Muniz own goal.",
      "Seconds after coming on, Emile Smith Rowe equalised in the 73rd minute, and while both teams pushed for that all-important winner, it finished 1-1 and United grabbed their first point of the season. However, Lineker wasn't best pleased with his trip to west London, as he shared his confusion during the VAR decision.",
      "While discussing United's struggles on the Rest is Football podcast, the ex-Tottenham Hotspur star said: \"They got a penalty, which my goodness, what a bizarre experience. You know, going to the game, we're watching the game, there's a corner and then the ball's cleared, the balls goes up to the other end of the pitch and Fulham's on the attack.",
      "\"Then suddenly the ref stops and you're thinking, 'What's going on here?' Now, I know the experience is probably different at home, but if you're in the ground, Oh my. Then you look at, you see a sign saying VAR penalty check. And I was honestly sitting there and I said 'For which team, who to?'",
      "\"I didn't even know whether it was that end or that end, and you had no idea what was going on. I mean, it's such an awful experience for fans.\"",
      "Lineker added: \"I mean, I know now they're telling you why they changed their decision, which he ultimately did. I couldn't see from how far we were away, so I had no idea whether it should have been overturned.",
      "\"But Bruno missed it anyway, blazed it over the bar. But they've got to actually tell you what's going on for the fans in the ground to hear it. There's a penalty check because so and so, we think he might have pushed so and so, but we're checking all the angles.\"",
      "When co-host Alan Shearer questioned Lineker's thoughts on the penalty decision itself, the popular pundit agreed that it was the right decision to award it. The 64-year-old went on to give Ruben Amorim's side some praise for their improvement on the previous campaign, despite United not winning a game yet in the 2025/26 season.",
      "He added: \"United started really well, I thought, 'Oh, hello,' because last week I thought they showed something, even though they lost, and the first 15 to 20 minutes you thought, 'Mm, okay'. Cunha was electric, went really close [with] a brilliant effort, hit the post.",
      "\"Another one blazed over the bar, he had a one on one with the keeper where he probably should've scored but a good save from Leno and you thought, 'Well, there's something here.'\"",
      "Reflecting on the missed opportunity, manager Amorim admitted that while he doesn't feel the \"urgency\" that fans may be dealing with, he believes the team has to manage the game better once they are ahead.",
      "Speaking to MUTV post-match, the Portuguese boss said: \"In this moment, we need to think about the performance. Of course I’m not crazy, I know what the feeling is of the players that play in the team that they have to win every match.",
      "\"But I felt that in the past, I don’t feel a lack of urgency in this moment. What I felt is that we missed the penalty, we missed some chances and then we score and I have the feeling that now we have to defend this goal.",
      "\"That is not a lack of urgency, it may be urgency in the opposite side. We just need to focus on our movement and the way we have to play the game.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"It’s normal [that Fulham are dangerous from corners]. I think we tried to press high and, after one or two times, we need to understand that sometimes we need to manage the game, to wait for the opponent. That was the option of Fulham and sometimes we push the ball to the side too soon.",
      "\"It was quite easy for the opponent to mark us and we wanted to press all of the time. We wanted to do that but sometimes we have to be better in that moment, understand the game, try to drop a little bit and start the pressure, so they had more space than us when they were attacking.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Fulham boss Marco Silva was much more critical of the refereeing decisions throughout the game, particularly at United's goal - where he felt it should have been disallowed for a foul.",
      "Addressing the media post-match, Silva said: \"I would like to explain everything about the VAR decisions this afternoon, but I can't. I can't because they were different in many different ways. They were unbelievable seeing two fouls at the same time, Shaw on Rodrigo and Bassey on Mount at the same time, both fouls, and they saw that Bassey foul was half of a half second before the Shaw foul on Muniz.",
      "\"Then the second one [the United goal]. I think what I saw is what everyone saw in the stadium; everyone around the world saw it. Two players were isolated at a corner and one player pushed the other to head the ball. If you go by the rules you know what is going to happen.",
      "\"I would like those types of decisions to always be the same. Simple as that.\"",
      "United will travel to League Two side Grimsby Town next in the second round of the Carabao Cup, before a visit from newly-promoted Burnley on August 30. Silva's side will face Bristol City next in the cup, before a tricky test at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "The £206m summer spending spree might just have turned Manchester United’s best player into a big problem.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was United’s saviour last season and the last player they needed to fix because he delivered goals, assists and made the whole team tick. But now, Fernandes looks lost in United’s new-look line-up as the game passes him by and his effectiveness has waned in Ruben Amorim’s team.",
      "United have bought themselves a superstar front three with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. They have invested heavily and gone all-out attack. There are exciting signs with Cunha already embracing the United No. 10 shirt and looking like an exciting maverick. Mbeumo has talent, skill and vision while Sesko cost £73m and, when he is finally fit to start, has got so many qualities as a classic No. 9.",
      "But there can be no doubt that United’s cavalier approach on the pitch and in the transfer market is having such an effect on their main man and captain.",
      "Fernandes will clearly be expected to slot back into a deeper midfield role and, in Sunday’s draw at Fulham, he was expected to do all the running too because Casemiro’s legs cannot carry him as far as they used to.",
      "Even worse, Casemiro always looks like he is a red card waiting to happen as he was hooked in the second half because he was on a booking.",
      "His replacement, Manuel Ugarte, clearly has not done enough to convince United boss Amorim that he is the answer either and they just do not have that quality in midfield.",
      "Clearly, all of Fernandes’ failings were brought into sharper focus by the fact that he sent a penalty sailing over the bar and a few fingers have been pointed at the midfield for not tracking runs on Emile Smith Rowe’s equaliser.",
      "United have a problem of their own making and to make it out of last season’s best player is, well, just typical United. Now the squad looks unbalanced - and they only have a week to fix it. They are crying out for a midfield general who arguably could make it work with Fernandes in a deeper role if that is what is needed.",
      "But, like with many things, United went for broke in attack and then neglected other key but obvious areas like in midfield and with the keeper.",
      "It is baffling as to why United did not go for someone like Joao Palhinha who joined Tottenham because he was surplus to requirements at Bayern Munich. Palhinha is on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent £26m switch. When United have spent all their dough up front, that would have been just perfect.",
      "They are also scrambling around for a new keeper because all of their current options are not good enough.",
      "At least they have fixed their forward line and made the supporters dream. When all three are fit and ready to start together, they will take some stopping.",
      "But it will have to be a case of them scoring one more than the opposition because, at this rate, the midfield will not offer the defence any protection and the keeper already looks exposed. Meanwhile, they are not getting the best out of their main man in Fernandes.",

      "Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville maintained the continued struggles of goalkeeper Altay Bayindir should worry Ruben Amorim's side. Bayindir was at fault for Arsenal's winner on the opening weekend of the season and had another nervy moment against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "Turkish international Bayindir flapped at a corner again at Craven Cottage. On this occasion, striker Rodrigo Muniz was unable to take advantage, but that didn't stop Neville from worrying.",
      "The scores were level at the time of the nervy moment for Bayindir, after Bruno Fernandes skied a penalty for United. The game ended all-square, with Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser cancelling out a Muniz own goal.",
      "United sit 16th in the table with just one point from their two matches. Last season's first-choice keeper Andre Onana was back on the bench after missing out entirely against Arsenal, but a new number one could yet arrive in the next seven days.",
      "Italy and Paris Saint-Germain keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma had emerged as a surprise target, only for Manchester City to join the chase for the Champions League winner. Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens could end up being United's man, and the young Belgian sat out his team's Sunday afternoon win.",
      "Lammens' form for Antwerp last season earned him a first senior Belgium call-up in March, but he was absent for the match against Mechelen over the weekend. Antwerp ended the game with 10 men after former Leicester midfielder Dennis Praet was sent off, but they still won 2-1 to continue their unbeaten start to the season.",
      "\"I am focused on our goalkeepers,\" United boss Ruben Amorim told Match of the Day after his team's draw in West London. \"Like every manager I look at the amount of training, what I see in pre-season, in the games and try to decide who is the best goalkeeper to use in a game and I am going to continue to do that.\"",
      "\"You can look at it both sides,\" he said when asked about Bayindir being targeted at corners. \"We have a goal with a goal kick, we have two situations where we could manage to score, a penalty and the corner kick. In every game in the Premier League, you will always have situations in the corners.\"",

And with Benjamin Sesko arriving for big money earlier in the transfer window, Hojlund has fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim.",

      "\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.\"",
      "He continued: \"It's hard. Sometimes, when you feel the contact early, you go down and the ref can give you a foul. When you're in the game and the ball's there to be one, sometimes you're tyring to get to the ball as quickly as possible and you've got to get the man out the way.",
      "\"There's a fine line between giving a foul away and getting away with it. On another day, maybe the ref doesn't look at it. We as players just have to try to be clever.",
      "\"I tried to communicate with the ref because I knew the block was coming. I told him, on every corner, 'watch the blocks, watch the blocks', but he made his decision. It's something to learn, just be a bit more streetwise and smart with it.\"",
      "United eventually got their noses in front at Craven Cottage when Leny Yoro's effort was deflected in off Fulham striker Rodrigo Muniz. The lead didn't last long, though, with Emile Smith Rowe ensuring the spoils were shared.",
      "\"As a penalty-taker, you have your own routines, your own things that you do,\" Fernandes adde.d \"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment, but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty. I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",

      "Manchester United have spent big so far this summer as they look to bounce back from last season's disappointing campaign, which saw the Red Devils finish 15th in the Premier League and fail to qualify for the Champions League after losing the Europa League final.",
      "United have spent more than £200million to bring in Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon, while Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy and Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof have been released.",
      "More incomings and outgoings are expected before the transfer window slams shut, with manager Ruben Amorim keen to strengthen his squad in several positions while also offloading a number of fringe players.",
      "Bruno Fernandes turned down the chance to join Al-Hilal earlier this summer, but fellow Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad are now hoping to sign the midfielder.",
      "According to a report from the Sun, a 'positive' meeting has already taken place between the two camps and Fernandes is said to be demanding a contract worth £33m-a-year. Speaking earlier this summer, Fernandes admitted he would be willing to leave if United wanted to sell.",
      "\"I have always been honest,\" he said. \"I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it.",
      "\"But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this.\"",
      "Sancho is part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' after spending last season out on loan at Chelsea, while Hojlund's future was plunged into doubt after Manchester United signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Senne Lammens appears to be edging closer to joining Manchester United after he was left out of the squad by Royal Antwerp for their 2-1 win over Mechelen on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim is keen to bring in Lammens to provide more competition for Andre Onana, who has come in for criticism since signing for United after making a series of errors. And the deal looks to be close after Antwerp did not pick him against Mechelen, with Yannick Thoelen handed his first start of the season and new signing Taishi Brandon Nozawa on the bench.",

      "Ruben Amorim's decision to start Benjamin Sesko on the bench for Manchester United's trip to Fulham has been slammed by Andy Gray, who says he is \"flabbergasted\" that the striker isn't starting games.",
      "United headed into the summer transfer window desperate for a new No 9 after both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee struggled for goals last season and paid big money to bring Sesko to Old Trafford. The Slovenia international, 22, has been eased into life in the Premier League, though, and came off the bench against Arsenal last week and in United's 1-1 draw with Fulham on Sunday.",
      "Mason Mount started the game in attack alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. But while Cunha and Mbeumo have been thrust straight into the team after big money moves of their own, Amorim is taking a different approach with Sesko - and Gray simply doesn't get why.",
      "\"I don’t get it. I am flabbergasted,\" he told beIN SPORTS. \"I moved to clubs for big money during my career and trust me, I didn’t need three or four weeks to understand the team.",
      "\"Sesko is an international footballer, played in the Bundesliga, he cost more than £70m… are you telling me he can’t go into that Manchester United team as a centre forward and play there? Come on! I must have missed something, seriously.",
      "\"If you’re a United fan, you want Sesko up there with Mbeumo and Cunha. He’s had a pre-season in Germany, he’s fit and ready to go. I’m staggered, I don’t get it.\"",
      "Owen Hargreaves, meanwhile, fears that signing Sesko hasn't necessarily solved United's issues up front. The former Manchester United midfielder also thinks the goalkeeper position could become an issue after Altay Bayindir started the Fulham game ahead of Andre Onana, who was left out of the squad that lost to Arsenal last weekend.",
      "\"I love Mbeumo, I love Cunha, Bruno had a bad game today, but my biggest worry is the goalkeeper situation isn’t addressed and the striker situation isn’t addressed,\" Hargreaves told Premier League Productions.",
      "\"I have never seen a team win without top players in those two positions. Maybe they are going to address that in the next week. But goalkeeper, striker, he has to address.",
      "\"The two in behind in Mbeumo and Cunha are fantastic but the one at the top and at the back, they need to address as soon as possible. You look at the fixtures, Burnley at home you expect to win but [Manchester] City and Chelsea are really difficult.\"",

      "“It was a tough match, and when we scored the goal we forgot about maintaining the way we play and tried to maintain the result. We want to win so bad,” said United boss Amorim.",
      "“After the goals we were just thinking about maintaining the advantage and we cannot do that. We have to grow up a lot as a team. The feeling is there. We are going to score goals because we are creating chances and that is the most important thing.",

The 20-year-old watched from the bench as Fernandes blasted a first-half penalty over the crossbar, before Fulham substitute Emile Smith-Rowe equalised after Rodrigo Muniz's unfortunate own goal gave United the lead.",
      "Mainoo was also an unused substitute in the Red Devils' 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal, where Amorim's attackers were similarly gun-shy. However, Amorim, who is reluctant to budge from his favourite 3-4-3 formation, insists the United academy graduate is competing with Fernandes for a place in the starting XI.",

      "We are not in his facetious form at his debriefs. Optimism is supposed to be rife in August. Only Amorim has been mentioned in the same breath as Paul Hart and Neil Warnock.",
      "Problems are surfacing at Manchester United and they are of their own making. Amorim is continuing to play their third-best goalkeeper, the midfield is brazenly targeted, the supporters in the Putney End hollered, “attack, attack, attack” in the 83rd minute and two centre backs emerged four minutes later.",
      "That will be down to managing workloads. At 1-1, Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw could have soldiered on for another ten minutes before a recovery day in the jacuzzi at Carrington.",
      "Four of the five United substitutes who came on are defensive players. Such an approach, when the team has won seven of the manager’s 29 Premier League games in charge, was unedifying.",
      "Those wins are scattered like a trail that has run out of bread crumbs: two in December, two in January, one in February, one in March and one in May. Three of the victories were against teams now in the Championship.",
      "Amorim dismissed the suggestion that United’s sudden change of plan midway through pre-season has affected their form. Since he removed Rasmus Hojlund from the starting XI and switched to a strikerless side against Everton in Atlanta, none of United's starters have scored from open play in four games.",
      "Including pre-season, United’s form with and without Hojlund reads:",
      "It was at Fulham last season that Amorim admitted he would rather have his goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, on the bench than Marcus Rashford. Vital has now replaced Hojlund. The Denmark international was not in west London on Sunday and is unlikely to get a kick for United again.",
      "The intention to sell Hojlund is understandable. He is not good enough to lead the line for United, he tallied three goals in his last 35 appearances for the club and they have replaced him.",
      "But Amorim has cut off his nose to spite his face with a striker who has had one cameo since he bullishly told journalists in Chicago that he was intent on staying. United were crying out for a striker, bought one for £73.62million, and have not started him.",
      "Watching Benjamin Sesko, you can see why. “I think he needs time,” Amorim admitted. “It’s not easy. Sometimes you are on the bench and go to the game and the game is really fast, he’s understanding that the game is even faster than the Bundesliga.",
      "“But he is fighting, he had some good connections with teammates, I felt that when he was on the pitch we were not in our best moment and that can change the way you see a player.”",
      "All the more reason to play a No.9. United could have maximised Hojlund, scorer of two goals on his last start against Bournemouth in Chicago, until Sesko was up to speed. Hojlund might have been more sellable and valuable, too.",
      "Instead, Matheus Cunha has had to double as a centre forward when he earned his move on his playmaking prowess. He ought to have converted his chance from Altay Bayindir’s punt, a scenario identical to Cunha's majestic goal at the same end for Wolves last season.",
      "Swapping the old gold for the red of United puts a player in a different mindset. Even one as classy as Cunha. He has been as confident and swashbuckling as he was for Wolves, only when he faultlessly controlled the ball he could not place it beyond Bernd Leno’s reach.",
      "United are in paradoxical form. Their attacking trident has created good chances and they are more fluid than rigid. Mason Mount had one of his most accomplished hours in a United shirt at Fulham. Yet they failed to get on the scoresheet and United’s periods of play with Sesko, an actual striker, have been unproductive.",
      "Mount is the last United player to score from open play, against Everton three weeks ago. Since United touched down back on these shores, their two goals, against Fiorentina in a friendly and at Fulham, have been own goals.",
      "“I think it’s a normal thing and when you reach this level,” Amorim said about the no-striker strategy. “Cunha can play as a striker and as a 10 at his former club.",
      "“I felt that during these last games with Mason Mount sometimes we are more robust in the way we play. So we are going to change according to the result and the opponent and try to win games.”",
      "Amorim’s stubbornness is the same at the other end. Retaining Bayindir was a contrarian call. He is demonstrably not United’s best goalkeeper and, though his afternoon at Fulham was devoid of a costly error, he was jittery again at corners.",
      "United need certainty in goal. Senne Lammens, the Belgian goalkeeper United are expected to sign, is not viewed as an outright No.1. So why persist playing the back-up goalie when the first-choice is fit enough to take the train to Euston?",
      "The prospect of United accommodating four goalkeepers this season is improbable. Tom Heaton is 39, has not played in two-and-a-half years and signed a new one-year contract in June. Bayindir has started in six of United’s seven games since the start of pre-season and Onana has not played since the post-season tour match in Kuala Lumpur yet is adamant he is staying.",
      "Mount dropped back into midfield nine days after Amorim mentioned him as an option to fill in there. He had to after Casemiro, on a yellow card, diced with death by sliding in late on Sander Berge. Amorim immediately summoned his first substitutes.",
      "Starting Casemiro on a weekly basis in the Premier League is an admission of defeat. This is his last season at United and they recruited a replacement last year. Manuel Ugarte, totally devoid of confidence, does not appear up to it and the interest in Carlos Baleba would suggest some at United have given up on the Uruguayan. Erik ten Hag was not sold on Ugarte and Amorim, who coached him at Sporting Lisbon, has benched him.",
      "At Craven Cottage last season, Amorim admitted he felt like he had aged ten years at United. Worry signs are forming again.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is modelling for a commercial partner and Kobbie Mainoo is recording snippets for the Chinese New Year. Luke Shaw arrives to speak with club media in another room.",
      "Three Manchester United correspondents have been invited to speak with Patrick Dorgu, who is slightly late for his engagement after spending time with young season ticket holders.",
      "United's press officer briefly speaks to Dorgu before ushering journalists into the new-look press conference room. Dorgu is about to speak for 16 minutes, touching on his desire to win the Premier League this season, his blossoming relationship with Matheus Cunha, finding his feet in Manchester after a ruthless introduction to English football and Rasmus Hojlund's future.",
      "\"I think I learned a lot,\" said Dorgu of last season. \"It was a difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season.\"",
      "United signed Dorgu from Lecce for £25million, with a potential £4.1m in add-ons, in the January transfer window, and United won just three Premier League matches after his arrival.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Dorgu was thrown into the deep end. However, he was a heavily data-driven signing and the numbers suggested he would be able to swim.",
      "Staff have noticed a difference in Dorgu in recent weeks. He is more confident, more willing to speak. He has become comfortable at Carrington, which should be reflected in his performances.",
      "And against Arsenal, he struck the post from distance, a shot he admits he would not have had the confidence to take last season.",
      "\"It's a new season and everyone did well in pre-season,\" he said. \"I'm just trying to play myself into the team more. Just give the fans what they deserve and I think everyone is trying to put United where we need to be.\"",
      "United believe Dorgu has the attributes to become a top player. \"I had interest from big teams in Italy as well, so it (United's interest) wasn’t a surprise,\" he said. \"If you're doing well, the big teams are going to look. I was surprised that they were really aggressive to get it done quickly, and I was really happy for that.\"",
      "Which big clubs in Italy were interested? \"I'm not going to say,\" he laughed.",
      "The 20-year-old was signed for Ruben Amorim's system and is first-choice at left wing-back.",
      "\"In Denmark, I was playing wing-back. Then when I moved to Lecce, I was playing left back, and then the last season before I moved to United, I was playing more as a winger,\" he said.",
      "\"It's just easier to attack as a wing back than as a full back - I feel comfortable in that role. But I could still do the job as I full back, but it's just less attacking.\"",
      "Regarding his current role, he added: \"I think just a lot of runs, like being more attacking. I could have been more attacking last season and I feel like in pre-season I've improved that a little bit. It's just to attack more [Amorim's message], get into the box, help the team create more chances.",
      "\"I like to tackle, I like to attack, I like to score goals, gain assists, so I think just to play wing back, you need to be all around, you need to be good at tackling, you need to be good at defensive work as well.\"",
      "Amorim's formation has been scrutinised, so what does Dorgu think? \"It depends what system you're playing against. You can always drop alongside the centre backs to make it a 4-3-3,\" he said.",
      "\"It's just about adapting to who you're playing against and just help each other, move for each other, and then it's not really about the system. It's more like how you're dealing with it.",
      "\"It's up to you how you want to play. If the midfielders feel like they're getting man-marked, then they can move down [towards defence], get the ball, and then play. You just need to move.",
      "\"Obviously, you're not just going to move around [anywhere]. I can't just run to the right side, but you can move in your position.\"",
      "Speaking about Amorim, Dorgu added: \"He's a really good guy, he's positive with everyone and always defending you. He always tries to help you play the game, so he knows how it is.",
      "\"We definitely understand more [what Amorim wants]. We understand what he wants us to do, and obviously, now that we're not in Europe, we have more training.",
      "\"He has more time for us to really understand his ideas. Obviously, we want to go back to playing many games. Now we have the time to do it and then we need to perform this season.\"",
      "Dorgu has grand ambitions: to win the Premier League and play at the 2026 World Cup for Denmark. When asked whether United can return to Europe, he responded: \"100 per cent, we are aiming to win the Premier League and we just need to take it game by game.\"",
      "Amorim has explained the internal target is European qualification. United are planning to win the Premier League by 2028, but Dorgu is impatient and insists it should be the aim this season.",
      "\"100 per cent. We are Manchester United, so that's always going to be our goal,\" he added.",
      "The reality is United are a world away from winning the title. The morale in the dressing room improved this summer, but the 1-1 draw against Fulham is a reminder that results must also improve.",
      "\"I think the facilities help, I think new signings have helped as well,\" Dorgu said. \"They bring a lot of good energy, quality into the group. We tried to be positive about our new season.",
      "\"Everyone has a point to prove this season. We need to get back to Europe, so I feel like if we are as a group and ready to perform on the pitch. We need to stick together, be happy, positive, and try to do what the coach asks.\"",
      "Dorgu is no longer the new face at Old Trafford with this summer seeing a trio of expensive attacking reinforcements join, including Matheus Cunha. When he arrived from Wolves he told Dorgu not to kick him, a reference to their encounter at Old Trafford last season.",
      "\"He had me once when I got a yellow card,\" recalled Dorgu. \"Besides that, he was quiet in the game. Matheus is a really public guy, like he talks a lot and he's really funny - he's trying to engage with everyone so it's easier to talk with him because he has a lot of energy.",
      "\"I feel like he's really, really good at driving with the ball, getting past players, and I feel like with my runs and what I can do will help him to do that, and get more space to play, and we just need to connect well, like me and him.",
      "\"Obviously, there other players as well. It's not only on the left side, we need to attack on both sides. It helps getting Cunha in because he's really good at what he's doing and he's going to help the team.\"",
      "Although Dorgu admitted he \"gets on\" with everyone in the dressing room, he nominated Hojlund as his closest friend. \"Probably Ras because he's Danish and I know him from when I was younger,\" he said. \"I played against him when I was at Nordsjælland and he was at Copenhagen.\"",
      "Hojlund has been left of the squad for succesive games and is expected to leave before the transfer deadline. \"Obviously, we don't know if he's leaving. He is training with us and he's part of the team,\" said Dorgu.",
      "\"You need to talk to the coach about why he was not in the squad. But if he ended up leaving, that's part of the game, everyone is not secure to be here. Obviously I would still see him with the national team.\"",
      "Dorgu looked in high spirits in the photographs of himself playing football with 13 young season ticket holders on the morning of the interview. The children were selected to take part in a skills workshop with Manchester United Foundation coaches and were treated to Dorgu's presence.",
      "United say the aim of such fan engagement activities is to provide memorable experiences for their most loyal supporters, to increase understanding between fans and players of each others’ perspectives, and, ultimately, to strengthen the bond between the fans and the team.",
      "Dorgu wants to further strentghen the bond with matchgoing fans by winning games again.",

      "Ruben Amorim has stressed that new Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko \"needs time\".",
      "United paid just under £74million to sign Sesko and the 22-year-old has started both of their Premier League matches against Arsenal and Fulham on the bench.",
      "Sesko only played 45 minutes in pre-season for RB Leipzig before he joined United just over two weeks ago and Amorim has opted for a strikerless side amid United's efforts to sell Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Slovenia international Sesko came on 13 minutes earlier at Craven Cottage, with the game goalless, than he did on his debut a week earlier.",
      "\"I think he needs time,\" Amorim said of Sesko. \"It’s not easy. Sometimes you are on the bench and go to the game and the game is really fast, he’s understanding that the game is even faster than the Bundesliga.",
      "\"But he is fighting, he had some good connections with teammates, I felt that when he was on the pitch we were not in our best moment and that can change the way you see a player.",
      "\"So I’m really happy because he’s putting in all the effort, we just need to be in a better moment sometimes to help him to show the talent he has.\"",
      "United have won only seven of Amorim's 29 games in charge in the Premier League after Fulham came from behind to secure a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage on Sunday.",
      "Burnley visit Old Trafford next Saturday but United commence their domestic cup programme with a League Cup second round tie at Grimsby Town on Wednesday.",
      "Wholesale changes are probable against the League Two team three days before United host newly-promoted Burnley, who beat Sunderland on Saturday.",
      "\"I think when we scored the goal we forget about maintaining the way we should play,\" Amorim added on the Fulham draw. \"We were just thinking about maintaining the result. We want to win so bad we forget about maintaining possession, push the opponent, we just gave a little bit of the game to Fulham.",
      "\"We start really well, until the goal I think we were a good team, we can do better. After the goal, I think we were just thinking about maintaining the advantage. We cannot do that.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Kobbie Mainoo is in competition with Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes for a place in the starting XI.",
      "Mainoo was unused for the second week running in United's 1-1 draw at Fulham, as Amorim sent on four defensive players in the second half.",
      "The only outright attacking change by the United head coach was the introduction of new striker Benjamin Sesko as Mainoo and striker Joshua Zirkzee remained in the dugout.",
      "Mason Mount dropped back into central midfield following the substitution of Casemiro with the game goalless. Defensive midfielder Manuel Ugarte replaced Mount in the 69th minute with United 1-0 up.",

      "Amorim favours an attacking midfielder and a defensive midfielder in his 3-4-2-1 system and Fernandes remains an automatic pick.",
      "\"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said of Mainoo. \"And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",

      "The United boss lamented his side's mindset in \"just thinking about maintaining the advantage\" having gone a goal ahead, claiming they forgot to \"push the opponent\". Yet it was he who brought on a holding midfielder in the shape of Manuel Ugarte just minutes before Fulham drew level, replacing the ever-energetic Mason Mount.",
      "Diogo Dalot replaced Amad early in the second half, and he allowed Alex Iwobi far too much space to pick out a cross for Emile Smith Rowe to level the scores.",
      "There is plenty to be analysed in the substitutions Amorim made, yet the United boss found himself discussing a substitution he didn't make at his post-match press conference.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has played as a No.10 and even a false nine during Amorim's time at Old Trafford. Fans have been crying out for Amorim to settle on a position for Mainoo, and the manager's post-match comments suggest he has done just that.",
      "\"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said. \"And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. [Sometimes] he’s going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he’s fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "Mainoo's talents are undeniable, it's simply a case of Amorim finding the best way to use him in his system. But if Mainoo is in a battle with captain and talisman Bruno Fernandes for a spot in the team, it really doesn't look good for the academy graduate.",
      "Fernandes' future has been under the microscope again of late amid more speculation surrounding a move to the Saudi Pro League. However, club sources are baffled by the speculation and still expect Fernandes to stay at United.",
      "Barring any late drama, Fernandes is set to stay at Old Trafford, and that is certainly good news for United.",
      "Where that leaves Mainoo is another matter.",

      "At 1-1 in the 83rd minute, the Manchester United fans implored the players to \"attack, attack, attack\". Ruben Amorim sent on two centre backs.",
      "Including pre-season, it is now eight successive halves that a United starter has failed to score from open play. That sequence started with the removal of Rasmus Hojlund from the team.",
      "A team crying out for a new striker has signed a new one. Benjamin Sesko only walked onto the turf before kick-off to get to the dugout in the Riverside Stand. Sesko came on 13 minutes earlier than on his debut and looked rustier.",
      "Harry Maguire's and Ayden Heaven's 87th-minute introductions will have been to manage the workload of their fellow centre halves yet it was a questionable look. Typically, the threatening Maguire almost nodded United ahead with his first touch.",
      "Four of the five players who came on for United in the second half are defensive players. Kobbie Mainoo was unused for a second successive week.",
      "Amorim's game management was too cautious and too soon after United went ahead. Manuel Ugarte, mired in a crisis of confidence, arrived to hasten Fulham's equaliser. Diogo Dalot, his fellow substitute, committed a familiar sin for Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser, inviting the wideman to cross.",
      "The Ugarte substitution seemed premature but United had already withdrawn. Within four minutes of the defensive change, Fulham equalised through substitute Smith Rowe's first touch. Fulham avoided defeat at home to United for the first time in 15 years.",
      "United were perfecting their dead-ball kicks before kick-off. The practice made perfect. A week on from Arsenal cornering United, it was their turn. Bryan Mbeumo was sizing up crosses during the warm-up and he will be claiming his first assist for his new club from a corner.",
      "Leny Yoro may dispute that. Yoro was credited for the goal yet it went in off Rodrigo Muniz's back. Yoro has quietly had a fine calendar year and it is already unlikely that his €70million fee will ever be mentioned in incredulous tones.",
      "Three minutes before Yoro helped force the breakthrough, he executed a masterful sliding tackle on Josh King. A defender increasingly playing on the front foot, Yoro was an inheritance that Amorim was always bound to be pleased with.",
      "The United supporters bellowed Yoro's name. A defender's deviated effort decided this fixture last season. Not this time.",
      "Even with £133.5m worth of new forwards in the attacking trident, goals are still hard to come by for United. Bruno Fernandes skied a penalty, his first failure from 12 yards since December 2023, and only his fifth misfire from United's record penalty scorer.",
      "Casemiro could not watch. Normally, it is safe to watch Fernandes stepping up from 12 yards. He converted three in pre-season. It was uncharacteristic that he missed the meaningful one.",
      "There was the usual outrage from a ground's denizens at perceived favouritism towards the big club in town. Their mood only worsened through the intervention of the Video Assistant Referee and the robotic announcement from on-pitch official Chris Kavanagh. Mason Mount was referred to as \"the Manchester player\". With the lengthy stoppage and grandstanding address, it felt like the other football American audiences are accustomed to.",
      "Andre Onana stepped off the United coach via the rear entrance and had his headphones on. For such a bubbly personality, his stern expression was a giveaway.",
      "Altay Bayindir and Onana enjoy a collegiate relationship though the latter would have had to perfect his poker face after Fulham realised the easiest route to a goal was through crosses and corners. Bayindir resembled a school pupil in the wrong age group. It was a quirk of the afternoon that United had the fulfilment of scoring from one of the quadrants.",
      "Mount assumed more responsibility with and without the ball, using it to feed Cunha for two shots inside the first two minutes. During breaks in play, Mount ushered Patrick Dorgu back into position, ready to initiate United's press himself, and encouraged Amad amid his complaint with the linesman.",
      "Amorim mentioned Mount as an option in midfield. Amorim reactively hooked Casemiro, booked and dicing with death again, in the 52nd minute and Mount dropped back next to Fernandes to underpin United's £200m frontline. This was the Mount United thought they were signing.",
      "Cunha slotted in one of the goals of last season at the Hammersmith End by trapping a long ball and finishing in one motion. He almost produced a sequel, alas Bernd Leno repelled his close-range effort. Cunha's expression was a familiar one of a forward wondering what he had to do to score.",
      "The Brazilian was soon tugged back cynically in the centre circle and there was a brief flicker of the frustration that blighted some of his appearances for Wolves with an outburst at the referee. Casemiro quickly assuaged Cunha.",
      "Amorim, casually clad in an unzipped Adidas tracksuit top and white t-shirt, beckoned United forward as early as the 26th minute. A dash of impatience was forgivable after United approached the two-hour mark without a goal this month. Amad smacked his thighs in frustration at not receiving the ball. When Casemiro attempted to force the issue, he overhit his pass.",
      "A minute later, Amorim outstretched his arms in exasperation and demanded an explanation as to why United had played the ball from Fulham's half into their own. The tracksuit jacket was discarded for the second half.",
      "It was a warm day in west London. Amorim is also bound to be hot under the collar when United can buy three new forwards but not buy a goal from open play.",

      "Wayne Rooney believes there is \"no excuses\" for Ruben Amorim at Manchester United this season.",
      "United began the Premier League season with a 1-0 defeat against Arsenal at Old Trafford. That was followed by a disappointing 1-1 draw against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday.",
      "Amorim was hoping to make a better start to the campaign. The 40-year-old was backed with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon this summer and is targeting a return to Europe.",
      "United have played just two Premier League games, but they will have to perform better if they want to qualify for European competition after finishing 15th in a dismal 2024/2025.",
      "Amorim must start winning matches to prevent pressure from building and Rooney shared his verdict on his BBC podcast. “There are no excuses now for the manager this season,\" he said.",
      "\"He’s got to start getting results and getting results quickly because once you start getting into October, November, if results don’t change drastically, then that’s when pressure comes.",
      "“United really needed to hit the ground running this season and one point from six is a worry.",
      "“It’s only two games into the season but the worrying sign is we’re seeing things that we saw last season and that’s a concern.”",
      "Asked if Amorim is the right man for the long term, Rooney replied: “It’s difficult to sit here and say, ‘yeah 100 per cent’ – I don’t think anyone could do that.",
      "“I don’t think Ruben would probably say that himself with what we’ve seen since he’s been at the club. I think the recruitment has been good in the summer – I still want to see two or three more players brought in.",
      "“But it’s difficult [to say], ‘right, this is going to be our manager for the next five years’ on what we’ve seen.”",
      "Reflecting on the Fulham draw, Rooney added: \"The start of the game was really positive. They took the game to Fulham and there was some nice interplay, and then from getting the goal. . . they were passive in the second half again and it was too easy for Fulham to get through the backline.",
      "\"It looked like Fulham were going to go and win the game. I still think there's a lot to be worked on. It's still early in the season, of course it is, but United really needed to hit the ground running.\"",

      "Manchester United still need to sign a central midfielder almost ten months after appointing Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils shortcomings in that department were clear again after the 1-1 draw away to Fulham last weekend.",
      "They have signed three forwards - Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha - this summer, four if you include Enzo Kana-Biyik. Diego Leon is also the second left wing-back brought in after already adding Patrick Dorgu during the winter transfer window, alongside Ayden Heaven, an additional central defender.",

      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there, and he is going to have to sort it out. I think Man United will have to get a goalkeeper and look at getting a central midfield player.\"",
      "The club selling Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, who are frontrunners to sign the wantaway winger, would seemingly be the most straightforward way of raising the funds for another signing. Securing the exits of Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia would no doubt help.",

      "A loan move has been touted, although it seems that Hojlund would want to remain in Naples beyond this season if a move were to be completed. Like England, the transfer window in Italy closes on September 1 meaning time is running out for a deal to be finalised.",
      "According to Corriere Dello Sport, McTominay is looking to use his relationship with Hojlund to get him to join him in Italy. The report claims that United would be open to a €5million (£4.3m) loan deal with an obligation to buy for an additional €40m (£34.6m).",
      "McTominay is the latest player to leave Manchester and enjoy success. The Scotland international moved to Naples last summer and played a crucial role in their Scudetto win under Antonio Conte.",

      "\"Very good negotiations, the package requested is €20m. There is a negotiation ongoing on deal structure and fee, still not a done deal between the clubs. It’s agreed with the player because Lammens already said yes to Manchester United. The arrival of Lammens – if it happens – doesn’t mean that Andre Onana is going to leave Man Utd.\"",

The midfielder is said to be 'open' to the move - and is understood to have requested a contract worth approximately £33million-a-year. Although that doesn't necessarily mean their captain, Fernandes, will be leaving - a potential departure would, of course, provide them with a significant financial boost, freeing up funds that could be reinvested into their squad or used to secure high-profile targets.",

      "\"Manchester United are informed about talks and ready to get deal done if Højlund and Napoli agree on terms.\"",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes understand that United are eyeing up a move for Sevilla midfielder Agoume.",
      "After deciding against pursuing a move for Carlos Baleba, United could still sign a new midfielder before the September 1 deadline. The report suggests that Agoume could be available for a fee ranging from £21.7m to £30.4m.",
      "According to reports, United have set their sights on Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller.",
      "It's suggested that Stiller has a £31.5 million release clause, but it only becomes active in 2026, meaning United would likely need to pay a premium to secure him immediately.",
      "The Mail understands that Onana is expected to stay at Man United despite speculation the club may move for Senne Lammens.",
      "\"Onana is ready to play like last week so we will see in the game who is going to be the goalkeeper,\" Amorim said in his press-conference.",
      "The report claims that both United and Onana anticipate he will stay beyond the transfer window, which closes a week on Monday, despite Monaco having been quoted £30million earlier in the summer and the possibility of renewed interest from his former club Inter Milan.",
      "Meanwhile, Lammens is thought to be seen as a long-term option in goal and is expected to challenge Onana, whose future has been uncertain following a string of inconsistent displays last season."

      "Manchester United are hoping to get off the mark in the Premier League this weekend.",
      "United suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in their opening game of the new league campaign at Old Trafford and they are looking to bounce back against Fulham at Craven Cottage.",
      "Ruben Amorim made a handful of contentious selection decisions against Arsenal and it will be fascinating to see his starting team. Benjamin Sesko was named on the bench against Arsenal and could make his full debut.",
      "Fulham drew 1-1 with Brighton last weekend after a last-gasp equaliser in added time.",
      "Here are the five things to look out for at Craven Cottage...",
      "Benjamin Sesko should be in line to make his full debut against Fulham. The Slovenian international was introduced from the bench in the second half against Arsenal, which made it difficult for him to impose himself.",
      "It was impossible to gauge anything from Sesko's cameo and fans will be desperate to see him from the start. The front line was fluid and slick in the first half last weekend, but it's a no-brainer to start Sesko.",
      "United's biggest weakness was their inability to score goals last season. The Reds notched just 44 goals in the Premier League and Sesko has been signed in a £73.7million deal to fix that.",
      "It would be strange to start Sesko on the bench again. Amorim may feel Mason Mount combined well with his teammates against Arsenal, but United did not score and they need a striker on the pitch.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund might be left at home again. Hojlund was dropped from the squad for the opening game of the season and he watched the contest from the directors' box at Old Trafford.",
      "Journalists will be waiting for the United team bus to arrive to confirm whether Hojlund has travelled before the team news is announced. It seems likely he could be omitted from the squad again.",
      "It feels harsh to drop Hojlund from the squad altogether - he has not worked his ticket - but Amorim seems to have marked his card and decided he needs to leave before the transfer deadline.",
      "The unwanted statistics have stacked up across the last two seasons, but United could create some positive club history when they take on Fulham because their record at Craven Cottage is impressive.",
      "Since drawing 2-2 with Fulham away from home in August 2010, United have won every visit to Craven Cottage in the Premier League, racking up a sequence of eight wins in London.",
      "Another win at Craven Cottage would set a new club record of successive wins at a venue.",
      "Craven Cottage should also be a happy hunting ground for United forward Matheus Cunha, who had a strong record against the London club during his two-and-a-half years with Wolves.",
      "Cunha has recorded four goal involvements in the last three Premier League games against Fulham, which includes two goals and assist in a comfortable 4-1 win for Wolves at Craven Cottage last season.",
      "That defeat represented Fulham's heaviest defeat of the 2024/2025 campaign. Marco Silva will be aware of the threat Cunha will pose, but will his players be able to stop the Brazilian?",
      "Ineos' headquarters are based in Knightsbridge, London, which is just a 20-minute drive away from Craven Cottage. That explains why Sir Jim Ratcliffe attended last season's game away at Fulham and why he might show his face again.",
      "Ratcliffe was approached by angry supporters after United's 1-0 win against Fulham in January. Lisandro Martinez scored a late match-winner, but fans conveyed their anger about the rise of ticket prices.",
      "The British billionaire was confronted as he sat in his car outside the stadium. Ratcliffe wound his car window down before he appeared to say: \"Get your photograph.\"",
      "\"66 quid, you're taking the p***. You're worse than the Glazers, sort it out,\" a fan replied.",
      "Another fan said during the heated exchange: \"66 f****** quid, mate. What are you doing mate? We're northerners, come on, mate. Our prices should be a third of Fulham's.\"",
      "United fans are still annoyed about ticket prices, but Amorim has been backed in the summer transfer window and it's unlikely Ratcliffe would face similar hostility this weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United go in search of their first win of the season when they travel to Fulham on Sunday.",
      "United were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season but largely looked much improved compared to last season.",
      "The front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko could be seen from the start together for the first time this weekend after all three players featured against the Gunners.",
      "And while a number of leading Premier League pundits have offered mixed predictions for this weekend's trip to west London, it is clear all three summer signings have already made a positive impression.",
      "Here is a round-up of how the pundits see United faring at Craven Cottage.",
      "\"Like a lot of people, I try to be balanced about Manchester United,\" Sutton told BBC Sport. \"They lost last week but I do think they will be better this season. Well, they can't be any worse.",
      "\"I really like Bryan Mbeumo and I especially like Matheus Cunha, I think he's got loads going for him. Fulham were fortunate to get something against Brighton but I think they'll improve in front of their own fans.",
      "\"Fulham don't play with any fear and will take the game to Manchester United which gives me a sneaking feeling United will exploit them and win this one.",
      "\"But then again I always predict Manchester United games wrong. I want to be positive about them but I'm not sure I can be. Plus, I think I predicted Fulham wrong for every one of their matches last season.",

      "\"On another day, they might even have won that game. The new lads looked good and I think we can see what Amorim is trying to build here, but that defence remains an issue.",
      "\"Will Sesko get his first start here? He went with Cunha the other day and I think Sesko will be in from the start. You saw glimpses the other day of what a handful this boy could be.\"",
      "Redknapp's prediction: Fulham 1-2 Manchester United",
      "\"I don't think Manchester United were as great as some people say. It looks like their new signings might take time to get used to each other and they still lack a killer instinct in front of goal.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed some spark, but there was a moment when he beat three players and could only muster a weak attempt. That is the problem if you ask me. Fulham will not offer the kind of space that Arsenal gave lavishly for him to operate. I actually don't think there will be a lot to separate these two teams on the table at the end of the season.",
      "\"I was impressed by Matthijs de Ligt, I thought he was solid. It was almost the perfect battle for him against Gyokeres. But Manchester United still ended up losing the game. Not sure if they are okay with playing better and losing, especially considering their situation now. I think this will be a draw.\"",

      "Everton should know better over Jack Grealish, while Thomas Frank and Brentford are both thriving. But West Ham and Ruben Amorim look utterly hopeless.",
      "",
      "Everton\nIf Everton supporters had not already connected with Jack Grealish on a spiritual level after his inspirational first start, those post-match comments must have made them feel seen and heard.",
      "“I think maybe at times in the last couple of years I’ve not fallen out of love, but didn’t enjoy football as much as I should,” he said. “I absolutely love football and I want to have that feeling again when you get up on a match day and can’t wait to get out there.”",
      "It’s the same feeling those fans have chased for years. They needed that as much as Grealish, with the new stadium a perfect backdrop to their consummation.",
      "One of the first rules of football is to never fall for a loan signing but Everton really are pretty much helpless here.",
      "",
      "Thomas Frank\nIt would be a foolish oversimplification to state that Frank has displayed more tactical malleability in three games as Spurs coach than his predecessor managed in two years.",
      "But it really does feel as though Frank has displayed more tactical malleability in three games as Spurs coach than his predecessor managed in two years.",
      "Of course he hasn’t. Ange Postecoglou planned and executed these performances and results on occasion and even won at the Etihad without conceding, as the prophecy dictates any Spurs manager must.",
      "But Frank’s flexibility in devising a gameplan not just to nullify the strengths of such diverse opponents as Paris Saint-Germain, Burnley and Manchester City but to more specifically accentuate the strengths of his own players is what a great many supporters wanted more often from the previous regime.",
      "There should always be a certain philosophy and style at the heart of it, the same principles which run through and define whatever team the manager picks. Frank outlined his in that memorable Monday Night Football segment two years ago focusing on how he would set Brentford up to face Manchester City away.",
      "The idea behind his appointment centred around transposing that to a higher level with better players. Curse Daniel Levy for he might have nailed it.",
      "",
      "Brentford\nWhat a difference a week makes. Keith Andrews said Brentford “produced a performance that was us” against Aston Villa, having lamented how the Bees were “a little nice” and “naive” in the defeat to Nottingham Forest.",
      "Those were not adjectives which have often been associated with Brentford since their promotion, even if a sort of identity crisis was understandable after a summer of immense change.",
      "Brentford won far more of their duels – especially in their own defensive third – and it provided a greater base from which they could build. Their goal was a beautiful and basic – a long kick from the keeper and flick-on – and they weathered the storm for over an hour to protect that deserved lead.",
      "Even the disallowed goal lashed in by Mikkel Damsgaard from a long Michael Kayode throw which left Emi Martinez prone was stirring proof that you can raid individuals, but you cannot kill an idea so easily.",
      "The one shot Brentford had from the 28th minute had a better xG than 13 of the 16 Villa mustered in that same time. Perhaps home comforts offered a timely reminder of what they do best.",
      "",
      "Chelsea without Cole Palmer\nHaving failed to score in the three previous Premier League games Cole Palmer did not start, Chelsea needed that.",
      "Their talisman’s durability meant that sequence stretched all the way back to December 2023 but proof of strength and variation beyond the main attacking cog in their machine was overdue with or without him on the pitch.",
      "Enzo Maresca “didn’t want to take the risk” with Palmer and the fact he didn’t feel he had to was encouraging. This might even afford the England international the break his sustained form has long suggested he needs.",
      "Five different scorers stepped up to assume responsibility; it was a far cry from when Mauricio Pochettino implored his squad to “show this is Chelsea Football Club, not Cole Palmer Football Club” before a 5-0 defeat to Arsenal in April 2024.",
      "And there is a story to be told in Chelsea’s prior five-goal Premier League win, when they also recovered from the concession of an early goal to thrash Southampton away last December. The five different scorers that day were Palmer, Axel Disasi, Christopher Nkunku, Noni Madueke and Jadon Sancho.",
      "It has come at ludicrous expense but this is a team transformed and quickly maturing.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nThe perfect riposte to the wider noise surrounding the opening weekend. Another clean sheet against a relegation-battling United was this time supplemented by a show of proper attacking force Arsenal have not exerted for what feels like an age.",
      "It had all the hallmarks of what is likely to become their trademark brand of victories alongside scrappy 1-0s this season: set-piece goals, a penalty, some Viktor Gyokeres fun and even a couple of celebration-tempering injuries in attack.",
      "After beating Manchester City 5-1 at the Emirates in February, Arsenal scored more than two goals in just one of their next 15 Premier League games – away at Ipswich in April. This sort of thrashing has become their calling card under Mikel Arteta and entirely justifies those 90-minute grinds.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth\nThe argument with Wolves was won long ago; not a single soul still believes Bournemouth might have made a mistake over Gary O’Neil.",
      "But the trade-up for Andoni Iraola continues to prove masterful. His coaching has safeguarded against a level of squad upheaval few can match. Only Chelsea have accrued more in transfer fees than Bournemouth this summer yet the Cherries remain a clear and established force.",
      "The majority of those sales were made at the back, with the ageless Adam Smith accounting for more than two-thirds of the combined Premier League career appearances made by the starting defence and goalkeeper which did not struggle to keep a clean sheet.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the only other side to pick the exact same starting line-up across the first two games, yet just Arsenal and Manchester City have used more players than Bournemouth.",
      "Iraola spoke after the game of his improved depth and “options” for good reason; it’s a quietly excellent squad being maximised by a brilliant manager.",
      "",
      "Scott Parker\nThere will need to be imminent evidence that Burnley can make this work against teams they haven’t just been promoted alongside, especially away from home.",
      "But there is also plenty to be said for the momentum and confidence which can be extracted from that sort of victory. The moods at Burnley and Sunderland could not have been more disparate after their mirrored opening-day results and the Clarets redressed the balance in 90 accomplished minutes.",
      "Parker has also now nudged ahead of Mick McCarthy in terms of Premier League points per game. It truly was a weekend Sunderland might never recover from.",
      "",
      "Marco Silva\nWhile he would quite like some new signings – and is far from alone in that regard – Silva continues to create problems for himself by perennially finding solutions.",
      "One third of Fulham’s Premier League goals since the start of last season have been scored by substitutes. After two games they have already salvaged a couple of points with equalisers from the bench. It’s a neat trick.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace\nOliver Glasner did offer a much brighter outlook on Crystal Palace’s future and how “everybody is working really hard to get the right players in”. There is a strong sense that once the window closes he will be thrilled to be able to just coach without all the nonsense surrounding it.",
      "But Palace really should spend this next week stopping him talking to either Austrian TV or Gary Cotterill. Nothing good can come of it.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo\nShould be replaced by the man in the opposite dug-out but also retains the full and unwavering support of the fans. Much like his predecessor actually; working for Evangelos Marinakis does seem inadvisable.",
      "",
      "Leeds\nDidn’t lose 6-0.",
      "",
      "West Ham\nThe cycle continues. Without significant change at the highest level beyond the loss of their Premier League status, it always will.",
      "West Ham have appointed a coach shorn of tactical identity and charisma, backed them haphazardly at best in the transfer market – it is difficult to think of a worse, more systematically self-destructive window from an established top-flight club – and reportedly given them a game-based ultimatum to figure things out.",
      "There is no smoke without fire and the internal rejection of those stories only intensifies the feeling that this is an irrevocably broken club.",
      "Potter is not good enough to make sense of any of it, but then it is difficult to fathom who else might. The shortlist to replace him will obviously include Rafael Benitez as it always does, a perfect illustration of a club stuck in the mid-2000s and refusing to modernise.",
      "It is a diabolical squad put together with the conflicting ideas of about five different individuals from at least two managerial regimes, a club which generates money in spite of itself and spends it atrociously.",
      "The Declan Rice windfall is a prime example. It should have been used to reinforce their position as a mid-table side with designs on challenging the elite. They signed Edson Alvarez (loaned out), Mohammed Kudus (sold), Konstantinos Mavropanos (an unused substitute twice this season) and James Ward-Prowse (part of the worst midfield in the league).",
      "The 2003 West Ham vintage is still held as the archetypal forewarning of a side being Too Good To Go Down. The 2025 edition really doesn’t look close to being good enough to stay up.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa\nThe PSR argument does sort of fall in on itself with results and performances like that. These first two games must prompt a great deal more introspection at Aston Villa than has been allowed to take place so far.",
      "It was a horribly undercooked bench and even little old Brentford were able to prove the advantages of having an expensive Premier League-ready signing available; that is the sort of asset Villa in many ways cannot afford.",
      "But there must be better in-house solutions than using John McGinn as an out-and-out winger, using Emiliano Buendia at all or persisting with a system which doesn’t appear to work.",
      "Villa put in 27 crosses, a vaguely impressive feat considering their starting line-up was an affront to width and pace, and a figure they surpassed just three times last season. Only four of them found a teammate yet nothing fundamentally changed in Villa’s approach until Donyell Malen came on to offer some thrust in the final half an hour.",
      "Having almost twice as many shots as Brentford but the same amount on target is ultimately as wasteful as their utterly absurd wage-to-revenue ratio.",
      "",
      "Manchester City\nBetween the bungled deployment of the Pep Lijnders high line and Thomas Frank thanking “awfully clever” Jurgen Klopp for inventing the aggressive high press, it was not the first Manchester City defeat which could be traced back to Liverpool.",
      "But that was a chastening reminder that spending more than £300m in a year does not immediately fix every problem. This is a new team with fresh coaching ideas which will take time to implement and master.",
      "While Pep Guardiola knows he will be afforded that patience based on what he was allowed to survive and come through last season, there remains an uncertainty surrounding Manchester City which has rarely been present under his rule.",
      "And it doesn’t feel like their continued curious pursuit of another keeper to completely undermine their initial succession plan will help decide which of the two teams we’ve seen in the opening weeks is a more accurate reflection of Guardiola’s latest expensive rebuild.",
      "",
      "Vitor Pereira\nThere is sympathy for a manager trying to establish and uphold standards at the highest level.",
      "The coach is privy to information and context that supporters and outsiders are not and if Pereira felt Andre was a necessary sacrifice to that altar based on his commitment and approach to training, with Jean-Ricner Bellegarde granted his place, then those are the choices he is paid handsomely to make.",
      "As Pereira said, game time is not a “gift” and has to be earned.",
      "But this is also not anything close to a squad which can afford to make such statements. It is a confused mess of profiles, nationalities, ages and positions and Andre is likely the best of them, as underlined by the Brazilian’s half-time rescue call after his replacement’s decisive mistake.",
      "Wolves were ultimately better for his presence, even with 10 men. But they look every bit a side which has sold its best forward and defender and spent a fraction of the income speculating to accumulate precious little. You’d struggle to name most of that starting line-up even with a team sheet in front of you.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim\n“We prove today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal,” said Amorim last week.",
      "He must have known it had to be backed up with victories against Fulham and Burnley before the first international break at the very least, with strong performances a preferred accompaniment.",
      "But the burden of that apparent proof is collapsing in on itself. Amorim has managed 25 Premier League games against sides currently in the division, winning just four and losing 15. It is a farcical record considering the backing he has received and the support he still benefits from.",
      "Maybe signing the league’s two biggest xG overperformers does not fix the attack. Maybe Manchester United should derive a modicum of shame in how freely and publicly their opponents discuss their tactical shortcomings. Maybe Manchester United shouldn’t have built around a player who has no clear role and who can’t take a penalty properly after being nudged a minute beforehand.",
      "And maybe Amorim really isn’t the one to fix this. It is worrying that Manchester United do not appear to have contemplated that possibility for one second, so many of their cracked eggs have they already placed in his basket.",
      "READ NEXT: Amorim sack inevitable as Mainoo joins list of Manchester United sacrifices for absolutely nothing",
      "",
      "Brighton\n“With our younger players a little bit older, Fabian a year in the Premier League, we are hoping for more next season,” said Tony Bloom this summer.",
      "More of the same is not what was planned. Brighton have gamed the system and mastered the market but still cannot consistently crack the code in terms of goals.",
      "Their top scorers last season all scored 10 each and one – their outright top scorer the campaign before – has been sold. For all their brilliance, the only player to ever score more than 10 goals in a Premier League season for Brighton remains Glenn Murray.",
      "That seems unlikely to change this year. Brighton continue to create at as quick a rate as they waste. Danny Welbeck is a wonderful player but never the fulcrum around which an entire attack should revolve, never mind at 34.",
      "And their defence is still unreliable: only three current Premier League clubs have conceded more goals than the Seagulls since Hurzeler’s appointment.",
      "Bloom sanctioned the biggest spend of any top-flight club last season to improve Brighton in the present and that has trickled over into a summer of recruitment in 2025 focused more on the future.",
      "It means £50m worth of teenage Greek strikers remain on the sidelines as Hurzeler does not deem them ready, but the coach has been given a hand his bosses feel is strong enough to be played properly now. The results he is producing suggest otherwise.",
      "",
      "Sunderland\nA necessary reality check after that euphoric opening win and fantasy summer transfer window.",
      "The objective at Sunderland remains survival, even if some supporters should dare to dream of Europe and beyond. An injury to Dan Ballard or being forced to have more of the ball would not bring everything crashing down quite so dramatically if the foundations were sound.",
      "These results will happen and often depend on the sort of chance Eliezer Mayenda spurned in the opening stages. Sunderland might be grateful that the one common theme from their first two games is a need not to overreact.",
      "Arsenal are plotting another Spurs hijack, and a new club are in the race for Marc Guehi, while Manchester United close in on a goalkeeper signing.",
      "We have ranked seven benched Premier League players with zero minutes played after two weeks of 2025/26 by how peeved off they’ll be…",
      "Even a truly rotten West Ham are better than Manchester United have been under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been told to put his ‘damned ego aside’ and sell Bruno Fernandes as Man Utd’s latest failure dominates.",
      "Manchester United “have to do a piece of business” in midfield, according to Gary Neville, who does not exempt Bruno Fernandes from criticism.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has not played a single minute for Manchester United this season. Why?"

      "Wayne Rooney thinks Ruben Amorim now has “no excuses” not to excel this season after the Man Utd board brought in new attacking reinforcements.",
      "The Red Devils ended last season with defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham after finishing the season in a terrible 15th position in the Premier League.",
      "And things have not started much better this season with an opening day defeat to Arsenal, while they were held to a 1-1 draw against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "That has left many fans and former players unimpressed with Man Utd spending around £200m on new players over the summer transfer window so far.",
      "With a full pre-season under his belt, as well as the new signings, Rooney feels that Amorim can now have “no excuses” for falling below the minimum requirements this season.",
      "Rooney said on his BBC Sport podcast: “There’s no excuses now for the manager this season. He’s got to start getting results and getting the results quickly because once you start getting into October, November, if the results don’t change drastically then that’s when the pressure comes.”",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim urged to sell Bruno Fernandes or face Man Utd sack",
      "When asked if Amorim’s record at Man Utd so far gave him any faith that he is the right man to lead the club forward, Rooney replied: “It’s difficult and to sit here and say ‘obviously, 100 per cent’ [he is the right man], I don’t think anyone can do that.",
      "“I don’t think Ruben Amorim would probably say that himself with what we’ve seen since he’s been at the club.",
      "“But I think the recruitment has been good in the summer. I still want to see two or three more players. But it’s difficult to say ‘this is going to be our manager for the next five years’ on what we’ve seen.”",
      "Rooney added: “We might be going to quick on this because Manchester United brings a lot more attention, it’s only two games into the season. But the worrying sign is that we’re seeing things that we saw last season and that’s a concern.”",
      "Former Man Utd team-mate Gary Neville has “checked” his pre-season optimism after a disappointing start to the season and has urged the club to sign a new midfielder.",
      "Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast: “[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up.",
      "“I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can’t continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.",
      "“I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it’s quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.",
      "“He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he’s fourth-choice really.",
      "“That means that they are going to need to get something sorted because it’s going to be a problem.",
      "“The two in there do get exposed when that front three are just a little bit higher and that back five get pushed back a bit.",

      "19) 🆕 Angelo Stiller – Stuttgart to Manchester United\nYouTube searches for Stiller have presumably increased exponentially after it emerged on Thursday that the midfielder is on United’s list of Carlos Baleba alternatives. Of course, the Germany international would be cheaper and a more simple deal to pull off but United’s interest has not yet led to a conversation with Stuttgart so links are tentative. For now.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Manchester City\nHonestly, who knows at this stage? Reports say City have joined the race to sign the Palace captain, though a move hinges on the futures of Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji. Even if those two leave, Pep Guardiola still has Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, John Stones and Abdukodir Khusanov, while Vitor Reis is out on loan. It’s a World Cup year, so Guehi could prefer to run out his contract in south London.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will apparently demand £60million since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Which might have scuppered whatever hope Napoli might have had of filling their Romelu Lukaku void with the Dane. But former team-mate Scott McTominay has been on the blower…",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Piero Hincapie – Bayer Leverkusen to North London\nSpurs made a proposal for Hincapie and then it quickly emerged that Arsenal are also keen. Will some hijacking history hilariously repeat itself after the Ebere Eze debacle? That would be quite something. The Ecuadorian defender has told Leverkusen he wants to leave and has a 60 million euro release clause.",
      "",
      "12) Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get rid.",
      "",
      "11) 🆕 Conor Gallagher – Atletico Madrid to Crystal Palace\nGallagher is reportedly open to a return to the Premier League, with the club he spent 2022/23 on loan at interested. It would be a loan deal but it all hinges on Atletico’s wishes.",
      "",
      "10) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay. Though James Trafford’s performance against Spurs might refocus City’s minds.",

      "",
      "9) Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nYou could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement. Ederson will not be keen to remain on City’s bench, from where he watched James Trafford’s poor tribute act against Spurs.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Manuel Akanji – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nThe City defender was left out of the defeat to Tottenham amid talk of interest from Galatasaray. Which City are likely to encourage given their desire to trim Pep Guardiola’s squad but Akanji is said to be keen to stay. Let’s see if being bombed from the matchday squad changes his tune…",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, reports suggest Spurs are lurking with more intent. Savinho was left out of the City squad that faced Spurs on Saturday.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nSimons was in the RB Leipzig side that was splattered all over the Allianz by Bayern Munich on Friday night but the club’s sporting director Marcel Schafer says the attacker has made clear his desire to join Chelsea. The Blues just need to shift some of the forwards they no longer want first. Nkunku seems to be the one this deal hinges on.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Bilal El Khannouss – Leicester to Crystal Palace\nThe Foxes playmaker is being linked with Spurs, Newcastle, Leeds, and probably a few other Premier League clubs but Palace appear better placed while they look for a replacement for Eze with £60million burning a hole in their pocket. El Khannouss was left out of Leicester’s squad to face Charlton on Saturday.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option on Tuesday night with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him. We anticipate another less mischief-making offer after Monday night’s clash between the two sides at St James’ Park and the nagging feeling remains this will get done.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Senne Lammens – Royal Antwerp to Manchester United\nUnited certainly need a goalkeeper and their refusal to engage over Donnaruma suggests they have something else up their sleeve. Indeed, some reports claim a deal with Antwerp is ‘almost done’ with United paying around £17million to give Andre Onana something to think about.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nPerhaps spooked by Tottenham’s interest, Everton have finally agreed a deal worth £42million which includes £6million in add-ons and a 20 per cent sell-on clause for the Saints.",

      "We have ranked them by how p*ssed off they will be after consecutive snubs.",
      "",
      "7) Dario Essugo (Chelsea)\nSigned for a decent fee this summer, Essugo has yet to see a single Premier League minute. The 20-year-old has been left to watch Chelsea’s draw with Crystal Palace and demolition of West Ham from the bench, and must already be fearing the same fate as Lesley Ugochukwu, Carney Chukwuemeka and the rest of the youngsters hoarded at Stamford Bridge before being loaned out and eventually sold.",
      "And we all know the script by now. Say it together: one, two, three…Strasbourg!",
      "",
      "6) Ilkay Gundogan (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola put Gundogan’s omission from Saturday’s squad against Spurs down to rotation, a week after the German sat on the bench while City – and his replacement Tijjani Reijnders – ran riot at Molineux. Journalist Nico Schira claims Gundogan is no longer in Guardiola’s plans, but that’s already obvious after just two weeks of 2025/26.",
      "After seven glittering years at the Etihad, Gundogan left for Barcelona on a free transfer. He impressed in Spain and was re-signed by City a year later, a move we deemed perfect for everyone involved. It turns out we were wrong. For the first and only time ever.",
      "A year on, and back-to-back Premier League snubs suggest a third transfer in as many summers. Gundogan should be more disappointed than angry about the situation: his second City stint looks set to end with him on the fringes, a far cry from 2023 when Guardiola worked tirelessly to convince him to stay. Age catches up with us all, fella…",
      "",
      "5) Manuel Akanji (Manchester City)\nAn unused substitute against Wolves and available but ignored against Spurs, Akanji looks destined for the exit. City have agreed a fee with Galatasaray for the Swiss defender, though personal terms are still to be settled.",
      "The decision is a curious one. Akanji has been versatile and reliable, while Nathan Ake’s fitness record is far shakier, but City seem intent on cashing in while Gala’s interest is strong. Guardiola’s squad is bloated and trimming it is a priority, and Akanji appears to be collateral.",
      "At 30, he’s weighing up his options, but the way this is unfolding would test anyone’s patience. A move to Turkey feels increasingly inevitable, whether it’s his preferred choice or not.",
      "",
      "4) Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United)\nHaving spent every minute of 2025/26 getting splinters on his bum, Zirkzee hasn’t been called upon once by Ruben Amorim. This is despite Amorim chasing an equaliser against Arsenal on matchday one and a winner at Fulham on matchday two. His goal record in England is far from spectacular, but the Portuguese head coach baffled everyone by turning to centre-backs Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven in the 87th minute at Craven Cottage with the score level, while Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo were Right There.",
      "But Zirkzee’s situation is different to Mainoo’s. He hasn’t done enough to prove himself as a top-level player for United, and the big-money arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were always going to push him down the pecking order. The one small consolation is that he hasn’t been cast aside entirely like poor Rasmus Hojlund. But two sunny Sundays on the bench already feel less like rotation and more like a gentle nudge towards the exit door.",
      "",
      "3) Ederson (Manchester City)\n“My future is here. Some friends send me a lot of news but 99 per cent is fake news. I understand, but there’s a lot of fake news around my name. My head is staying at the club. It stays with the City. It gives me everything to go back to the Premier League again and try to win the Champions League as well.”",
      "That was Ederson in June. At the time we said it might not be down to him, and it’s panning out that way. Despite his public declaration, the Brazilian goalkeeper – like Manuel Akanji – is a target for Galatasaray. City seem happy to move him on, leaving him out of the squad entirely for the trip to Wolves amid the speculation before plonking him on the bench for Saturday’s defeat to Spurs. A James Trafford error, Ederson camera pan was inevitable.",
      "Trafford has moved ahead of him in Guardiola’s pecking order, and if Ederson goes, the door opens for PSG’s Gianluigi Donnarumma. It’s a brutal situation for City’s long-time No.1, whose future suddenly hinges not on his own form or loyalty, but on the availability of a superstar replacement.",
      "",
      "2) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nIt’s Groundhog Day for Kiwior, who has started a second successive campaign on the fringes. Left out completely for the Gunners’ opener at Old Trafford, the defender was an unused substitute against Leeds United on Saturday. Last August, Kiwior didn’t make the squad on matchday one and then sat on the bench for another three matches before finally starting in the Premier League on December 4.",
      "There is genuine transfer interest in Kiwior, and a sale would make sense. FC Porto are keen, but Arsenal are right to hold firm for a decent fee. Andrea Berta has the tough task of rebuilding the club’s reputation in the market, and securing good value for Kiwior would be a step in the right direction.",
      "Plenty of Arsenal fans would be content for him to stay – he played an important role in the second half of last season when Gabriel Magalhaes was injured. But the early signs suggest history is repeating itself. With Gabriel first choice, and Riccardo Calafiori and new arrival Cristhian Mosquera also in Mikel Arteta’s squad, opportunities will be limited. A move to Porto looks increasingly likely, and at this stage, Kiwior would be wise to give it serious thought if he wants to play regularly.",
      "",
      "Playing academy graduates is a cheat code for building a connection with supporters, and Mainoo is one of the best to come through at Old Trafford in years. He broke into an equally dysfunctional United side under Erik ten Hag at just 18 and showed incredible maturity and quality to establish himself in the first team. He’s a top talent, and if Amorim can’t find a role for him, that’s on him.",
      "The England international ought to be exasperated watching Manuel Ugarte struggle while Amorim turns to the Uruguayan and defenders Diogo Dalot, Maguire and Heaven as substitutes ahead of him.",
      "That only fuels uncertainty about Mainoo’s long-term future. He remains one of United’s best, most consistent players – even off the back of a difficult season – and is not someone they can afford to lose, even if a sale would be a pure-profit goldmine. Mainoo might love the club to death, but players will always do what’s best for their career. We’re only two games deep, but fans are already annoyed, and you can only imagine how young Kobbie is feeling.",
      "Everton should know better over Jack Grealish, while Thomas Frank and Brentford are both thriving. But West Ham and Ruben Amorim look utterly hopeless.",
      "Arsenal are plotting another Spurs hijack, and a new club are in the race for Marc Guehi, while Manchester United close in on a goalkeeper signing.",
      "According to reports, England international Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on leaving Manchester United after being snubbed by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Even a truly rotten West Ham are better than Manchester United have been under Ruben Amorim.",

      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "19) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nIt is still very early days but really not much more Thomas Frank could have done. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’d get on operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. Remarkably, he appears to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",
      "",
      "16=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nAn earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "16=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "16=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",
      "",
      "15) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least.",
      "",
      "9=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "9=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "9=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "9=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "9=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "9=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "We’ll know far more pretty soon given Burnley face Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "5=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "5=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, and it really might just be that West Ham are that bad.",
      "",
      "5=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and a lacklustre defeat to a Bournemouth side with plenty of problems of their own.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "3) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "2) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "",
      "1) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nAlways felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Arsenal face a nervous wait on Kai Havertz after a knee setback, with Mikel Arteta confirming he’s unavailable to face Leeds United.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner."

      "Kobbie Mainoo has not played a single minute for Manchester United this season. Why?",
      "The Manchester United midfielder remained on the bench throughout their 1-1 draw with Fulham on Sunday while Diogo Dalot, Benjamin Sesko, Manuel Ugarte, Ayden Heaven and Harry Maguire were all called upon to turn the game around.",
      "As we said elsewhere, Ruben Amorim wasted Arsenal goodwill immediately as Manchester United sacrificed everything for nothing.",
      "Amorim was obviously asked why he had not used Mainoo in either of his team’s first two matches – the narrow defeat at home to Arsenal or the away draw with Fulham.",
      "“No, he is fighting for the position now with Bruno (Fernandes),” said Amorim, giving Mainoo the impossible task of replacing his captain.",
      "“And I changed two midfielders. I like Mason Mount there because we want to score a goal. And then when I change it, I felt that the team needed to return to one holding midfielder.",
      "“So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno in training. Like it should be at Manchester United.”",
      "The problem with that situation is obvious: Amorim is never going to take off Fernandes, even when he can see he is struggling.",
      "Fernandes missed a penalty against Fulham and Amorim admitted after the game: “I think he is not used to missing penalties. He knows the importance that this moment can have [and make a] huge impact on the team.",
      "“During the game he was not happy because he was not involved and he has so much responsibility and I think he thought missing the penalty was huge for us.”",
      "And yet Mainoo still did not come off the bench to replace Mainoo, suggesting he is not “fighting” hard enough in training.",
      "Former Manchester United player, pundit and tireless self-promoter Rio Ferdinand has his own theory about Mainoo being sidelined.",
      "He said on his own YouTube channel: “I think he’s the type of player, I think he’s got the talent to build around, but you’ve got to have the team functioning and playing in a particular way.",
      "“I had a debate – there are some players who need the system to be able to perform. There’s some great players we’ve got in this country right now, I’ll go through a few of them, I think Kobbie Mainoo needs a system to play in.",
      "“I think Phil Foden needs a system to play in, I think for them to play to their optimum best.",

      "Wayne Rooney thinks Ruben Amorim now has “no excuses” not to excel this season after the Man Utd board brought in new attacking reinforcements.",
      "Arsenal are plotting another Spurs hijack, and a new club are in the race for Marc Guehi, while Manchester United close in on a goalkeeper signing.",
      "We have ranked seven benched Premier League players with zero minutes played after two weeks of 2025/26 by how peeved off they’ll be…",
      "According to reports, England international Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on leaving Manchester United after being snubbed by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Even a truly rotten West Ham are better than Manchester United have been under Ruben Amorim."

      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "10) Richarlison (2)\nYou would have got incredibly long odds on Richarlison winning the Golden Boot two weeks before the season but he has been immense so far, scoring twice in that simple opening win over Burnley and then impressing again as Spurs won at Manchester City. He will take some shifting from that starting XI by Dominic Solanke.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame and that looks like hard work in this particular Aston Villa team.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "7) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "4=) Joao Pedro (1)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came v West Ham.",
      "",
      "4=) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "4=) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "3) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (2)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres on Sunday.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",
      "Mind games? Being nice to an Arsenal interviewer? Whatever the reason, the newly minted Player of the Year reckons Mikel Arteta’s side are the favourites this year.",

      "Ruben Amorim was given a pre-season, £200m, more goodwill than most and the perfect opener against Arsenal. But his Manchester United just isn’t working.",
      "",
      "‘Manchester United have trampled over too many green shoots of promise they have only just planted to engender much faith in this latest long-term plan. Their modern history contains more false dawns than a Vicar of Dibley convention. Do this against Fulham and Burnley before the international break and we’ll start believing this might be different.’",
      "Ruben Amorim would struggle to get Journey on board at this rate.",
      "There was a kickback against the general positive slant given to what was ultimately a 17th defeat in 43 matches as Manchester United manager for the Portuguese last week. But in most quarters the praise was tempered.",
      "It was good and could have been better but was also not indicative of the barometer against which this coach and team ought to be judged.",
      "A home opener against an Arsenal side not yet up to speed was almost the ideal game. It brought low pressure to match expectation levels which have dropped through the actual floor based on last season. A halfway decent performance was always going to be painted in a bright light rather than dull, depressing greys.",
      "The reaction was somewhat driven by the narrative on both sides: it is more interesting for Manchester United to be better this campaign; it is funnier for Arsenal to miss out on the title again. Only one of those possibilities has lasted the week.",
      "Manchester United cannot be trusted. Nor Amorim, who has been furnished with a £200m summer spend amid redundancies and claims of imminent bankruptcy to achieve an arguable slight uptick in performances despite also being granted the silver bullet of a pre-season.",
      "And that absolutely does carry relevance in the face of these results. The increasingly absurd, cruel decisions made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have been justified all along as a necessary and unavoidable part of delivering Manchester United back to where they supposedly should be. If that process fails, what was it all really for?",
      "Nothing has really changed. Manchester United still start games well, still have moments of genuine ingenuity and cohesion going forward, still concede thoroughly preventable goals through a series of individual and collective mistakes in the middle and at the back, and still end with Harry Maguire as their chosen desperate route to goal.",
      "And when almost that entire £200m spend has been reserved for completely remodelling the attack, at least two of those enduring traits going back at least to last season and arguably well beyond are close to unforgivable.",
      "Matheus Cunha was electric before quickly becoming static, his three shots and single pass leading to a shot all coming in the first 15 minutes. Bryan Mbeumo did an awful lot of running for little reward. Some moves were slick, with speed of thought, flicks, a crispness in execution and technique.",
      "But their biggest first-half chances came from a long Altay Bayindir kick and a relatively contentious penalty – it was ultimately stupid defending from Calvin Bassey – which Bruno Fernandes skied.",

      "Even the opening goal was a deflected header from a corner as Leny Yoro followed up an excellent tackle on Josh King but expertly nodding a shot off the back of Rodrigo Muniz.",
      "There was no semblance of Manchester United wanting to capitalise on that fortunate breakthrough. The next four shots all came from Fulham, culminating in an equaliser scored by a substitute only just introduced.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe, Raul Jimenez, Harry Wilson and Antonee Robinson all gave the hosts something different; Diogo Dalot gave the ball away for that goal, Benjamin Sesko offered nothing and Manuel Ugarte was similarly ineffective before Maguire and Ayden Heaven were chucked on to give the impression of maximising set-pieces.",
      "Each new player was sacrificed to a system which doesn’t appear to work, subsumed by the flow of the game rather than dictating it. Manchester United’s changes were timid and Fulham’s were brave – although they had to be as they were chasing the game – and the performances reflected that.",
      "Manchester United are stuck. They have yielded so much to Amorim in serving his specific philosophy and publicly ostracising and depreciating high-value players – hello, unused substitute Kobbie Mainoo – that these results, especially after going deep into the overdraft of goodwill last season, should not be accepted and indeed ought to result in his sacking. Yet they have also gone too far down that road to stop now for fear of having completely wasted their time all along.",
      "It is why the modest improvements will be amplified beyond all meaning while the familiar failings are excused and ignored, at least by those blinded by the past or in a position of power to do anything about it.",
      "But there are precious few signs of actual sustained change. The best Amorim can conjure after being granted a summer reset even he conceded was entirely undeserved is more of the same. He is the anti-Klopp: turning doubters into people who might never believe again.",
      "Everton should know better over Jack Grealish, while Thomas Frank and Brentford are both thriving. But West Ham and Ruben Amorim look utterly hopeless.",

      "This summer there’s been a greater than usual number of Premier League managers openly complaining about their club’s inability to get enough transfer business done, even if most have been more sensibly diplomatic about it than Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The Nottingham Forest boss, Everton’s David Moyes, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner, Newcastle’s Eddie Howe and Fulham’s Marco Silva have all been outspoken about the issue – and the Cottagers make for a particularly interesting case study in the problem now facing a whole fleet of mid-table sides. Even Newcastle, a Champions League side, are struggling with it.",
      "After year upon year of adding to the squad, Fulham have had an uncharacteristically quiet summer transfer window. There’s something almost delightfully Rothmans retro about a Premier League side’s only business being the £500,000 signing of a 34-year-old back-up goalkeeper from Montpellier; their only departures have been a handful of routine free agent releases and loans, mostly to the Championship.",
      "Unlike some clubs, this seems to have nothing to do with Fulham taking a necessarily cautious approach due to the pressure of profit and sustainability rules; their position is reasonably strong compared with some other Premier League clubs.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE ON FOOTBALL365\n👉 Arsenal have a pivotal early-season moment – but is it Gyokeres’ goals or Saka setback?\n👉 Nottingham Forest should steal frustrated Glasner from Crystal Palace to solve ‘spectacular fallout’\n👉 Jack Grealish thrives in Everton spotlight as Brighton do an absolutely massive Brighton",
      "Rather, the issue facing clubs of their stature is one of pure supply and demand.",
      "If you’re newly-promoted and just need upgrades on a Championship squad, or if you have had almost your whole defence poached like Bournemouth, finding players who are an improvement on what you already have is relatively straightforward. If you have wallets and reputations the size of Chelsea’s, Liverpool’s, Manchester City’s, Manchester United’s, Tottenham’s and Arsenal’s, then you can afford to spend very big money on the very best players.",
      "But sides like Fulham are stuck in between. To establish yourself in mid-table security these days, on the whole your recruitment has to be incredibly well-optimised – especially with PSR in effect.",
      "Brentford, Brighton, Bournemouth and Fulham haven’t got where they are over the past few years by just having a flyer on someone they think might be alright – but the huge money available to them compared with even some of the biggest teams in Europe’s other leagues means they have been able to sign players of a standard that would never have been available to them a decade ago.",
      "The thing is that talented footballers are a finite resource – and six year into the TV money reaching truly astronomical levels, those who offer a substantial improvement on what the Premier League’s middle class already have is proving extremely difficult.",
      "Those who would do so are now only affordable to the big boys, or are increasingly leaving the big clubs not to join the mid-table pack, but to ply their trade abroad where they are more likely to find a club that can compete for trophies: Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford, Jarrell Quansah, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, even Tyler bloody Morton. Thankfully for Fulham here, they had an exception to call on: Emile Smith Rowe, who signed from Arsenal last year.",
      "It does not help those clubs’ managers that for the same reasons, you really have to stuff things up big time to find yourself drawn into a relegation battle with the three sides coming up from the Championship.",
      "Chairmen and directors of football are now in a position where playing it safe and looking after their PSR position for the next transfer window is a far more sensible decision than spunking a load of cash on a punt and a hunch – especially when the same problem also affects the clubs immediately around you in the table.",
      "Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing depends on what you want from your football. Those supply problem means those who do manage to find gems at an affordable price will still be at an advantage. But it feels retrospectively inevitable that things would start to settle down at some point, and the Premier League, at least in mid-table, would return to being primarily about which clubs put their existing resources to best use.",
      "For purists who are more interested in tactics, coaching and academy graduates than they are in being able to brag about having won the transfer window on social media, that might not be the worst thing; it makes the football much more about managerial battles of wits rather than who can use Wyscout most effectively.",
      "The good news for those Fulham fans who are frustrated by their lack of transfer movement is that Marco Silva showed last year that he has grown to be a very savvy Premier League manager capable of getting results.",
      "Here, his introduction of Smith Rowe from the bench came at the perfect moment, with Fulham applying increasing pressure in search of an equaliser and just needing that finishing touch in the box. Silva has made those kind of substitutions a specialty: they’ve scored 19 from the bench since the beginning of last season, the most of any top-flight club.",
      "We’re not surprised by that stat at all. Fulham’s push towards the European qualification places last season was built on their shrewd manager making them extremely organised, disciplined and difficult to play against – traits they exhibited again in this game. The only (admittedly glaring) exceptions were in dealing with crosses, such as Calvin Bassey’s bizarre decision to turn into a judoka and hand the visitors a clear-cut penalty that Bruno Fernandes then blasted over the bar, and letting Leny Yoro rise unchallenged at a set piece to force the opener.",
      "But it’s bad news for league table mobility, and the chances of a side like Fulham closing the gap on the long-established wealthy elite are minimal. To do that, they need to upgrade their attacking options from the serviceable-but-not-outstanding players they already have. It certainly would have made the difference here, with Fulham firmly on top after drawing back level but unable to find a winner.",
      "Unfortunately, those kinds of players are the most problematic of all amid that supply and demand issue – two of the best from the middle reaches of the Premier League, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, lined up against Fulham for Manchester United here.",
      "That kind of complaint is nothing new; football has ever been thus. But that’s the problem with being fabulously wealthy: it doesn’t really matter if you’re ranking yourself against your even richer acquaintances.",

      "The Premier League of today is missing the antic energy, the pure fun of those lovable upstarts, the late 80s/early 90’s Wimbledon teams. Antagonistic manager, unlikable owner Sam/Stan, ball in the mixer, hilarious disciplinary record, scoring loads of scrappy goals from corners. I love that Arteta has attempted to recreate that style and bring fun and joy back to our sterile football world. He truly is a student of the game.",

(which I think is what you get by spending marginally less than a billion quid?) but I say why protest? You’re living the dream! Watching Arsenal every week is not a torturous slog akin to a five hour documentary on making paint, in Romanian, with no subtitles, no! It is pure, golden nostalgia. A throwback to a simpler time.",

The endless grind was all worth it! I can hear the Emirates quietly singing now; “One trophy… to the Arsenal! One Trophy!’\nDrew, LA. (*to be fair to Wimbledon, they also achieved 3 promotions as well as the FA Cup triumph in the same time frame as Arteta has had, don’t want to cause any controversy with this missive.)",

      "Spurs ‘look mightily decent’ despite ‘Levy absolutely Levy’ing this transfer window\nI said it earlier this week in the mailbox and I’ll say it again now – after what was a calm and fuss-free performance from Spurs – but having your players play in their actual position with the correct set up is an understated element.",
      "Of course, conceding a record 497 goals and finishing one place above the relegation zone will always have the ‘your defence is sh*t’ line thrown at you. Negative. It was always the set up. These are very good players and, despite my reservations of Vic as a truly elite goalie, this back 5 has genuine potential to be very miserly indeed.",
      "Hard to get too excited after beating ‘just’ Burnley. And some may even argue that Spurs v City doesn’t count much either, because we have some curse over Pep, but I’m getting semi-excited. Not a semi though, don’t worry.",
      "It’s been a horrible week for Spurs on the old internet. This whole Eze thing has got the fanbase evoking Sol Campbell emotions. Which is weird. Eze, an Arsenal fan and once at their academy, decides to sign for *check notes*, oh, Arsenal. Hardly a f***ing surprise is it.",
      "Let me give you some advice, stay off socials and just watch the footy. It might leave you feeling happier and lighter.",
      "Anyway, despite Levy absolutely Levy’ing this transfer window – no MGW, Eze, Rodrygo, Rogers, Paz or the million others we’ve been linked with – we’ve got Frank coaching the team to play as a team and making us look mightily decent, even without key creative players in Madders and Kulu. He’s even got Richy looking like an actual football player, which he has very rarely done in a Lilywhite top.",
      "I’m not sure we get anyone else in. If we do, it’s probably underwhelming. The challenge will be when we are playing multiple games per week. For now, though, we look like a very decent prospect. I expect the top 4 to be Pool, City, Ars*nal and Ch*lsea. 5th? Who knows. Could we? Maybe. Qualification for a European comp would definitely represent success this season. That plus the CL and FA Cup. F*** it, and the league cup.",

      "And then Liverpool paying 120M+ for Isak, after spending 110M on wirtz. Good players but not anywhere box office enough for that money.",
      "For the most part, English clubs pay Gucci prices for Uniqlo players. And the media happily plays along saying we can’t compete with the Reals, Barcas and PSGs. Sometimes I miss Woodward, at least he had the courage to go after Galacticos. And he brought over Zlatan, Pogba and Ronaldo to EPL. If only the others could aim higher.\nGaurav MUFC Amsterdam",

      "Isak, Coutinho debate\nSo Dave AFC thinks that because Liverpool sold a player for a large fee that didn’t work out for the buying club, Liverpool fans should not be at all concerned about paying a large fee for a player that… might not work out for the buying club.",
      "Logic not your strong point, I guess.",
      "Also, ftr, there is no comparison between Coutinho whilst playing for Liverpool and Isak in present day. Coutinho was far better – the conversation of the time was whether he or Hazard was better… and then they both went to Spain and flopped. Often, players don’t perform as well out of the environment that made them stars. Doesn’t mean they weren’t utterly fabulous for those clubs in the Premier League in a way that Isak can’t claim to be after just one season or so of superb football. If he can do it for, say, 5 years in a row, then sure.",
      "Also worth remembering that Newcastle are demanding 150% of the current British transfer record, and Liverpool are offering as an opening offer 110% of it. It’s not as if anyone is being stingy here.\nJon, Bridgwater.",
      "",
      "Isak, promises and perspectives…\nOn Isak. People keep pointing at the Coutinho deal like it somehow makes £150m for Isak reasonable. Come on. The Coutinho fee was Barca losing their minds after PSG nicked Neymar. Liverpool didn’t set a trend, they just cashed in and we’ve been laughing about it ever since. That doesn’t suddenly mean Isak is “worth” £150m.",
      "Newcastle can value him however they like, but let’s not pretend Isak agrees with them. I’d be stunned if he wasn’t told something along the lines of “if a big bid comes in, we’ll look at it.” A record bid did come in and Newcastle basically said “jog on.” No wonder the lad’s annoyed. Liverpool have already tested the water with £120m talk, and he can see it. If you were him, wouldn’t you feel stitched up?",
      "As for this “Liverpool don’t need another attacker” argument – nonsense. We’ve lost players, spaces need filling. This isn’t disruption, it’s evolution. You refresh a title-winning side or you fall behind. The new signings are bedding in fine, and another attacker doesn’t change that. The whole point is to set the squad up for the long term, not just this season.",
      "And Newcastle “acting like a big club” by clinging on? Please. Real big clubs know when to cash in, reinvest, and come back stronger. Newcastle look terrified of life without Isak because they know they can’t find anyone close. That’s not Liverpool’s problem, it’s theirs.",
      "And while I’m here, my last mail about the racist abuse of Semenyo and the disgraceful comments that followed never got published. Felt like a cop-out. The abuse was vile, but instead of focusing on supporting Semenyo, too many people in your comments used it as another excuse to bash Liverpool. That isn’t rivalry, it’s just bitter nonsense, and it lets the actual racist off the hook.",
      "So, back to football. £150m is silly money, Isak feels let down, Liverpool are evolving, Newcastle are clinging on, and this whole saga is dragging on longer than Odemwingie in a car park. At some point, they’ll either take the cash or they’ll end up with a striker who magically develops calf injuries every other week.\nLJ DUB – LFC stranded in Salford",

      "The pre-Xmas slump starts. This usually runs from October to late March/early April. A series of debilitating losses and appalling performances litter the spiritual home of football, London Road.",
      "Towards the end of the season, performances improve, goals flow and Posh look unbeatable; this leads, in turn, to play-off hopes for the following season.",
      "Most of the first team squad is then sold (nothing new here, Posh have always been a selling club and many alumni have gone on to bigger and better things, with the good wishes of the fans); to give you an idea, 78 goal involvements in the shapes of Poku, Mothersille and Jones went this season.",

      "Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 draw with Fulham dampened optimism around the side and underlined the need for midfield reinforcements, according to Gary Neville.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser in a dramatic game at Craven Cottage cancelled out a contentious own goal by Rodrigo Muniz as Manchester United's wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued following last weekend's 1-0 loss to Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim persisted with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his central pairing, with the latter missing a first-half penalty as Kobbie Mainoo remained an unused substitute.",
      "\"[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can't continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.",
      "\"I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.",
      "\"He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he's fourth-choice really.",
      "\"That means that they are going to need to get something sorted because it's going to be a problem.",
      "\"The two in there do get exposed when that front three are just a little bit higher and that back five get pushed back a bit.",
      "\"Those gaps, those acres of space seem to open up, and I thought United got cut through quite a few times in the second half.",
      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he [Amorim] is going to have to sort it out.\"",
      "For the second week in a row, Neville felt Manchester United's performance worsened with Amorim's substitutions, one of which saw Benjamin Sesko thrown on early in the second half.",
      "The Slovenia international, a £73.7m signing from RB Leipzig who also appeared from the bench against Arsenal, was unable to make an impact as Manchester United struggled to find attacking momentum.",
      "\"I said this last week and it's a little bit worrying: Fulham got a lot stronger when they made their substitutions, I actually thought United got worse when they made theirs,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Sesko, at the moment, let's just say it, he's nowhere near in terms of fitness or just getting up to speed.\"",
      "Neville feels the striker will need to be given more minutes to build his fitness, starting in Wednesday's Carabao Cup second-round tie away to Grimbsy Town.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him,\" said Neville. \"Last week, I was saying, 'look, let's just get him straight in'.",
      "\"He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.",
      "\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football.",
      "\"What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "\"The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes allowed his penalty to distract him during the game.",
      "\"I think he let it impact him,\" said Neville. \"I thought he let it get to him. When he came out for the second half, he was still talking to the referee.",
      "\"I know that can happen, but I think you can see in his face sometimes with Bruno that he wears his heart on his sleeve and it was quite clear that obviously he's desperately disappointed about missing the penalty in the way in which he did.",
      "\"Sometimes, if a goalkeeper saves it you might think, 'OK, that happened', but he's smashed it over the bar, and then there was this idea that the referee disrupted his rhythm.",
      "\"It was a complete accident. Obviously the referee was trying to walk back towards the players coming in.",
      "\"He just seemed to let it impact him in the game and I think that's just something that shouldn't have happened really, but that wasn't the biggest problem out there for United today.\"",

      "Fulham held Man Utd to a 1-1 draw on an afternoon of refereeing controversy; Leny Yoro forced a Rodrigo Muniz own goal after pushing Calvin Bassey in the back; Bassey and Silva both felt it was a clear foul, with the Fulham defender also giving away a penalty for a shove on Mason Mount",
      "Monday 25 August 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Calvin Bassey and Marco Silva both felt Manchester United's opener at Fulham should have been ruled out for a clear push by Leny Yoro in the build-up - on an afternoon of officiating controversy at Craven Cottage.",
      "In the pulsating 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage, Yoro appeared to have two hands in the back of Fulham defender Bassey as he met a United corner, before forcing a Rodrigo Muniz own goal. VAR Darren England approved the goal after a brief check.",
      "But Bassey felt referee Chris Kavanagh \"will be disappointed\" when they look back at the decision - especially as the Fulham defender was penalised for a shove on Mason Mount in the first half which gave United a penalty - that Bruno Fernandes missed.",
      "\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He [Yoro] has got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.",
      "\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.\"",
      "\"I cannot understand it. I would love to explain everything to you from the first whistle to the last. But I don't have this. It's not my job, I don't want to go in this direction for everything that went on this afternoon at Craven Cottage.\"",
      "Analysing the United goal on co-commentary duty, Gary Neville said: \"If I was Fulham, I would be asking about the two hands in Bassey's back.",
      "\"Both hands on the back and Yoro is lucky to get away with that, but he will not care.\"",
      "Bassey was also at the centre of VAR controversy as he was accused by the officials of bringing down Mount in the penalty area.",
      "As per PGMOL guidance, referees will award more penalties for holding this season - in an attempt to crack down on grappling at set-pieces.",
      "Referee Kavanagh did not award the shove on Mount in real time but - two minutes after the incident, the official was sent to the VAR monitor during the next available break in play.",
      "\"I still think it's harsh,\" said Bassey about the incident. \"I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.",
      "\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.",
      "\"It's hard. Sometimes, when you feel the contact early, you go down and the ref can give you a foul. When you're in the game and the ball's there to be won, sometimes you're trying to get to the ball as quickly as possible and you've got to get the man out the way.",
      "\"There's a fine line between giving a foul away and getting away with it. On another day, maybe the ref doesn't look at it. We as players just have to try to be clever.",
      "\"I tried to communicate with the ref because I knew the block was coming. I told him, on every corner, 'watch the blocks, watch the blocks', but he made his decision. It's something to learn, just be a bit more streetwise and smart with it.\"",
      "Asked if he was relieved at Fernandes then missing the penalty, Bassey replied: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"",
      "There was even controversy as Fernandes stepped up to take the spot-kick, with the United captain colliding with referee Kavanagh in the build-up.",
      "Analysing the incident on co-commentary duty, Neville said: \"He picked the ball up, and maybe the referee has given him a bump by accident. And he goes back, it unnerved him a little bit.",
      "\"I thought it was because the referee was adjusting the players on the edge of the box, but [a few seconds later] he was still having a go at the referee, Fernandes - as he feels it was a little bit clumsy. That is maybe what put him off.\"",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty.",
      "\"I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",
      "Asked for his take on the incident, United boss Ruben Amorim said: \"I think he's not used to missing a penalty. He knows that every moment in this context can have a huge impact on the team.",
      "\"I felt that during the game he was not so happy, not so involved, because he had so much responsibility and he felt the missed penalty was huge for us.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes were purring early on at Craven Cottage. Cunha went close three times. The quartet linked up with speed and precision around the box. They looked sharp.",
      "But it didn't last once Fulham settled and stifled Casemiro and Fernandes with their midfield diamond. Ruben Amorim's substitutions also weren't able to have the same impact as Fulham's, Emile Smith Rowe equalising with his first touch.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came off the bench early in the second half but had just one touch in the opposition box - it wasn't a telling one.",
      "Last weekend, United's possession was in the spotlight, racking up 60 per cent against a traditional top-four side for the first time in almost a decade. It helped them get the ball into dangerous areas and fire off 22 shots.",
      "This time it was different, over 10 per cent less as they were out-passed by Fulham, not by much, but with only 10 shots to show from it. Amorim's side remain a work in progess.David Richardson",
      "Jack Grealish received the biggest cheer even before Everton kicked off against Brighton in the first Premier League game at the Hill Dickinson Stadium but the cheers were bigger in the 93rd minute as he left the field after a player-of-the-match performance.",
      "The winger picked up two assists in Everton's 2-0 win - as many as in the previous two seasons combined at Manchester City. Had Dwight McNeil converted a late chance, it would have been a hat-trick of assists for the first time since his Aston Villa days.",
      "\"I hope he has got more of them to come,\" said David Moyes afterwards, acknowledging that Grealish gives this Everton something different. \"The big thing is he ball-carried for us. He retained the ball for us as well which gave us a little bit more composure.\"",
      "It is no great surprise that Grealish showed good technique. The only question was how he would approach this challenge after the disappointment of finding himself surplus to requirements at City. But he showed that he had the stomach for the fight too.",
      "He was tracking back inside two minutes. Putting in a tackle inside his own box just after the hour. \"He was game for it, didn't try to shirk anything, didn't want off after 60 minutes, didn't want any of that,\" said Moyes. \"No chance, he wants to show that he's the real deal.",
      "\"You know, you admire somebody who's saying, he probably has something to prove. I had something to prove, I think, over the years at different times. Sometimes it gives you that challenge that you have to try and be ready to take. Hopefully, Jack is.\"Adam Bate",
      "Anthony Elanga, who? Dan Ndoye is beginning to impress, filling the hole left by the Swede. With two games, he's already registered two goal contributions. After a debut goal against Brentford and an assist against Palace, he became the first Nottingham Forest player to score or assist in both of his first two Premier League games for the club since 1998.",
      "Elanga's attributes were clear and Ndoye perhaps doesn't possess the blistering speed that Newcastle's summer signing has.",
      "However, Ndoye's adaptability will impress Nuno, who can continue to hope for an interchanging and dynamic forward line.",
      "Ndoye's first-half display saw him marshalled out of the game. However, all it took was a tweak from Nuno to switch him and Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ndoye's individual brilliance did the rest to carve out the assist that earned Forest a point.",

      "Within the whirlwind that Crystal Palace have caught themselves up in this summer, it's been too easy to forget the fine work that is still being accomplished at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace continued an unbeaten start to the season.",
      "Whether it's the demotion to the Conference League or Palace's biggest stars being linked and in Eberechi Eze's case, securing a move away, the Eagles have navigated a strong start to the season. Their four games unbeaten are reflective of the mentality Glasner has developed in SE25.",
      "A win in the Community Shield saw Palace fight back to take Premier League Champions Liverpool to penalties. Their opening league fixture at Chelsea saw them controversially denied a point at the home of the world champions.",
      "A first game in Europe followed with Eze's future an acceptable distraction but still Palace secured victory. Against Forest, Palace will feel they dropped two points against a side that scored with their only shot on target. But Oliver Glasner will see the positives in their display.",
      "Their start is a total contrast to the beginnings of last campaign, where a slow start brought Glasner into question. Their recent run represents a growing consistency that is going under the radar.William Bitibiri",
      "To not score a goal from an expected goals figure of 2.46 was quite an achievement by Brighton.",
      "Not since Manchester City created 2.92 at Crystal Palace in March 2022 had a team in the Premier League created such a high xG figure without scoring away from home.",
      "Perhaps the footballing gods were working their magic for Everton on their big day so Brighton didn't really stand a chance but Fabian Hurzeler will be worried about the flakiness of his forwards.",

      "Bruno Fernandes missed a first-half penalty as Manchester United slipped to a 1-1 draw with Fulham after Emile Smith Rowe cancelled out the visitors’ controversial opener.",
      "United are winless in their first two Premier League matches after being beaten by Arsenal last weekend and failing to hold onto their lead at Craven Cottage, with the pressure already building on head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "A Rodrigo Muniz own goal had put them in front just before the hour mark despite United defender Leny Yoro pushing centre-back Calvin Bassey in the back with both hands as he headed a corner in off the Fulham striker.",
      "The incident came after Bassey had been punished in the first half for throwing Mason Mount to the floor at a corner while Man Utd's Luke Shaw bundled over Muniz in the same moment.",
      "The game was stopped one minute and 23 seconds later when the VAR Darren England instructed referee Chris Kavanagh to review the incident, and he awarded a penalty.",
      "Kavanagh was involved further when he accidentally collided with Fernandes as the Man Utd captain was preparing to take the spot kick, which he then smashed over the crossbar, looking to find the top left corner.",
      "Fernandes appeared to be upset with Kavanagh disrupting his pre-penalty routine and said afterwards: \"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment, but that's not an excuse for missing the penalty.\"",
      "United were left to rue the chances they missed in the first half. Matheus Cunha had three shots within the opening 14 minutes, whistling a strike from distance over, side-footing an effort against the right post and then forcing Bernd Leno into a fine save after brilliantly controlling Altay Bayindir's long pass forward.",
      "But Fulham more than played their part in an entertaining game, forcing the nervy Bayindir into two significant saves before Smith Rowe came off the bench and tapped in Alex Iwobi's cross from close range with less than 20 minutes remaining to deservedly earn a point.",
      "Fulham: Leno (7), Tete (7), Andersen (7), Bassey (6), Castagne (6), Berge (6), Lukic (7), Sessegnon (7), King (6), Iwobi (8), Muniz (7).\n\n\nSubs  Wilson (6), Robinson (6), Smith Rowe (7), Jimenez (6)\n\n\nMan Utd: Bayindir (6); Yoro (7), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6); Amad (6), Fernandes (6), Casemiro (6), Dorgu (6); Mbeumo (6), Mount (6), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Dalot (5), Sesko (6), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a), Maguire (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Alex Iwobi",
      "\"I was upset. As a penalty-taker, you have your own routines, your own things that you do.",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty.",
      "\"I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",
      "\"It's the same as my one. It's a foul. He pushed me to stop me from getting to the ball. When the ref looks back on it, he will be disappointed. I can't say too much before I get a fine!",
      "\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He's got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.",
      "\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.",
      "On the penalty award for his foul on Mason Mount: \"I still think it's harsh. I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.",
      "\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.\"",
      "On Bruno Fernandes' penalty miss: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"",
      "\"I think we can do better but we are putting the effort, so that is the most important thing for me. I think we did well in some moments, especially at the beginning of the game.",
      "\"After the goal, we were just thinking about the result. This team needs to win games, so we need to focus on the performance and what we need to do, because if we focus on the results, we forget to do the normal things.",
      "\"We were OK until the goal. We scored and we should do the opposite: have more possession, push the opponent more. We were not smart in that moment.\"",
      "Fulham head coach Marco Silva on whether Man Utd's goal should have been disallowed:",
      "\"Perhaps. Difficult to say something. I think you saw the same as myself. All of the world saw what happened here this afternoon in terms of the VAR decisions. I will not say anything more.",
      "\"I don't have the words to explain things that are impossible to explain. They did unbelievably well when they saw the penalty. The foul on Rodrigo (Muniz) was half of a second after the push from Calvin (Bassey). I think they were amazing and we have to congratulate them.\"",
      "\"We are going to score goals because we are creating so many chances.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is convinced Manchester United's attack will fire this season. The evidence suggests it will. They threatened to run riot in the opening 15 minutes at Fulham, but a concern is how they've faded in games.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes were purring early on at Craven Cottage. Cunha went close three times. The quartet linked up with speed and precision around the box. They looked sharp.",
      "But it didn't last once Fulham settled and stifled Casemiro and Fernandes with their midfield diamond. Ruben Amorim's substitutions also weren't able to have the same impact as Fulham's, Emile Smith Rowe equalising with his first touch.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came off the bench early in the second half but had just one touch in the opposition box - it wasn't a telling one.",
      "Last weekend, United's possession was in the spotlight, racking up 60 per cent against a traditional top-four side for the first time in almost a decade. It helped them get the ball into dangerous areas and fire off 22 shots.",
      "This time it was different, over 10 per cent less as they were out-passed by Fulham, not by much, but with only 10 shots to show from it. Amorim's side remain a work in progess.",
      "Marco Silva deserves a lot of credit for how his Fulham side have battled to start the Premier League season.",
      "Two games with two late goals to rescue a point on both occasions, they could have easily walked away empty-handed.",
      "Silva has been vocal about the need for reinforcements within his squad, with Benjamin Lecomte their only addition throughout the summer, and spoke openly about it after full-time against Manchester United, too.",
      "\"We need to sign two or three players,\" he said in his post-match press conference.",
      "Returns for Antonee Robinson and Ryan Sessegnon, as well as a boost in confidence for Emile Smith Rowe following his goal, will ease the strain on his squad. However, if they want to start converting draws into wins, fresh faces will be needed.",
      "They had the momentum to win this fixture but just lacked the final push in the latter stages of the game.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
