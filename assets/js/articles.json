      "Manchester United star Amad has urged fans to be \"patient\" and claimed that a top five finish would be a \"good season\" for the Red Devils. United are looking to bounce back form their worst ever Premier League campaign last season.",
      "They finished 15th in the league and missed out on a spot in the Champions League after losing 1-0 to Tottenham in the Europa League final. However, Amad remains confident that United will \"win a lot\" under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"I think they have to be patient with us,\" the winger said. \"There's a new manager, with new players and new tactics. We know last season wasn't really good for the team, but I think this season we will win a lot with him (Amorim).",
      "\"And I hope this season that we are going to achieve a lot of good things by the end of the season. A good season will be top five. I hope we can achieve top five at the end of the season.\"",
      "Amad also gave his thoughts on United's transfer business so far, with Matheus Cunha having joined from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo also set to make the move to Old Trafford. \"He's a good player,\" Amad said of Cunha.",
      "\"We need good players in the team and he'll bring a lot to the team. I hope he can give us some different things. Especially last season, we missed a lot of good players in the final third. He scored a lot of goals last season, so I just wish him all the best.\"",
      "And when asked about Mbeumo, he added: \"Of course I'm looking forward to playing with him. We need good players in the team who can bring something to the final third. We are really excited to have them in the team and I hope that together we can give something to the fans at the end of the season because they deserve it.\"",
      "United drew 0-0 with Leeds in their first pre-season friendly on Saturday and Amorim admitted that his side were off the pace. \"It was a pre-season game. The gaps between our sectors was sometimes too big,\" he said.",
      "\"We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and bring the ball. But we created chances. I think Matheus Cunha showed what we need. That he is a player when he receives the ball between the lines can be really aggressive in the direction of the opponents.",
      "\"We watched that during last season in a different team so we expect the same thing. Of course you can see the connection between him and Bruno is still not there but it’s going to be a good connection.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford's patience has paid off and he will be leaving Manchester United for Barcelona, with a loan deal close to being agreed between the two clubs. Rashford has only had eyes for Barca since his loan spell at Aston Villa concluded early due to injury and, barring any hiccups, he will get his way.",
      "The 27-year-old rejected a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia and has been waiting for Barca and United to come to terms over a move. Barcelona were initially slightly reluctant, as they first chased Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams, and then flirted with Liverpool winger Luis Diaz.",
      "But Hansi Flick's side are now keen to sign the United forward, viewing him as an option on the left of their 4-3-3 formation and as a back-up to veteran centre-forward Robert Lewandowski.",
      "Barca's financial struggles in recent years have been well documented and the Catalan giants have been unwilling to sign Rashford permanently straight away. United put a price tag of £40million on Rashford, before placing him Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' alongside Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "United want to sell their unwanted players as quickly as possible in order to help fund a major squad overhaul, which has already seen Matheus Cunha arrive for £62.5m, with Bryan Mbeumo set to follow for £70m.",
      "However, they have agreed to loan Rashford out again on the proviso that Barca pay the entirety of Rashford's wages and they retain an option to buy. That is a significant financial commitment he is paid £325,000-a-week on a contract until June 2028.",
      "Getting that off their wage bill will come as a relief for United, who are also close to agreeing Sancho's move to Juventus in the coming days. United are about to head off on their pre-season tour of the United States and the click is ticking down towards the start of the 2025/26 season.",
      "While Rashford's departure has been in the pipeline for some time, with the striker having fallen out with Amorim over the winter before being loaned to Villa in January, it is still a major deal for both parties.",
      "Rashford came through the United academy and has 138 goals and 77 assists in 426 appearances for his home-town club. He has helped them win the FA Cup and the EFL Cup twice and the Europa League and his exit will mark a significant moment.",
      "Speaking back in December, he said: \"If I know that a situation is already bad I'm not going to make it worse. I've seen how other players have left in the past and I don't want to be that person.",
      "\"When I leave I'll make a statement and it will be from me. When I leave it's going to be 'no hard feelings'. You're not going to have any negative comments from me about Manchester United.

      "United may have signed Mathues Cunha from Wolves and are close to confirming the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford after a protracted saga, but boss Ruben Amorim wants at least two more new faces, as well as needing to shift players out to raise revenue to fund those arrivals.",
      "The failure to secure European football, following United's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, means fewer fixtures next season and therefore a smaller squad required by Amorim.",
      "But it is a squad remains woefully short on quality in key areas, which is why the United boss is so desperate to recruit at least two more signings – a striker and a midfielder – in addition to clearing out the deadwood in Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Saturday's 0-0 draw with newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm underlined the need for United to sign a striker capable of scoring 20-plus goals a season. Mbeumo hit that target last season and Cunha will provide goals as well as some much-needed creativity, but United desperately need a new No.9.",
      "This summer has been one of missed opportunities for United as, one by one, their striker targets have chosen other clubs – a damning indictment of where the fallen giants now find themselves in modern football's new world order, where they have assumed the unwanted role of a faded force.",
      "Liam Delap chose Chelsea over United, Viktor Gyokeres rejected a reunion with his former Sporting Lisbon boss Amorim and is set to join Arsenal, while Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike is close to agreeing a deal with Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "That has left United short on options to fill the No.9 void at the apex of their attack, with Rasmus Hojlund – while willing and industrious – simply not cut out for the role, having toiled for two seasons since his absurdly-inflated £72million move from Atalanta, which has yielded just 26 goals from 95 appearances.",
      "The signings of Cunha and Mbeumo will ease the pressure on United skipper Bruno Fernandes, who carried the side last season and without whom the side would almost certainly have been involved in a battle to stay in the Premier League.",

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich has claimed Sir Alex Ferguson has him to thank for signing club icon Dwight Yorke. The Australian was a team-mate and close friend of Yorke's during their time at Aston Villa in the mid-90s.",
      "It was the summer of 1998 when Sir Alex made his move to bring the Trinidadian striker to Old Trafford after scoring 97 in 284 appearances for Villa. The acquisition of Yorke for £12.6million proved to be a masterstroke as he instantly made a vital impact, netting 29 times during United's historic treble-winning campaign in 1998/99",
      "However, Bosnich has now revealed that the Red Devils were initially on the fence about Yorke due to doubts about his character. That was until the Australian received a phone call from his former United youth coach Eric Harrison and reassured him of his personal qualities.",
      "Speaking on ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster's Fozcast podcast, Bosnich said Yorke was stunned when he heard the news.",
      "\"Eric Harrison originally got in contact with me and asked about him and his character,\" he said. \"At the time, he said there was a debate about whether or not he'd be the right person. I told him, and I told the manager that he'll win you the European Cup and he did.",
      "\"He was the final piece of that jigsaw. I thought with Yorkie coming in, he's something a little bit different. He struck up a really good partnership with Andy Cole and they were phenomenal that year.",

      "After winning the treble, Yorke also bagged his fair share the following term with 23 goals during the 1999/2000 season. One of his best performances for United came in February 2001, when he scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 demolition of Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "He scored 65 goals in 152 appearances for the Premier League giants between 1998 and 2002 before moving to Blackburn Rovers. Yorke and Bosnich were reunited in 1999 during the keeper's ill-fated second stint at United.",
      "Bosnich said the key to getting the best out of the striker was to adopt a soft approach towards him. He added that he passed this advice on to Sir Alex ahead of Yorke's arrival at United.",
      "\"Dwight is as tough as they come, but he's very emotional too,\" he said. \"In a dressing room scenario, you have to put your arm around him if you want the best out of him and I told this to Fergie.",
      "\"It was sort of a love-hate a little bit with him and Ron Atkinson [at Villa]. Then when Brian Little came in, he really put his arm around him. That really brought the best out of him and he was scoring 20 plus goals.\"",

The Gunners have been in negotiations with Sporting for some time over the structure of the transfer fee for Gyokeres and may have left the door open for their Premier League rivals.",
      "Gyokeres is desperate to leave Sporting in the summer transfer window and things have got increasingly bitter between the Swedish striker and his current employers. After threatening to go on strike, the ex-Coventry player appeared to have got his wish when Arsenal chose him over Benjamin Sesko.",
      "It emerged last weekend that Arsenal and Sporting had verbally agreed a deal in principle worth an initial £55million plus £8.6m in add-ons and bonuses. However, continued discussions involving Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta and Sporting chiefs have so far failed to yield a full agreement.",
      "The sticking point is the way the deal is structured and the delays have meant that Arsenal have been unable to sign Gyokeres in time for their pre-season tour of Asia. While this appeared to simply be a bump in the road on Gyokeres’ way to north London, it could now become something more serious, with Portuguese media dropping a bombshell on Sunday.",
      "SIC now reports that Arsenal’s deal is ‘increasingly at risk’. They say Arsenal’s fixed offer is set at €63.5m (£55m), which rises to €70m (£60m) because Gyokeres' agent waived his €6.5m (£5.6m) commission. And that rigid structure is not acceptable for Sporting.",
      "Record, meanwhile, says United have now dropped a new bid on the table which is worth between €70-80million (£60-69m). The newspaper notes that Gyokeres - who played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting - still only wants to join Arsenal, but it is still a curveball in the transfer saga.",
      "The 27-year-old is under contract with Sporting until June 2028 and Sporting president Federico Varandas has been happy to play hard ball in negotiations – and make his stance plain in public. “If they don't want to pay Viktor's fair market value, we're very comfortable with that for the next three years,\" he said recently.",
      "\"This strategy is also making it more complicated for the player to leave. Nobody is above the interests of the club. Whoever they are. We're calm. Everything will be resolved with the market closing, a hefty fine and an apology to the group.”",
      "Gyokeres has indeed refused to report for pre-season training to incur a fine. \"One thing you should already know is me better,\" Varandas previously stated. \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",

      "Instead, he opted for a switch to Spain with Almeria, but the move hasn't gone as planned for the midfielder. His failure to break into the first team is a huge fall from grace after he was tipped for big things when he arrived on the red side of Manchester.",
      "Upon signing for Almeria, he expressed his optimism to RTVS at the time, saying: \"I have spent the last days in Spain, where my steps will continue. They will follow in the first Spanish league, La Liga. I have high expectations, it will be a new experience, a new country.\"",
      "However, his journey with Almeria got off to a rocky start when he was sent off on his debut for the reserves, despite their 3-0 victory over El Palo FC. His dismissal came after he had waited four months to get onto the pitch for the B team.",

      "While their stance backfired on that occasion, they did the same when it came to negotiations over players like Paul Pogba, Harry Maguire, Fred and Jorginho. The first three of those names ended up at Old Trafford.",
      "United's lack of joined-up thinking continued when Berrada arrived last summer. More than £200million was lavished on Levy Yoro, Manuel Ugarte, Matthijs De Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui - and in November the decision was taken to sack manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim was recruited from Sporting Lisbon on Berrada's insistence - despite the Portuguese's three-at-the-back philosophy being an awkward fit for the squad he inherited.",
      "With United more than £1billion in debt and facing issues complying with Profit and Sustainability Regulations, the club are unable to spend their way out of the mess that has been created by more than a decade of gross mismanagement.",
      "When Amorim’s team lost to Spurs in the Europa League Final in May and missed out on Champions League qualification, the need to sell unwanted players to raise money became even more acute.",
      "Cashing in on Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia would have potentially raised hundreds of millions of pounds in normal circumstances.",
      "But Amorim’s decision to group them in a so called bomb-squad, refusing to allow them to train with the players he wants to take into the new season and instructing them to report for fitness sessions late in the afternoon when the chosen ones have left the building at Carrington means interested clubs are playing a waiting game in the knowledge that United are being held to ransom by the policy.",
      "Berrada must find a way of breaking the deadlock - and quickly."

      "Ruben Amorim gave an unofficial debut to £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha, who was one of the only positive takeaways from the match. Otherwise it followed a familiar theme for the club, who finished a lowly 15th last season and are expected to improve in 2025/26.",
      "Hojlund managed 10 goals in 52 appearances for United last season, only four of which came in the league, and he often cut a frustrated figure up front. That continued on Saturday in the Swedish capital – and the Danish striker wasn’t shy in letting his team-mates know.",

The Portuguese full-back wasn’t interested in hearing his moans and simply ignored him and jogged on.",
      "The lack of a link-up between the two United players was evident later in the game too. Dalot did find Hojlund with a cross, only for his header to be deflected, while the young striker was shouting at Dalot again later on after he opted to pass to Patrick Dorgu instead of him.",

Amorim used the first game of pre-season to give no fewer than 24 players a run-out in the Stockholm sunshine after ordering Marcus Rashford and the rest of his misfits to stay behind at Old Trafford.",
      "There were debuts for £62.5million Matheus Cunha and £7million Diego Leon in the Strawberry Arena. Bryan Mbeumo will join the squad in the United States this week after the Reds agreed to meet Brentford’s £70million valuation of the Cameroon international almost two months after the London club made it clear their asking price was non-negotiable.",
      "Amorim will now be hoping that Sir Jim Ratcliffe will free up some cash to sign the goal-scoring striker he craves after Barcelona opened talks about taking Rashford to Spain for the season with a £50million option to buy making the deal a no-brainer for United.",
      "If they can also raise some cash by flogging Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia then perhaps there will be even more wriggle room for new recruits. United certainly need the rebuild to continue at pace.",
      "Amorim was only spared a relegation battle last season by the dire form of the three promoted clubs who eventually went down. There was certainly no obvious gap in quality between the two different teams he sent out in each half to face Daniel Farke’s Football League champions.",
      "A pedestrian first period ended with Casemiro’s cross flicking off Leeds skipper Ethan Ampadu and glancing the crossbar. But after the kick-off had to be delayed by 10 minutes due to crowd congestion, thrills and spills were at a premium for the 43,345 Scandinavian fans who fancied taking in one of those rivalries that make the Premier League so compelling.",
      "There were Leeds debuts for Jaka Bijol and Lukas Nmecha, with fellow new-boys Sean Longstaff, Gabriel Gudmundsson and Sebastian Bornauw following suit in the second half after starting on the bench.",
      "Leeds will strengthen further this week when German midfielder Anton Stach arrives from Hoffenheim for £17million. Farke also rang the changes after the break, with Hollywood funnyman Will Ferrell, a minority investor at Elland Road, travelling to Sweden to offer his support from the posh seats.",
      "Ferrell might have had reason to smile in the second half as Leeds carved out decent chances for Jayden Bogle and substitute Largie Ramazani. Both times, keeper Tom Heaton came to United’s rescue with saves that illustrated why he has signed a one-year contract extension at the grand old age of 39.",
      "Amorim made 11 changes at half-time and was forced into another 18 minutes from time when Harry Maguire limped off with a knock. United should have won the contest two minutes from time, but Robbie Mainoo headed against the crossbar and Ayden Heaven fired his follow-up straight at Leeds keeper Illan Meslier from point-blank range.",

      "The ‘bomb squad’ approach has proven contentious at United – but it is about to bear fruit with Sancho, with a transfer to Juventus a matter of days away. The winger had appeared set to join Chelsea at the end of the season after spending the campaign on loan with the Blues.",
      "However, Chelsea turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, deciding they would rather stump up a £5million fee than pay £25m for his services. Sancho then agreed personal terms with Fenerbahce over a transfer, only for that move to collapse.",

      "Juve initially offered £15m (€17m), but are now ready to meet United’s asking price of €25m (£21.6m) – a figure which includes easily achievable add-ons and severance pay for Sancho, who is halving his salary to move to Turin.",

      "The former Wolves man was dynamic and was one of the few players threatening to make things happen in the final third. He started proceedings as the left-sided No 10 in Amorim's preferred system and immediately looks right at home.",
      "Amad was one of the few shining lights in a difficult campaign for Manchester United and he looked bright again in Stockholm.",
      "But where does he fit best in United's current shape? He started here as the right wing-back but swapped positions with Toby Collyer to take up the right-sided No 10 spot. The uber-talented star has the attributes to thrive further up the pitch but it will be intriguing to see where he plays with Bryan Mbeumo incoming.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs are as good as wingers at time given how high they are up the pitch. Amad has caught the eye in an attacking role in the past, though. Whatever the manager's decision, one thing is for sure: Amad should surely be on of the first names on Amorim's teamsheet this coming season.",
      "United's game at the Strawberry Arena gave fans an early glimpse of their new wing-back, just 18. And Leon showed why he is now set to stay and compete for a place in Amorim's team instead of Harry Amass, who is poised to head out on loan.",
      "He looked comfortable high up and pitch and crafted one chance for Chido Obi in a lacklustre first half with a neat no-look pass. Leon has obviously been signed with the future in mind, but as far as first impressions go, this was positive.",
      "Yes, this point isn't exactly hot off the press, but Manchester United really need to kick into action in the transfer market.",
      "Their first half performance was reminiscent of plenty of United's games last season bar a brief flurry of penalty box action late in the half. If Amorim is to succeed, then he needs to be backed with signings.",
      "Cunha and Leon looked bright and Mbeumo was one of the Premier League's top attackers last season. He and Cunha in particular will help United no end, but they need much more if they are to have a successful season. Yes, funds are tight so that means player sales are needed. But United need to get moving on that front if they are to give Amorim the tools he requires to rebuild this team properly. Over to you, then, Ineos.",
      "Listen, it's the first game of pre-season: and it's certainly not all doom and gloom for Manchester United.",
      "The likes of Amad, Leon, Ayden Heaven, Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo and Bendito Mantito to name just a few are evidence that the future is bright for United, even if things aren't all rosy at the moment. United just need the right signings to help balance things out and push them back among the Premier League's elite."

      "Barcelona and Manchester United are getting close to a deal which will see Marcus Rashford join the Spanish giants on loan with an option to make the move permanent.",
      "The United academy graduate, 27, is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and spent the second half of the 2024-25 campaign on loan at Aston Villa after falling out with Ruben Amorim. The talented forward was always likely to move again this summer and it's no secret that Barcelona has long been Rashford's preferred destination.",
      "And after weeks of speculation, it seems as though Rashford - part of Amorim's five-man 'bomb squad' at United's Carrington training ground - will finally get his wish.",
      "Talks over an initial loan move between the clubs have begun, with the outline of an agreement reached - although the finer details still need to be sorted. Rashford's signing has already been approved by the Barca boss, Hansi Flick, after talks with the England international.",
      "Rashford would initially head to the Nou Camp on loan with an option included for the arrangement to be made permanent at a later date.",
      "Although United would prefer to offload Rashford permanently, a loan move will still benefit them in their bid to raise funds for further incoming transfers and they have agreed to the terms of the proposed deal, with talks now in the final stages.",
      "Rashford is one of the club's highest earner on £325,000-a-week; Villa paid two-thirds of that package plus bonuses when they signed him on loan back in January.",
      "The deal will also benefit Barcelona, whose financial difficulties in recent years have been well documented.",
      "The Spanish giants have been seeking a new left winger all summer and had agreed personal terms with Nico Williams over a transfer before the Athletic Club star had a late change of heart and opted to stay put.",
      "Barca have also pursued Luis Diaz but Liverpool insist the Colombia star is not for sale.",
      "When he was asked about signing a new winger this summer back in May, Flick said: “This is what we have talked about with the club. In the last matches maybe we did not have a lot of options in that position… so we have to bring more options to the team and more quality. This is the job from Deco, is clear, and I will support him.”",
      "When he was asked about interest in Rashford and Diaz specifically, Flick added: “I don’t want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players. I like them and we’ll see what happens.”"

      "Shortly before Manchester United faced Leeds United in their first pre-season friendly in Stockholm, Marcus Rashford took to social media. Rather curious timing, you might say.",
      "Rashford is not part of the 29-man United squad in Sweden for the fixture. The England international, back with the club after falling out with Ruben Amorim and spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, is one of five senior stars who make up part of the so-called 'bomb squad'.",
      "He and the other four - Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia - have all been told they won't train with the first team as they explore opportunities to leave Old Trafford. The fivesome are able to use the club's Carrington training ground, but have been asked to do so when the first-team and head coach Amorim have headed home.",
      "Rashford is keen to find a move abroad. Barcelona is his preference and the two clubs are in negotiations, with Hansi Flick keen on a deal being done after speaking to the 27-year-old.",
      "An offer has been made over a potential loan deal with an option to buy at the end of the season. That suits Rashford and may be the best that United can get. As it stands, they've agreed, with talks now between all sides looking to nail down terms.",
      "Rashford has been very keen in recent weeks to share images on social media of himself putting in the hard graft in the gym. His latest, on Saturday shortly before the Leeds fixture, was simply entitled: \"The lab\".",
      "It marks the third such upload featuring clips of Rashford's workout regime since the beginning of last week. Several United teammates have responded to these posts - and the latest was no different.",
      "Antony, Diogo Dalot, Ethan Wheatley, Godwill Kikonki, Joe Hugill and Joshua Zirkzee all gave the latest upload a like.",
      "Antony, like Rashford, has been omitted from the squad to take on Leeds. The same applies to Ethan Wheatley and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "United say Zirkzee, the £34million summer signing 12 months ago, is dealing with a \"small issue\".",
      "Several of the club's former players have also shown Rashford their support. They include Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Brandon Williams, Donny van de Beek, Facundo Pellistri and Jesse Lingard.",

      "Overall, 24 players were used as Tyler Fredricson and Jack Fletcher emerged for minutes in the second half. United fly to Chicago, their base while they are in the United States, on Tuesday and should have Bryan Mbeumo on board their flight.",
      "Here are five talking points from their first friendly in Sweden:",
      "Each player will be at different stages of their fitness and the rotational XI indicated that. The second XI for the second half was arguably stronger.",
      "It was still mystifying that Amorim opted for Toby Collyer as one of the two playmakers when it is the one area of the squad where United have a surfeit of options.",
      "Collyer said on tour last season he needed to improve on his ball-work. Shifting from a deep role to such an advanced position for a central midfielder by trade is unlikely to do him any favours. Collyer looked as lost as a playmaker as he did at left back against Barnsley last year.",
      "Midfield is one of United's weakest areas. The brains trust possibly believe they can cope with a quintet of Collyer, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo in a season devoid of European football. United cannot shift Casemiro, which is partly blocking an upgrade to that department.",
      "Fernandes has excelled from deep in the past and United are banking on him to carry the midfield. Ugarte was dropped for the Europa League final, Mainoo lost his first-team status several months ago, Casemiro could be redundant with no UEFA competition to participate in and Collyer has started three games against teams from League One, Scotland and Romania.",
      "Mainoo lined up in midfield in the second half and Amorim has to make his mind up on where he will primarily play next season.",
      "Shortly before the hour, Diogo Dalot charged into the Leeds third and played the ball into the channel for Rasmus Hojlund. Hojlund may have strayed offside and nothing came of his backheel.",
      "Before Hojlund got back to his feet, he was ready to let rip at Dalot. \"F**k's sake,\" he shouted, clearly irked that Dalot had not passed the ball sooner.",
      "It is not the first time Hojlund has vented at Dalot's end product. The most infamous flashpoint was in San Sebastian in March. Dalot was apologetic that night. On this occasion, he kept on running and blanked out the noise from Hojlund.",
      "Amad is the one winger who has survived United's cull as he has the defensive discipline to complement his attacking instincts. He has never been a problem for United, either, unlike Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Amorim said he prefers to use the Ivory Coast winger closer to goal but he played Amad on the flank in Sweden. Bryan Mbeumo is waiting in the wings and time will tell if he is used on the wing.",
      "Matheus Cunha was fouled a couple of times on his first United start and one or two other challenges arguably warranted a stoppage. Cunha got plenty of attention at Wolves and markers will doubtless be tighter and nastier now he is United's No.10.",
      "Fernandes was quick to impose himself on his United debut in February 2020 and Cunha is not a shrinking violet. He was well within his rights to rebuke Chido Obi for shooting while off balance when Cunha was well poised to at least hit the target as the ball rolled towards him. Obi offered an apologetic low-five.",
      "Even from 45 minutes that may have sent plenty of viewers to sleep, there were glimpses that Cunha is United material.",
      "Sean Longstaff and Daniel James lined up together for United. Leeds United. If Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had it his way, it would have been for Manchester United six years ago.",
      "United's pursuit of Longstaff ended in 2019 when Newcastle quoted them £50million. James did join the club and he has regressed to his true level since that purple patch at the beginning of his Old Trafford career, signing for relegation fodder, suffering relegation and a couple of seasons in the Championship."

      "He was deployed alongside Bruno Fernandes in midfield in Bucharest, with Christian Eriksen and Mainoo preferred in the two No.10 positions.",

      "Pre-season is all about experimenting ahead of the competitive action so Ruben Amorim is entitled to test the water in matches where the outcome means very little.",
      "However, the United head coach's decision to deploy Collyer further forward was perhaps his way of trying to help Fernandes. Following the addition of Cunha, the feeling throughout the summer has been that the United captain will start the 2025/26 campaign in midfield.",
      "Fernandes regularly dropped deep in the second half of last season and was arguably more effective. He enjoyed a real purple patch in March when he was stationed as one of the two No.8s.",
      "With Bryan Mbeumo closing in on a move to Old Trafford, he is set to battle it out with Amad to land the right-sided No.10 spot. It is unlikely Amorim considers that position as Collyer's long-term habitat.",
      "Widely considered as a midfielder that tends to sit deep and try and marshal proceedings, it would be a drastic shift if he was to suddenly be transformed into a playmaker.",
      "With four more friendlies still to come, Amorim has plenty of time to experiment. However, the closer United get to the end of their pre-season schedule, the more likely it is the former Sporting Lisbon boss will field an XI that resembles something close to the one he has in mind for the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "United's starting XI in Stockholm had a rotational feel to it. As interesting as Amorim's decision to start Collyer in such an advanced role was, it is likely he did it to try and get another look at Fernandes as a No.8.",

      "\"Could be extra conditioning or simply having the players meet their individual thresholds - the players were wearing our GPS in-game, so the coaches were monitoring in real-time on the sideline.\"",
      "United's players will be looking to reach full fitness ahead of a daunting Premier League opener at home to Arsenal on August 17. The Reds also face tough league fixtures against Manchester City and Chelsea in the opening two months of 2025/26."

      "Bendito Mantato",
      "The 17-year-old is highly thought of at Old Trafford and of all the youngsters, it was the winger who Amorim handed a shirt to when he rang the changes at the break.

The midfielder has struggled to nail down a place in the first XI since Amorim's arrival but operated in the pivot position against Leeds and caught the eye. A year ago the midfielder was part of an England squad that nearly won the European Championships, he will hope to hit similar highs for club and country in the upcoming campaign.",

That school of thought will not have altered based on his showing in Scandinavia.",

The Chelsea academy graduate will be hoping for an extended run in the Portuguese's squad having endured an injury-hit start to his career at Old Trafford.",

      "\"You could see a few of the changes in the club that were set in motion then that might still be affecting the club today. As soon as Sir Alex left, you could tell there was a change of atmosphere in the club.",
      "\"It had gone from having a real family sort of feel. You can look back with rose-tinted glasses, can't you, but I think I was privileged enough to be there in a very special era and that was in the twilight years of that period.",
      "\"I suppose I was just privileged to be there then. I can't speak too much for what has gone on over the last ten years or so, but I think times have changed, and I was just happy to spread my wings and was realistic enough to recognise that if you have not made it by about 20, you're probably not going to.",
      "\"You have to go elsewhere and try to forge a career for yourself elsewhere.\"",
      "Grimshaw arrived at Deepdale nursing an injury that sidelined him for six months. It meant his Preston debut was delayed until the opening weekend of the 2016/17 campaign.",
      "His time at the Championship club was difficult, limiting him to just eight appearances. He joined Chesterfield on loan for the second half of the 2016/17 campaign.",
      "Having left United to drop into the Championship to try and make a name for himself, Grimshaw could have easily felt a sense of disappointment at finding himself in League One just 12 months later. However, he is adamant he has no regrets about how his United career came to an end.",
      "\"I suppose at the time I got to an age where I had played plenty of reserve team football and had trained plenty enough with the first-team as well,\" he explained. \"But I got to an age when I got fed up of playing in the reserves and I wanted to go and test myself.",
      "\"You want to prove yourself in senior football and I had the opportunity to go to Motherwell on loan [in September 2015] and I took it. I took it with both hands, to be honest.",
      "\"I fancied getting out there and testing myself and I played 15 games at Motherwell while on loan and did relatively well and Preston then signed me from Man United. It would have been nice to have had an appearance for the first-team, but at the same time, I was more than realistic enough to know that those who make it into the first-team are few and far between.",
      "\"I definitely have no complaints. It would have been nice. A few of my pals who were in digs with me stayed and did get a couple of appearances, so you never know if I would have stayed. But there are certainly no regrets.\"",
      "Grimshaw, who has been without a club since leaving Dundee United in August last year, has fond memories of his time at United. He was in the company of household names throughout his time at Old Trafford, not least Ferguson.",
      "The legendary United boss, who retired at the end of the 2012/13 campaign, made a lasting impression on Grimshaw, who was often impressed by the high standards he set for everyone associated with the club.",
      "Grimshaw recalled: \"I do remember going into his office, him sitting me down and United offering me a two-year deal. It is a very special memory.",
      "\"His persona and his aura was incredible, but he was just so down to earth, really. Whenever I had any dealings with him around the club, he would always be speaking to anyone in the club like he spoke to Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "\"He would be speaking to the kit staff or the chefs like he did to his first-team players. I think that is certainly one reason why they had so much success over his time at Man United.\"",
      "After returning to Preston following his loan spell at Chesterfield in the second half of the 2016/17 season, Grimshaw, who has also flexed his muscles at right-back during his career, departed Deepdale again at the end of the 2017 summer transfer window, returning to former loan club Motherwell on a permanent basis.",
      "It was the beginning of a successful marriage between himself and the Scottish Premiership outfit. Grimshaw spent five years at Fir Park, playing more than 100 games for the club.",
      "Motherwell are one of three Scottish clubs Grimshaw has played for in his career, also representing Dundee United and Greenock Morton.",
      "\"It might sound a bit daft, but I think the Scottish game itself, and I don't know if it is now, was like how the English game was 20 or 30 years ago,\" said Grimshaw when asked why he was able to thrive in Scotland. \"It was very up and at them.",
      "\"Even though the quality might not always be there in some of the games, they are always high energy games and that suited the way I played. I just got on well with the people up there; they were very down to earth and similar sort of people to where I'm from back home.",
      "\"Motherwell was the perfect club for that. They were a very community-driven club. I have still got a lot of my pals up there now, and that is not just football players - it's people in the community as well, such as Motherwell fans.",
      "\"I just settled really quickly, and my wife and I spent the vast majority of our adult lives there after leaving Burnley when we were about 19 or 20. We were up there for the best part of ten years.",
      "\"I have nothing but good things to say about Scotland and the people. They are very friendly. I also think the Scottish game doesn't get the credit it deserves. I know a lot of folk in England poke a bit of fun.",
      "\"I think it has definitely got certain aspects that if we could bring back to the English game, it would be refreshing, certainly in the Premier League. But I think that ship has sailed now! But I only have good things to say about Scottish football.\"",
      "After leaving Dundee United in August last year, Grimshaw is yet to find himself a new club. He is now spending a lot of time travelling with his wife and young daughter.",
      "His travels give him an excuse to enjoy one of his favourite hobbies: writing. The former United youngster has a passion for putting his experiences and thoughts down on paper, and his personal blog - Thoughts from the Foothills - is his platform to do so.",
      "Outlining his passion for writing, Grimshaw said: \"I was always into my writing at school; I loved writing. I never did it outside of school, but I suppose it came quite naturally in English classes and that sort of stuff.",
      "\"I probably didn't write for ten years after school, maybe longer, to be honest, in any sort of capacity. In fact, I tell a lie, I did a couple of bits for a family in Motherwell when I was first up there when I was 19.",
      "\"My brother is a professional cricketer in the Lancashire League for Rishton and he had a really good season for Ramsbottom. They won the Worsley Cup which is a big cup for the Lancashire league and they had an incredible season.",
      "\"He scored more runs than anyone has ever scored in that cup competition in history. Michael Clarke, an Australian batter, is below him, a few West Indians, top names, and he was top of that. He got 149 in the final and I wrote a poem about it.",
      "\"I don't know why, but it was a great day, a brilliant day and hundreds of people were there. From then on, I just carried on with my writing because I enjoyed doing it and I thought 'why not, I'll keep writing'.",
      "\"I suppose I just needed somewhere to post a few of my bits, really, so I set up my website which I post on semi-regularly; I should post on it more, and I am going to try and post on it more. I suppose with travelling at the minute, I have got a bit more content themes, in terms of explaining what I'm doing. I have a bit more inspiration for my writing at the minute with being away.",
      "\"I was trying to raise some money for charity and I wrote a poem about Burnley. Burnley is my team; I'm a Burnley lad.",
      "\"I worked with a local illustrator on that and we were raising money for a local charity. It didn't do as well as I'd hoped, but I still managed to raise about £500 or £600 for two local families who had just had deaths in the family, so they were two grieving local families and we raised some money for their local charities, so that was good, and it is still available on the website now.\"",
      "Grimshaw created his blog with the idea of sharing his passion for sport, history, poetry and travel.",
      "\"Basically, it is just a platform for me to write down my thoughts on a range of things,\" he continued. \"I like writing about sport. I am very keen on history and travel.",
      "\"I have quite a passion for travel. If I am in a new city, I try to get to a sporting event or obviously try and find out about its history.",
      "\"For example, while we're in Melbourne, we are going to as many things as we can. We are going to see Rugby League and go to the races; I love my racing.",
      "\"I have a big passion for sport and history, and getting it down on paper is a hobby of mine. I have been paid to do a few articles for Nutmeg Magazine in Scotland, which is a really good football magazine. I think I have done about eight articles for them, and one of them got picked up for The Herald in Scotland.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "\"I have done a few bits and bobs, but it is definitely something I would like to try and investigate more and put a bit more time into it as well.\"",
      "Summarising his love for writing, Grimshaw concluded: \"That is exactly it. I have always enjoyed doing different things outside of football, but early on in my career, with the pressures of coming through at a place like Man United and moving on, you are always striving for the next thing and sometimes my focus would have 100 per cent been on football.",
      "\"That never wavered, don't get me wrong, but I think over time, I just learnt to use other things alongside my football. Sometimes you have to take a step away and relax and I think my writing was one of those things that helped me do it.",
      "\"Some lads would go and play golf or have a beer, but I think writing was certainly one thing for me. I would also enjoy watching live sports. It is a bit of a hobby and I have been lucky enough to have had a couple of pieces picked up off different places.",
      "\"I think I should definitely continue with it, and you never know where it might lead.\""

      "Hugill spent the second half of last season in League Two at Carlisle United, having spent the first half of the campaign at League One side Wigan Athletic.",
      "Linking up with former United ace Mark Hughes in Cumbria, Hugill managed just two goals in 17 games as Carlisle were relegated to the National League. Barnet have traded places with the Brunton Park after clinching the National League title last season.",
      "Mapping out his ambitions for the upcoming season, Hugill told Barnet's club website: \"I think it's just obviously playing a lot of games, scoring a lot of goals is the main thing for a striker, but I'm still pretty young – still 21 – so I think it's just getting the games under my belt and having a really good season.\"",
      "Bees manager Dean Brennan added: \"We've been after this type of player for a long time. Even though he's tall, his movements and attributes are all in behind.",
      "\"He's got pace, excellent finisher, very dynamic – we want him to look down the barrel of the goal. He's such an exciting player, he's like a Jamie Vardy/Michael Owen type.\"",
      "Hugill's contract at Old Trafford is up at the end of this season, but United have the option to extend it by an additional year. The striker has become the fifth player to be sent out on loan by the Reds this summer.",

      "United, who entered talks with Brentford to sign Mbeumo in early-June, have always maintained a sense of confidence they would reach an agreement with the Londoners.",
      "After signing Matheus Cunha to strengthen their attack last month, United immediately identified Mbeumo as their next top target. The club has prioritised attacking signings this summer after finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, has been keen on a move to Old Trafford throughout the summer, meaning both he and United have been keen to strike an agreement.",
      "United submitted an opening offer for the former Troyes man worth £55m, which was rejected, and their second proposal was worth in excess of £60m just over three weeks ago.",
      "For a time, it looked as though United's second offer would be enough to extract Mbeumo from the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "The attacker, who was directly involved in 28 Premier League goals last season, will bring plenty of versatility to Old Trafford. As well as being an option at right-wing and for the right-sided No.10 role, he is also capable of playing through the centre of the attack.",

      "Mbeumo is close to completing a switch to United from Brentford after the Reds agreed a £70million deal for the Cameroon international. United will pay an initial fee worth £65million plus the potential for a further £5million in add-ons.",
      "United and Brentford have been locked in negotiations for a deal for Mbeumo for several weeks and finally reached a breakthrough on Friday. The offer from United was the third bid presented to the Bees, which has now been accepted as Mbeumo looks set to secure a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Tottenham also expressed an interest in signing Mbeumo before United beat the North London outfit in the race for the winger's signature earlier in the summer.",
      "Frank was Mbeumo's manager during his time as Brentford boss before he took on the role as Tottenham manager in the summer, replacing Ange Postecoglou in the process.",
      "It was Frank who signed Mbeumo from Troyes back in 2019, and the Spurs boss has now given his reaction to the 25-year-old's move to United.",
      "\"Bryan [Mbeumo], of course, is a fantastic player. I have been with him for five years,\" Frank told reporters on Friday.",
      "\"I think he deserves the move, no matter where he goes. And as a player, I wish him all the best when you've been with a player for so long.\"",
      "United will be hoping to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo in the near future and make the forward their second signing of the summer transfer window.

      "One of the best pieces of news Manchester United fans will have come across this transfer window was a Championship club rejecting a bid from a Premier League club.",
      "Brentford's offer for Omari Hutchinson was another step in the right direction for United in their negotiations for Bryan Mbeumo. Despite the wait, that deal has never appeared in jeopardy.",
      "United start their season against Arsenal in four weeks and the transfer window is open for six more weeks. The only 'deadline' was United's departure for Chicago on Tuesday.",
      "They now expect Brentford to accept their third and probably final offer of £65million rising to £70m. Brentford have held out for a higher fee for Mbeumo than the £62.5m Matheus Cunha, which is somewhat logical. Cunha got 15 Premier League goals last season and Mbeumo got 20. Mbeumo is slightly younger than Cunha and played in the Premier League for twice as long.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "The change of manager at Brentford was always bound to cause a hold-up. Brentford also needed time to line up their duck to replace Mbeumo. Hutchinson is a left-footed right winger with a release clause. Ipswich Town rejected Brentford's package as it was not an up-front payment.",
      "And so, when push comes to shove, United seem likely to get Mbeumo in time for him to be in the squad against West Ham United in New Jersey next Saturday. Mbeumo will have missed out on a full week's worth of pre-season training. Hardly an issue for a player who has spent four successive seasons in the Premier League.",
      "There has been a shift from United. A target they initially valued at £50m-odd could end up costing them £70m. Sources say Brentford refused to budge on an overall £70m fee and United eventually relented.",
      "After going the entirety of last summer without breaking the £60m barrier for any of the five signings, United are about to do so with both incomings this summer. Club figures stressed as recently as Wednesday that Mbeumo's fee had to be \"sensible\".",
      "His cost will doubtless drive the price up of that elusive new No.9, unless there is a satisfactory option with a release clause. Some form of a compromise feels inevitable there, whether it is a short-term fix or United settling with their existing options. All of the evidence suggests Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are not good enough.",
      "At least Cunha and Mbeumo have been plying their trade on these shores. There is a modicum of progress in that United have settled on such fees for players with Premier League experience, rather than for a brash Brazilian in the Netherlands or a callow and underwhelming striker in Italy.",
      "It is needs must, too. United recorded a minus goal difference in 2023-24. Last season, it was ten times worse. Cunha and Mbeumo were towards the top of the Premier League goalscoring charts in 2024-25.",
      "Should they contribute 35 league goals between them for United, nobody will mention their fees. Expectations should be reined in, though. Wolves finished 14th and 16th in Cunha's two campaigns at Molineux. Mbeumo has been playing at a stadium with a capacity of 17,250. The Sir Alex Ferguson Stand alone is much bigger than that.",
      "The pair are in for a culture shock though United are confident the players have the wherewithal to cope with the great expectations and the greater scrutiny. Cunha was always destined for another big move and Mbeumo is one of the most affable and attentive characters in the league.",
      "Mbeumo had a more than respectable first season in the Premier League as Brentford finished 13th yet the winger was so self-critical he embarked on an intensive training programme that entailed posture training. Those close to him are adamant that it marked the turning point in his career.",
      "United should not overburden Mbeumo. They cannot entertain the notion of playing him up front when everyone knows they want an out-and-out striker. Cunha, Amad and Bruno Fernandes are the playmakers who can make United play. Mbeumo has to go into the starting XI on the wing.",
      "The team would be a starting striker shy of completion for the forthcoming season. Centre back is United's strongest area in their squad, Manuel Ugarte has to start repaying the club's investment and is set to have Fernandes as his partner. A more established left winger is bound to be a priority next year but Patrick Dorgu is one of United's most recent investments, albeit at a price (£25m) with little risk.",
      "A new goalkeeper could be needed this time next year, too, unless Andre Onana rediscovers the form of his Champions League semi-final and final campaigns with Ajax and Inter Milan. That would be more good news for United."

      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘ready to step up’ their interest in a Belgian goalkeeper amid concern over an injury to No.1 Andre Onana.",
      "United have been on the hunt for a new goalkeeper this summer. Indeed, it’s been suggested they have lost patience with incumbent keeper Onana, given his propensity to be involved in errors leading to goals.",
      "However, Onana doesn’t look likely to be going anywhere, but he has now been ruled out for the next six weeks. That saw Altay Bayindir play in a friendly against Leeds on Saturday, and means Onana will be out until the end of August.",
      "United will likely have played at least their first two Premier League games by then.",
      "As such, talkSPORT reports United are ‘ready to step up’ their interest in Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, with the hunt for a new keeper required given Onana’s injury.",
      "Lammens is said to be valued by his current club at around £17million.",
      "Lammens is already aware of United interest from earlier in the summer, and feels he’s suited to the challenge.",
      "“The first time I heard I thought, ‘Wow.’ Immediately a world [renowned] team that follows you. That is special.",
      "“Of course, I was also spoken to about it a lot and when I made a save in training, it was United this, United that [from colleagues]… It’s only positive.",
      "“Especially because it’s the best competition in the world and my profile, my stature and way of playing, is similar to English football. You have to physically hold your own there and that suits me.”",
      "Whether Lammens would be able to displace Onana once and for all when both are fit remains to be seen, but that the incumbent is injured at the start of the season will mean for an interesting situation.",
      "Indeed, if United are willing to change starters when Onana is fit, as has looked likely over the summer, then if Lammens performs well at the beginning of the campaign, he might well be able to keep the No.1 spot.",
      "The Belgian, 23, kept 10 clean sheets in all competitions last season, which is one fewer than Onana, though Lammens has a far better save percentage from last season, and if he could continue that in the Premier League, he’d be a better asset than United’s current keeper.",
      "Whether the move does go ahead remains to be seen, but United will begin to push harder soon.",
      "Man Utd and Leeds are chasing a new number one as their long-running rivalry spills into a transfer battle over a top-performing European keeper.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘frustrated’ at how this summer transfer window is going for Manchester United after making two ‘priority demands’.",
      "Man Utd could have a chance of signing Emiliano Martinez this summer as Aston Villa prepare to announce a new goalkeeper signing, according to reports.",
      "Andre Onana only joined Untied two years ago but already looks to be heading out the door if the club get their way.",
      "Man Utd are ‘back in’ for Botafogo goalkeeper John in the summer transfer window after his performance at the Club World Cup, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are prepared to allow Andre Onana to leave on loan and Ruben Amorim has his ‘ideal’ replacement in mind, according to reports."

      "There are whispers out of Portugal that Man Utd really are back in for Viktor Gyokeres. Which would be absolutely hilarious…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan are looking into the feasibility of signing Hojlund as they search for a striker. United paid Atalanta £72million two years ago and the Rossoneri would struggle to give the Red Devils half of their money back. And even if Hojlund has struggled, from a numbers perspective, United simply cannot afford to shed any strikers since Hojlund is the only senior specialist centre-forward they currently have.",
      "",
      "19) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nBack here again, are we? Apparently so, according to reports in Portugal. The stories go that United are close to an agreement with Sporting, which sounds very convenient for the Portuguese club, but its is a tactic that has already failed, so we cannot see why they would flog that particular dead horse if there was nothing in it. Gyokeres has made clear his intention to move to Arsenal, but he, like us, must be close to losing hope. If he did go to United now, the Arsenal meltdown would be spectacular.",
      "",
      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao which, presumably, will supress the Old Lady’s appetite for Sancho. And with the talk of Juve interest in Rashford, what now for Sancho?",
      "",
      "17) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Aston Villa\nJackson was rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United but Unai Emery is said to be keen to be reunited with the striker with whom he worked at Villarreal. Villa’s interest in Jackson is heavily linked to…",
      "",
      "16) Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Chelsea\nRogers is said to be Chelsea priority for the remainder of the window and while Villa are reluctant to sell, any big offer would have to be considered. If Rogers is to join Chelsea, likely triggering a Villa move for Jackson, it won’t be long before the end of the window.",
      "",
      "15) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko is back in the 20 after losing out to Gyokeres in Arsenal audition but, apparently, United are ‘serious’ about signing the Slovenian. Maybe they are, and Christ knows they need a striker, but they will have to start selling sharpish if they are to afford what Leipzig are demanding.",

      "",
      "14) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "13) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seemed as though Liverpool were taking Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead doused our initial suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak. But it all seemed a bit weird on Saturday when Isak was sent home from Glasgow ‘due to the speculation around him’ and Eddie Howe sounded less convincing that the Swede would remain with Newcastle beyond the end of the window. Maybe this one isn’t done?",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags. Man Utd seem to have finally got their mitts on Bryan Mbeumo, which makes it less likely the Bees will entertain interest in Wissa too.",
      "",
      "9) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nWe all assumed Newcastle would pull their finger out after their initial bid of £27million inclusive of add-ons was rejected last month. Since then, though: nothing. Leaving City to swoop in for the England Under-21 keeper. Reports suggest City are trying to secure a discount on the £40million buy-back clause they hold for their ex-goalkeeper but with the increased noise around Ederson departing, it’s hard to envisage the Citizens allowing Newcastle back into the race.",
      "",
      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement. Lord knows they’ve been discussing it for long enough.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nThis seems to be reaching its inevitable conclusion sooner than we thought. We knew Rashford would go on loan, probably to Barca, but we thoroughly expected United to drag it out. It’s almost to their credit that they haven’t, even if the fact they can’t sell Rashford for actual money is a mess largely of their own making. It seems the only sticking point is how much the buy option would be at the end of a season-long loan. Whatever it becomes, Barca probably can’t afford it. But that isn’t stopping them from covering his entire salary, for which United should be grateful.",
      "",
      "4) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nArsenal have missed Arteta’s deadline for Gyokeres to be on the flight to Singapore and some reports in Portugal suggest the deal could be jeopardy, with add-ons still to be negotiated and solidarity payments to be sorted. Gyokeres’ agents are working their nuts off but they don’t seem to be having much joy. To the contrary: the player’s father is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ while Gyokeres himself is distancing himself from London. We genuinely thought this one was done, but it’s a saga that’s had more fake endings than Lord of the f*cking Rings. For all the good work Arsenal have done this summer, if they screw this up…",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. But with Fabrizio Romano now giving this one the ‘here we go’ treatment it appears only a matter of time before Ekitike joins Liverpool’s big list of summer signings. Certainly, personal terms should pose few problems given the player himself seems unsurprisingly enormously keen.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nThis is done, apparently, with images leaked of the defender in his Arsenal training kit. The paperwork is still being ratified, but the delay between medical and confirmation is a pattern with Arsenal this summer.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nWe have a deal! United have spent weeks haggling, only to pay more than Brentford’s initial asking price. But a medical is set to take place over the weekend before Mbeumo flies off to the United States with his new team-mates. Now for a striker. And some sales."

      "",

      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",
      "19=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "16) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",

Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "10=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",

And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",

      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "10=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "10=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin.",
      "",
      "7=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s little chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five. And for some reason the bookies agree that he is nowhere near safe.",
      "",
      "7=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "7=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which is possible after the exits of Anthony Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "3) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford if they sell Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "1) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "",
      "Mikel Arteta’s ‘cheating’ is tipped to push Arsenal down to fourth as the Gunners are defended over Thomas Partey and Liverpool fears are allayed.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal are in ‘do or die’ seasons for very different reasons as Mikel Arteta faces becoming ‘the new Brendan Rodgers’…",
      "Mikel Arteta is pushing Arsenal to complete a deal for Viktor Gyokeres today after the Sporting star entered a seventh day of ‘unexcused absence’.",
      "Mikel Arteta loves an excuse and can blame his sacking at the end of another trophyless season on Andrea Berta, Liverpool and fans of The Arsenal.",
      "Former Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka could be returning to the Premier League with newly-promoted Sunderland eyeing a move, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal supporters have lost it over the £50m+ signing of Noni Madueke, but here are six times Mikel Arteta has made angry fans look foolish."

      "He’s only had eyes for Barcelona and after the Catalans were snubbed by Nico Williams and backed away from a possible move for Luis Diaz over Liverpool’s demands, they’ve now reached an agreement with Rashford and Manchester United.",

Verbal agreement in principle between all parties involved with Barça planning for medical tests next days. Loan deal with buy option, details being finalised today then Man Utd will authorize his travel to Spain.’",
      "It was thought that Rashford’s wage of around £325,000 a week might pose a problem, with Barcelona either unwilling or unable to cover that salary quite as much as Villa, who were paying around 90% of it during his six-month stay.",

      "They confirm that the purchase option agreed is ‘not mandatory’ but that the fixed fee for the option is just €30m [£26m] – a significant drop to the fee Villa were required to pay this summer, and much lower than Transfermarkt’s €50m [£43m] valuation.",

      "Remember, these are the correct opinions.",
      "Big themes for this season include: round collars, local ‘inspiration’ and more immediately obvious divergence between ‘replica’ and ‘authentic’ versions of shirts. We’re not really happy about any of those themes, if we’re honest.",
      "Away and third kits to follow in due course but there are still just far too many unknowns and uncertainties there for any kind of solid ranking, and as you know we wouldn’t want to just put our name to any ranking that was half-baked. Ahem. On we go.",
      "",
      "TBC. Sunderland\nWe’ve seen a few leaks and they’re mainly terrible, but no confirmation yet for what is actually the kit. It’s hummel, so it should be good. Which is the main reason we’re remaining too sceptical to rank based on those current upsetting leaks.",
      "",
      "19) Burnley\nUtter woke nonsense, we’re afraid to report. Burnley and Castore were so busy coming up with a shirt that meets the apparent current requirements to ‘taking inspiration from the local area’ that they completely forgot to take inspiration from an actual Burnley shirt.",
      "Update your phone wallpaper to celebrate our 2025/26 Home kit 🥳 pic.twitter.com/g6w7rcNGOE",
      "— Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) July 4, 2025",
      "The marketing bullsh*t manifests in a vaguely topographical pattern designed to represent the fact that East Lancashire, famously and uniquely, has some hills in it.",
      "But they’ve completely failed to put anywhere close to enough blue on here. Yes, Burnley have in the past dispensed with their traditional blue sleeves, but we don’t care for it and it will never look right.",
      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

We’re not saying this is bad, we’re saying we’re not sure whether it’s bad or brilliant, and it’s that total lack of conviction that has rattled us into the shadow realm.

      "Our big problem, though, is the ‘lace-up’ collar detail. Officially, it’s ‘inspired by our original 1925 kit lace design’ but… it’s a bit wanky isn’t it? There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",

That’s not unusual in itself; what’s unusual is that just as Spurs managers generally alternate in style and tone, so too their home kits operate on a rota switching between all-white (or nearly all-white) and more colourful.",

Now there’s less navy on this sleeve for sure, but it still constitutes a navy-heavy season, and with plenty of that silvery-blue-gray thrown in for good measure. That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",

      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards, something we expect the away and third kits to do rather more based on the leaked pics we’ve seen so far.",

Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",

      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves.

You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "8) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",

      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "6) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

      "We reserve the right to alter this ranking if the actual shirt disappoints, but at this stage we’re very excited about this one.",
      "",
      "4) West Ham\nUmbro have done some fine retro work with West Ham in recent years, and it all comes together here in this shiny and powerfully early 80s effort. Even the BoyleSports logo looks like it’s from 1983.",

      "Also, while we generally restrict our rankings here to the tops, given the amount of switching and alternate use that goes on with shorts and socks anyway, it is worth noting that West Ham have this year’s best socks, with the stripes of the collar and cuffs deployed simply but expertly.",
      "",
      "3) Wolves\nYes, we like this. That’s a pleasingly modern take on a proper old-fashioned collar, and the whole retro vibe is enhanced by a material that almost looks knitted.",
      "Again, we could be wrong because we’re only at this stage going off pictures rather than real-world information, but it does look like the lads at Sudu have got the colour right this time. Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible.

      "Having praised the black, though, we’re not quite sure at first glance about what seem some very shiny black adidas stripes on the shoulders and sleeves. They’re slightly off-putting – notably on the long-sleeve version.",
      "There’s also a print woven into the sleeves rather than body of the shirt, which is an unusual choice but one that works here. The last United home shirt we can recall with sleeves that differed from the main body of the shirt was 1998/99, and that seemed to work out well for everybody.",

      "With the Spanish giants in perennial financial bother, the sort of loan with no obligation to buy which helped showcase Rashford in the second half of last season at Aston Villa carries inevitable appeal.",

      "The England international forward will then undergo a medical in the ‘next days’ ahead of completing another loan with a buy option.",
      "It was thought that Rashford’s wage of around £325,000 a week might pose a problem, with Barcelona either unwilling or unable to cover that salary quite as much as Villa, who were paying around 90% of it during his six-month stay.",

      "In recent weeks, Ruben Amorim’s side has been focused on signing Mbeumo and their prolonged negotiation with Brentford has paid off this week, with an agreement struck on a deal worth an initial £65m plus £6m in add-ons.",
      "United made Mbeumo a top target after he scored 20 Premier League goals in 2024/25, and like Cunha, he would be an upgrade on last season’s No.10 options and has reportedly had his medical on Saturday.",
      "The arrival of Mbeumo would be a significant boost, but they need to remain in the market for more additions after finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to win a trophy in 2024/25.",
      "READ: Man Utd reach ‘verbal agreement’ for fourth signing after Mbeumo as ‘medical’ date set",
      "The two remaining priorities are to sign a striker and a goalkeeper as United require upgrades on Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Romano has confirmed this, but he has revealed that they “don’t want to spend fresh money” on a goalkeeper as they intend to “save the money for a striker”.",
      "Due to this, Romano claims Man Utd hoped to reach an agreement with Aston Villa over a “swap deal” for Emiliano Martinez.",
      "“For Emi Martinez, the idea was to discuss a swap deal with Aston Villa,” Romano said.",
      "“They don’t want to spend fresh money but instead save the money for a striker. At the moment, club-to-club talks haven’t started and Man Utd haven’t approached Villa. It’s not an easy topic.",
      "“Man Utd know that Dibu Martinez is keen on a move to them. But it depends on what they want to do and, financially, what they can do.",
      "“Outgoings are very important for Man Utd after spending money on Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo.”",
      "Man Utd have also been linked with Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson in recent weeks as it’s been suggested that he could leave following the arrivals of Liam Delap and Joao Pedro.",
      "However, Romano has indicated that the striker is “not a player for sale”.",
      "“Man Utd have been informed about the situation of Nicolas Jackson,” Romano added.",
      "“He’s not a player for sale because Chelsea are not desperate to sell him. If they get a good proposal, he could leave.",
      "“At the moment, they’ve not started real conversation, so it’s still early stages of any discussion.",
      "“They’re aware what’s going on and are waiting on outgoings, they’re still deciding what striker they want internally and then what happens with the goalkeeper.”",
      "He continued: “We have to see what they will do with the goalkeeper: do they want a new one or a young goalkeeper for the future?",
      "“Or maybe they want to sign an experienced goalkeeper because Emi Martinez keeps hoping for a call from Man Utd. He’s open to a move there.”",

      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "While no deal completed this summer can challenge the biggest overpays in Premier League history, plenty have already been made well in excess of a player’s reported market value.",
      "A few factors go into that assessment. Age, performance level and experience are inevitably taken into account but the number of interested teams, general market trends and the reputation and status of the leagues the selling and buying clubs belong to can also heavily dictate that that market value.",
      "And when it comes to those increasingly expensive intra-Premier League transfers there is basically a £10m surcharge applied before talks even commence.",
      "It is no coincidence that five of the seven biggest supposed overpays – going by the numbers crunched by the fine folk at Transfermarkt – involve a pair of Premier League clubs both trying to orchestrate PSR-friendly deals.",
      "Nor that Real Madrid account for the other two when they signed Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono.",
      "But those five Premier League overpays, made by four of the Big Six plus Newcastle, do beg the question as to who has been most royally screwed.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal)",
      "Fee: £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £34.7m",
      "If you listen to Arsenal supporters, which is medically inadvisable at the best of times, the Madueke signing is not only an egregious use of club funds but an act so deeply objectionable as to prompt petitions, protests and defaced murals.",
      "That the line for those deeply ‘entitled’ fans is drawn at their favourite football club making what they deem to be an underwhelming signing, rather than the shameful handling of the Thomas Partey debacle, is a cripplingly damning indictment on the modern world.",
      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",
      "As the most recent scorer of a Champions League knockout stage goal for Manchester United, Elanga even brings a degree of experience to a stage Newcastle are still adjusting to.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Spurs)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £39m",
      "There is always a quirk in the system and the idea Spurs overpaid for Kudus seems curious.",
      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",
      "Thomas Frank pinpointed Kudus as his main transfer target because of the “unpredictability” the Ghanaian can provide in attack at “almost the perfect age to perform and hit the next level”.",
      "While moving a player with those characteristics across enemy lines was always going to require some intricate negotiations, Spurs pushed it through at a price both parties could sell as a win.",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £43.3m",
      "From the competition Chelsea faced for Pedro to the remuneration Brighton were due for their work in developing a former club-record £30m signing, the Brazilian was always going to cost a pretty penny.",
      "Throw into the equation the fees Chelsea consistently pay for forwards in particular – and what is effectively the antithesis of a discount at their favourite shop as Brighton are still making them pay for the Moises Caicedo mess – and it could be suggested that the Blues paid over the odds.",
      "But rarely if ever before has a player paid back their fee so quickly and specifically as with Pedro, whose first three Chelsea goals helped win the Club World Cup and earn Enzo Maresca’s side an extra £30m or so.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United)",
      "Fee: £62.5m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £52m",
      "The spotlight which comes with a move to Manchester United cannot have surprised Cunha but being scapegoated by Newcastle for their lack of signings and blamed by Sporting for their valuation of Viktor Gyokeres seemed curious.",
      "It is unknown precisely how far Manchester United would have gone in the bidding if Cunha wasn’t accompanied by a release clause which specified his price tag – or indeed if they would have targeted him at all without one.",
      "A multi-functional 26-year-old Brazilian international forward with 42 goal contributions in 82 Premier League appearances does, after all, come with a premium.",
      "And if all else fails, Manchester United will simply continue Cunha’s career trend of being sold for £18m profit every two years.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "A former Arsenal player has backed Noni Madueke to become a starter, while criticising fan reaction and comparing him to Kai Havertz.",
      "According to reports, two key reasons are behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to “really push” Arsenal to sign Noni Madueke from Chelsea for around £52m.",
      "An ex-Arsenal player has questioned Arsenal’s move for Noni Madueke and hints it could signal a deeper issue involving Bukayo Saka’s future.",
      "Leandro Trossard has indicated to Arsenal that he wants to leave this summer after the club’s transfer flurry in recent days, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Premier League giants Arsenal will complete their next summer signing ‘today’ as they close in on four deals."

      "Marcus Rashford should be the most sellable member of the five-man Manchester United bomb squad. But he’s not…",
      "When they entered the summer, United were apparently hopeful of raking in around £160million for the five players everyone knows they want rid of.",
      "That, obviously, was ludicrous. The only club daft enough to pay top whack for these lads would be United themselves.",
      "So as the summer rolls on, United remain at an impasse with the transfers, unable to strengthen much further before they get rid of their drifters.",
      "How much can they hope to bank now? Is it possible they will start the season with all five still on their books? Here’s how we rank the unwanted stars based on how likely they are to earn some money for United…",
      "",
      "5) Tyrell Malacia\nPSV opted against taking up their option to sign Malacia for £9million because they’re not daft. The Netherlands defender started only three Eredivisie games after joining in January but at least he proved to any potential suitors that he’s not completely broken having spent over a year on the sidelines.",
      "Ruben Amorim didn’t aid United in their mission to sell Malacia when he revealed the 25-year-old hasn’t got it in him to play as a wing-back because he struggles to go forward. Which feels like something United ought to have spotted earlier but, as we know, they haven’t been the most observant bunch.",
      "So what now? United will apparently accept something like £3million just so Malacia doesn’t show as a loss on the books. Will anyone who can afford his £75,000-a-week salary stump up? Probably not.",
      "",
      "4) Jadon Sancho \nUnited need to hope there is some truth in reports Juventus want both Sancho and Francisco Conceicao since it seems the Old Lady has done a deal to sign the Portuguese winger from Porto.",
      "Regardless, whether it’s Juve or anyone else, United will have to accept they aren’t going to get anything like the £25million they hoped for. Frankly, they’ll be fortunate to bank anything while escorting Sancho off the premises one last time.",
      "The winger is on something ridiculous like £250,000 a week which he is due for another year. Chelsea offered him the chance to get away for less, but that wasn’t for him. Juve certainly won’t pay the same salary – reports suggest he’s being offered half. And we doubt Sancho is motivated enough to give up half of what he’s contractually owed to take up a great opportunity in Turin.",
      "And, to be fair, why should he? It makes sense for Sancho to sit tight, wait for a loan move at the end of the window, when United will have to accept paying only a portion of his salary for the reward of having him out the door. Then, in a year, after another season trousering an undeserved wedge, he gets to go as a free agent.",
      "So, if anyone is daft enough to offer actual money for Sancho, United ought to snap their hand off.",
      "",
      "3) Antony\nAside from Malacia, around whom all is deathly quiet, the least noise among the bomb squad is coming from Antony’s direction. Because it was thought Real Betis would find a way to bring back a winger who regained some credibility while on loan in Spain during the second half of last season.",
      "Can Betis afford to buy? Maybe, probably not. And they are cool with that being known. Because it will squeeze United ever more over a player who clearly has no future under Amorim.",
      "Of course, Betis would prefer Antony back on loan but United insist they won’t do that. At least not without guarantees and the Spaniards are toying with some workarounds. There are reports of interest from elsewhere but nothing firm enough for Betis to panic into making United an offer they might be satisfied to accept. Certainly not yet. And they are content in the knowledge Antony fancies being back in Andalusia.",
      "Apparently, United have already dropped the asking price from £40million to £30million, but they won’t get that either. Certainly not in the form of cold hard cash they can put towards their stalled summer recruitment.",

      "2) Marcus Rashford\nRashford is probably United’s most sellable asset of the five. But that also means he can afford to be pickier when choosing his next move.",
      "Ideally, he would go to Barcelona. A few weeks ago, that appeared something of a pipe dream while Nico Williams was being teased by the Catalans. But Barca’s failure to close a deal for Williams highlights the financial constraints they remain under.",
      "If they can’t buy Williams, they probably can’t buy Rashford. But they can wait until the back end of the window before offering a loan deal with options or obligations, which at least gets the forward’s salary – or most of it – off United’s books.",
      "Barca can bide their time here because they know Rashford’s desire. Without something coming from nothing, the only obvious threat we see here is Bayern Munich, given the Bavarians and Liverpool are way, way off in their valuations of Luis Diaz. And even then, Leandro Trossard could be a cheaper option.",
      "",
      "1) Alejandro Garnacho\nThe Argentina winger probably represents United’s best chance of banking some cash. But certainly not the £70million they initially hoped for. Nor £60million after their first reduction. If they get anything more than half the price they were initially quoting, that’s a result.",
      "Why should they be grateful for that? Because Garnacho would be a risk for anyone taking on the his full rights this summer.",
      "As a player, we know he is limited. He has bursts, moments. For a winger, he’s not rapid and as a right-footer on the left, he struggles to go down the outside.",
      "If that doesn’t make buyers beware, his character ought to. There were red flags around Garnacho’s attitude even before he made his first senior start and all the evidence suggests little has changed.",
      "So the smart suitors will insist on trying before they buy, but someone of the not-unreasonable belief that United is more the problem, not the player, could be tempted by Garnacho. Probably Chelsea.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Como – £87.9m\nThe richest club in Serie A are determined to spend money to secure European football for next season. Jesus Rodriguez is the most expensive of those to arrive so far.",
      "",
      "9) Bayer Leverkusen – £88m\nArmed with money from Liverpool for Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, new coach Erik ten Hag has been busy, with US international Malik Tillman coming in for a club-record fee.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Atletico Madrid – £92.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada and Matteo Ruggeri have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again.",
      "",
      "7) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £122.1m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £127m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "This is the summer of the intra-Premier League transfer but Alexander Isak and others considering future employers closer to home have some way to go to reach this list.",
      "",
      "26) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "25) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "24) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "23) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "22) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "21) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "20) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "19) Noni Madueke – £52m (Chelsea to Arsenal, July 2025)\nA section of the most ‘entitled’ fanbase in the world ought to have been ashamed at how they rallied against Arsenal’s latest signing of a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "While neither the striker Arsenal need nor the Rodrygo-level wide forward they wanted, Madueke will provide the sort of attacking cover which was painfully lacking in their latest failed title charge.",
      "",
      "18) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "Tottenham have reportedly ‘begun talks’ with the agents of a star midfielder, after they also held direct contact to discuss a move for Manchester City star Jack Grealish.",
      "A new report has revealed the ‘most realistic solution’ for Manchester City and England star Jack Grealish amid interest from Premier League rivals.",
      "Jack Grealish looks destined to leave Man City this summer but a £300k-a-week wage has made it hard for clubs to take the risk.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League."

      "Man Utd have admired Bryan Mbeumo for some time and feel he is a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system; United submitted an improved offer worth £71m on Thursday; the forward has completed medical and should sign in time to join USA tour which departs on Tuesday",
      "By Dharmesh Sheth",
      "Sunday 20 July 2025 16:39, UK",
      "Manchester United's move for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has entered the final stages of completion.",
      "It is understood Mbeumo has completed his medical and formalised the details on a long-term contract.",
      "There is an expectation that everything will be sorted in time for him to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package on Friday that includes a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over month for Mbeumo, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable - mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "United had been encouraged and impressed by Mbeumo's desire to join them, but Brentford have made it clear they would find it difficult to sell both him and Yoane Wissa, with interest intensifying in the Congo striker in the last week.",
      "Newcastle stepped their pursuit after seeing Liverpool move ahead of them in the race for Hugo Ekitike. Nottingham Forest also had a bid rejected for Wissa, while Spurs have been considering him since January.",
      "It may be the case that this shift in dynamic around Wissa sparked United into their successful offer for Mbeumo, with a striker next on the agenda for Amorim and the recruitment hierarchy.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have reached a broad agreement to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Report as Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against Leeds; Matheus Cunha made his debut but United failed to show much attacking improvement; Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar, but Leeds had good chances through Largie Ramazani",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 21:51, UK",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "After Ruben Amorim's side recorded their worst-scoring Premier League campaign last term with 44 goals, there were little signs of improvement in front of goal despite starting new £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha, who played the first half.",
      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",
      "Man Utd then had the best chance of the afternoon as the clock ticked into 90 as Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from a corner from just two yards out, with Ayden Heaven finding Meslier on the rebound from a similar distance.",
      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is on his way to complete a £71m move to Manchester, but there is still a lot left to be desired about Amorim's attack on the basis of this showing.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim to MUTV:",
      "\"It was a pre-season game. The distances between the sectors were really big sometimes. We suffered a little bit when we tried to press high, they kicked the ball high and won the second balls. They were dangerous in those moments.",
      "\"We have a lack of pace. Especially in the middle of the park, you can feel it's hard to bring the ball. But we created chances. We have a lot to do, but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams. A good test.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team [Wolves]. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",
      "On Diego Leon's debut at left wing-back: \"We have to understand that the kid came from Paraguay. It's his second week at Manchester United. He did really well, he's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.",
      "\"The environment is really good. Of course sometimes we are going to struggle, but what I felt in the first moment is that if we are going to struggle, we will struggle together. That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",
      "\"We need to create that bond between everybody [on the United States tour] - not just between the players butthe staff. All the changes are stopping. We need to leave that as a group.",
      "\"We have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. We need to improve.\"",
      "Manchester United, it's almost like you never left.",
      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",
      "Obi taking the ball off Cunha's toes and Amorim admitting his relationship with Fernandes \"is not there yet\" meant it was a slow start in his new colours.",
      "And Hojlund's display showed more frustration - falling over the ball at one stage in the box and then getting in the way of a late Dorgu strike.",
      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
      "Amad Diallo also looked sharp at wing-back - which is important in the context of Mbeumo coming into the team.",
      "But United need a lot more than the Brentford man to improve this attacking set-up. There's still a need for a new striker, plus more clarity in midfield and out wide.",
      "There's now less than a month to go until United's Premier League opener with Arsenal. An awful lot still needs to change on the pitch if Amorim's project is going to take off.",
      "Leeds manager Daniel Farke has announced that Patrick Bamford is no longer in his plans for next season.",
      "Farke said on Bamford's future: \"I had an honest communication with him.",
      "\"For me, at this stage he needs to be the main man, he needs the backing, the arm around the shoulder after difficult years to rebuild his confidence.",
      "\"After the last two seasons, I wasn't willing to take him on right now as the main man in the Premier League.\"",

      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.",
      "Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, with agreement having now been reached over a £71 million deal for the Cameroon international.",
      "On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.",
      "But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson, Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko are the other situations United are monitoring.",
      "While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
