      "Mason Greenwood found himself in the firing line from his own boss after Marseille suffered a home defeat to Lille.",
      "The former Manchester United academy product was subjected to harsh criticism from Roberto De Zerbi, the ex-Brighton and Hove Albion chief. Greenwood joined the French club last year, shortly after charges of attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour and assault were dropped - he had denied all allegations.",
      "De Zerbi has generally been satisfied with the forward, who has netted 11 goals and provided four assists across 19 outings in all competitions. Nevertheless, the Italian made a point of singling out Greenwood's display against Lille for particular censure.",
      "He declared: \"We played badly and we deserved to lose. We didn't string three passes together. We lost every second ball. Even with dribbling, we couldn't beat anyone. Defensively, we were never as aggressive as we usually are.",
      "\"We were passive from the first minute to the last. One shot on target for a player like Greenwood isn't enough for him. Shooting so infrequently isn't sufficient.\"",
      "This represents a sharp departure from Greenwood's recent praise for De Zerbi, where he credited the Italian with helping to resurrect his footballing career. The 24-year-old told Telefoot: \"I'm in a really good place thanks to the coach and my teammates.",
      "\"I feel good and I hope to improve, to win more awards this season. Roberto De Zerbi? He's the brains of the team, the architect of our game. He helps me understand football much better, he helps me improve every day.\"",
      "Former Watford striker Troy Deeney recently backed Greenwood to potentially represent England once more in the future. The Wibsey-born attacker was awarded Jamaican citizenship and received a passport from the Caribbean nation in August.",
      "Nevertheless, he has not yet featured for Jamaica's national squad. In his Sun column, Deeney argued that Greenwood deserves another opportunity with England, provided his displays merit selection.",
      "The ex-striker penned: \"Football cannot be a place where people are written off after mistakes, alleged or not, in their younger years. This is not to dismiss the seriousness of those allegations. Greenwood will live with them forever.",
      "\"In truth, he does not owe an explanation to football supporters. It is his friends and family he must prove himself to. But, if he wants an England return, he must address it in public – prove he is worthy of wearing the England shirt, show he can be trusted.",
      "\"Rebuilding trust is the only way this can ever happen and it is an incredibly hard thing to achieve. It would be taxing on Greenwood himself having to face such justified scrutiny. If Greenwood can face that and come through it.",
      "\"He deserves a second chance with England. If there were to be no way back whatsoever, the game is setting a dangerous precedent. Sending a message that any mistake in your personal life rules you out for good.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Tottenham midfielder James Maddison has once again defended his decision to hit back at Roy Keane after the duo were involved in a war of words last season.",
      "Manchester United legend Keane started the feud after he criticised Maddison, 29, before Tottenham went up against the Reds in the Premier League back in February.",
      "Speaking to the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"Maddison isn't bad when he's not at the darts... but if you think he's going to come back and get Spurs top six, you're in cuckoo land.\"",
      "He added: \"He's a talented player, but if you're a player in the Spurs dressing room and he's back in the squad, you wouldn't be looking and going, 'James is back today - we're going to be fine!'\"",
      "Maddison responded by scoring the winner for Tottenham in a 1-0 win against United. He then produced his trademark darts celebration before putting his finger to his lips in a silencing motion.",
      "\"There was a little bit of outside noise this week,\" Maddison replied. \"People will have their opinions. I wanted to do my talking on the pitch today so I hope there's a certain few that enjoyed me being the match-winner today.\"",
      "Maddison then continued his squabble with Keane after Tottenham won the Europa League in May. Although he didn't play in the final against United, Maddison joined CBS Sports' post-match coverage, and said: \"I wasn't gonna do any interviews but I heard Roy Keane was in the studio tonight!\"",
      "The panel burst into laughter, with Micah Richards urging Maddison to recreate his darts celebration on camera. He happily obliged, saying: \"Oh, I will, Micah, with pleasure - Roy Keane, that's for you, son!\"",
      "\"I remember that week,\" Maddison started. \"I love Roy Keane. People have asked me about him a lot since that. If I am watching the TV I am watching Roy Keane because he is box office, he is entertaining.",
      "\"He was a top, top player and he is great to watch. He gave me a bit of criticism during the week and I ended up scoring against United. If you're not allowed to hit back at him, what's the point?\"",
      "Jamie Carragher added: \"I love that, coming back and having that character and personality. Why would you just take criticism? You should give a little bit back. It was in a respectful manner and it was brilliant.\"",
      "Maddison hasn't played a single minute of competitive football this season after he injured his Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) in pre-season. Although Maddison returned to the grass for a light session on Monday morning, he is not expected to return for at least another couple of months.",
      "The ex-Leicester and Norwich playmaker scored 12 goals and provided 11 assists in 45 matches across all competitions for Tottenham last season.",

      "Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo's future is up in the air after falling badly out of favour under Ruben Amorim. The Englishman saw a loan request rejected over the summer but could be on the move as January approaches.",
      "Amorim's side have somewhat recovered after a dismal start to this Premier League season but one midfielder continues to suffer. Despite once looking like a potential superstar at Old Trafford and bagging an FA Cup-winning goal just over a year ago, 20-year-old Mainoo doesn't seem to be part of the manager's plans.",
      "Mainoo looked set to make a loan move away from Manchester this summer but the club blocked a departure. New reports suggest he could be on the move in January after continuing to be left out of Amorim's plans.",
      "One speculated destination was Italian side Napoli. The likes of Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have left Old Trafford to prosper in Naples and it was reported that the club had shown an interest in the youngster.",
      "But Tutto Mercato now report that Napoli are \"on the fence\" regarding Mainoo and have an alternative in mind in the form of West Ham's Soungoutou Magassa.",
      "They also state that Roma and Italy star Lorenzo Pellegrini is on the club's radar, should they choose to abandon their pursuit of the promising Mainoo.",
      "Club captain Bruno Fernandes remains an integral part of Amorim's side this season and took his tally up to four goals with a brace against Wolves on Monday night. He has started every match so far.",
      "Since joining United from Sporting CP in January 2020 the Portugal international has been a dependable rock in the heart of the club's midfield and his commitment and on-field contributions have been recognised.",
      "On United's club website, there is a section that houses profiles of players the club deem to be 'legends.' This includes the likes of Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney, Paul Scholes and countless other icons.",
      "But Fernandes now finds his name on said list alongside another current, albeit on loan player in the form of Marcus Rashford. The 31-year-old's profile is complete with a biography of his time at the club so far and a suitably gold-trimmed design.",

      "The Premier League issued a statement following Manchester United's contentious second-half penalty during their 4-1 victory at Wolves at Molineux on Monday. In the 80th minute, Amad Diallo furiously demanded a spot-kick after his powerful strike appeared to hit Yerson Mosquera's hand inside the area.",
      "Although referee Michael Salisbury initially dismissed the appeals, VAR officials urged him to review the incident on the pitchside monitor. After examining the footage, Salisbury reversed his original call and awarded United a penalty, determining that Mosquera had deliberately handled the ball.",
      "Replay footage revealed that the Wolves defender marginally moved his arm towards the ball as the shot travelled goalwards, leaving Salisbury with little option but to award a penalty.",
      "In an announcement to the Molineux crowd, Salisbury explained: \"After review, Wolves No.15 commits a deliberate handball in the penalty area. Final decision is yellow card and penalty kick.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes took responsibility from 12 yards and slotted past goalkeeper Sam Johnstone to extend United's lead to 4-1 and secure vital three points.",
      "Moments after Fernandes found the net, the Premier League released a statement confirming: \"#WOLMUN – 80' VAR OVERTURN. After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of no penalty to Manchester United.\"",
      "It marked Fernandes' second goal of the evening, having already broken the deadlock for the Reds in the opening period. Jean-Ricner Bellegarde equalised for Wolves during first-half injury time, though this wasn't enough to stop United claiming victory.",
      "The Red Devils dominated after the break, finding the net three more times. Bryan Mbeumo restored United's advantage six minutes into the second half following Diogo Dalot's cross into the box.",
      "They're now level with fifth-placed Chelsea and trail fourth-placed Crystal Palace by just a single point. After the final whistle, Mount, who earned Player of the Match honours for an outstanding display, commended his fellow players.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was on song as Manchester United got back to winning way by beating hapless Wolves 4-1. The Red Devils took a deserved lead through Fernandes on 25 minutes after shambolic defending from Rob Edwards' rock-bottom side.",
      "But United failed to convert a series of chances before the break and were pegged back, as Jean-Ricner Bellegarde scored Wolves' first goal since October. Ruben Amorim seemingly gave his players at a rocket at half-time and by the hour mark, the away team were two goals to the good.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo finished off a counter attack as United exposed Wolves' high line before Mason Mount made it three. Fernandes then went from provider to scorer for the fourth.",
      "Here are five talking points from Molineux.",
      "They've seen a change in the dugout but Wolves' supporters aren't satisfied with just that. Their struggles on the pitch are symptomatic of what's going on upstairs at the club, with chairman Jeff Shi the focus of their anger.",
      "A healthy portion of home fans didn't take their seats until the 15th minute and chants of 'Jeff Shi is a w*****' rang around the ground once they arrived. Chinese investment group Fosun International don't want to sell at present, but the pressure is building.",
      "Some punters argue that the Premier League has never been a stronger when it comes to the quality of players up and down the division. If you changed the scoreboard and kits, though, you'd be forgiven for thinking United's opener came from Sunday league.",
      "Wolves relinquished possession in their own half, as Casemiro nipped in to give Matheus Cunha a one-on-one with Emmanuel Agbadou. Fernandes came to help him out but Cunha's pass was behind him, forcing the United captain to trip over.",
      "The United captain managed to quickly recover and fend off Agbadou, squeezing a shot through Sam Johnstone. \"What the f***ing was that?\" cried the Wolves fans in unison.",
      "Finally, the home crowd had something to cheer about. With United fluffing chance after chance to double their lead, Edwards' men knew they were still in the game.",
      "The problem was they needed to score, something that they hadn't done in the previous FIVE games - and never under Edwards. So when Amad left David Moller Wolfe free at the far post to pick up the scraps of a cross, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde smelled blood.",
      "Moller Wolfe's cutback found Bellegarde, who produced a somewhat acrobatic finish and drew Wolves level in stoppage time. All square at the break.",
      "It'd be a surprise if Amorim didn't give his players a rollicking at half-time. It was beggars belief how they let Wolves back in the game and fortunately for the Red Devils boss, they were much more clinical in the second period.",
      "Cunha slipped through Diogo Dalot on the counter attack, as they feasted on Wolves' high line to allow Bryan Mbeumo a tap-in after Sam Johnstone went wandering. Just 11 minutes later, Mount made it three.",
      "The England World Cup hopeful, starting his second game of United's last three, made a savvy run to evade the Wolves defence and was picked out by Fernandes. Mount produced an excellent finish and with Bellegarde having gone off injured between both goals, the wind had been taken out the home side's sails.",
      "Although Wolves didn't threaten a comeback, they were defending doggedly to keep the deficit at just two. That was until Yerson Mosquera stuck his arm out after Amad's shot from close range.",
      "VAR recommended that referee Michael Salisbury review the incident pitch-side and he didn't need too many looks to award a penalty. Fernandes stepped up and confidently tucked it away, despite Johnstone guessing right.",

      "James Maddison has thrown his support behind Kobbie Mainoo, insisting the young midfielder will rediscover his finest form and reach a \"really high level\", despite Ruben Amorim's latest Manchester United snub. Maddison, 29, offered his backing after Amorim once again named the England international on the bench for United's Monday night trip to Wolves.",
      "The 20-year-old hasn't featured in a single Premier League starting XI for United in 2025/26. He has played just 171 minutes in the top flight this season, and he remained an unused substitute during Thursday's 1-1 stalemate against West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "In his pre-Wolves press conference, Amorim justified his choice to restrict Mainoo's playing opportunities this season. When questioned about whether he recognised why Mainoo's status as a homegrown English talent generated particular scrutiny, Amorim said: \"Of course I understand, and my job is to answer. But you always ask me the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in]. It's my decision.\"",
      "Maddison replied: \"Yeah, definitely. It wasn't that long ago he was starting in the Euros for England. I remember Kobbie's first start for England was a game I came on as a sub in and I was very impressed with how composed he was and the occasion just didn't get to him at all.",
      "\"He is good on the ball and calm. A player with that much quality and assurance on the ball, I don't see any way how he doesn't get back to a really high level.\"",
      "Following Mainoo's omission against West Ham, an incensed Paul Scholes turned to Instagram to express his displeasure with Amorim. \"Bulls***,\" Scholes wrote in response to Amorim's recent claim that he considers Mainoo a starter.",
      "\"The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Mainoo was included in a nine-man United bench for the Wolves fixture, alongside fellow academy product Shea Lacey. Altay Bayindir, Patrick Dorgu, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee completed the Reds' substitutes.",

      "Manchester United have announced that Jonny Evans has resigned from his position as head of loans and pathways. The former defender took on the role in June after hanging up his boots, but has departed after just six months in the job.",
      "His responsibilities included organising loan moves for emerging talent and collaborating with Jason Wilcox to 'enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first-team'. Upon his appointment, Evans had declared: \"I am looking forward to working with the next generation of talented players to support them to reach their potential.\"",
      "Now, the 37-year-old has chosen to step away in order to prioritise time with his family, and it's believed he will now take a break from football before considering his next move. Sources at United have confirmed the split is on good terms and Evans departs with the club's full support and gratitude.",
      "Evans' move into the administrative role had marked the conclusion of his playing days. The centre-back had two separate spells at Old Trafford after progressing through the youth system and racked up 241 appearances for the Red Devils.",
      "The Northern Ireland international lifted the Champions League trophy, three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and two League Cups during his time at United, whilst accumulating 536 career appearances in total. Evans represented Northern Ireland on 107 occasions and received an MBE in 2023 for his contributions to the sport.",
      "In 2015 he went to join West Brom and then ended up at Leicester City, where he impressed in Brendan Rodgers ' side, winning the FA Cup in 2021. Evans returned on a free transfer under Erik ten Hag, initially being paid the minimum wage due to being registered as a short-term employee.",
      "“He likes to keep the structure of his team, not too much moving parts. Instead of your whole back five moving one way, he’ll just move one player.”",

      "Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) boss Howard Webb has been urged to speak with with referee Andrew Kitchen following Aaron Wan-Bissaka's controversial escape from a red card during Manchester United's draw with West Ham. The ex-United full-back remarkably avoided dismissal for a reckless sliding tackle on Patrick Dorgu despite having already been cautioned mere moments before.",
      "The Hammers drew level between those two Wan-Bissaka incidents when Soungoutou Magassa converted the rebound from Jarrod Bowen's effort that had been hooked off the line. Diogo Dalot had given United the lead earlier in the second period.",
      "United pressed for a decisive goal but couldn't breach Alphonse Areola's defences again, meaning they had to make do with a point. Had Wan-Bissaka been given his marching orders, the outcome could have been vastly different, with former Premier League official Keith Hackett left baffled by the decision.",
      "He has since proposed that Webb should be conducting debriefs with officials to comprehend their thinking. Hackett, speaking to Football Insider on The Final Whistle, said: \"I was just fooled by it.",
      "\"Watching it, I was saying, 'You're off, mate. You're going to have an early Christmas present,' but nothing happened. The second yellow was worse than the first, and the second yellow was more like orange.",
      "\"On its own, I could have had it sit as a red. This was absolute nonsense. When we have situations like this, it's important for Howard Webb to talk to the referees.\"",
      "\"He should say, 'Talk me through this situation.' Why didn't you issue a yellow card? What have you seen that negates a yellow card?\". Before that moment, Kitchen had delivered a strong performance in the middle, with Hackett eager to praise the 29-year-old before subsequently offering a damning assessment in the immediate wake of the incident.",
      "He said: \"Whilst I think that Andrew Kitchen had a very good game, I would like him to review the two Wan-Bissaka challenges, particularly the last one. On a yellow card, you put in a reckless challenge, he should have had a second yellow followed by the red.",
      "\"He's a lucky guy. Andrew, you've got to keep focused up until the final whistle.\"",
      "After his fairly prominent mistake, Kitchen wasn't chosen to take charge of a Premier League fixture in game-week 15, nor did he oversee any Championship matches.",
      "United are in action again on Monday night as they take on winless Wolves and Ruben Amorim has insisted his side must remain concentrated for the challenge ahead. He remarked: \"Everything can happen, and that will change.",
      "\"There is no team in the Premier League history that didn't win one game. So, it can be any game. So, we need to try to improve, to rest the players, work really well, and prepare a tough match because, with us, it's always a tough match.\"",
      "United welcome Bournemouth the following week before travelling to Aston Villa ahead of Christmas. Before 2026 begins, United host Newcastle United and Wolves at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United could potentially snap up Brighton and Hove Albion's midfielder Carlos Baleba for less than £75million in 2026, just six months after they were deterred by the Cameroon international's hefty price tag. The Red Devils have been eyeing the 21-year-old for a while and had approached the Seagulls via intermediaries about a possible summer transfer.",
      "Brighton's firm stance and a whopping £105m asking price led United to back off, opting instead to spend £18.2m on goalkeeper Senne Lammens as a replacement for Andre Onana. United's manager Ruben Amorim is keen to bring in a new midfielder when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Alongside Baleba, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is also high on their wishlist following his standout performances this season. On Sunday, Baleba was taken off during Brighton's Premier League draw against West Ham, marking the 12th time in 13 starts that manager Fabian Hurzeler has chosen to substitute the midfielder.",
      "Hurzeler has publicly questioned Baleba's performance levels, pointing to United's interest in the player over the summer. Now, recent reports suggest that Brighton's position on Baleba's potential departure has softened since the summer.",
      "However, Tavolieri has suggested that some figures within Bayern are hesitant to meet such a steep asking price for the player. This leaves the door ajar for United to maintain their position as favourites to secure the midfielder's signature, although whether they'll be willing to stump up that sum remains uncertain.",
      "Back in September, Hurzeler acknowledged his worries that Baleba's difficulties might have been triggered by United's summer pursuit. \"For sure, when a young boy reads there is interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep, deep down,\" he remarked.",
      "\"That's also part of the development to understand that when you play well, there comes a big offer, there comes a big club who wants to have him.",
      "\"But then to keep pushing, to be humble, stay here in Brighton, and try to make the next step with the team and that's something we have to keep on working with him. I can't give you a clear answer if it's really affected him or not.",
      "\"But for sure, he's a young boy and we need to understand he's not a machine that if you click on then he always runs and off then he stops. We need to understand his feelings, his emotions, where he comes from, and that's our responsibility.\"",

Wharton is among the top targets at Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his midfield options.",
      "United tried to secure Carlos Baleba from Brighton and Hove Albion in August but chose to allocate the rest of their transfer funds toward a new goalkeeper. Bringing in a new midfielder is United's main priority heading into the January transfer window, with both Baleba and Wharton featuring prominently on their shortlist.",
      "The Red Devils have recently turned their attention towards Premier League-proven talent, having splashed out over £120 million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer. Wharton has three-and-a-half years remaining on his contract at Palace following his switch to Selhurst Park from Blackburn Rovers at the beginning of 2024.",
      "The England international is among several Palace assets who have been linked with lucrative moves away from south London. Marc Guehi came close to joining Liverpool toward the end of the summer window, while Jean-Philippe Mateta was reportedly attracting interest from United.",
      "\"We're not going to throw it all on red and have a massive problem. Unless you want to be in a situation where you're constantly putting in money every year, there's a cash limit to what you can spend.",
      "\"You can't spend money you don't have. You have to have some guardrails as a club, or you'll build up big problems down the track. Everyone saw where prices went in the summer; it's a difficult landscape.",
      "\"There wasn't the right thing available at the right time when the finances were in place. There's no point in doing something for the sake of it. How are you going to get someone to come and tell them they are No 1 in Ebs [Eze] position if you still have him? The one where we didn't, with Marc [Gueh], we kept him.",
      "\"You can't always make happen what you want to. We are where we are in the pecking order; you could ask why other clubs make bids for our players two weeks before the end of the window. I don't know why they did that.\"",
      "Parish's remarks follow revelations from Wharton's agent, James Featherstone, who disclosed that the midfielder harbours aspirations of reaching the very top. \"When he was at Blackburn we sat down and spoke about shooting for the stars and playing for England,\" he told talkSPORT.",
      "\"So how do you get there? Personally I think to play for England you have to play Champions League, to play in the Champions League you have got to play for one of the top teams in one of the top leagues.",
      "\"That jump to a Champions League team, I think you can get lost. The plan below that was to play for a Premier League team. We have got a plan. He is 21. I have to check myself to remember that every now and then. It doesn't have to be achieved yesterday, today or this moment.",
      "\"He has got his in-game, in-season targets and goals. He has got to do his bit and the rest will look after itself in a very structured, calm way to ultimately add value and maximise his ability.\"",

      "He knew his star had fallen. He knew his form and goals had dried up. He knew he'd become a liability to his club, rather than an asset. And he knew he wanted to leave and cash-in with a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro-League. So he decided to find someone to blame but himself.",
      "Sound familiar?",

      "Manchester United's Rasmus Hojlund broke his eight-match goalless streak by netting twice for Napoli in their 2-1 victory over Juventus on Sunday evening. The 22-year-old joined Napoli on loan with an obligation to buy in the summer and is set to seal a permanent £38million move to Antonio Conte's side in 2026, provided the Italian side secure a Champions League place.",
      "Despite making a promising start in Naples, Hojlund's form seemed to have taken a significant dip. The United forward had only found the back of the net four times in 13 appearances prior to Sunday night's clash.",

After Kenan Yildiz levelled for Juventus, Hojlund restored Napoli's lead in the 78th minute, heading the ball home from close range after Weston McKennie set it up for him.",
      "The former Atalanta player now boasts ten goals and three assists in all competitions this season.",
      "Hojlund's brace arrived shortly after he emphasised that a collective triumph with Napoli takes precedence over individual accolades. \"Obviously, I'd like to score a lot of goals again and start doing so soon, but it's important to always contribute to the team, and I'm happy to help,\" he said, following Napoli's victory over Roma last Sunday.",
      "\"I try my best to be useful. I consider myself a - myself a team player: winning is more important than scoring goals.\"",
      "The striker's next outing will see Napoli make the journey to Benfica for their Champions League fixture on Wednesday. Following that, they'll head to Udinese on Sunday, 14 December, before squaring off against AC Milan in the Supercoppa Italiana.",
      "Reflecting on his side's triumph against Juventus, Conte heaped praise upon his squad. \"The players deserve all the compliments, we can only thank them as in a moment of extreme difficulty and with so few available, we are doing incredible things,\" the former Tottenham and Chelsea boss told DAZN.",
      "\"Everyone who plays steps up with great character and sense of responsibility.",
      "\"These lads have improved so much in that sense, and it fills me with pride, because they felt what we are doing, understood the difficulty of the moment, and gave remarkable responses.\"",
      "Napoli currently lead Serie A by a single point over Inter, having earned 31 points from 14 fixtures. AC Milan trail by three points in third place, whilst Roma occupy fourth spot, four points adrift of top position.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! champion Angry Ginge received some handy tips from last year's runner-up Coleen Rooney before venturing into the Australian jungle. The Manchester-born content creator was crowned King of the Jungle on Sunday night.",
      "Ginge, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, launched his Twitch channel at 19, initially streaming FIFA gameplay. His online stardom has exploded since 2020, with the devoted Manchester United supporter regularly teaming up with other prominent content creators and sporting personalities.",
      "Before flying out to Australia, where he won over viewers and triumphed over E4 Celebs Go Dating receptionist Tom Read Wilson and EastEnders star Shona McGarty for the crown, it's emerged that Ginge was given some precious guidance from another well-known personality.",
      "During an appearance on Good Morning Britain, United and England icon Wayne Rooney, married to the 2024 I'm A Celebrity runner-up, disclosed that pals Ginge and fellow campmate Aitch were offered some pointers from his wife ahead of their jungle stint.",
      "\"She [Coleen] gave them a few tips. It was little things like, when you go to the toilet empty your water bottle out so they give you fresh water,\" Rooney explained.",
      "\"Speaking to Coleen, it is tough and it is real out there,\" he continued. \"She really enjoyed it. She loved her time in there. It gave her really great memories.\"",
      "Rooney's other half was a crowd-pleaser during her stint on the popular ITV programme but missed out on the top prize 12 months back to McFly frontman Danny Jones.",
      "However, Ginge wasn't the footballer's pick for this year's champion as he confessed ahead of the finale: \"I want to come on and give Aitch my support. He's been outstanding.",
      "\"He's been himself and you've seen at times him get a little bit emotional,\" Rooney continued about the rapper. \"It's good to see, because it's showing he's vulnerable as well at times. He's missing his family at home.\"",
      "Yet it was Ginge who snatched victory on Saturday, with the 24-year-old breaking down in floods of tears when Ant and Dec announced his triumph.",
      "Before revealing who the public had voted as their winner, the presenting duo disclosed they'd clocked up their biggest audience response in a decade.",
      "\"I don't think I can swear, but I feel amazing,\" declared Ginge. \"Honestly, a dream come true. I didn't think I could go all this way never mind win. Thank you to everyone who voted.\"",
      "Speaking about his jungle ordeal, he reflected: \"It was a lot harder than I thought it'd be. I'd reached out to people before I went in to get some advice, but nobody warned me about what I was about to go through.",
      "\"No one said it was going to be that hard. That was the hardest thing I've ever done and was a real mental test. There were so many times I wanted to throw the towel in.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has all but confirmed there is no way back for him at Manchester United after referencing his future plans in Italy. The Danish striker left Old Trafford in the summer as he joined Serie A side Napoli on a season-long loan.",
      "The reigning Italian champions paid a €6m (£5.2m) loan fee, while there is an option to sign Hojlund permanently for €44m (£38.4m). That clause will become an obligation should Antonio Conte’s side seal a spot in the Champions League. And it appears that Hojlund is already taking the stance that he is a permanent Napoli player.",
      "Speaking to DAZN after scoring twice in a 2-1 win against Juventus at the weekend, the striker promised: “Next season, I’ll give my interviews in Italian.”",
      "Hojlund, 22, joined Man United from Serie A side Atalanta in 2023 for £64million. He netted 16 goals in his debut campaign but scored only ten goals in the following season before being allowed to join Napoli.",
      "And he is already some way to surpassing that, having netted six times for Napoli this season in all competitions. Speaking about his recent form, Hojlund added: “Sometimes as a striker you don’t score and I try to help the team in different sorts of ways.",
      "“I know how important it is for the manager to hold up the ball, to put the game a little bit higher, also work hard on the pressing and keep the team compact. I scored two goals tonight, but it’s all down to my teammates, the manager and his staff.”",
      "After scoring, Hojlund celebrated with members of Conte’s coaching staff and claimed that their instructions on the training ground had led to his two-goal haul.",
      "He added: “Gianluca and the staff talked a lot about my movement in the box. I’ve been going a lot to the back post, but they said there’s space in the front. I attacked the front more and it worked, so I’m happy.”",
      "Meanwhile, Napoli captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo was full of praise for Hojlund as he continues to impress in Italy. He said: “It is certainly pleasing, we had another really good intense performance tonight with a high tempo, playing open football.",
      "“These are our characteristics, we’re happy, and I am pleased for Rasmus. He scored twice today, but he always helps us out every game. In difficult moments, we gave a strong response, that’s the sign of a great team spirit.”",
      "Hojlund will be aiming to extend his positive form this weekend as Napoli travel to Benfica in the Champions League ahead of a clash with Udinese on Sunday afternoon.",

      "Manchester United won 4-1 against Wolves in the Premier League on Monday evening. United took the lead in the first half through Bruno Fernandes, but the game was level at half-time after a response from the hosts.",
      "United emerged for the second half by creating a few opportunities and restored the lead thanks to a goal from Bryan Mbeumo, who finished after an excellent Diogo Dalot breakaway. Mason Mount wrapped up an important victory with a close-range volley in the 62nd minute of the game before Fernandes put the icing on the cake by converting a penalty in the final 10 minutes.",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a confident start to the game and made a superb claim in the box to alleviate pressure in the 32nd minute. Lammens couldn't do much about the goal after some sloppy defending by his teammates. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Solid throughout and made an important tackle early on when Wolves tried to orchestrate an attack. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Started the game nervously with a dodgy pass back to Lammens, and was forced to apologise after another mix-up with his goalkeeper. Improved and settled as the game progressed. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Made a cracking challenge on the halfway line to deny a Wolves breakaway in the first half. Played a sloppy pass at the start of the second which led to a spell of Wolves pressure. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Found himself in a handful of promising positions, but his final ball wasn't great. Had a decent effort saved by Sam Johnstone and was at the scene of the crime for Wolves' goal. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Has listened to his manager's criticism and is notably trying to offer more in attack from left wing-back. Should have scored when he was sent through on goal by Fernandes. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Did well to start the move that led to the opening goal but was bypassed on a few occasions in the centre of the pitch. Made an excellent recovery in the box to deny a Wolves chance. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fired United into a lead thanks to a comical goal, doing well to find the net after slipping to the ground. Assisted the third and converted the penalty. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Had a few shots blocked in the first half and, like Amad, wasn't alert to the danger unfolding for Wolves' equaliser. Couldn't miss when Dalot squared a pass across goal to him. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Has become important in the dressing room this season. His work out of possession can often go unnoticed, but he clocked up plenty of kilometres up and down the Molineux pitch, and he scored. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Cunha's pass was under-hit for Fernandes' goal and United got away with it. The Brazilian wasn't at his best upon his return to Wolves, but he played a crucial role in goal to restore the lead. 7",

      "More minutes under his belt. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Fine. 6",

      "Ruben Amorim praised Mason Mount following Manchester United's victory against Wolves. United were heavy favourites to win against the Premier League's bottom side, who had claimed just two points all season, and they opened the scoring in the 25th minute through Bruno Fernandes after some comical defending.",
      "However, Wolves were level at the interval thanks to Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. The home side had not scored for five games, but they broke their duck after a strike from Bellegarde. Wolves were unable to build on that in the second half. United were gifted space in the final third and took advantage, scoring three more goals through Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and a Fernandes penalty.",
      "Amorim was asked whether Mount was now delivering consistently strong performances and responded: \"I think also the way we play, if you compare the past that he had in Chelsea, which Chelsea is the same, then he has a great quality.",
      "\"He can defend, he can attack, is really the quality that when he touched the ball is really good. So it's not a surprise for me, but of course, we need to take care of him. Sometimes you need to protect them in training in games, but when you build, that is going to happen the same, the same thing with Luke Shaw. So he's going to build that and it's going to be really important for our club.\"",
      "Discussing whether Mount was setting an example, Amorim said: \"He’s a different type of leader. It's not like Licha, for example. It's a guy that leads by the example. It doesn't matter the situation.",
      "\"Mason Mount is always the same thing, training, talking, dealing with people around Carrington. That is not easy. So he’s a very, very good player.\"",
      "Amorim explained why Mount hasn't started every game, adding: \"Sometimes it's the tactical issue. When you play a striker and sometimes Cunha is going to that position or sometimes it's also we need to protect Mason Mount.\"",

      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" Wolves fans chanted after Bruno Fernandes' opening goal for Manchester United on Monday night. That was followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "United will not play against such a dysfunctional club again this season. Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They had amassed two points from 14 games before Monday and have a strong chance of taking Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08.",
      "It was a non-negotiable for United to leave Molineux with three points, and it was comfortable in the end, despite the visitors' best efforts to give the worst team in the Premier League a chance of getting a result.",
      "United's draw against West Ham meant they have dropped eight points from winning positions in the league this season, the joint third highest in the top flight. Amorim was furious when he spoke after that match, and he still looked agitated on the touchline against Wolves.",
      "\"He'll turn the Reds around,\" was sung just once at Old Trafford last week. The chant was missing from the catalogue in Wolverhampton and '12 Days of Cantona' was aired instead.",
      "United were one of three clubs in the Premier League to have no goals from substitutes so far this season, which must be put down to Amorim's tendency to make conservative changes.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was named on the bench again. Mainoo scored a special 97th-minute match-winner against Wolves at Molineux in February 2024, when he was still considered an integral part of the team. On this occasion, there was a huge cheer for the youngster when he was introduced near the end.",
      "Cunha returned to Molineux for the first time since joining United and he mistakenly headed for the home team dressing room when he exited the team coach. Cunha milled about, speaking to Wolves staff and former teammates, and looked comfortable at the venue where his career took off.",
      "Ayden Heaven retained his starting role, despite a hellish 45 minutes against West Ham. The defender was hooked at the interval and was bound to be tested again by a physical Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "There were hundreds of seats vacant in the Sir Jack Hayward Stand and Stan Cullis Stand. Wolves fans protested against their owners by delaying their entry into the ground, but there were still plenty of gold seats when the demonstration was over and the disenchanted trickled in.",
      "Heaven apologised for a mix-up in communication with Senne Lammens. \"We want Fosun out, we want Fosun out,\" the Wolves protestors chanted. The United fans responded with a vitriolic chant about Joel Glazer.",
      "There was mutiny in the air and Wolves fans could not believe what they had seen when Fernandes fired United into the lead. Cunha under-hit his pass to the skipper and the chance seemed to have gone, but the United captain squirmed the ball in at the front post. It was like a sketch from Benny Hill.",
      "Some fans speculated in the build-up to the game that Wolves had the potential to be Amorim's equivalent of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's visit to Vicarage Road in 2021. Solskjaer was finally put out of his misery after losing against Watford, and a defeat to Wolves would have been a similar nadir for Amorim.",
      "The home side had gone five successive league games without a goal, so United couldn't have had a better opportunity to record just their second clean sheet of the campaign. And they should have put the game to bed once they had taken the lead.",
      "This United side never does anything easily, though. The home side were level on the stroke of half-time thanks to a goal from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Amad and Bryan Mbeumo enjoyed a brilliant October, but they regressed at the end of November and both were at the scene of the crime.",
      "The in-game management after taking the lead was dismal. United had experienced international players on the pitch and couldn't control the contest. There is little wonder that the conversation about Amorim's system has resurfaced, but United were able to carve through Wolves like a hot knife through butter when play resumed for the second half, in part because Wolves are shockingly bad.",
      "Not even United could mess up a visit to the league's worst team. Mbeumo slotted into an empty net after a square pass from Diogo Dalot, and Mason Mount scored to gain a two-goal cushion.",
      "Wolves' defending for both goals left plenty to be desired. United got the job done, but there should be concerns that Wolves threatened to make it a contest. The target is to return to the Champions League this season, and a Champions League team would have won with a cricket score.",
      "Fernandes converted a penalty to seal a captain's performance. The Portugal international has not been at his best in recent weeks, but it will be a huge boost if he peaks in the middle of the campaign.",
      "Amorim is hoping to emerge from the winter period without being bowled out and greater tests await in the coming weeks. Thankfully for United, they play Wolves again in just 21 days.",

United had dominated the opening quarter but after taking the lead they ceded the initiative to the home side and they responded by levelling in first half added time when Jean Bellegarde turned home from inside the box.",

Wolves are the worst team in the Premier League by some stretch and not even this United side could slip up tonight. Fernandes and Mount were excellent. There will be stiffer tests ahead for United in the coming weeks, but the good news is they play Wolves again at Old Trafford before New Year.",

      "Bruno Fernandes scores from the spot.",

      "Well how do you explain that. Wolves hold onto the ball for an age, get the pocket picked and then Fernandes, in the box, falls over and still somehow gets up and scuffs a shot goalwards which somehow gets past Johnstone at his near post and dribbles in.",
      "Bruno Fernandes opens the scoring. Possibly the scrapiest goal you will ever see but United won't care. They lead"

      "It's not often a player who hasn't even started a league game dominates the build-up to a Premier League fixture. But Kobbie Mainoo has been the name on the lips of many Manchester United supporters this season.",
      "He's gone from being one of the first names on the teamsheet, scoring a goal in the FA Cup final and playing a role in England's run to the final of the European Championships, to being out in the cold for his club. His only United start this term has been in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town and he was again on the bench at Wolves on Monday night.",
      "United ultimately cantered to a comfortable 4-1 victory at Molineux and Mainoo was introduced to the action with 12 minutes left to play. His arrival was greeted with one of the loudest roars of the night from the sold out away end.",
      "The message from the travelling fans was clear, he's one of our own and we want him to stay. Mainoo's talent is obvious and his application during his period on the sidelines has been a credit to the 20-year-old. He's not moaned or whined, and has knuckled down to try and force himself into Ruben Amorim's thinking.",
      "That hasn't transpired and there is no indication to suggest it might in the near future. Amorim spoke in the build-up to the game about the young midfielder and in a spiky press conference defended his decision to overlook the England international.",
      "\"I just want to win,\" said Amorim. \"I don't look [at] who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You always ask me the same thing. I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in]. It's my decision.\"",
      "The United boss then said \"I don't know\" when asked whether the upcoming departure of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo to the Africa Cup of Nations might afford Mainoo the minutes he craves. \"I don't know what is going to happen,\" said the United boss. \"It depends. I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Mainoo's response to his lack of football is set to be a request to move in January. He asked to leave in the summer but a permanent move was blocked. He's set to seek a loan switch when the winter window opens.",
      "Whether Amorim will sanction a departure remains to be seen but one thing is clear, the United fans want their homegrown hero to stay at Old Trafford, they want him to be given an opportunity. Amorim doesn't seem to share the view.",

Evans took up the position in June following his retirement as a player, but he has left after six months. He was responsible for arranging loans for youngsters and worked closely with Jason Wilcox to 'enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first-team'.",
      "When Evans was appointed, he said in a statement: “I am looking forward to working with the next generation of talented players to support them to reach their potential.\" However, the 37-year-old has decided to leave to spend more time with his family, and it's understood he will now take time away from the game before deciding what to do next.",
      "United sources have said the departure is amicable and Evans leaves with the best wishes of everyone at the club. Evans' transition into the role had confirmed the end of his playing career. The defender enjoyed two stints at United after coming through the club's academy and made 241 appearances for the Reds.",
      "The Northern Irishman won the Champions League, three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and two League Cups with United, while he made a total of 536 career appearances. Evans earned 107 caps for Northern Ireland and was awarded an MBE in 2023 for his services to football.",

      "Manchester United's struggles under Ruben Amorim are largely attributed to the failure of the wing-backs to consistently provide an attacking threat within his 3-4-2-1 formation. This critical weakness will be further exposed when their most dynamic wing-back, Amad, departs for the Africa Cup of Nations. Read full story here>>>",
      "Amorim is facing growing pressure and risks losing support due to his persistent refusal to utilise Kobbie Mainoo. Fans are baffled and frustrated by Mainoo's lack of involvement, suggesting the manager's handling of Mainoo could become the tipping point for their patience. Read full story here>>>",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are facing intense scrutiny as the team's poor form could put Amorim's job in jeopardy. If United were to cut ties with Amorim, who was Berrada’s appointment, it would not only cost millions but would also reflect badly on the new executive team's competence. Read full story here>>>",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to grant Amorim time, believing structural issues are United's primary problem, but this patience may be challenged by the Glazer family. The Glazers have historically dismissed managers when Champions League qualification becomes impossible, and missing out again would be another financial blow. Read full story here>>>",
      "Manuel Ugarte is struggling significantly more than Mainoo and should be the player considered for a January exit. Despite having played under Amorim previously, Ugarte has drifted to the fringes of the squad and his lack of defensive security is underscored by the high volume of goals conceded when he is on the field.

      "Senne Lammens was \"surprised\" by the spirit and togetherness in Manchester United's dressing room when he arrived in the summer. Lammens signed from Royal Antwerp on the final day of the summer transfer window and has made a strong impact since making his debut in October.",
      "The Belgian has retained first-choice status since keeping a clean sheet against Sunderland, and he has earned praise for delivering consistent displays in between the sticks at Old Trafford.",
      "Lammens recently sat down with Malaysian broadcaster Stadium Astro to conduct an interview at Carrington and he was asked who he is closest to in the dressing room. Lammens named two goalkeepers, but admitted he is close to everyone because all the players have a strong bond.",
      "He explained: “I would say maybe Tom Heaton or the fourth goalkeeper Dermot Mee or also, like, the Dutch guys, because it’s easier with the language as well. But I think just in general that’s what surprised me the most.",
      "\"It’s just the togetherness of the group and of the dressing room. Everyone was really nice. So I don’t really want to say one or two guys. It’s in general with everybody, to be honest.”",
      "Amorim has improved dressing room morale. The bad eggs were banished in the summer and sources admitted that a feeling of 'us against them' had developed after their departures.",
      "Lammens provided further personal insight when he revealed he journals before and after matches. \"I think it started when I started played at Antwerp two years ago,\" he said. \"I like to write things down before and after a game just to get my head into the right mindset. Sometimes if things don't go right, or you don't want it in your head, you just write it down to get it off your chest.",
      "\"I came up with it [journaling] a little bit myself, but also got it [the idea] from people talking about it as well, so I thought I would give it a try and it actually helped me a lot, so I still do it.",
      "\"Before a game, I write down a little bit about the opponent, about how they will play and put pressure on me. Also individual things, like key points I have to remember throughout the game.\"",
      "Lammens continued: \"Being a complete goalkeeper is something I take pride in. It's not just stop-stopping, it's coming out for crosses and helping the defence when the balls go behind them. My distribution as well, but what I'm most proud of is being able to play with my left foot and right.",
      "\"That makes it more difficult for the opponent to press me. Coming out for crosses is really difficult in the Premier League especially. I still like to do it a lot, but you need to protect yourself a little bit.\"",

      "For the second time this season, Manchester United got a goal from a wing-back on Thursday night. The manner in which the ball fell to Diogo Dalot was fortunate, but Dalot's finish was not and neither was his positioning.",
      "This was what Amorim so desperately wanted from the wide players in his team. With the ball on the right, left wing-back Dalot moved into a central area inside the penalty box. When Casemiro's deflected shot fell to him, he was ten yards out and had time to take a touch and finish.",
      "The problem for United and Amorim is that it isn't happening enough. The wing-backs in this system are supposed to provide an attacking threat, but they aren't doing it on a regular basis. Amad was lively at times against West Ham, but generally, the quality isn't there out wide.",
      "Dalot continues to give his all and can deliver at times, but the transition to wing-back doesn't come easily and he would probably look a lot more comfortable as a natural full-back with a winger in front of him. Patrick Dorgu is a more attacking wing-back, but he has yet to show he is good enough for this level.",
      "Amorim spoke last week about the anxiety he senses when Dorgu has the ball and the 21-year-old isn't a sufficient attacking threat down the left. The quality is lacking.",
      "During the answer about the anxiety you can feel when Dorgu has the ball, Amorim also expanded on his wing-backs, admitting they weren't good enough at the moment but insisting they were showing more in training.",
      "\"What I feel when I see them training, they are doing so much better than in games,\" he said.",
      "\"I think they (wing-backs) are far from the best, and they know it. So, like a lot of players in our team, like myself. So I just, I just look at them, and I think they have so much more to give. So let's see, let's see this week if we improve that.\"",
      "He was also asked last month if wing-back was an area he wanted to strengthen, but again said time was needed to \"improve the characteristics of the team.\"",
      "The problem is that Amorim has had a year to turn the wings into a positive area for United and he hasn't done it. It is also surprising that the £25million deal to sign Dorgu in January is the only attempt to strengthen the position in the transfer market, with the £215m summer spending spree focusing on a striker and two No. 10s.",
      "Things might be about to get worse as well. Amad will head to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) later this month, as will Noussair Mazraoui, who is only a very occasional fill-in at wing-back these days. Amad's absence will be felt keenly. He is easily the most attacking wing-back in this squad and the one who looks most likely to provide the incision from out wide.",
      "Unless Amorim decides to move Luke Shaw back out wide, then Dalot and Dorgu will be the only available wing-backs while Amad is away with the Ivory Coast. It's hard not to think that will reduce United's wide threat and put more of an onus on goals and creativity on Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "If this system is to ever click into gear and work on a regular basis, then either the wing-backs have to improve or better players have to be signed for the role.",

      "There have been boos to greet the final whistle at the end of the last two games at Old Trafford and it feels like Bonnie Tyler's 'It’s a Heartache’ hasn't been heard quite as often in Manchester United ends recently, but it would be stretching it to say matchgoers have lost faith in Ruben Amorim just yet.",
      "It's clear concerns at the lack of progress are growing and the momentum built up a month ago has again been replaced by introspection, but United fans are generally reluctant to turn on a manager. They didn't really turn on Erik ten Hag in stadiums and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer only properly got abuse on his final day in charge after a 4-1 defeat at Watford. Amorim hasn't had anything like that yet.",
      "But from his adherence to a system that isn't working to concerns over a playing style that is hardly thrilling to watch, the pubs around the ground will be ablaze with fans who aren't convinced at what they are seeing. The issue that might finally drive a wedge between supporters and Amorim is a player we get barely to see, however. Kobbie Mainoo has managed just 171 minutes in the Premier League this season and as the weeks have gone by, Amorim's faith in him seems to decline.",
      "There is a similar precedent towards the end of Solskjaer's reign, when fans used his refusal to play Donny van de Beek as a stick to beat him with. The difference is that Solskjaer was right and Van de Beek hadn't shown enough for United, and never would do. With Mainoo, the feeling is different.",
      "Fans have already seen what the gifted 20-year-old can do. He burst onto the scene in 2023/24, has played in a major tournament final, scored some brilliant goals for United and been at the heart of an FA Cup final win against Manchester City. But now he is the last option in midfield for Amorim, the break glass in case of emergency player on the bench, and even then, Amorim would rather look elsewhere.",
      "With United needing a goal against West Ham on Thursday, the Portuguese head coach opted for Lisandro Martinez as his fifth and final substitute. It left Mainoo kicking his heels again, but it was clear to everyone else inside Old Trafford that he was the more likely source of a goal.",
      "To compound matters, Mainoo is the Stockport-born United fan who is the current poster boy of an academy being turned into a cash machine rather than a source of first-team footballers. Supporters are baffled at his lack of involvement and angry at Amorim's approach to homegrown players.",
      "It won't have helped matters that Amorim was so dismissive of Mainoo in his press conference ahead of facing Wolves this weekend. He gave the impression there were very few scenarios in which he would play the youngster and was clearly sick of being asked about him.",
      "Mainoo has no option but to pursue a loan move next month. His development is stalling for a lack of first-team football and whatever it is Amorim and his coaches are trying to improve in training, the approach clearly isn't working.",
      "But if Mainoo moves to the continent for six months and starts lighting up games again with his wonderful close control, ability to manipulate the ball near the box and find space in tight situations, the frustration at Amorim's approach to him will only grow.",
      "If United were flying under the 40-year-old, then this would be less of an issue. Supporters would still be frustrated, but they would be willing to trust Amorim and let it slide for now. But they are not flying. They are going nowhere at the moment.",
      "United would have no interest in letting Mainoo leave permanently in January and the midfielder wouldn't want to. He wants to make it at Old Trafford and right now he is probably looking at it and thinking he is far more likely to last the course than Amorim.",
      "The former Sporting boss is under pressure and his refusal to give Mainoo a chance is only raising the stakes. It might be the issue that finally sees patience snap for many fans.",

      "There were no caveats presented when Sir Jim Ratcliffe stated in October that he wanted Ruben Amorim to have three years to prove himself at Manchester United. The statement didn't come with a list of terms and conditions.",
      "Everything Ratcliffe has said has pointed to his desire to give Amorim time. United have been through a succession of managers in recent years and none of them have managed to bring consistent success back to Old Trafford. In Ratcliffe's view, the issues are as much structural as having the wrong man in the dugout.",
      "But there will surely come a time when Amorim's position comes under intense scrutiny once again. Perhaps we're there after desperately disappointing results in the last two home fixtures. Monday's trip to Wolves sticks out as a banana skin fraught with danger.",
      "Lose to a team who have just two points from 14 Premier League games and the damage will be difficult to recover from. A win should be a given, but it might only be a matter of time until the next result that puts the Portuguese head coach back in the spotlight.",
      "All eyes at Old Trafford will be on the league table. Amorim's side are eighth at the moment, only two points off fourth but equally only three points off 14th. They need to be moving in the right direction.",
      "United can spin the positives of one season out of Europe, which includes extra time on the training pitch for Amorim and a group of fresh players to target the Premier League every weekend. But right now, they are not making the most of those advantages.",
      "A second campaign outside of the Champions League and the riches on offer in the expanded competition would be damaging. A second season outside of Europe would be disastrous entirely.",
      "The difference between the Europa League and the Champions League is north of £100 million and missing out on that kind of cash is going to hurt. It will limit what United can do in the transfer market, damage their ability to attract players and impact revenues at a time when building a new stadium is a top priority.",
      "We can't be sure how much that will come into Ratcliffe's thinking. As a businessman, he will clearly have an eye on the bottom line, but could he be willing to suck up the pain for another season in the interest of standing by his man? It would be a brave call.",
      "However, one area of potential conflict is with the Glazer family, who remain the majority shareholders, even though it's Ratcliffe who is currently running the show. The Glazers are all about the finances and they know how expensive not getting in the Champions League is.",
      "They have been ruthless with managers before when Europe has slipped away, often dismissing them when qualification for the Champions League became impossible. United's long-term ambitions can only be met with consistent entry into the Champions League.",
      "The Premier League is likely to have a fifth spot again next season, giving United more room to bag themselves a seat at the top table. An encouraging run of fixtures in December might yet see them put themselves firmly into that race.",
      "If that doesn't happen, however, and the gap grows, that is when things could get nervy for Amorim. It is also when Ratcliffe's desire to give him time and the Glazers' focus on revenue could potentially rub up against each other.",
      "For now, the Glazers are letting Ratcliffe and his team get on with running United. But you guarantee they are keeping a close eye on events at the club and they will be well aware of the consequences of missing out on the Champions League again.",

      "Ruben Amorim dismissed claims he had no faith in the Manchester United academy but refused to offer Kobbie Mainoo any guarantees that he would get a chance when the club lose players to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute during United's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday despite being one of only two attacking options on the bench. He has managed just 171 minutes of Premier League football this season and his only start came in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old will return to the scene of one of his best moments in a United shirt on Monday night. Mainoo scored a stunning winning goal at Molineux in February 2024, during a remarkable breakout season that ended with him playing in a European Championship final.",
      "However, he has fallen out of favour under Amorim and doesn't look like forcing his way into the team anytime soon. Manuel Ugarte came on for Joshua Zirkzee against the Hammers and quizzed about Mainoo's prospects before the trip to Wolves, Amorim became frustrated at the topic coming up again.",
      "“Of course I understand [why you ask], and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing,\" he said.",
      "“I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.”",
      "Amorim accepted that Mainoo's situation was becoming deflating for the academy graduate, who could leave on loan during the January transfer window.",
      "But he insisted his team selection was purely down to picking the best players and that he didn't see Mainoo in the best XI this season.",
      "“I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch,\" he said.",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.”",
      "Asked if AFCON could be Mainoo's route into the team, Amorim added: \"I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Amorim's faith in the academy has been questioned recently. He has shunted Mainoo to the margins of the squad and although youngsters such as Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey have made the bench this season, they haven't made it onto the pitch.",
      "It was put to Amorim that he didn't trust the academy, and he went on to explain why Lacey has made the bench for three games in a row but not made an appearance.",
      "\"“But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard,\" he said.",
      "“So you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.”",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",

      "We’re basing this Premier League XI on WhoScored ratings, which essentially means Opta statistics and algorithms that generally reward ‘doing stuff’, so aerially dominant centre-halves are far more likely to be included than calm passers.",
      "Anyway, here we go. At this stage, all candidates must have started 10 of 15 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "David Raya is sitting on his hands as he earns the Golden Glove and Dean Henderson has prevented the most goals, but the algorithms make Pope the leading goalkeeper in the Premier League this season, taking over from Robin Roefs after his Sunderland side got a mini-paddling from Manchester City.",
      "",
      "There was no right-back in the PFA Team of the Year for 2024/25 season but Arsenal’s Jurrien Timber might be impossible to ignore this season. But the numbers but Munoz ahead so far…he claimed his third goal of the season in the 1-0 win at Burnley. He is quietly (well, not so quietly) showing Manchester United’s wing-backs how to do the job.",
      "",
      "At this stage of the season, there is a bias in favour of defenders with goal contributions, and Gabriel has one goal and two assists. But he is also the best centre-half in the Premier League bar none. Though Arsenal are having to learn to cope without him right now.",
      "",
      "Only Arsenal have a better defensive record than Palace this season, who now have two players in this Premier League XI after a 1-0 win over Burnley brought their seventh clean sheet of the campaign. Guehi then scored the winner against Fulham to lift Palace into the Champions League places. Liverpool really should have got their arses in gear in the summer.",
      "",
      "Slim pickings at left-back – unlike at right-back – with O’Reilly emerging from the pack with a goal and three assists from left-back. It’s also booked him a place to the World Cup with England.",
      "",
      "We had been waiting for the algorithm to align with our eyes on Rice, who has been freed as a creative influence by the signing of Martin Zubimendi. He added his second goal of the Premier League season v Burnley and then his third assist against Tottenham. Probably the best midfielder in Europe bar none.",
      "",
      "Much maligned but once again, the numbers are on his side. We keep being told that the United formation is curtailing his attacking output, and yet nobody in the Premier League has more assists (six) than Bruno, who has now scored four Premier League goals this season.",
      "",
      "Another excellent game for Saka v Tottenham in which he really showed Mohammed Kudus how to be a Premier League right winger. He is defensively diligent as well as insanely productive. After a slow start to the season, Saka is flying once again and now has four Premier League goals.",
      "",
      "Move over Eberechi Eze. Foden now has six Premier League goals this season after a double in that mental game v Fulham and another v Sunderland. He was also defensively diligent in that game; his busy-ness is a gift to the algorithm. It’s interesting that three City players emerge at the top of WhoScored’s players of the season. But then they have scored the most goals this season…",
      "",
      "Absolutely phenomenal against Liverpool, he scored a goal, won a penalty, dribbled past seven players and created three chances. He then created four chances against Newcastle United but was overshadowed by Harvey Barnes. Only Kudus dribbles past more players but Doku has more end product this season and loses the ball a whole lot less.",
      "",
      "Just casually strolling towards the Golden Boot with 15 Premier League goals in his first 15 games. He looks sharp and he looks absolutely brilliant, clearly taking the summer spend on outrageously expensive strikers as a personal affront. Still the best? Absolutely.",
      "Liverpool are spiralling hilariously out of control, Arsenal must ‘adapt’ and Morgan Gibbs-White is a massive loser who hit a new career low against Everton.",
      "Mo Salah will not find a whole lot of sympathy for his big old tantrum, which has given Arne Slot to punish him as he sees fit.",
      "Rayan Cherki never felt like the archetypal Pep Guardiola player but there should be no surprise at his rabona being met with cold water and Savinho praise.",
      "Never mind Arne Slot, what does Jurgen Klopp think about Mo Salah? You’ll be surprised to learn he has made his feelings clear.",
      "Mo Salah’s timing is all wrong. Lashing out now from a position of such personal weakness just makes him look like a big baby having a tantrum.",
      "Leeds United’s 3-3 against Liverpool wasn’t an example of the weak league; it was just really enjoyable football."

      "It’s June 17 and Mason Mount is starting under Thomas Tuchel in England’s first game at the World Cup against Croatia while Jude Bellingham, Morgan Rogers, Cole Pamer and Phil Foden watch from the bench or from home and everyone is absolutely fine with it.",
      "An awful lot has to happen between now and then for that to happen, including the vast majority of people accepting that Mount is in fact not a man stealing a living at the highest level but a very fine footballer who can do more than run, press and tackle. More performances like we saw against Wolves and they will have little option but to begrudgingly accept that reality. He was really, really good.",
      "As if conceding a goal against a Wolves side that had gone 43 days and a full six games without finding the back of the net in the Premier League could be more damning for Manchester United and Ruben Amorim, it had been coming.",
      "41.2% of the final 15 minutes of the first half took place in Manchester United’s own third. Jhon Arias smashed a ball across the penalty area a couple of yards in front of Jorgen-Strand Larsen. United’s defenders gave Jean-Ricner Bellegarde time and space to cut in and shoot over the bar from 20 yards, and then more space for him to equalise from bang in the middle of the box.",
      "David Moller Wolfe had caught Amad Diallo sleeping at the back post before chesting the ball down and cutting it back for Bellegarde, who looked the most likely for Wolves, apparently to all but those on the pitch for United, who opted to take his possible game-changing impact with a pinch of salt which proved costly.",
      "Not for that long though, because Wolves are a defensive shambles.",
      "United’s opener was a gift. Matheus Cunha fumbled with the ribbons with a limp, poorly directed pass before Bruno Fernandes arrived with the scissors to effectively unwrap the offering delivered by Andre, who tried to give the ball away with a pass before being caught in possession by Casemiro.",
      "That was the clearcut error in a litany of them from an absurdly open Wolves side constantly requiring heroes to rescue them, whether that be Sam Johnstone pulling off a save or a centre-back clearing the ball off the line.",
      "It’s unsustainable and the limited pressure United applied in a first half which saw them record more shots (14) than any away game since 2003/2004 – save for a game against Everton in 2008 (15) when Cristiano Ronaldo, Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney were their front three – went up a couple of notches in the second half, perhaps after some strong half-time words from Amorim at them drawing with this football team,  as United found their attacking rhythm.",
      "Mount was superb in response to Roy Keane branding him a “schoolboy” for having no “presence” off the bench against West Ham last time out.",
      "Creator-in-chief Bruno Fernandes largely took a backseat as Mount combined his archetypal energy and work-rate with a near-perfect performance on the ball, zipping passes into teammates or in behind the Wolves defence for Cunha or Mbeumo to run onto. He’s always everywhere, but was doing everything, everywhere at Molineux in what was surely his best game for Manchester United.",
      "It’s also arguably one of few good ones in a Red Devils career blighted by injury, poor form and the comes-with-the-territory dip in performance almost all players to have made the move to Old Trafford have suffered in the last decade.",
      "“You go back to stats as an attacking player,” Keane said on Mount back in October. “At United, his stats when he’s played are really poor. It’s not as if you’re going, yeah I can see he’s getting a lot of assists, his stats are really poor.”",
      "He made it three goals in his last four Premier League starts here, with his strike coming between Mbeumo’s tap-in on the break and Fernandes’ penalty. And it was beautiful.",
      "Fernandes’ clipped pass over the Wolves defence was delightful and spoke to a burgeoning relationship building between him and Mount, as the former Chelsea man spotted his captain with time and space on the ball, made his dart in behind and volleyed the ball past Johnstone with ease and authority.",
      "It was a performance we’ve not seen from Mount since his heady days under Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea, when the playmaker played a starring role in the Blues winning the Champions League in 2021.",
      "And Tuchel, waiting for any excuse to call up a guy branded as something of a teacher’s pet in their time together at Stamford Bridge, won’t need too many more performances like this to grant him a spot in his World Cup squad despite the absurd competition for places in his position.",
      "“He said to me, there’s no guarantees, even though you played for me,” Mount said after Tuchel rang him to say why he wasn’t in the England squad in July. “But it gives you more, you want to push even more to be able to be back in the squad.”",
      "We can only dream of the degree with which teeth with be gnashed should Mount become Tuchel’s starting No.10 given the response to the England manager preferring Rogers over Bellingham. The overwhelmingly apathetic response to Mount playing for the Three Lions even during his absolute peak days at Chelsea suggests Gianni Infantino and his Donald Trump love-in wouldn’t then be the sole cause of World Cup boycotts.",
      "We and he are still a long way off that dream. This was just one game, against Wolves, who are terrible. But if Mount can reproduce this display and get himself into the groove he found under Tuchel at Chelsea, the pair may yet be reunited on the biggest football stage.",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane hit out at his former club after their disappointing 1-1 home draw against West Ham United on Thursday night.",
      "Paul Merson has called on Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim to drop Mason Mount for their next Premier League match against Brighton over the weekend.",

      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future.",

And also that Arsenal are top by winning games from set-pieces and that Manchester City are over-reliant on Erling Haaland. I honestly don’t know what such precious people want. Have you bought the ‘elite’ rubbish the league has been selling for decades?",
      "It perfectly illustrates how a certain mindset has been inculcated into some fans when the league tries to make a virtue out of tedious predictability. What do you want – competition or dominance? Surely competition wins every time? Money bringing success has become the default; don’t you find that depressing? Can’t you enjoy the smallest temporary cracks in its hegemony?",

The richest clubs will assert their dominance sooner or later. I think some people actively dislike unpredictability.

But surely the important thing, regardless of this supposed quality, is whether it’s actually enjoyable. I take enjoyment above any skill level you want to reference. Poetry stimulates your synapses in a way maths doesn’t.",
      "If a defender kicks it in off someone’s backside, that’s clearly more fun than a technically perfect 0-0 draw.",
      "Don’t worry, the same teams will be back hogging a lot of the talent and dominating soon enough. There hasn’t been a revolution. It’s more than likely that City, Arsenal or Chelsea will win the league; let us just enjoy a brief moment where sometimes we don’t know the result of a game before kick-off.",
      "Why do these people insist on the Freudian practice of trying to measure everything and everyone to arrive at a ‘satisfaction’ quotient? Is it a result of computer football where everything is presented as predictably good, average or poor, with a corresponding price? That’s not reality.",
      "The irony is, more typically, the Premier League is less regularly entertaining and more predictable than the other four major European leagues and certainly less entertaining than the Scottish Championship so enjoy this, almost certainly brief, period where results are unpredictable. Because history suggests it won’t last long.",
      "Stop mithering that a side isn’t good enough in your vague, imprecise assessment of ‘quality’ to be top six. If many of the sides are all bunched together and keep flying up the table and dropping back down, that’s a good thing. Yes it’s unusual and a break from what has become the norm, but the opposite of a sign of this league being poor. It makes it more compelling. Better.",
      "The companies, organisations and states who own top-flight football crave predictability and want to invest in a safe bet and use huge amounts of money to ensure it. The last thing they want is teams going up and down the league as it might harm their income stream. Don’t be like them. Their influence is already pernicious enough. Celebrate unpredictability because it won’t last long.",
      "We keep being told that the United formation is curtailing Bruno Fernandes’ attacking output, yet he has six assists and is in the team of the season.",
      "Liverpool are spiralling hilariously out of control, Arsenal must ‘adapt’ and Morgan Gibbs-White is a massive loser who hit a new career low against Everton.",
      "Mo Salah will not find a whole lot of sympathy for his big old tantrum, which has given Arne Slot to punish him as he sees fit.",
      "Rayan Cherki never felt like the archetypal Pep Guardiola player but there should be no surprise at his rabona being met with cold water and Savinho praise.",
      "Never mind Arne Slot, what does Jurgen Klopp think about Mo Salah? You’ll be surprised to learn he has made his feelings clear.",
      "Mo Salah’s timing is all wrong. Lashing out now from a position of such personal weakness just makes him look like a big baby having a tantrum."

      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firmed up again. Then they switched off in the second half against Manchester United, with Joshua Zirkzee’s strike from an acute angle (0.03 xG) a bad look on the England keeper. But then came another clean sheet against Burnley and three good saves v Fulham.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.

      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford.",

      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it.

Back to being solid at Palace and it wasn’t his fault v West Ham.",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five.

And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth.",

      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton.

      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa. But he was absolutely culpable v Forest.",

Conceded seven goals in his last three Premier League games but nobody gives a f*** at Leeds.",

Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",

      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now, but a win at Wolves on Monday would be handy.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out, although defeat to Palace does leave Fulham closer than they would like to the relegation fight.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. After the harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week, he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and one that could have been even more convincing.",

      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, which have gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But, well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",

Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned.”",

      "“If United finish seventh or eighth or wherever it is around there, not many people are going to bat an eyelid. I mean, maybe the board will, but I’m just speaking  from the perspective of people who understand the game, if they were to finish around that seventh or eighth position, we’d sit here and say, ‘yeah, yeah, I can see that. I can see that, because that’s kind of where they are.’",

Last season all 4 made it out of the group stages in the CL, with Arsenal and Villa going relatively deep. Spurs and Utd reached the final of the EL (can’t remember who won), and Chelsea breezed through the EC and won it. This season, Arsenal are flying in the CL with the other 4 teams in with a strong chance of qualifying; the same for the teams in the lesser comps (although Palace could be doing better to be fair).",

Currently there’s only 3 genuinely weak teams, but if you’re slightly off it against anyone else particularly away from home you’re liable to get turned over no matter who you are and no matter what perch you’ve toppled off.",

      "Manchester United can smell the Champions League places, but they’re not going to finish in the top five of the Premier League if they don’t a) make some signings in January and b) win more than one game in a row.",
      "Will their finances allow a big spending spree in the winter transfer window? Probably not. Are we going to create a scenario where Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos spend around £250million? Yes. Absolutely.",
      "These five transfers would make for a perfect January for Manchester United and Ruben Amorim, with a Liverpool hijack, Vinicius Junior and Mason Greenwood all thrown into the equation.",
      "",
      "It’s obvious that Manchester United need and want to sign a new central midfielder. The question is: who?",
      "If this was Career Mode or Football Manager, it would be one or two of Federico Valverde, Sandro Tonali, Declan Rice, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong or Moises Caicedo. But this is the real world. And in the real world, it’s going to be Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton. Which is still absolutely fine, by the way.",
      "Ruben Amorim is never shifting from his beloved 3-4-2-1 formation, so looking at previously successful English clubs operating in the same way, the Red Devils need a player like Nemanja Matic, N’Golo Kante or Jorginho. So it really isn’t all that simple. The best option, that also happens to be realistic, is Anderson.",
      "The Nottingham Forest star’s 2025/26 statistics put him up there as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League. He has made 24 key passes (6th), 802 passes (5th), 111 progressive passes (1st), 111 ball recoveries (1st), 35 tackles (9th), 14 interceptions (23rd), won 29 fouls (2nd), and only received two yellow cards. And in Forest’s defeat to Brighton, Anderson became the first player in the last 10 Premier League seasons to record 100+ touches, 10+ ball recoveries, 10+ duels won, 5+ key passes and 5+ successful dribbles.",
      "He might not be Kante, but he could be Matic, and we’re confident he can become better than Jorginho, if he isn’t already.",
      "It would be a statement signing for Manchester United and there isn’t a better option out there among the players who would actually want to join. The fact he can do absolutely everything and has the engine to play midfield on his own makes him perfect for Amorim’s system. The only issue is the price. In January, you’re looking at £100m. In the summer, maybe closer to £80m. Better, but still very pricey. For England’s No.6, though? Probably worth it…",
      "",
      "Not only would Guehi massively improve United and walk straight in as a leader and their best defender, but signing him means Liverpool don’t, which is probably top of the list of positives, next to a blank column of negatives.",
      "There isn’t really much more to say about it. He would be an absolutely outstanding signing, but the odds are heavily stacked against United.",
      "Liverpool put all the groundwork into signing Guehi last summer and were hours away from getting it done, putting them comfortably ahead of the Red Devils in the race. He can negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from January 1, which gives Real Madrid a big advantage. They love a free transfer, need a centre-back and have dropped their interest in Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.",
      "But it’s still in United’s hands if they want it to be. Offer Palace £30m and they might struggle to reject it, considering he’s in the final six months of his deal. Just make a sufficient offer well before the deadline, lads.",
      "Liverpool are also in a much worse place than they were when Guehi agreed to join. They were reigning champions – and still are, technically – and looked set to dominate England and Europe after spending over £420m. Now they are mid-table, out of the title picture, and on an abysmal run of form. It’s not the place to be for someone like Guehi, though he could help fix the problem.",
      "And does Guehi even want to leave England? You’d have to ask him. Some players are reluctant to go abroad, especially if a top English club is offering a fat contract and guaranteed minutes. Real Madrid is the exception, though. You don’t turn down Real Madrid.",
      "",
      "It would be audacious to even try, and the noise surrounding Vinicius‘ situation at Real Madrid is probably a ploy to get a better contract. When he realises his only options are Manchester United or Saudi Arabia, he’ll likely return to Florentino Perez with his tail between his legs.",
      "But let’s say he actually does want to leave and refuses to renew. United would actually stand a chance. They are still, in the eyes of many, the biggest club in the world. They are an institution. Players are addicted to the idea of being ‘the one’ who finally fixes them after years of chaos.",
      "Out of all the big names United could chase, Vinicius would be the most ambitious and exciting. Leaving Real Madrid at 25, after being Ballon d’Or runner-up two years earlier, is not a normal career move. Joining United might be career suicide, but if anyone who is remotely gettable can single-handedly fix them, it’s Vinicius.",
      "",
      "Signing Anderson or Wharton, Guehi, and Vinicius is impossible without a significant sale or two. The best sale for everyone is Ugarte. Casemiro could work if the right offer arrives, but he’s actually been pretty good since Ruben Amorim came in. You could argue he’s been the Portuguese coach’s biggest success story so far. Then there’s Kobbie Mainoo, who is a ‘break glass in case of emergency’ pure profit option.",
      "Truth be told, only Saudi Arabia can bail Manchester United out when it comes to Ugarte. No Champions League contender will want him after back-to-back disappointing spells at two giant clubs. Sporting might want to re-sign him, but for nowhere near the £50m United paid Paris Saint-Germain in August 2023. That leaves the filthy-rich Saudis, who will surely be interested in a big name like Ugarte, who is still only 24.",
      "It’s unrealistic, but not completely delusional. And United will only sanction his sale if they’ve already signed a new midfielder, or have one lined up.",
      "The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules will probably still punish United anyway, but they can at least tell supporters they lived and enjoyed the dream while it lasted.",
      "",
      "Another significant windfall could come via the sale of Mason Greenwood from Marseille.",
      "Reports suggested United wanted to reintegrate Greenwood after his charges of attempted rape and assault were dropped, but after putting the feelers out, fan backlash was fierce. They quickly U-turned and pretended they always wanted to sell him. After a year on loan at Getafe, he joined Marseille for £26.7m, which was a low fee, but United’s hands were tied. In an uncharacteristically savvy move, they included a big sell-on clause, believed to be 50%.",
      "Transfermarkt says the 24-year-old is worth around £35m, but 10 goals and three assists in Ligue 1 this season, coupled with his potential and previous seasons, suggests he will go for much more – perhaps around £60m, giving United £30m.",
      "And when Greenwood does leave Marseille, Manchester United will finally be able to close a dark chapter.",
      "READ NEXT: Top 10 transfer flops of the season: Liverpool trio shamed as Premier League clubs waste £500m",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could be set for a significant windfall as an ‘offer’ has been submitted for Marseille forward Mason Greenwood.",
      "Man Utd are ready to splash out on one of two Real Madrid players in the summer, while they want Antoine Semenyo in January, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are set to break their transfer record next summer on one of two players as they look to bring in a new midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly decided to break the £100m barrier on their next addition, though four stars may need to leave first.",
      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood has been backed to play for England again on one condition as he would solve “many problems”."

      "Many Wolves supporters missed the first 15 minutes of the match as they protested about the club's ownership, although they did not miss much from a Wolves side who looked bereft of quality and confidence early on, United cutting through with ease.",
      "Diogo Dalot wasted a one-on-one, while Sam Johnstone also saved from Mbeumo before Casemiro robbed a dallying Andre and the ball was worked to Fernandes who had time to slip over and still get to his feet to sneak the ball past the goalkeeper.",
      "Toti Gomes had to clear off the line from Matheus Cunha, returning to face his former club, and at that stage Wolves looked there for the taking. But as has often been the case under Amorim, United surrendered the initiative, allowing the bottom club back in.",
      "The home side sensed it, Ki-Jana Hoever's cross finding David Moller Wolfe who put the ball back into the box for Bellegarde, Wolves' best player before going off injured, to force home smartly. The first goal of Edwards' reign coming in his fourth game in charge.",
      "But more hapless defending from Wolves allowed United to restore their lead early in the second half, Dalot again racing through down the left channel before squaring for Mbeumo to slot into the net with Johnstone stranded for his first goal in exactly a month.",
      "A moment of quality from Fernandes saw him dink the ball into the path of Mount for the third goal before Yerson Mosquera was adjudged to have handballed in the area, allowing Fernandes to smash in his second from the spot. Wolves were well beaten.",
      "Their fate appears sealed already even in December.",
      "What lies ahead for Amorim's United this season remains a mystery.",
      "Wolves equalled their longest-ever losing streak in league history, also losing eight in a row between December 1981 and February 1982.\n\n\nWolves’ haul of only two points in the Premier League this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers, level with Sheffield United in the Premier League in 2020-21, Southport in 1975-76 in the Fourth Division and Barrow and Newport County in 1970-71 in the Fourth Division.",
      "Fellow playmaker James Maddison praised Fernandes in the Monday Night Football studio. \"Bruno Fernandes is underrated for the consistency he shows regularly,\" said the Tottenham player. \"Every time he is on the ball, he can just see it all.\"",
      "Fernandes showed that with his assist for Mount's goal. He punished Wolves and now has 15 goal involvements in his last 14 Premier League games for Manchester United against sides starting the day in the relegation zone - six goals and nine assists.",
      "\"I thought some of the combinations going forward were crisp, were sharp and that's what we can do.",
      "\"We know we can do that. It's about us creating as many chances as we can as forward players and trying to get on the scoresheet. I thought going forward we were solid, and as a defence it's about defending as a team and not letting them have any chances to get back into the game.\"",
      "\"We scored four but had a lot of shots. I cannot make that connection with being more clinical. We improved a lot.",
      "\"If you compare last season and this season, we are creating so much more chances and scoring more goals and having more real situations of danger. I am really pleased with that.\"",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",

      "Manchester United blew the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League on Thursday when West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford; Roy Keane slammed a 'frightened' performance and questioned the standards of the home side after conceding again from a corner",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 07:27, UK",
      "Roy Keane accused Manchester United of being too \"frightened\" to see out victory over West Ham after blowing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League, and called the performance \"desperate\".",
      "West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford when Soungoutou Magassa's 83rd-minute equaliser cancelled out Diogo Dalot's opening goal.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have only taken 27 points from 20 games at Old Trafford, and only managed one win from their last five in the league - drawing three of those, despite being ahead in each.",
      "\"After they get the goal, you are playing against a team in the bottom three, they take their foot off the gas,\" said Keane. \"Take nothing away from West Ham and they just about deserved the equaliser.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappoint. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"Same old problems. The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group of players? I've watched the games closely, the lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team. There is expectation at this club, you have to deal with that.\"",
      "Keane also questioned the standards of the home side after they switched off from a set-piece to concede the leveller. Since the start of last season, only West Ham themselves (17) have conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (15).",
      "\"The reason you are playing for Manchester United is that you deal with these situations,\" Keane added.",
      "\"If they are anxious, you worry why they are playing for Manchester United and what they are fearful of. Fearful of West Ham, why?\"",
      "\"I don't get it, I don't get the lack of urgency, and the lack of intensity. I don't get the slow play. I don't get the lack of risk in the game.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he's not going back into the changing room saying 'guys, play slowly tonight'. He's saying 'let's get the ball moving quicker, let's run forward, let's play with real threat and vigour'.",
      "\"It doesn't transpire out on the pitch, so I don't know, why does that happen? I've got no understanding.",
      "\"I don't see the actual appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game, and everything you've got, and throw it forward and take risks. They're showing us what they are, the seventh, eighth or ninth team in the league.\"",
      "Defender Diogo Dalot said his side became \"anxious\" after opening the scoring at Old Trafford, and must look at themselves after squandering another lead.",
      "\"We cannot get as anxious as we get. We were a bit more sloppy with the ball in possession. Obviously disappointed with the draw, we had the game there.",
      "\"It's a solution we need to find. In the end, we have to look to ourselves. It's more our fault.\"",
      "It was established far further back than Thursday night that Manchester United lack resolve under pressure. Diogo Dalot says his team-mates are hindered by anxiety. Really, it's just about concentration levels.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have not registered a clean sheet in seven games - since early October. They establish a foothold in games and then inevitably hand it back. They win a game and then suffer a setback in the next. There is no continuity here.",
      "United dominated every attacking metric against inferior West Ham, creating higher xG, landing more shots on target and generating three big chances - two of those were missed. They had 42 touches in the opposition box. That's a staggeringly high amount if the yield is only one goal.",
      "Ultimately, this United team have very little conviction. Amorim bemoaned a lack of second-half control post-match and blamed \"second ball losses\". If you don't compete, or can't compete, for a whole 90 minutes that is what will happen.",

      "Sunderland could lose most Premier League players to Africa Cup of Nations with seven set to head to Morocco this month; Fulham have seen most goal and assist contributions from African players - and will miss Nigerian trio to finals",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:02, UK",
      "The AFCON deadline is around the corner for Premier League clubs to release their players for the month-long tournament in Morocco. Who will lose the most players to the competition, and what games could they miss?",
      "Players are required to report to north Africa on December 15, with the tournament kicking off six days later when hosts Morocco face Comoros. However, with Man Utd playing Bournemouth that evening, there is the potential for exceptions to be made.",
      "The final will be held in Rabat almost a month later on January 18, meaning it could be a long Christmas and New Year period for some Premier League sides without a number of key players",
      "Whose squads will be hit the hardest, who has the toughest fixture schedule across that period and who doesn't have anything to worry about at all?",
      "Most nations are yet to announce their final squads but going by recent selection and injury status, here's the realistic scenario for how many players each Premier League club could lose to the tournament...",
      "Of the 458 players used in the Premier League, 45 have been from the African continent - with Sunderland the most reliant on their ranks. All seven of their African players arrived in the summer, and all seven look set to be called up to their respective squads for AFCON.",
      "No surprise, then, that Sunderland have also had the highest percentage of minutes played by African players since their promotion, more than 10 per cent than the next closest, Wolves - who look set to lose four to AFCON this month.",
      "There are no worries for Arsenal, Chelsea, Leeds and Newcastle who haven't been represented by a single African player between them this season - and will not see their squads impacted by the tournament.",
      "Sunderland might have given almost a third of their playing minutes to African players but given all of their three attacking signings have struggled for minutes, they find themselves well down the list of goals and assists across the Premier League this season.",
      "Instead, Fulham lead the way on that front, not least after Samuel Chukwueze's double and Alex Iwobi's finish in their pulsating 5-4 defeat to Man City.",
      "Individually, no African player has contributed more to his side's attacking output than Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, piquing further interest from Premier League suitors ahead of a potential January transfer - when a new release clause will come into being, albeit only briefly.",
      "Whether he stays or goes, for the moment Bournemouth will be happy to keep their flying forward at the Vitality Stadium for the next month, with Ghana finishing bottom of their qualifying group and missing out on AFCON for the first time since 2004.",
      "On paper at least, Aston Villa have the hardest set of fixtures across the six Premier League rounds played during AFCON.",
      "Man Utd are slated to have the easiest, facing both Wolves and Burnley, ranked 20th and 19th, in that time.",
      "Sunderland, the team losing the most players to the competition, have the triple whammy of facing Man City, Brighton and Crystal Palace across the month.",
      "Man Utd play Bournemouth on Monday Night Football on December 15, after the deadline for clubs to release their players for AFCON.",
      "The club have been in talks over extending that deadline for their three affected players - Noussair Mazraoui, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo - to feature in that game, but it is still not clear whether that will be possible.",
      "Speaking ahead of their game with Wolves, Ruben Amorim was asked if he had received any clarification about when he may lose the trio and replied: \"No, with everything, They are going to play the next game [at Molineux] and that is the only thing I care [about].\"",
