      "Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is poised to make his long-awaited return to competitive football this weekend. The Frenchman hasn't featured in a match for more than two years.",
      "He signed for Ligue 1 outfit Monaco during the summer following a seven-and-a-half month spell as a free agent. He departed Juventus in mid-November following a mutual termination of his contract.",
      "The 32-year-old had been serving a suspension after failing a drugs test, with his initial four-year ban cut to 18 months following an appeal. He became available for selection again in March this year, but didn't join Monaco until the summer.",
      "Despite being cleared to play, Pogba has yet to feature for Monaco this campaign whilst working to regain match sharpness. His comeback was initially scheduled for after the October international window.",
      "That target was subsequently delayed due to a minor setback in his fitness A fresh target date for the Paris FC fixture at the beginning of the month was then set.",
      "But those plans were once more thrown into disarray when the midfielder picked up an ankle problem during training. The injury further delayed the midfielder's debut.",
      "According to L'Equipe, Monaco are preparing to name Pogba in their matchday squad for Saturday evening's Ligue 1 clash with Rennes. If he takes to the field, it will mark the player's first appearance since 3 September 2023, when Juventus defeated Empoli 2-0 in Serie A.",
      "Discussing the ankle knock that ruled him out of the Paris FC encounter, Monaco manager Sebastien Pocognoli said: \"We are awaiting confirmation of the severity of the injury.",
      "\"The idea is that he can be available after the international break; that is the plan that we are following. We are all disappointed.\"",
      "Monaco currently sit sixth in the Ligue 1 table with a tally of 20 points from their first 12 matches and are set to face Rennes away this weekend, before jetting off to Cyprus for a Champions League group stage clash against Pafos on Wednesday night.",
      "Both squads have managed to secure five points from their initial four tournament games and are in 19th and 20th place in the league stage. Pogba's most recent Champions League outing was for United in the Last 16 showdown against Atletico Madrid back in March 2023.",
      "The midfielder enjoyed two stints at United, initially rising through the youth ranks between 2009 and 2012, prior to his transfer to Juventus.",
      "He then made return to Old Trafford in 2016, with a hefty price tag of £89 million. During his time there, he clocked up 233 appearances, netted 39 goals and delivered 51 assists.",
      "In 2022, he made a free transfer back to Juventus. His tenure at United saw him as part of the team that clinched the League Cup in 2010 and 2017, as well as the Europa League in the 2016/17 season.",

      "Mason Greenwood's decision to reject a call-up to play for the Jamaica national team has been vindicated, as the Reggae Boyz failed to secure automatic qualification for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Steve McClaren had hoped that the ex-Manchester United forward would choose to represent Jamaica after it was revealed he had submitted paperwork to change his international allegiance. However, reports surfaced last week suggesting that 24-year-old Greenwood is instead 'obsessed' with donning the England shirt once more, over five years since his debut against Iceland.",
      "Despite England boss Thomas Tuchel making it clear he's not in his plans, Greenwood remains resolute in his ambition to return to international football with the Three Lions.",
      "Now, Greenwood's choice to decline a call-up to the Jamaica squad has now been justified, following their failure to automatically qualify for the upcoming World Cup in North America.",
      "The Reggae Boyz needed a victory over Curacao on Tuesday to top their qualifying group and book their place at the World Cup, but they fell short, ending in a humiliating 0-0 draw.",
      "In doing so, the small Caribbean island finished top of their CONCACAF group and secured their World Cup berth, leaving Jamaica to settle for runners-up and a spot in the intercontinental play-offs.",
      "Soon afterwards, former United coach McClaren announced he would be stepping down from his role as Jamaica manager. \"Over the last 18 months, I have given everything I have to this job,\" he said post-match.",
      "\"Leading this team has been one of the greatest honours of my career. But football is a results business and tonight we have fallen short of our goal, which was to qualify from this group. It is the responsibility of the leader to step forward, take accountability and make decisions in the best interests of the team.",
      "\"After deep reflection and an honest assessment of where we are and where we need to go, I have decided to step down as head coach of the Jamaican national team.\"",
      "He continued: \"Sometimes the best thing a leader can do is to recognise when a fresh voice, new energy and a different perspective is required to move this team forward. I'm positive this team will succeed in March.",
      "\"I thank you, Jamaica. I will be forever grateful to have led the Reggae Boyz, really has been an honour, respect and one love to you all.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Greenwood has been in impressive form for Marseille this campaign.",
      "The forward has netted nine goals and registered four assists in 15 outings across all competitions.",
      "The former Getafe loanee made a £27million switch from Manchester United to the Ligue 1 team last summer and has been turning heads under Roberto De Zerbi's management for the past 16 months.",

      "Manchester United's Patrick Dorgu is teetering on the brink of a suspension which would pose a problem for Ruben Amorim. The wing-back, who has clocked up 624 minutes in 10 Premier League appearances this season, is just one yellow card away from a one-match ban.",
      "Dorgu has already been booked in matches against Tottenham, Brentford, Arsenal and during his brief appearance against Brighton. If he picks up another caution, he'll be forced to sit out United's next match, having reached the maximum number of bookings before gameweek 19.",
      "However, Dorgu's potential absence might not be too major a setback for United. Amorim has an action plan in place as he has favoured Amad at times at right wing-back, resulting in Diogo Dalot being shifted to the opposite flank. When the Denmark international is selected, Noussair Mazraoui or Dalot can fill the other side.",
      "United are set to return to Premier League action on Monday evening when they host Everton at Old Trafford. Amorim faces several selection headaches ahead of the clash, with Benjamin Sesko sidelined for several weeks due to a knee injury sustained in the draw against Spurs.",
      "A public spat between Slovenia and United over the severity of his injury ensued before the international break, but the situation was later clarified.",
      "\"Completely expected from the English media,\" national team boss Matjaz Kek said in reference to his comments being exaggerated. \"But I emphasise - once again - the moment communication was established between us and the Manchester United medical team, the problem was solved in five minutes.\"",
      "Harry Maguire and Casemiro also suffered problems against Tottenham, although the Brazilian went on to play and find the net for his country last week.",
      "The midfielder is also in danger of a suspension with three bookings already against his name and, given his combative approach, it appears certain he will reach that threshold and be ruled out of a fixture during the hectic period ahead.",
      "United face Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Wolves, Bournemouth and Aston Villa before the Christmas break, with clashes against Newcastle United and Wolves sandwiched between then and the New Year.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is one United star certain to be unavailable for some matches during that spell as he'll be on duty for Cameroon at AFCON.",
      "Amad will likewise be away representing the Ivory Coast at the tournament. Players such as Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and even Joshua Zirkzee may consequently prove crucial with numerous forwards set to be missing.",
      "Limited game time for the Dutch attacker has sparked speculation over a January move with a Serie A return mooted as a possibility, though this has been dismissed. United could be busy in the January transfer window, with Amorim previously expressing interest in bolstering his midfield and having made enquiries for Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "After being quoted a hefty price tag, United did not pursue Baleba further before the end of the summer window, while Nottingham Forest sensation Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have emerged as alternative targets.",
      "Joao Gomes is the most recent player rumoured who could make a move to Old Trafford, as Wolves look destined for the drop this term.",

      "Former Manchester United star Nemanja Matic slammed their decision to sell Scott McTominay - and ex-boss Erik ten Hag was on his side. McTominay was sold by United in August 2024 after they accepted a bid from Napoli worth €30million (£25.4m).",
      "The midfielder, 28, made an instant impact in Italy, helping Napoli clinch the Serie A title and winning the league's Player of the Year award. Given a more advanced role by Antonio Conte, McTominay has scored 17 goals in 50 appearances for Napoli and continues to show the Red Devils what they're missing.",
      "It's not only at club level where the United academy graduate has impressed either. McTominay is a talismanic presence for Scotland, as demonstrated by his marvellous bicycle kick to give them the lead in Tuesday's winner-takes-all World Cup qualifier against Denmark on Tuesday night.",
      "The dramatic 4-2 win at Hampden Park raised yet more questions as to why United sold him. If it were up to Matic, who played alongside McTominay for five years, he'd still be at Old Trafford.",
      "\"My opinion is that #manutd made a mistake by selling Scott McTominay, today it is difficult to replace a player like him,\" the Serbian posted on X when the transfer was completed. \"Conte is smart man.\"",
      "Soon after Matic's claim, Ten Hag admitted that he didn't want McTominay to leave. The Red Devils manager, who was sacked two months after the 28-year-old's sale, pointed to the Premier League's rules on academy products.",
      "\"Selling a graduate is considered 100 per cent profit under current PSR rules and United sorely needed the cash. Unfortunately, it's the rules,\" Ten Hag bemoaned. \"You have to discuss the rules to do sales and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It's not the right thing to do but for everyone, for all parts, it's a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it. Of course, for Napoli, a very good player but also for us.\"",
      "The Dutchman added: \"I'm very happy for him and for us, but it's mixed [feelings] because I would have preferred not to lose him. He has Manchester United in his veins... He was so important for our team, he was at Manchester United for over 22 years.\"",
      "McTominay felt that it was right time for a new challenge and said: \"It was a mutual decision. It was a case of - there's an opportunity there, do you want to go?",
      "\"Obviously I know from their side FFP is difficult. It's not easy for clubs to make a decision in regards to homegrown players, but that was never in my thought process. My thought process was coming here, seeing the fans, the coach and hopefully doing really good things.\"",
      "He added: \"On my last day, I had to go and see everyone and it was not easy to say goodbye. But that's football. That's the life. I spoke to him [Ten Hag]. He expressed his thoughts on the situation. I said, 'Listen it's my career, I am here to push myself on'.",
      "\"In this situation, I have to look out for number one and go with my gut feeling of what I want to do in my career and not be held back by any other external factors.",
      "\"It was amicable. I love that football club to bits, they have been my life for 22 years, but I have moved on now. I am thoroughly enjoying myself here.\"",

The former United ace posted an image of his stunning overhead kick on Instagram, with Garnacho and numerous other United legends expressing their admiration in the replies.",

It has been said that Ruben Amorim will be more likely to turn to the club's academy and wait until the summer to splash the cash on a new central midfielder.",
      "But the Portuguese boss has already hinted that the Africa Cup of Nations could spark a small foray into the market. United will be without Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui for a period over the winter.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON],\" Amorim said. \"But we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "And United could yet keep their eyes on four opportunities in particular, according to Mail Online. Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are unlikely to be available but a 'low-cost' move for Wolves star Joao Gomes could be considered.",
      "United will also keep an eye on Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, despite Liverpool being favourites for his signature. Semenyo has a release clause that stands at £60million plus £5m in add-ons, which becomes active in the January transfer window.",
      "Marc Guehi could be another opportunity United consider, even if Liverpool remain favourites for his signature after a £35m deadline day move collapsed. The defender will enter the final six months of his Crystal Palace contract in January, and the Red Devils could be interested in a central defender, given the limited progress in extending Harry Maguire’s deal, which also expires in the summer.",

Alongside Brighton ace Baleba on their shortlist is Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace playmaker Adam Wharton and Gomes.",
      "The Wolves midfielder is in his third full season at Molineux, having joined from Flamengo in January 2023 for around £15million. Gomes signed a new five-year contract with Wolves back in April, but amid their disastrous start to the season - losing nine and drawing two of their opening 11 games - he's been tipped to leave the Premier League's last-placed side.",

Onana was anticipated to keep his position as United's No.1 this season despite underwhelming performances during his opening two campaigns at the club.",
      "A hamstring injury ruled him out of pre-season and Altay Bayindir was given the nod between the sticks for the Premier League clashes with Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley. Onana finally received his opportunity against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, a match that would prove decisive for his Old Trafford future long-term.",
      "The shot-stopper found it difficult to cope with both Grimsby goals and while he showed improvement after the break, his display in the penalty shootout was far from convincing. Five days afterwards, United secured Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp and just over a week later, Onana was sent out on loan to Trabzonspor for the rest of the campaign.",

      "\"Sometimes all you need to say as a goalkeeper is; 'You know what, I'm not going to play it around the back, I'm just going to smack it forward as far as I can.' Lammens, with all the pressure that must have been on his shoulders when he came in, has handled it so well.",
      "\"He comes out for crosses and catches really well, which is a big breath of fresh air for everyone. He's really solid and has taken everything in his stride, which is all that you want from your goalkeeper.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's prohibition on holidays during international breaks continues to apply to the 11 Manchester United players who weren't called up for international duty. The Red Devils manager introduced this policy last year following controversy surrounding Marcus Rashford and Casemiro.",
      "The pair had travelled to the United States last November after being overlooked by England and Brazil respectively. The duo faced severe backlash for their choice to take a long-haul trip for a short break rather than staying in Manchester, with Gary Neville amongst those publicly condemning them.",
      "Amorim was barely a fortnight into his role as United manager and initially defended Rashford and Casemiro, pointing out that the club hadn't explicitly forbidden them from travelling during the international window.",
      "The 40-year-old said at the time: \"Would I set a different structure? Yes, for sure. But we cannot put this on the players. They told them they have five days off so they can fly anywhere. Because nobody in the club says you cannot fly. So we cannot, this time, put that on Rash or Case.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim acknowledged that changes were imminent as he stated: \"Us as a club have to set the standards and have to manage that. It's my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly.",
      "\"This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\" It's a change has remained a year on since his appointment and one the current crop of United players not on international duty have abided by.",
      "The club have 15 first-team players away on national team duty, with 11 players remaining at Carrington ahead of their return to Premier League action on Monday against at home to Everton.",
      "The 11 players include the likes of Benjamin Sesko, who withdrew from the Slovenia squad through injury, and the England quintet of Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, plus Tom Heaton.",
      "Netherlands pair Tyrell Malacia and Joshua Zirkzee have also stayed at the training complex, while youngsters Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Chido Obi all hope to catch Amorim's eye in their pursuit of more first-team opportunities.",
      "United were last in action at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium earlier this month where they scraped a point against Spurs in the 2-2 draw, courtesy of Matthijs de Ligt's 96th minute equaliser.",
      "After the game, Amorim lamented his side's lack of bravery as he said: \"I think it's more we need to look at ourselves. We were not pressing with the same intensity, because we felt comfortable.",
      "\"We need to understand that but to feel also that if we have a little bit more bravery, we can kill this game. Sometimes it's like that: you have a first half better than the second.\"",

      "Manchester United have been told that Elliot Anderson could be tempted to leave Nottingham Forest despite the club ruling out selling the England midfielder in the January transfer window. The 23-year-old is understood to be high on United's target list as Ruben Amorim plans an overhaul of his midfield.",
      "Forest have set a hefty £100million price tag for the player as doubts have been raised over whether the Red Devils could afford to fund such a deal. According to reports, Forest are unwilling to sell Anderson in the winter window as they aim to transform their fortunes under Sean Dyche's leadership.",
      "However, former United goalkeeper Ben Foster is convinced that any suitors could be in luck if they are willing to wait until the summer. Newcastle United, who Anderson left to join Forest for £15m last summer, are also believed to be keen on re-signing him.",
      "And Foster reckons recruiting Anderson is as \"sure a bet as you can get\" to add quality in midfield after praising his \"phenomenal\" work rate. The ex-Wrexham and Watford keeper also thinks that the £100m asking price is about right in today's market.",
      "“It doesn't surprise me in this modern day as he's a very, very good player,\" Foster told talkSPORT. \"He's so reliable and he's absolute quality all over the pitch. His work rate is phenomenal and he looks like a really good lad as well.",
      "\"Forest wouldn't want to get rid, but if anybody did go and sign him, I'd say it's about as sure a bet as you can get when signing a player. Forest fans would definitely say no, but if there's a couple of teams in for him in the summer, you can't blame him for wanting to go.",
      "\"That's no disrespect to Nottingham Forest, who are a massive football team, but when you're talking about some of these big European teams, then the question's got to be asked.\"",
      "Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis is the man who is expected to have the final say on the club's valuation of Anderson. The asking price could rise over £100m after he signed a five-year deal at the City Ground in July 2024.",
      "Speaking about Anderson recently, Newcastle legend Alan Shearer said: \"It [Anderson’s exit from Newcastle was the best thing. Although it was tough for Newcastle and it wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for PSR.",
      "\"But it was the best thing that happened to him, to get out and play. He wasn't going to get in Newcastle's midfield. You've got to give him credit. He wouldn't be far away now [from getting in Newcastle's midfield], I agree with that.",
      "\"He wouldn't have been able to do what he has done and is doing at Newcastle. Good for him. I'm delighted for him. He's gone from being a bit-part player at Newcastle to being one of the main guys at Forest and one of England's.\"",
      "England boss Thomas Tuchel has also hailed Anderson as one of the most effective midfielders in the Premier League. He said: \"Anderson is a key player for us at the moment. He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League - that's why he is with us and starting for us.",
      "\"He deserves it because he has been nothing but impressive. He has to keep on going now though. He is a very complete and mobile midfielder, and that's what he keeps showing me.\"",

      "Manchester United enquired about the availability of Romeo Lavia during the summer transfer window, but Chelsea chiefs never considered letting the 21-year-old midfielder go. The midfielder's future in west London was uncertain at the end of last season after he sustained an injury at the FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "The former Manchester City prospect, who was signed by the Blues from Southampton for £53m in August 2023, had to sit out the rest of the tournament due to a muscle strain. Despite his injury woes, Lavia managed to start three of the opening four games in the United States.",
      "Having missed a significant part of the domestic campaign, making just 11 starts in the Premier League, his setback raised doubts about his reliability.",
      "However, according to football.london, Chelsea made clear they were keeping their faith in the Belgian, who is under contract until June 2030.",
      "Meanwhile, the Blues were successful in signing Alejandro Garnacho from United, with Enzo Maresca securing his signature at the end of August in a deal worth just £40m. The report claims the Red Devils did enquire about Lavia during the summer, but Chelsea never offered him up.",
      "United did, however, express interest in Christopher Nkunku, who was later snapped up by AC Milan for £36m.",
      "Until earlier this month, when Lavia suffered another injury, it seemed like he was living up to the expectations of the Club World Cup winners.",
      "Prior to picking up a muscle injury during Chelsea's 2-2 stalemate with Qarabag in the UEFA Champions League, the Belgian had made six appearances across all competitions. Lavia had impressed, playing a key role as the Blues secured victories against Liverpool, Nottingham Forest, and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Now, he's facing a time out injured, potentially sidelined for fixtures against the likes of Barcelona, Arsenal, and Newcastle United. Speaking to journalists in Baku, Maresca gave his initial assessment of the setback.",
      "The Italian said: \"We feel a shame for him, especially for him. He's not able to be fit for a long, long period. We will see now. It's too early to understand what kind of injury. I think it's his quad.\"",
      "Later, during the pre-match press briefing before Chelsea's encounter with Wolves, Maresca described the injury as 'painful'. The Blues manager was fully conscious of the gamble in fielding Lavia, drawing parallels with Reece James's predicament.",
      "Prior to the lengthy journey to Azerbaijan, he had outlined his strategy for the midfielder. Maresca said: \"The main target for Romeo now is to be fit.",
      "\"Don't get any injuries. For me, at this moment, Romeo is where Reece was more or less one year ago in terms of back after a long time. We need to manage him every minute, every day, every second.",
      "\"And the target with him is just to keep him fit. So, he's training with us. He's OK. He's 100 per cent fit. But, we need to be very careful with him because we don't want him to be out again and finally he can enjoy being a football player.\"",
      "Maresca added: \"In the Forest game, we planned for him 45 minutes. Then Ajax, I think he played one hour, 70 minutes. The other day against Tottenham, when he was on, he was very good.",
      "\"We are happy with Romeo. We are happy with the way he's progressing. And the only thing we want is to keep him fit. So, I would like to have Romeo inside the pitch always. But it's my duty to try to protect also him.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim reportedly wants to bring back Manchester United legends like Eric Cantona to ensure the current crop of players can utilise their knowledge and experience - particularly the younger stars.",
      "The Portuguese head coach has just marked his first 12 months in charge at Old Trafford and is in the midst of the best unbeaten run of his tenure. It has not been smooth sailing for the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss and he's keen to tap into the success of yesteryear.",
      "As well as Cantona, who is regarded as the signing that helped spearhead the club's success in the early 1990s, Amorim also wants to make use of the IQ held by the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Teddy Sheringham, Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke.",
      "They were all part of the 1999 treble-winning side and Amorim is said to hold “a deep admiration and appreciation” for the club's legendary figures and wants them to aid the development in the younger players in his squad.",
      "United have the likes of Benjamin Sesko and Amad in their ranks. The former was their most expensive summer signing but has endured a mixed start to his time in Manchester. Academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game as he struggles for minutes.",
      "An insider told The Sun: “Throughout his own career, Ruben always loved when former players and legends of the clubs he played for would interact with the team - sharing knowledge, stories, and advice about what it means to represent the club. Coming from Benfica, he understands what real pressure feels like and how to use it to grow - as a man, a player, and now as a leader. He believes these exchanges can help the players make the most of their time at United, both on and off the pitch.”",
      "While Darren Fletcher is the under-18s coach, United have no previous players currently in and around the first-team group. A host of clubs around Europe have previously made use of club legends, be that as managers or assistants, but the Red Devils haven't had such a figure since Ruud van Nistelrooy. Michael Carrick also served as assistant to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Cantona remains a legendary figure at Old Trafford. He spent five years in Manchester, scoring 82 times, and winning the Premier League on four occasions. He also claimed the FA Cup twice and has a huge admirer in Amorim.",
      "The United source added: “Ruben loves Cantona. He sees him as the embodiment of the spirit and aura of Manchester United. These are people who have United in their DNA, and Ruben wants that energy, that heritage, to be felt and lived by everyone in the squad.”",

      "His exploits in the south coast wasn't enough to keep them from being relegated but it did lead to a £58million move to Stamford Bridge in 2023. The Belgium international was notably courted by Liverpool that same summer but opted to join the Blues.",
      "The likes of Arsenal and the Red Devils were also linked with signing the then-teenager during his time with the Saints and he was even asked to address the interest in him from some of the world's biggest clubs.",
      "Despite his tender age, Lavia showed just how professional he was in what was his first season of senior football, admitting he was aware of the fleeting attention players receive in football while remaining focused on his job with the Saints. Speaking in 2023, he said: \"I don’t read it because I just don’t think about it.",
      "\"I just enjoy my football and focus on what we have to do as a club. Whatever is outside, it is not what I can control, so I don’t pay attention to that. Football, with how it goes, it goes so fast. One moment you can be in the headlines and the next, you’re not.",
      "\"So the only thing to do is just be neutral, don’t think about it and get your head down and work.\" Lavia's arrival in west London was seen a huge coup but over two years on, he's been a major disappointment.",
      "Back to the present day and injuries have decimated his start to life at Chelsea. He has played just 30 games across all competitions since joining the Blues in August of 2023.",
      "He's currently out of action for a month due to muscle strain, and his inability to remain fit for a consistent period of time reportedly saw Chelsea attempt to part ways with Lavia this past summer.",
      "According to ESPN, while Alejandro Garnacho was signed in a £40m deal from United, the Blues are said to have attempted to include Lavia in a swap deal arrangement for the Argentine. However it was swiftly declined by the Red Devils due to concerns over his fitness.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Lavia has played just 240 minutes of action this season and even when fit, he's got the challenge of battling Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo for spots in Enzo Maresca's midfield.",
      "After a slow start to Garnacho's Chelsea career, the 21-year-old has three goals and assists in his last three league games. He has started the last five games in the top-flight, with the west Londoners racking up four wins in that time.",

      "Joao Gomes has spoken out on social media amid rumours of a potential move to Manchester United. The Red Devils are reportedly eyeing the Wolves star as Ruben Amorim looks to strengthen his midfield in the January transfer window.",
      "Mirror Sport understands that Gomes is on United's radar as a possible alternative to Elliot Anderson, who has also caught the attention of Liverpool and Manchester City. United have also long been fans of Carlos Baleba, but he and the Nottingham Forest playmaker could command a price tag north of £100m.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo's future hanging in the balance, Gomes has come into the picture. The Red Devils have been keeping a close eye on the Brazil international for the past 18 months, and they might have to dig deep into their pockets to secure his services.",
      "Reports in Portugal have suggested Gomes could be up for grabs for around £44m, but Mirror Sport understands that any deal at that price might have to be put on hold until the summer. When Rob Edwards took over from Vitor Pereira, the top brass at Molineux agreed not to offload the club's key players in the winter window to boost Wolves' chances of staying up.",
      "Posting a photo of himself in Wolves training gear, having missed out on Carlo Ancelotti's latest Brazil squad, the United target wrote: \"Excited to do what no one believes, for us and for our city. Let's go wolves [wolf emoji].\"",
      "Gomes, who is tied down at Molineux until June 2030, has made 11 Premier League appearances this campaign, with Wolves drawing two and losing nine of those matches. Despite the club's struggles to pick up points, the Brazilian midfielder has impressed observers.",
      "He's previously drawn comparisons to Casemiro from Matheus Cunha, who swapped Molineux for Old Trafford in a £62.5million switch last July. The pair were teammates in the Black Country, playing together 70 times over a three-season period.",
      "Gomes and the new United striker have also linked up at the international level, featuring in a 4-1 loss to Argentina back in March. Speaking in an interview last July, Cunha outlined why his compatriot would fit perfectly into Amorim's squad.",
      "Asked which player the Wolves star brings to mind, the United forward said: \"Maybe Casemiro. He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive.",
      "\"I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that. He is unbelievable on the pitch.\"",
      "Cunha added: \"I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, hinted that some of his squad members might be looking for a way out last month. As quoted by ESPN, the United gaffer said: \"A lot of things can happen.",
      "\"Even in our club, and you know that we have World Cup, some players are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything.\"",
      "Amorim didn't dismiss the idea of bolstering his team during the winter transfer window. He continued: \"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United.",
      "\"We are not just buying one guy, because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now. No, it's going to be... we want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen, but of course we think about how we can improve the team, and in January the window is open, we can do something.\"",

      "Scott McTominay helped fire Scotland to the World Cup for the first time in 28 years with ex-Manchester United ace - and now Napoli team-mate - Rasmus Hojlund congratulating him.",
      "The midfielder scored after three minutes in the must-win clash with Denmark with a stunning overhead kick at Hampden Park on Tuesday night. Hojlund's Danes were holding their opponents until two dramatic stoppage time goals saw the Scots claim the three points with a 4-2 win and leapfrog Denmark to top the group.",
      "It led to jubilant scenes in Glasgow with Scotland heading to a first World Cup since 1998. Kieran Tierney put the Scots ahead with a stunning strike after 93 minutes before Kenny McLean scored from his own half with Kasper Schmeichel off his line.",
      "McTominay has been integral to Scotland's qualifying success with his stock going through the roof since he left Manchester and headed to Naples. He was named as the Serie A's best player last term and has lapped up the praise - with Hojlund among them despite playing for the losing side.",
      "McTominay posted on Instagram: \"USA BABY. SCOTLAND ARE COMING\". Hojlund was quick to reply as he said: \"Congrats mate. Well done\". Fellow Scot and Napoli team-mate Billy Gilmour said: \"Yassssssss Scotty boy\".",
      "Hojlund, like McTominay, had been able to look far more impressive since leaving Manchester and heading to Italy. The Danish forward struggled for form during his spell in the Premier League but he has looked much more confident since he headed back to Serie A.",
      "Steve Clarke masterminded Scotland's route to the World Cup having been in charge since 2019. The ex-Kilmarnock boss has taken the Scots to the last two Euros, albeit they failed to win games at either of those tournaments, but believes his approach has proved successful.",
      "He said: \"Really simple - what a fantastic group of players. Unbelievable. I've said it from the very start of my time. It took me a year, maybe 18 months, to work out the best way to go forward. If I give myself a bit of credit, I chose the right way.",
      "\"We chose more caps, more experience. When you come to a night like this, when you're behind and struggling, and not sure it's going to happen, I trust my players. I've told them so many times, I trust them implicitly.",
      "\"I woke up this morning, and as a manager you normally wake up with that tight feeling in your stomach. I didn't have it this morning, and I thought 'wow, that's strange.' I thought there was something wrong with me! But it's because I trust my players so much.\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson believed Scott McTominay would become a Manchester United great before his move to Napoli. The midfielder scored a brilliant opening goal in Scotland's 4-2 win against Denmark.",
      "For the first time since 1998, Scotland will grace the World Cup having topped their qualifying group. In a thrilling contest, they put Denmark to the sword at Hampden to stamp their ticket to the competition in North America.",
      "McTominay bagged the opener with a sensational overhead kick and he is enjoying a successful year, having won the league with club side Napoli. The 28-year-old moved to Italy from United in 2024.",
      "The midfielder was with the Manchester club until the age of five and was highly regarded by former managers. Iconic head coach Ferguson, in particular, expected he would amount to great things at Old Trafford before his sale, which United may be regretting.",
      "Back in 2021, Ferguson was asked about McTominay, who had begun to find his feet in the first team and was even named as a stand-in captain for an FA Cup tie.",
      "The Scottish boss, who won 13 Premier League titles at United, sang McTominay's praises and expected that he would emerge as and had almost already become one of his side's pivotal puzzle pieces.",
      "\"Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of Man United's big players,\" Ferguson told the Scottish FA. \"When you watch Man United pick their team for a big game, McTominay's name is in it. He's a good character, a great trainer. I know a little bit about the boy and I think that's the background.\"",
      "Alas, McTominay was sold in August 2024 for £25.7million. Manager at the time, Erik ten Hag, even hinted that he wished he could have kept the Scotsman at the club, but because of the value homegrown players hold in the eyes of PSR their hands were relatively tied.",
      "\"It is a little bit mixed,\" said Ten Hag when asked about McTominay being sold. \"I am very happy for him, but it is mixed because I wouldn't prefer to lose him. He is Manchester United in everything. He was so important for Manchester United.",
      "\"He was here for over 22 years but unfortunately, it is the rules. Homegrown players bring more value and that is not the right thing to do but for everyone, for all parties, it is a good deal. Scott is happy with it, and Napoli and us.\"",
      "Fast forward just over a year and McTominay has been named the Serie A MVP for his role in Napoli's title win. He is now World Cup-bound after scoring a wondergoal and United may rue the fact that they let such an influential player depart.",
      "Scotland captain and McTominay's team-mate Andy Robertson said after the history-making win: \"I'm so glad it's ended up this way. This group of boys, this group of staff, it's the best group I've been involved in.",
      "\"The manager's speech before the game was unbelievable. He went through the big moments we've had. Qualifying for the Euros - he couldn't quite remember - we were in Wunderbar. He said 'Let's make it another one.'",
      "\"We were quite emotional. To do it for him, the staff and all our families, it'll go down as one of the greatest nights of my life. That just sums up this squad. Never say die.",
      "\"We just keep going right to the end and one of the craziest games. We put the country through it, but I'm sure it's worth it. We're going to the World Cup.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Premier League striker Paul Dickov has given Carlos Baleba some advice on how to justify his hefty £110m price tag, amid interest from Manchester United. The Red Devils were reportedly eyeing the 21-year-old during the summer transfer window, but baulked at the asking price.",
      "Baleba was said to be keen on a move to Old Trafford, but a deal never came to fruition. Brighton appear to hold all the cards in this ongoing transfer saga, as the youngster's contract doesn't run out until 2028, with an option for an additional year.",
      "Despite a slower start to this season following his standout performances last term, United are still reportedly interested in the defensive midfielder. However, it's the steep price tag that Dickov can't quite wrap his head around.",
      "He said in an interview with Best Betting Bonuses: \"I didn't really think he was worth £110million in the summer, really, but he's a wonderful player. He's still a very young boy.",
      "\"Sometimes with the speculation and the pressure surrounding him in the summer, it can affect players. You know, the last couple of games, he has been better, but he has struggled this season.",
      "\"That could be the pressure that's been put on him. Sometimes the price tag, that talk of going to clubs like United, Chelsea or wherever it may be, it can affect you.",
      "\"I think what he's got to do is, first and foremost, concentrate on himself and try to get his form back to somewhere where it was because he was outstanding last season.",
      "\"If he can do that, there's going to be a lot of clubs that are going to come back knocking. But I'm not quite too sure about £110 million.\"",
      "Given that Casemiro's deal runs until 2026, Baleba might be viewed as a potential long-term successor. Yet with the seasoned Brazilian showing renewed vigour on the field, Amorim may face a challenging decision come next summer.",
      "United are also said to be monitoring Elliot Anderson, who offers similar qualities to Baleba. Once more, should United genuinely pursue Anderson, they would likely need to stump up around £100million for the Nottingham Forest star.",
      "Man United and Brighton have already locked horns this season, with Amorim's side emerging victorious 4-2. Their next encounter is on the final Premier League matchday, which could see Baleba's last outing for Brighton against his potential future club.",

      "Ruben Amorim could use Joao Gomes’ dream of playing in the Champions League to bring the Wolves star to Manchester United. Amorim’s Red Devils are currently enjoying their best spell since the Portuguese head coach took the reins a year ago, having gone five games without defeat in the Premier League.",
      "That puts them in seventh place and within touching distance of a Champions League qualification spot, albeit after just 11 games. But there is certainly a belief brewing at Carrington that United can return to Europe’s elite club competition next year - something Amorim has candidly spoken about in the past as a main objective.",
      "The club hierarchy are prepared to back him in the January transfer window, as they already did by spending over £200million on their forward line and bringing in new No.1 goalkeeper Senne Lammens last summer.",
      "Central midfield is the one area that needs the most urgent attention, with the Red Devils being linked with several names. They include the likes of Carlos Baleba and Elliott Anderson, as well as 24-year-old Wolves ace Gomes.",
      "The Brazilian, as first reported in Portugal, is deemed to be a more affordable alternative to the aforementioned duo, and was even hailed as “unbelievable” by compatriot and United star Matheus Cunha.",
      "As previously reported, Gomes has been extensively watched by United bosses over the past 18 months and could be available for around £44m. However, it is believed that any potential deal may have to wait until the summer due to Wolves being in the midst of a relegation battle and agreeing with their new manager not to sell their top players in January.",
      "While that would prove potentially frustrating in the short term, waiting until the end of the season may boost United’s chances of signing the ex-Flamengo star. Should Amorim’s men actually qualify for the Champions League, it would make Old Trafford a far more attractive destination for Gomes.",
      "The player has made his desire to play Champions League football clear in the past, though with the added fact that he would like to do so for rivals Liverpool. Prior to joining Wolves, Gomes told ESPN Brazil in the summer of 2022: \"Liverpool is a team I would play for. I have the greatest desire to play. Playing in the Champions League is my biggest dream and that of my family, my biggest dream in football.\"",
      "While sickening to hear for any United fans about his support for their rivals, football moves quickly and a new and improved United with the promise of European football would put them in good stead if they approach Gomes next summer.",
      "And it's something Amorim is keen to achieve. Speaking ahead of last season's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, the United boss said: \"Personally for me, Champions League is more important for everything, to prepare the next season, and we are supposed to be in the Champions League.\"",
      "For now, the most difficult task for Amorim will be to sustain this form and push on, with plenty of games still left in the season. United host Everton in the Premier League next Monday before a visit to Crystal Palace.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Much was made of Manchester United's summer transfer business, as Ruben Amorim was allowed to further shape his squad at Old Trafford.",
      "Backed by the club's hierarchy, over £200million was spent to overhaul the Red Devils' attack, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arriving. Senne Lammens joined too to be the club's new No.1 and the Belgian has impressed between the sticks.",
      "There have also been outgoings, both permanently - Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea perhaps the most notable - and on temporary deals. Indeed, United have 18 players out on loan this season. Some, like Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana, were pushed out in high-profile deals with Amorim having decided United needed to go in another direction - but with no-one willing to splash the cash straight away.",
      "Then there are a plethora of youngsters - both signed with an eye to the future and those who have come through the academy - sent out on loan to gain experience. Some of those are thriving in new surroundings, while others haven't had the impact both they and the club may have hoped.",
      "The Cameroon international has been the subject of praise in the Turkish media since moving on loan to Trabzonspor. He has been a key part of a run of one defeat in eight league games, keeping three clean sheets and helping them to third in the table.",
      "It's not quite a total rejuvenation of his career, but it might well be signs that the 29 year-old is back on track and will give United hope of being able to find a buyer at a decent price next summer.",
      "The 22-year-old goalkeeper has been very important to Bristol City's solid start to the season, the No.1 pick for Gerhard Struber at Ashton Gate.",
      "He has started every Championship game so far, keeping five clean sheets in the process and Struber has been impressed: “He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "After injury saw him miss the opening two games of the League Two season, Harrison started the next four matches for Shrewsbury Town before reporting for England Under-20 duty in September. In his absence, another young goalkeeper took his spot and Harrison has been on the outside looking in since.",
      "The young right-back has made 13 league starts in League Two so far and gained valuable experience, albeit in a struggling dressing room.",
      "Now Dave Hughes, who coached Ogunneye in United's academy, has just departed and that might impact Ogunneye's role in the squad moving forwards.",
      "Aljofree, 20, started the first eight games of the campaign but he has lost his starting role over the last few weeks. When Notts County faced Harrogate Town last weekend he was missing from the squad.",
      "Things haven't been going the way United had hoped for the centre-back in the National League.",
      "Solihull Moors sit in mid-table, but Jackson has fallen from prominence. Since starting the opening two games of the season he has struggled to make the lineup since and has been absent from the past five matchday squads.",
      "It's been a nightmare campaign for the Owls amid their ownership situation, barely being able to get a team out and with a 12-point deduction.",
      "But Amass has been a bright spot. He's been given regular game time, making 11 stars and scored his first senior goal against Southampton. United are delighted with his time at Hillsborough so far and it looks like he'll extend his stay until the end of the season.",
      "The 20 year-old is performing well in Scotland's top flight with Falkirk, who are enjoying a very respectable season so far, exceeding expectations and currently sitting fifth in the Premiership table.",
      "William has contributed a goal and three assists in nine appearances in the Scottish top-flight for Falkirk, who are exceeding expectations by sitting fifth in the table.",
      "The 19 year-old midfielder has made 15 appearances for Orient thus far in League One, but only four of those have been starts in the league.",
      "As the season moves forwards, he'll be looking to force his way into the starting lineup, because there have been glimpses of quality throughout the campaign.",
      "Midfielder Gore returned on loan to Rotherham in the summer, having initially joined in January, only to pick up an injury shortly after arriving.",
      "This term, Gore has been crucial for Rotherham in midfield. He has started 15 games in League One and has been one of the Yorkshire club's best players.",
      "Toby Collyer had to bide his time under Ryan Mason at The Hawthorns, making seven substitute appearances immediately after his arrival.",
      "He broke into the starting team against Millwall last month and retained his role in the next game, but he has since picked up a muscle injury.",
      "Ennis spent the second half of last season with promotion-winning Doncaster Rovers and subsequently joined Fleetwood on a season-long loan for the current campaign.",
      "It's been something of a mixed bag so far, albeit a productive one, starting eight league games and contributing two goals and an assist. Now Ennis and United - and Fleetwood too - will be hoping he can kick on.",
      "Things aren't going the way Jadon Sancho may have hoped in the West Midlands.",
      "After seeing Chelsea pay £5million not to sign him, he is in something of a slump this season. The £73m winger has not started for Aston Villa in the Premier League and has failed to record a goal or an assist.",
      "Barcelona seemed a great fit for Rashford to rediscover his form as he made the 'dream' move that he desperately wanted.",
      "And Rashford has certainly looked reborn in Catalunya. He has contributed six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances this season, got himself back in the England reckoning under Thomas Tuchel and is making a major impact for the Blaugrana.",
      "It's been interesting for the Dane back in Italy, where he made his name before joining United with Atalanta. Hojlund made an excellent first impression in Naples, scoring twice against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League shortly after his arrival, but he has scored just four goals in total.",
      "His recent performances have seen him come in for some stick among the Italian media, with last season's title winners currently in fourth. His place will come under threat from Romelu Lukaku soon.",
      "Young striker Wheatley needed to leave on loan after outgrowing academy football to get some senior action. He has made 13 starts in League Two for Northampton and has found the back of the net twice, as well as recording two assists.",
      "Kana-Biyik was called up to France's Under-20 squad for the November internationals and recently scored his first senior goal, salvaging a point in a local derby.",
      "A major disappointment for Hugill thanks to injury. He started the first two games of the League Two season, but hasn't been seen since.",
      "His Old Trafford contract expires in June, but United have the option of extending the deal by 12 months.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 50% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "Manchester United will be aiming to stretch their unbeaten run to six games when they host Everton. It's been a turbulent start to the season for Ruben Amorim's side, but the mood at Old Trafford has lifted significantly since their last defeat - all the way back in September.",
      "Granted, two 2-2 draws against Tottenham and Nottingham Forest just before the international break hardly set pulses racing, especially after the impressive run of victories against Brighton, Liverpool and a high-flying Sunderland team.",
      "Even so, United sit seventh, only two points behind third-placed Chelsea and a win on Monday could - depending on other results - lift them into the Champions League places for the first time since August 2024.",
      "They will fancy their chances, too, given their impressive recent record against Everton. Although the most recent meeting between the sides ended in a draw last February, United had won the previous six encounters, with their last defeat to the Toffees coming way back in April 2022.",
      "With the Premier League returning this weekend, here are the latest Manchester United headlines.",
      "Roy Keane and Rio Ferdinand are singing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to Adam Wharton, with the Crystal Palace midfielder continually linked with a move to Old Trafford. According to reports, Wharton is high on United's transfer wishlist, with the club weighing up a possible approach in 2026.",
      "The 21-year-old has been a revelation since arriving at Selhurst Park last season and is now a full England international, having started in Sunday's 2-0 win over Albania. His composure, tenacity and footballing intelligence have rightly earned widespread praise, but it is his willingness to play forward passes that has particularly impressed United legends Keane and Ferdinand.",
      "\"I do like Adam Wharton,\" Keane said after England's win at the weekend. \"A lot of the modern midfielders, their first option seems to be, 'Can I go sideways or backwards?'",
      "\"What I like about him, the first option he seems to look at it is, 'Can I pass it forward?' and that's a big strength to have. This is where he can mature over the next year or two if he's playing at the top level.",
      "\"Put demands onto people. Shout at players, go, 'Give me the ball!' That's what I used to do, I used to fall out with people a lot. 'Give me the ball!' Put demands on your team-mates.",
      "\"He's still new to it, so I'm not going to be too harsh on him. But as he matures and starts playing more games, put demands on your team-mates.\"",
      "Ferdinand has noticed the same thing, specifically highlighting Wharton's progressive passing as a major reason why he'd be an excellent signing for United.",
      "\"I would sign another central midfielder this summer to play alongside Manuel Ugarte. That player needs to be able to take the ball and transfer it up the pitch. You know who I would go for? Adam Wharton,\" he said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel.",
      "\"I would go get him. The reason I would take him is that he can get on the ball and transfer it up the pitch. Wharton has got a great range of passing. I think he would be a great addition to the United squad. He reminds me of Michael Carrick a bit.\"",
      "However, prising Wharton away from Crystal Palace will be far easier said than done. The Eagles are expected to demand in the region of £100million for their prized midfielder next summer and, with his contract at Selhurst Park not expiring until 2029, they are in no hurry to sell.",
      "Bacary Sagna has urged United to trigger Antoine Semenyo's £65m release clause in January, insisting the Bournemouth forward would take the club \"to the next level.\" The Ghanaian has been in sensational form this season, scoring six goals and providing three assists in just 11 Premier League appearances.",
      "United, long-term admirers who seriously considered a move for him last summer, now have a clear pathway to sign him when the clause becomes active and the former Arsenal and Manchester City defender believes the fee would be money very well spent.",
      "\"Looking forward, if he was to leave Bournemouth and stay in the Premier League, I think Manchester United would be a suitable option for him,\" Sagna told Oddspedia. \"He could definitely help the club get back to the top end of the league and if he did join them, he'd be regarded as the player which made the difference and take United to the next level.",
      "\"He's young, fresh and has proven he can shine in big games this season - so I think Old Trafford could be a good destination for him.\"",
      "United's recruitment strategy is now focused on Premier League-proven talent, as demonstrated by the summer arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Semenyo ticks the same boxes - both in profile and tactically - with the 25-year-old equally comfortable out wide or cutting in as an inside forward.",
      "The Red Devils are not alone in their admiration, though. Liverpool and Tottenham are also linked with the player and the public knowledge of his £65m January release clause is likely to alert several more suitors.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window went well, but heading towards January the Reds know there is work to be done as their squad still feels light in certain areas. Even with the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, the Reds still feel short in attack. Sesko's injury has shown that to be the case.",
      "Should Sesko miss any upcoming games, United seem destined to play Cunha as the false nine with Mbeumo and one of Mason Mount or Amad behind him. But when Mbeumo and Amad leave for AFCON, United suddenly look very short. Ruben Amorim did hint after the Tottenham draw that he could delve into the January market, especially if Sesko's injury is serious.",
      "Even if Sesko doesn't miss a game for United it must be clear to Amorim that another forward addition is needed. Fortunately, the green light has just been given to repeat a trick United used in the summer. The Reds targeted attackers who, as Jason Wilcox put it, can 'plug in and play'. Mbeumo in particular looks to be a very good piece of business as he settles into his new surroundings and continues to score goals.",
      "There is clearly something to be said for signing players who have Premier League experience and so United should be on the lookout for any players at fellow Premier League clubs who could be on the move. According to The Athletic, Bournemouth's top scorer Antoine Semenyo has a release clause of just £65m this winter.",
      "United would need to act quickly to activate it though as it is claimed to expire early in the January window. But, if they did want to make a move, why would United hesitate? Semenyo is a proven goalscorer at this level, with six in 11 for Bournemouth so far this season.",
      "While he has been utilised as a winger this season, he has more than enough experience as a centre-forward to provide decent competition for Sesko at the top end of the pitch. The only issue is whether United would have the funds to activate his release clause. The obvious candidate if United were to sell before they can buy is Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "It is hard to envisage a scenario where Zirkzee gets game time ahead of Sesko, or any of United's other attacking players for that matter. It is believed the striker is set to hand in a transfer request in January and any funds raised from his sale could help a swoop for Semenyo.",
      "It is a deal that would make a lot of sense for United but there will be other teams wanting to snap him up. Liverpool and Tottenham are among the other clubs thought to be keen on him so the Reds would need to act quickly.",

      "The January transfer window may be a notoriously difficult month for clubs to do business, but for Manchester United and other top teams it can present an opportunity. Players who are out of contract in the summer can speak to overseas clubs as early as January.",
      "If you are club like United where there are a number of players out of contract at the end of the campaign, you need to decide what the plan is for them before January rolls around. If you don't, you risk losing players who you may wish to keep. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at five players United must make decisions on before the January window opens.",
      "Tom Heaton",
      "Starting with the least urgent decision, Heaton has been a good servant for the club since moving back to Old Trafford. Some often underestimate the importance of the third-choice goalkeeper but Heaton has been part of the leadership team at United this season and he is clearly respected at the club.",
      "His future will depend on whether the former Burnley man wishes to retire at the end of the campaign. If he doesn't, the Reds will need to make a choice. But either way, they will want to know what is happening at the end of the season before January arrives.",
      "Tyrell Malacia",
      "This one feels like an open and shut case. Malacia requested to leave United in the summer transfer window but he was the one member of the 'bomb squad' to miss out on an exit.",
      "Ruben Amorim has reintegrated him into first-team training and he has made one appearance on the bench this season. His time at the club is coming to an end and United would more than likely welcome him signing a pre-contract agreement elsewhere in January.",
      "Jadon Sancho",
      "Certainly a trickier decision than Malacia. Not because there is a route back into the United fold for the winger but due to whether or not the club decides to take a risk and activate the 12-month extension in his deal.",
      "If they do that, the Reds will have two chances to gain some money back for the forward. However, they are only pushing the issue further down the line and activating an extra 12 months against his will doesn't seem like the right move for United to make.",
      "Sancho's time to earn a permanent exit for a fee has passed him by and United need to put this sorry saga to bed. His performances at Aston Villa have done little to suggest any club would want to pay a fee for him.",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Maguire has managed to turn around his career at Old Trafford and will now be remembered somewhat fondly for how he has bounced back. United would like to keep Maguire and you can tell he is a good person to have in the dressing room. The contract needs to be right though.",
      "Casemiro",
      "Arguably the trickiest decision on this list. Casemiro has been superb this season for United, he is their second top goalscorer and is enjoying a renaissance at Old Trafford. United hold an option to extend his contract by a further year but the Reds would like to negotiate him down from that lofty salary.",
      "There seems to be a severe lack of affordable and quality defensive midfielders at present and United will know that. But if Casemiro is unwilling to agree to a lower salary, the Reds will have no choice but to move on, but that decision needs to be made soon.",

      "Manchester United face a fight to land Wolves midfield ace Joao Gomes if they make a January move.",
      "A new midfielder will be top of Ruben Amorim's wishlist if United look to strengthen in the mid-season window. United are unbeaten in five Premier League outings, their best run under Amorim since his appointment 12 months ago, with the club aiming to qualify for Europe next season.",
      "Having spent over £200million to rebuild the club's ailing attack and finding themselves a new No.1 in the shape of Senne Lammens, adding more quality to United's midfield ranks is the next port of call.",
      "Nottingham Forest and England midfielder Elliot Anderson is admired by those at the club, while Brighton's Carlos Baleba was considered last summer. However, both would likely cost in excess of £100m.",
      "United are also understood to have been monitoring Brazil international Gomes over the past 18 months and he has emerged as a more cost-effective alternative, with suggestions of a £44million price tag mooted in some overseas reports.",
      "However, Wolves are loath to sell their prized asset given the club's dire situation in the Premier League and amid growing fan unrest.",
      "New manager Rob Edwards has been hired with the club vowing to do all it can to remain in the top flight. And that includes telling the new head coach that, despite only having two points from 11 games thus far, they will not be cashing in on their star man as they look to give themselves the best possible chance of staying up.",
      "Gomes would undoubtedly be keen on a move to United, where he would team up with £62.5m former Wolves teammate Matheus Cunha, who has previously labelled the ex-Flamengo star \"unbelievable\".",
      "And he will be aware that a move to United may not still be there in the summer if other options appear at the table.",
      "But Wolves are ready to insist he stays put until the end of the campaign, unless United make an offer that is simply too good for the Midlands club to refuse.",

      "Matheus Cunha labelled Ruben Amorim \"a winner\" when asked about the Manchester United boss while on international duty.",
      "The Reds signed Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves in the summer. The early part of the campaign was particularly challenging for the club, increasing the pressure on Amorim. However, recent weeks have brought some relief and Cunha has expressed his admiration for the Portuguese coach and teammate Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "While on international duty with Brazil, Cunha told Hayters when asked to describe Amorim and fellow summer signing Mbeumo: \"Amazing. What a player [Mbeumo]. You asked me some questions to think about United, right now my mind is in Brazil.",
      "\"But it's amazing to be there and it's amazing to play with big players like Bryan. And to be coached by a winner is always something I feel privileged about.\"",
      "Throughout his career Cunha has played in various different roles. When asked about his favourite position, the 26-year-old said he was simply happy to play.",
      "He continued: \"My favourite position is to be on the pitch and help my team, of course. Right now in Brazil, I have a different job to come a little bit and help the team in the build-up and attack as a striker.",
      "\"I feel fine playing as a false nine, exactly, this kind of participation in the build-up and get on the ball more.\"",
      "Cunha could be called upon to play the false nine role next week depending on Benjamin Sesko's fitness. The forward limped off in the draw with Tottenham Hotspur with a knee injury.",

      "Cunha featured for just over 60 minutes when Brazil faced Senegal at the Emirates Stadium, and could again be in action on Tuesday night when they take on Tunisia.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog on Wednesday, November 19.",
      "The last international break of 2025 is nearly over and with that comes the return of domestic football. For United, they will have to wait until Monday evening for their Premier League clash against Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite the January transfer window being at least six weeks away from opening, the rumours are rife with the latest of those surrounding Antoine Semenyo's imminent future at Bournemouth and a previous United offer.",
      "Ruben Amorim also appears keen to strengthen in midfield with Joao Gomes of Wolves a potential winter window opportunity while Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba are very much summer targets.",
      "With all of that being said, MEN Sport has you covered for all the latest transfer talk and you can stay up to date through all of it by following along below!",
      "The January transfer window may be a notoriously difficult month for clubs to do business, but for Manchester United and other top teams it can present an opportunity. Players who are out of contract in the summer can speak to overseas clubs as early as January.",
      "If you are club like United where there are a number of players out of contract at the end of the campaign, you need to decide what the plan is for them before January rolls around. If you don't, you risk losing players who you may wish to keep. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at five players United must make decisions on before the January window opens.",
      "Furthermore, United will be in FA Cup third round action on the weekend of January 10, another fixture those players could be ruled out of. Ruben Amorim was asked about AFCON at a recent press conference and said: “We have time to suffer with that. We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew [that].",
      "\"It is going to be an opportunity because when I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it is hard with one game to take some players from the team because they are going well also, during training and the games. Other players are going to have the opportunity to help us, they are understanding the way we want to play. The change of characteristics are not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team, but let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and then we will see in January.”",
      "Amorim will have the option of promoting young players in the absence of Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui, but which academy players have a chance of contributing to the first team?",
      "Bruno Guimaraes has described Manchester United midfielder Casemiro as a \"complete player\". Casemiro has become an important player for club and country again, starting nine games in the Premier League and forcing his way back into Brazil's starting team under Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "The 33-year-old has scored against Chelsea, Brighton and Nottingham Forest this season, and a conversation about whether he merits a contract extension has started among supporters. Casemiro has been representing Brazil during the international break. Newcastle captain Guimaraes sat down for a chat with Globo Esporte and he said he had been \"inspired\" by Casemiro.",
      "When asked why he rates Casemiro so highly, Guimaraes said: \"Experience, titles... he's a complete player. His career speaks for itself. In one of my first interviews with the national team, in 2020, when I arrived they asked if I was inspired by anyone in midfield, and I said his name, Casemiro.",
      "Read more here",
      "Casemiro has easily been one of Manchester United's best players this season. The 33-year-old impressed in the Europa League last term but in the Premier League, where the pace is so fast, he faltered. And yet, this season he has looked a different player in the English top flight.",
      "He has anchored the midfield and given Bruno Fernandes the freedom to push forward. However, he has also been a threat in the opposition box. Only Bryan Mbeumo has scored more than Casemiro for United this season, but with his contract expiring next summer, the Reds have a decision to make.",
      "United could still extend his stay by a further year. It is believed the Reds would be happy to extend his contract, but only if he was willing to agree to a pay cut. If that agreement cannot be reached, United will lose their defensive midfielder and suddenly the search for his replacement becomes a priority. So far, the likes of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba have been mentioned as options to replace Casemiro.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Joachim Andersen was visibly upset during a live TV interview after Denmark's guaranteed World Cup spot was dramatically taken by Scotland, with Scott McTominay's overhead kick leaving him in complete shock. Late goals from Kieran Tierney and Kenny Maclean secured the win for Scotland, despite Denmark twice equalising.",
      "Former Manchester United star McTominay eased the tension at Hampden Park just three minutes into the game when he instinctively responded to a Ben Gannon Doak cross with an audacious overhead kick. Denmark later equalised through Reds loanee Rasmus Hojlund, whose penalty followed a foul by Andy Robertson, before Lawrence Shankland put the hosts back in the lead.",
      "Rasmus Kristensen was shown a red card 15 minutes prior, but Denmark rallied once more with Patrick Dorgu netting a loose ball to level the score again. However, Steve Clarke's team ultimately triumphed when Kieran Tierney scored from distance in stoppage time, and Kenny McLean stylishly confirmed their place at next summer's tournament by lobbing Kasper Schmeichel from inside his own half.",
      "Read more here",
      "Mason Greenwood's decision to snub a call-up to the Jamaica national team has been all but justified, after the Reggae Boyz missed out on automatic qualification for the World Cup.",
      "Steve McClaren had hoped that former Manchester United forward Greenwood would represent Jamaica after it was announced that he had filed papers to request a switch in his international allegiance.",
      "Reports last week, however, emerged that Greenwood, 24, is instead 'obsessed' with representing England again, more than five years since he made his Three Lions debut against Iceland. Although England head coach Thomas Tuchel has made it clear he is not in his thinking, Greenwood is still determined to return to international football with the Three Lions.",
      "Manchester United approached Chelsea to enquire about the availability of Romeo Lavia in the summer transfer window, but at no point did higher-ups at Stamford Bridge put the 21-year-old midfielder on the table.",
      "Meanwhile, the Blues pushed to sign Alejandro Garnacho from United, and Enzo Maresca eventually secured his signature at the end of August as part of a deal worth just £40m.",
      "Manchester United have been issued with a stark reminder of what could have been at Old Trafford with Rasmus Hojlund and Scott McTominay on target in Scotland's thrilling win over Denmark last night.",
      "The latter scored a stunning overhead kick to put Scotland in front, but it was Hojlund that cancelled it out from the penalty spot.",
      "United star Patrick Dorgu was also on target to put Denmark on the brink of qualification for the World Cup, however late goals from Kieran Tierney and Kenny Maclean means Scotland have sealed a guaranteed spot at next summer's tournament.",
      "The Napoli duo have been in impressive goal-scoring form since departing United with that continuing on international duty. In the last two-week domestic pause, Hojlund scored three goals while McTominay grabbed one assist.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has received a welcome fitness boost in attack after losing Benjamin Sesko to injury.",
      "The summer signing suffered a knee issue before the international break and is expected to miss the next few weeks at least. Bryan Mbeumo will also be unavailable for a similar period which makes Matheus Cunha that much more important.",
      "He has already suffered an injury this season but any worries over him returning from Brazil with an issue or fatigue have been eased. That is because he played just 45 minutes of their friendly against Tunisia after featuring for 65 minutes against Senegal this past weekend.",
      "Manchester United are still keeping tabs on Adam Wharton despite fresh links to Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Joao Gomes.",
      "The Crystal Palace midfielder has continued his superb form into the new campaign which has prompted fresh links. Wharton himself recently responded to United rumours directly with those behind-the-scenes at Old Trafford forced into a summer plan.",
      "According to ESPN, United will not make a move for a central midfielder in the winter window with the likes of Anderson and Wharton almost certainly not for sale. Gomes was an option given Wolves' struggles but that switch now seems off the table from both sides.",
      "Manchester United have already been turned down by Antoine Semenyo as a number of Premier League clubs circle the Bournemouth star.",
      "It has been widely reported there is a £65mllion release clause in his new contract that can be activated in the January transfer window.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham have all been linked with Semenyo in recent months with the latter also rejected by Semenyo with the Telegraph claiming that Ruben Amorim's side and Spurs saw £50million moves turned down by Semenyo, before he agreed fresh terms at Bournemouth.",
      "Manchester United will likely struggle to sign Joao Gomes if they decide to make a move for the Wolves midfielder in the January transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been monitoring the Brazil international over the last few months with a £44million price tag mooted.",
      "However, folowing the appointment of Rob Edwards as the club's new head coach, it has been claimed there is gentleman's agreement in place not to sell the club's best players in January to give them the best possible chance of staying in the Premier League.",
      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog.",
      "For all the latest news, updates and rumours on Antoine Semenyo, Adam Wharton, Joao Gomes, Carlos Baleba, Marcus Rashford and much more, stay right here throughout the day!",
      "Manchester United are reportedly setting their sights on Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes as a potential January acquisition, in a deal that could save them £60million compared to signing Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Reds have been linked with the Brighton and Hove Albion star, but it's suggested that the Seagulls would demand around £104million (€120m) for the Cameroon international.",
      "Portuguese media outlet Record reports that Gomes is open to a move to Old Trafford and could be signed for just £44m ahead of the January window.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been told that Antoine Semenyo would take his Manchester United side to the 'next level' Semenyo, 25, has scored six goals and registered three assists in 12 Premier League games this season, helping Bournemouth make an impressive start.",
      "Since Jason Wilcox took over as sporting director, United have prioritised signing players with Premier League experience, as demonstrated by the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. The club have also shortlisted players such as on Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba, Joao Gomes and Adam Wharton, further evidence of their new mandate.",
      "Semenyo was on United's radar this summer, with reports claiming that Amorim met him for a meal in London. The forward's stock has increased since then, sparking interest from Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "Read more here",
      "Forest are reportedly likely to demand a huge fee for Elliot Anderson amid interest from Manchester United, according to the Telegraph.",
      "It is suggested that the 23-year-old midfielder, who is valued at at least £100m, has no release, buy-back or sell-on clauses in his current Forest deal.",
      "The report also suggests there is no chance of a winter sale, however, Forest are braced for bids in the summer with Newcastle also interested.",
      "Marcus Rashford's wish to play at the Camp Nou is set to be granted after Barcelona announced their imminent return to the stadium.",
      "The Manchester United star's loan to the Spanish giants was a move the England forward chased this past summer, and he hasn't been shy in admitting a permanent switch to Catalonia is one he'd like.",
      "His happiness in Spain has come despite not being able to play at the club's iconic ground due to a £1.3billion refurbishment. Barcelona haven't played at the Camp Nou since 2023 and have instead hosted matches at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium.",
      "Read more here",
      "Jadon Sancho's challenging four-year stint at Manchester United appears to be nearing its conclusion. The England international has not featured under Ruben Amorim, having spent the previous season on loan at Chelsea before moving to Aston Villa for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The 25-year-old has primarily been utilised in the Europa League by Emery, clocking up 336 minutes this season - just under a quarter of which have been in the Premier League. He is yet to make a starting appearance in the latter competition, with a brief substitute appearance against Manchester City ending abruptly when he was taken off.",
      "Emery later clarified that the decision was due to fitness concerns, as Sancho had played 67 minutes in Europe just days prior. However, it seems he is part of Villa's second-choice team, with updates now surfacing about his future at Old Trafford and the three clubs he could potentially join next year.",

      "Former Premier League defender Bacary Sagna believes Man United is a suitable destination for Semenyo next year.",
      "United are monitoring the Bournemouth star and clubs can activate his release clause of £65m in January.",
      "Speaking to Oddspedia, Sagna said: \"If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season. As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it’s much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly - rather than joining midway through a campaign.",
      "\"Looking forward, if he was to leave Bournemouth and stay in the Premier League, I think Manchester United would be a suitable option for him. He could definitely help the club get back to the top end of the league and if he did join them, he’d be regarded as the player which made the difference and take United to the next level. He’s young, fresh and has proven he can shine in big games this season – so I think Old Trafford could be a good destination for him.\"",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein has suggested Bournemouth may be powerless when it comes to Semenyo in January.",
      "His release clause is said to have been set at £65m but interested clubs 'must trigger it by a set date', in order for the Cherries to secure a replacement.",
      "The same will apply in the summer, although his price is expected to be lower.",
      "Portuguese newspaper Record suggest Man United could make a move for Wolves' Joao Gomes in January.",
      "The Brazilian is said to be on the club's list of targets as a cheaper alternative to Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson. With Wolves fighting for survival in the Premier League, it is claimed that he has 'not closed the door' on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "However, Wolves have reportedly valued the midfielder at £44 million.",
      "According to ESPN, Man United will not strengthen their midfield in January.",
      "It's said they will wait until next summer to pursue their interest in Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton.",
      "Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller is believed to also be monitored by the club.",
      "Man United head coach Ruben Amorim will be eagerly awaiting news on Benjamin Sesko's injury ahead of the clash with Everton.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is the only other senior forward available to Ruben Amorim, but he has been on the fringes of first team action this season. United could be without Sesko for the visit of Everton next Monday, so how will they line up if the Slovenian is not fit?",
      "If Amorim continues to overlook Zirkzee when naming his starting XI, United will adopt a strikerless system against Everton. This could see Noussair Mazraoui retain his place at right wing-back with Amad in the No.10 role. Bryan Mbeumo could then move across to the left with Matheus Cunha leading the line in a 'false nine' role.",

      "Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho appears destined to depart the club at the end of his contract next summer, but there is a scenario in which he moves on permanently in the January transfer window.",

      "Their report has added those talks took place at a luxury hotel and while it is unclear which team presented their long-term plans the best, it has been stated that Sancho would be willing to take a pay cut.",
      "The 25-year-old, currently on loan at Aston Villa, is earning more than £13million per-season.",
      "Manchester United face a big decision over whether or not to recall Elyh Harrison from his loan at Shrewsbury Town with the young goalkeeper having lost his place to Will Brook.",
      "United are following Harrison's situation at The Croud Meadow. The 19-year-old is highly regarded and Shrewsbury landed his signature due to their game time assurances.",
      "Almost every academy player who leaves United on loan has a recall break clause that can be activated after six months, which gives a chance to assess whether it's best for the youngster to stay on loan",
      "Manchester United could sign Antoine Semenyo for just £15million more than they were willing to pay this past summer.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Ruben Amorim's side and Tottenham saw £50million moves turned down by Semenyo, who went on to sign a new and improved contract at Bournemouth.",
      "A £65million release clause is in that fresh deal with United having the chance to pay it by a set date in January or part ways with less if he remains at the Cherries until next summer.",

      "Manchester United are already being tipped to have a busy January transfer window, but Benjamin Sesko's injury could have the opposite effect. United have just over a month to go until they are allowed to go into the market for new signings once again.",
      "Sesko was one of five new additions to the United squad in the summer, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon all moving to Old Trafford. Despite making big moves in the transfer market a few months ago, United are still being linked with making further additions in the New Year.",
      "However, the recent injury to Sesko could prompt a change in strategy from United. The Slovenia international suffered a knee injury during United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, with reports suggesting that he is expected to be sidelined for up to a month.",
      "As a result, Ruben Amorim could be forced to turn to other members of his squad to fill the void left by Sesko's absence for the next few weeks. One such player is Joshua Zirkzee, who has been heavily linked with a move away from United ever since the summer.",
      "Zirkzee has struggled for game time at United this term and is yet to be handed a start by Amorim in any competition. In fact, the Netherlands international has made just four substitute appearances in the Premier League this season, which combined have resulted in 82 minutes on the pitch.",
      "Since being signed by United for €42.5million (£37.4million) in the summer of 2024, Zirkzee has scored just seven goals for United and has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford for some time.",
      "With Sesko on the treatment table for the time being, it could see Zirkzee get more minutes on the pitch for United over the next few weeks.",
      "Not to mention, United will also have to consider what will happen to their squad across December and January.",
      "The Africa Cup of Nations are taking place later this year, which will see Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui compete for their respective countries.",
      "This will leave United short of options in the forward line, which could also prompt United to give Zirkzee more minutes.",
      "With these two scenarios, it would not be a surprise to see United stop Zirkzee from leaving the club, even if the player wished to do so and an offer was made.",
      "Reports in recent weeks have even suggested that United will block an exit for Zirkzee if the possibility comes up due to the lack of other senior forward options in the squad.",

      "Ruben Amorim could use Joao Gomes' Champions League aspirations to lure the Wolves star to Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's side are currently experiencing their best run since the Portuguese manager took over a year ago, having gone unbeaten in five Premier League matches.",
      "It puts them in seventh place, within reach of a Champions League qualification spot, albeit after only 11 matches. Nevertheless, there is a growing belief at Carrington that United can make a comeback to Europe's premier club competition next year - something Amorim has openly admitted is a primary objective.",
      "The club's chiefs are ready to support him in the January transfer window, having already invested over £200million on their attacking line and recruited new first-choice goalkeeper Senne Lammens last summer.",
      "The central midfield is the area most in need of immediate reinforcement, with several names linked to the Old Trafford outfit. These include Carlos Baleba and Elliott Anderson, as well as 24-year-old Wolves sensation Gomes.",
      "As first reported in Portugal, the Brazilian is considered a more cost-effective alternative to the aforementioned pair and has been labelled \"unbelievable\" by his compatriot and United ace Matheus Cunha.",
      "The Mirror reports United bosses have been keeping a close eye on Gomes for the past 18 months, and he could be available for around £44m. However, it's believed that any potential deal may have to wait until the summer due to Wolves' ongoing relegation battle and an agreement with their new manager not to sell their top players in January.",
      "While this could prove frustrating in the short term, waiting until the end of the season might increase United's chances of signing the former Flamengo star. If Amorim's side manage to qualify for the Champions League, Old Trafford would become a far more appealing destination for Gomes.",
      "Gomes has previously expressed his desire to play Champions League football, although he mentioned rivals Liverpool as his preferred team. Before joining Wolves, Gomes told ESPN Brazil in the summer of 2022: \"Liverpool is a team I would play for. I have the greatest desire to play. Playing in the Champions League is my biggest dream and that of my family, my biggest dream in football.\"",
      "While his support for rivals Liverpool might be hard for United fans to hear, football moves on quickly. An improved United with the promise of European football would put them in good stead if they approach Gomes next summer.",
      "Amorim is eager to achieve exactly that. Speaking before last season's Europa League final loss to Tottenham, the United boss stated: \"Personally for me, Champions League is more important for everything, to prepare the next season, and we are supposed to be in the Champions League.\"",
      "For now, Amorim's biggest challenge will be maintaining this form and pushing on, with many matches still to play this season. United host Everton in the Premier League next Monday before a visit to Crystal Palace.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Lisandro Martinez has shown encouraging signs in training after being pictured with Joshua Zirkzee during the November international break.",
      "The Argentine has been out of action since sustaining a serious knee injury in February. However, the 27-year-old has since returned to training at Carrington as he works his way back to full fitness.",
      "Reports suggest that Martinez was granted permission to train with Argentina during the international break to build match fitness. It is currently unclear whether the former Ajax star will be fit enough to be included in United's squad for Monday night's clash against Everton, however.",
      "Reds boss Ruben Amorim is expected to provide an update during his pre-match press conference on Friday. And the latest signs are looking good for Martinez if Zirkzee's latest Instagram story post is anything to go by",
      "The Dutchman posted a picture of him with Martinez and several youth team players - indicating that they won a practice match with the Argentine coming through unscathed. He said: \"Young lads made it easy for us @lisandromartinezzz.\"",
      "Amorim has recently admitted he does not want to set a date for Martinez's return to the matchday squad. However, when questioned in late October - the Portuguese revealed he was happy with the progress being made.",
      "\"He's feeling well,\" he said. \"The knee is responding really well, so I don't want to say one specific day or one week.",
      "\"I don't know, but it's near to start the training with the team. Then it depends on the rhythm of Licha, if he wins the place or not, that will depend on him, but he's closer to return to training.\"",
      "Previously, the United head coach made it clear how sorely missed Martinez has been. Amorim's current options in central defence struggle to play out of the back - a skill the Argentine is equipped with.",
      "\"We miss a lot, Licha, especially in this moment,\" he said. \"We miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him.\"",
      "It is therefore perhaps no surprise that United have increasingly decided to play the ball long from defence - a tactic referenced by Liverpool boss Arne Slot when his side lost at home to Amorim's men last month.",
      "But Martinez will not have an easy route back into the Reds' defence. Luke Shaw has been ever-present in the Premier League this season, operating as the left-sided centre-back and is likely to keep his place for Monday's game against the Toffees.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Joao Gomes has broken his silence on social media since emerging as a potential target for Manchester United. The Wolves star has recently been linked with a move to Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his midfield in the January transfer window.",
      "According to the Mirror, Gomes has been shortlisted by the Reds as an alternative to Elliot Anderson, who has also attracted interest from the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City. The report claims that United are long admirers of Carlos Baleba, although he and the Nottingham Forest playmaker would likely cost in excess of £100m.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo facing an uncertain future, Gomes has emerged as an option. The Reds have reportedly 'extensively watched' the Brazil international over the past 18 months, and they could be forced to pay over the odds for his signature.",
      "Reports from overseas claim Gomes could be available for £44m, but the Mirror reckons that any deal at that price may have to wait until summer. When Rob Edwards replaced Vitor Pereira in the dugout, higher-ups at Molineux agreed not to sell the club's prized assets in the upcoming window to give Wolves the best chance of survival.",
      "They're currently rooted to the bottom of the Premier League, while United are seventh. On Tuesday night, Gomes broke his silence on X, formerly known as Twitter, following the reports.",
      "Captioning a picture of himself in training for Wolves, having not been called up by Carlo Ancelotti this month, the United target wrote: \"Excited to do what no one believes, for us and for our city. Let's go wolves [wolf emoji].\"",
      "Gomes, whose contract expires in June 2030, has featured 11 times in the Premier League this season, drawing two and losing the other nine. Despite having failed to get three points on the board, the Brazilian has caught the eye.",
      "He's previously been compared to Casemiro by Matheus Cunha, who swapped Molineux for Old Trafford for £62.5m in July. They crossed paths at Wolves, sharing the pitch 70 times across three seasons.",
      "Gomes and the new United forward have also played alongside one another on the international stage, appearing in a 4-1 defeat to Argentina in March earlier this year. In an interview in July last year, Cunha explained why his fellow countryman would be a welcome addition to Amorim's dressing room.",
      "When asked who the Wolves star reminds him of, the United ace said: \"Maybe Casemiro. He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive.",
      "\"I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that. He is unbelievable on the pitch.",
      "Cunha said: \"I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "At the end of last month, Amorim revealed that he expects out-of-favour players to hand in transfer requests in the coming weeks. As quoted by ESPN, the United boss said: \"A lot of things can happen.",
      "\"Even in our club, and you know that we have World Cup, some players are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything.\"",
      "Amorim refused to rule out the possibility of strengthening his squad over the festive period. He added: \"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United.",
      "\"We are not just buying one guy, because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now. No, it's going to be... we want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen, but of course we think about how we can improve the team, and in January the window is open, we can do something.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho's challenging four-year stint at Manchester United appears to be nearing its conclusion. The England international has not featured under Ruben Amorim, having spent the previous season on loan at Chelsea before moving to Aston Villa for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The 25-year-old has primarily been utilised in the Europa League by Emery, clocking up 336 minutes this season - just under a quarter of which have been in the Premier League. He is yet to make a starting appearance in the latter competition, with a brief substitute appearance against Manchester City ending abruptly when he was taken off.",
      "Emery later clarified that the decision was due to fitness concerns, as Sancho had played 67 minutes in Europe just days prior. However, it seems he is part of Villa's second-choice team, with updates now surfacing about his future at Old Trafford and the three clubs he could potentially join next year.",
      "Sancho penned a five-year deal when he transferred from Borussia Dortmund to United in 2021, meaning that contract is set to run out in roughly six months.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Sancho will leave the club as a free agent, having made 83 appearances and scored 12 goals with six assists over what is technically just two years, considering his loan spells elsewhere.",
      "United will be relieved to remove his substantial wages from their books, but will undoubtedly regret the possibility of losing a player who cost them £73million for nothing.",
      "One destination during Sancho's career was former club Borussia Dortmund, who may attempt to re-sign him. He contributed to their run to the 2024 Champions League final before an underwhelming loan period at Chelsea last season.",
      "Unai Emery evidently values Sancho, though his intentions regarding a permanent transfer remain unclear. Villa, who are covering 80 per cent of Sancho's wages, did not include an obligation to buy clause in his loan agreement with United, but would likely be leading contenders should they choose to pursue a deal at the season's end.",
      "Reports in September suggested that Villa were already considering making his transfer permanent. Nevertheless, Sancho's restricted playing time since his summer arrival has done little to support that notion.",
      "Despite this, Villa manager Emery has no doubts about Sancho's abilities. \"When Leon Bailey left, it was a moment for us to assess the players we had identified through our scouting,\" Emery said when asked about the decision to bring in the winger.",
      "\"We then had the opportunity to make a signing, and one of the players on our list was Jadon Sancho. He's capable of playing on both the right and left wings, and he provides something different. He's a good player - 25 years old - and I felt he performed very well last year at Chelsea.",
      "\"Yes, he had some problems at Manchester United, but during his time at Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic. He's also played 25 times for England. He's still young, still hungry, and has the ability to show his skills and qualities.",
      "\"Hopefully, we can bring out the best in him here. In the last few years, he's played more on the left, but at Dortmund, he was more often on the right. Here, I see him being able to play in both of those positions.\"",
      "Sancho is due to complete the remainder of the current campaign on loan at Villa, with no break clause inserted into the agreement, which means United cannot bring him back in January.",
      "Sancho looks likely to depart United when his contract runs out next summer, although there remains a possibility he could secure a permanent transfer during the January window.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, 'discreet but meaningful discussions' took place throughout the November international break between Sancho's advisers and representatives from Fenerbahce, Galatasaray, and Besiktas.",
      "The report also suggested that these meetings happened at an upmarket hotel, where the three Turkish clubs each outlined their individual plans for Sancho. It has also been suggested that Sancho would be prepared to accept a reduction in his current £13million per season salary.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be eagerly awaiting news on Benjamin Sesko's injury ahead of the clash with Everton.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is the only other senior forward available to Ruben Amorim, but he has been on the fringes of first team action this season.",
      "United could be without Sesko for the visit of Everton next Monday, so how will they line up if the Slovenian is not fit?",
      "If Amorim continues to overlook Zirkzee when naming his starting XI, United will adopt a strikerless system against Everton. This could see Noussair Mazraoui retain his place at right wing-back with Amad in the No.10 role. Bryan Mbeumo could then move across to the left with Matheus Cunha leading the line in a 'false nine' role.",
      "This would give Mazraoui some more much-needed minutes having been eased back into action by Amorim following an injury. It also pushes Amad into a more offensive position, with the Ivorian having struggled with the defensive side of his role at right wing-back at times.",
      "However, if Everton play with a low block at Old Trafford, having an attacking outlet like Amad at right wing-back might be a good option. If he does start in that role, we can expect to see Mason Mount brought back into the starting XI to play alongside Mbeumo.",
      "Amorim is a big fan of Mount and he has so far managed to avoid any major injury concerns this season.",
      "United have looked impressive when playing in a strikerless formation at times this season and with plenty of options for Amorim to choose from, Sesko's absence might not be felt as harshly as you'd expect if he is ruled out.",

      "Manchester United sent plenty of players out on loan in the summer transfer window.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana were among the highest-profile loan exits from the club, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho completed moves to Napoli and Aston Villa respectively.",
      "There were several players from the academy sent on loan to gain experience. Some of those youngsters are excelling, while others have not made the impact they might have hoped. United loaned 18 players in total - and here is how they are faring this season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been hit with a 12-point deduction due to their ownership situation, but they were able to promise regular game time to Amass, who has made 11 starts. The youngster scored his first senior goal against Southampton and United are delighted with his stint so far.",
      "Collyer was limited to seven substitute appearances after his arrival. He broke into the starting team against Millwall last month and retained his role in the next game, but he picked up a muscle injury.",
      "Ennis spent the second half of last season with promotion-winning Doncaster Rovers. The youngster joined Fleetwood on a season-long deal for this campaign and he has started eight league games. Has contributed two goals and an assist during his positive loan spell in League Two.",
      "Gore picked up an injury shortly after signing for Rotherham last January, but he made a strong impression in the time he was available, so he was re-signed for this season. Gore has been crucial for Rotherham in midfield. Has started in 15 games in League One and has been one of their best players.",
      "Onana has received praise in the Turkish media since his move to Trabzonspor, who have lost just once in the league from a possible eight games since he signed. The 29-year-old has recorded three clean sheets and helped Trabzonspor to third in the table.",
      "After missing the opening two games of the League Two campaign due to a minor injury, Harrison started the next four games for Shrewsbury Town before reporting for England Under-20 duty in September. In his absence, another young goalkeeper came into the side and has earned first-choice status over Harrison.",
      "Hugill started the first two games of the season for Barnet in League Two, but he picked up an injury and has been absent since.",
      "Defender Aljofree started the first eight games of the campaign and notched a goal but he has lost his starting role over the last few weeks. The 20-year-old was not in the squad for Notts County played Harrogate Town last weekend.",
      "Solihull Moors are midtable in the National League. Jackson started in their first two games of the season, but he has struggled to make the XI since. The centre-back has been absent from their last five matchday squads.",
      "Hojlund made an excellent first impression in Naples, scoring twice against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League shortly after his arrival, but he has scored just four goals in total. Hojlund has copped some flak from the Italian media for his recent performances. Napoli won Serie A last season but sit fourth.",
      "Kana-Biyik recently scored his first senior goal. He salvaged a point for Lausanne in a local derby and was called up to France's Under-20 squad for the November international break.",
      "Moorhouse has made 15 appearances for League One side Leyton Orient, but just four of those have been league starts. The youngster has shown glimpses of quality from the bench.",
      "Dave Hughes, who coached Ogunneye in United's academy, has just departed Newport County. That might impact Ogunneye's role in the squad, but the youngster has made 13 league starts in League Two so far and gained valuable experience, albeit in a struggling dressing room.",
      "Barcelona seemed a great fit for Rashford to rediscover his form. The United academy graduate has contributed six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances this season, and has looked back to his best.",
      "Rashford has been revitalised by leaving on loan - but Sancho continues to be in a slump. The winger has not started for Aston Villa in the Premier League and has failed to record a goal or an assist.",
      "Vitek has started every league game for Bristol City in the Championship, keeping five clean sheets. The 22-year-old has made some great saves. Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber recently said of Vitek to the Bristol Post: “He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "Wheatley needed to leave on loan after outgrowing academy football. The young striker has made 13 starts in League Two for Northampton and has found the back of the net twice, as well as recording two assists.",
      "Williams is performing well north of the border. Has contributed a goal and three assists in nine appearances in the Scottish top-flight for Falkirk, who are exceeding expectations by sitting fifth in the table.",

      "The loan spell to Catalonia was the last throw of the dice for Rashford. His bridges were burnt with Ruben Amorim and, for all involved, the best thing to do was to let him leave.",
      "Rashford wanted Barca in January but an approach was not deemed viable by the La Liga giants. Fortunately for the United academy graduate, they returned in the summer and the deal was done.",

      "With that in mind, United know what they can't do. Sell Rashford to a Premier League rival. In Spain, El Nacional has reported that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have both made early contact with Rashford's agent to try and persuade him to move to the Premier League. United can't let that happen.",

      "Manchester United fans will have eagerly taken in Casemiro's latest Brazil masterclass as the midfielder looks to tie down his spot in Carlo Ancelotti's plans. And the midfield maestro turned the clock back as he scored in a 2-0 friendly win over Senegal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.",
      "He and Chelsea winger Estevao each contributed as the Selecao continue to make progress under former Real Madrid chief Ancelotti. And the response from Brazilian media suggests United star Casemiro will indeed have an important role to play at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The major question for United fans is whether that will be as a United player, with Casemiro's contract due to expire next summer. The club hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension to his stay, and Casemiro has been making a strong case despite his eye-watering £350,000-a-week salary.",
      "News outlets in his home country have nevertheless been raving following his impressive performances for his national team this season, with his latest display showing he \"has evolved\" at a late stage in his career while also becoming his side's \"main leader\" ahead of next summer's World Cup.",
      "\"There is no longer any reason to divide the midfield, as was done in Brazil in recent decades, between the number five, number eight and number 10 shirts,\" read one report of the win against Senegal in Folha de Sao Paulo. \"They blend together. As Klopp, former Liverpool coach, said, more important than a good, classic number 10 is recovering the ball closer to the opponent's goal.",
      "\"Even better is having both options, the pressure and the star player, which happens in many teams. There is still room for midfielders who play more centrally and further back, who protect the defence and initiate offensive plays with excellent passes.",
      "\"They are the links between defence and attack. Great teams have this type of player. Casemiro, who has always stood out from midfield back, has evolved and is now a great playmaker.\"",
      "The 33-year-old has shown that in spades of late, having collected three goals and one assist in his last four outings for club and country. Casemiro, who was recalled to the Brazil squad by Ancelotti after a two-year hiatus, is expected to contribute in more areas for United than he was during his days at Real, and that has helped redefine his importance at both levels.",
      "After securing a new role as a playmaker in Ancelotti's side, it also appears the midfielder could well be heading to the World Cup with a starting spot following his latest impressive performance.",
      "\"But it was the creative and attacking players of the Brazilian national team who were the protagonists of last night,\" read an excerpt of Globo's report. \"Increasingly in sync, Casemiro and Bruno Guimaraes are consolidating themselves as the starting midfield duo for the World Cup.",
      "\"Since Ancelotti's arrival, both have demonstrated a good ability to alternate in chasing down opposing midfielders and participating in the build-up to attacking plays.\"",
      "Correio Braziliense piled on with their praise by suggesting Ancelotti has indeed found his preferred formula: \"Casemiro, one of the few remaining players from the last World Cup and the team's main leader alongside Marquinhos, sealed the result. Both goals were scored in the first half, a period in which the Brazilian team was flawless.",
      "\"The presentation suggests that Ancelotti has found a starting line-up. Or at least he's close to it. It's quite likely that the 11 who started the match in the English capital will be at the World Cup. And that some of them will be starters at the World Cup hosted in Canada, the United States and Mexico.\"",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens has received the seal of approval from club legend Sir Alex Ferguson following an impressive run of form.",
      "The 23-year-old shot-stopper joined the Red Devils from Belgian side Royal Antwerp for just over £18million toward the end of the summer transfer window. Since then, he has established himself as the first choice under Ruben Amorim, starting each of the last five games.",
      "While he has kept only one clean sheet in that time - a 2-0 win over Sunderland - three victories mark a significant improvement on the start of the season and have lifted United to seventh in the table, just a point off the top four.",
      "Having missed out on Europe altogether after a dismal league finish last term, reclaiming their place near the top of the table is imperative for Amorim’s side this season.",
      "So far, so good for United, as Ferguson believes the signs are encouraging in light of recent results. Praise rarely comes higher from a United perspective, given what the Scot achieved during his lengthy tenure, and he has been particularly impressed by Lammens as well as Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,” Ferguson said in an interview with Raceday RTV. “Particularly the goalkeeper - he’s been outstanding. He’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",
      "“Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, have added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - and the signs are getting better.",
      "“I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where improvement requires patience, they’ll enjoy it now.”",
      "The goalkeeper position has been something of a problem area for United in recent years following the departure of David de Gea in the summer of 2023. Andre Onana was initially signed as his replacement for a hefty £47 million from Inter Milan, but despite some positive moments, the Cameroon international never fully convinced as United’s long-term solution.",
      "Amorim handed Turkey’s Altay Bayindir an opportunity at the start of this season to stake his claim, but he too struggled to convince, prompting United to return to the transfer market. Now, just a few months into his time at the club, Lammens already looks like a smart piece of business and someone capable of making the position his own.",
      "After the international break, United face a crucial run of fixtures in the build-up to Christmas, with winnable matches against the likes of Everton, Crystal Palace, West Ham, Wolves, Bournemouth and Aston Villa. With full focus on Premier League football, climbing the table and breaking into the top four will be Amorim’s priority in the weeks ahead.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Liam O'Brien has admitted that it took Sir Alex Ferguson a couple of years to speak to him again after choosing to join Newcastle in 1988.",
      "O'Brien moved to Old Trafford in 1986 after impressing for Shamrock Rovers in his home country, Ireland. He would spend a little over a year and a half in Manchester before deciding to move to St James' Park.",
      "The midfielder only made 34 appearances for the Reds but that did not stop Ferguson from being livid with the Irishman for choosing to leave. Reflecting on the conversation he had with the legendary manager ahead of the release of his new book Pass Master, O'Brien told Chronicle Live: \"I didn’t expect him to be impressed with the news I had to tell him.",
      "\"'I have something to tell you,’ I said. ‘I’m after signing for Newcastle United.’ There was a moment of silence.",
      "\"A pregnant pause. He wasn’t one bit impressed. He went through me. Who did I think I was walking out of a club like Manchester United?",
      "\"After he had his say, the phone went dead. Suddenly.",
      "\"It took some time for Alex Ferguson to talk to me again. When I met him a few months later, he didn’t speak. Eventually, the ice did thaw – although it took a couple of years.",
      "\"There were suggestions made that Alex and myself had this big bust-up before I left Old Trafford but that wasn’t the case. There was no big row.",
      "\"Did I have regrets that I left Man United – especially considering what they achieved later under Ferguson? No, I didn’t and don’t now, all these years later.\"",
      "Despite his relationship with Ferguson turning frosty upon his departure, the now 61-year-old can remember a time when the Scottish manager showed his softer side. After being sent off on his debut for United away at Southampton live on TV, O'Brien found himself under scrutiny like never before.",
      "Sir Bobby Charlton even stormed the team bus before it departed the south coast to lambast O'Brien for his tackle on Mark Dennis. But the ex-midfielder said that Ferguson was a lot more understanding about the situation.",
      "\"I played on ITV against Southampton. Sir Alex Ferguson gave me my debut for Man United down at the Dell,\" he added.",
      "\"In Ireland, it was the first time I think live football had been on from England, so all my friends and family were watching. I got told to watch out for Mark Dennis in midfield and that he was 'nasty'.",
      "\"I went in for a tackle and Dennis came off worse, I thought it would be a yellow card, back in the day you'd get a caution. Then the ref pulled out the red card after 85 seconds.",
      "\"I went back to the dressing room knowing everybody had been watching at home. It brings you to a dark place and you wonder how things will go for you at a club like Man United. Fergie actually thought I'd insulted the ref.",
      "\"He watched the video back with me on the team bus. But he didn't fine me because he knew it was the wrong decision.",
      "\"All managers have good sides and bad sides. You have to show some type of ruthlessness to be a manager.",
      "\"But Fergie cared about his players first. He was like [Kevin] Keegan and would always back his players.\"",

      "United crashed out of the Carabao Cup second round against Grimsby Town and were hammered 3-0 by Manchester City, which cranked up the pressure on Amorim.",
      "Amorim had not won back-to-back Premier League games since his arrival, but the United boss enjoyed an outstanding October, winning three games on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Here are how the players have rated so far this season:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "The bar was low to impress between the sticks, but Lammens has made a huge impact since his strong debut against Sunderland. The Belgium international has made a supremely confident start to life at Old Trafford, and the \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" chants tell you how he has performed. 7",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "It was only a matter of time before Bayindir lost his first-choice status. He made a mistake against Arsenal on the opening day of the campaign and another error against Burnley at Old Trafford. Made some good saves against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium, but still conceded three. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Has started every Premier League game on the left side of the back three. Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby, but he bounced back against Chelsea in the following week and hasn't really put a foot wrong since then. His passing has been a huge asset from the back. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Maguire started on the bench for the first four games of the campaign. Technically recorded an assist against Chelsea and scored the matchwinner at Anfield. Maguire has produced some memorable moments during his United career, but he will look back on that goal with particular fondness. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "De Ligt has markedly improved this season. He is showing the kind of form that saw him earn a reputation as one of Europe's best defensive prospects, and he is delivering consistent performances each week. He is still the only United player to have played every minute in the Premier League. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Yoro has started seven league games this season. He has been substituted off in five of those matches, with Amorim reshuffling his defensive line in the closing stages of contests. Looked to have scored for United at Craven Cottage in August, but it was marked down as an own-goal. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "It's been a mixed bag for Dalot this season. Has recently been asked to play at left-wing back, and he didn't look comfortable in that role - he is better on the right - against Sunderland and Nottingham Forest. Was dropped to face Tottenham last weekend. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Dorgu looked sharp in pre-season and started the campaign full of confidence, but he has delivered some unconvincing performances and his end product around the box must improve. Dorgu did not start once during United's excellent run of three wins on the bounce throughout October. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Has played just over 200 minutes across five appearances this season due to injuries. Mazraoui performed well against Spurs last weekend and it felt harsh to remove him before the hour mark. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Heaven started against Grimsby in August when Blundell Park felt like hell. The youngster has made just two substitute appearances in the league, but he provided an assist in the 4-2 win against Brighton. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Has become hugely important this season. United have conceded five goals when Casemiro has been on the pitch and 15 when he has been off it. Also contributed goals against Chelsea, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, so he's been one of the standout performers. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes' performance against Tottenham encapsulated his season so far - he was poor but played the corner into the box for the equaliser. Has scored two goals and recorded three assists in total, but missed penalties against Fulham and Brentford. Could easily go up another level. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Looked bright without scoring when starting the first three matches of the campaign. Scored brilliantly to open the scoring against Sunderland and was industrious against Liverpool. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Was far too weak when allowing Wilson Odobert to breeze past him for Tottenham's first goal last Saturday. Ugarte was off the pace against Grimsby and has struggled when introduced from the bench. 3",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Mainoo has not really made a negative or positive contribution due to his lack of involvement. Was absent against Spurs due to a knock, and hopefully that injury is nothing serious. 5",
      "Amad",
      "His relationship with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed as the season has developed. He assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and scored a stunning goal against Forest to salvage a point. Has delivered strong performances from right wing-back. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo is the current favourite to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award. The Cameroon international was unstoppable before the international break and he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for October. Six goals in 12 appearances for United. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Has made a big impact since his arrival and scored his first goal for the club against Brighton, but Cunha would have liked to have more goals and assists to his name. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Sesko started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford. Built on that by scoring against Sunderland, but has failed to fire since that game in early October. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Can't mark Zirkzee higher or lower than a five - he hasn't started once. 5",

      "An update has emerged about Joshua Zirkzee's future at Manchester United amid continued speculation as the January transfer window approaches.",
      "United signed Zirkzee from Bologna in the summer of 2024 in a deal worth €42.5million (£37.5m). The Netherlands international moved to Old Trafford after being signed by former manager Erik ten Hag, but Zirkzee has found game time difficult to come by since Ruben Amorim's appointment 12 months ago.",
      "Zirkzee has made just five appearances for United so far this season, four of which have come in the Premier League, and he is yet to score his first goal of the campaign.",
      "Amorim has yet to name Zirkzee in the starting line-up in any match so far this term, with the striker being left as an unused substitute on seven occasions in the top flight.",
      "As a result, there has been frequent speculation linking Zirkzee with a move away from United during the January transfer window.",
      "However, The Sun have reported that this will not be the case as Zirkzee looks set to remain at Old Trafford. It has been claimed that the 24-year-old has \"no chance\" of leaving United in the New Year.",
      "The report claims that the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which will be expected to see Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo be unavailable for several weeks, is influencing United's decision-making for the January window.",
      "It's because of this that Zirkzee has reportedly been told that a transfer in January will not be possible, with the expectation now that the forward will get more game time across December and January.",
      "Various reports have been claiming for some time that Zirkzee would seek a chance to leave United in January in search of more regular first-team football, but if the latest article is accurate then that may not be possible.",

      "The 18-year-old has caught England's eye in recent weeks and months and again played a starring role on the international stage this week.",
      "The United prospect came off the bench to score for England Under-20s in their 1-1 friendly draw with Japan on Friday night, having only made his debut at that level last month.",
      "That outing came after the teenager was called up to train with the Under-21s - who beat Ireland 1-0 on Friday - where he received glowing praise from boss Lee Carsley.",
      "\"He's been in the pathway a good amount of time now and he's a player that we rate highly,\" said Carsley.",
      "\"It worked out well that we needed that position for the training we were doing and Shea was more than happy to come over and train with the Under-21s. You can see he's a good talent.",
      "\"I know he's struggled with injuries in the past, which has probably held back his development, but I think it's so important we don't rush these young players, we let them develop in their own time. I think he trained two sessions with us and I enjoyed having him.\"",
      "In October, Lacey spent time training with the England senior squad under the watchful eye of boss Thomas Tuchel when he was drafted in from age-group sides to assist ahead of the friendly win over Wales.",
      "His international showings are reward for a strong start to the season with United at Under-21 level. He's got five goal contributions in eight games across the Premier League 2 and EFL Trophy, while he was one of a clutch of youngsters who were alongside the senior group when United returned to pre-season training in the summer.",
      "The playmaker had an injury-hit campaign last term and was carefully managed as a result. His minutes at academy level were therefore limited, but he did travel on the post-season tour to Asia and was handed a senior appearance off the bench in the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "That offered a glimpse of what he can offer, with his ability on the ball evident. Lacey, who featured for United's Under-18s aged just 14, signed a professional deal at the first opportunity last year and Old Trafford insiders believe he has the potential to break into the first team.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "United‘s academy has brimmed with talent for the last 88 years. Indeed, that’s the length of the streak in which at least one player who has come through the Red Devils’ academy has been named in a first-team squad.",
      "Boss Ruben Amorim recently said it’s “really important” to keep that streak going, and in their last game, Jack Fletcher was the sole academy player in the squad, replacing Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "With AFCON coming up and each of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui heading off to represent their respective countries, there could be chances for academy players to represent the first team.",
      "That has been posed to the Daily Mail‘s United writer, Nathan Salt, who feels there is ‘honestly, not too many’ options for Ruben Amorim at the moment.",
      "He states that Shea Lacey is the ‘clear frontrunner’ having been very close to making the squad for the Sunderland game of late, while Fletcher – on the bench against Tottenham – is second, as Amorim is known to be a big fan.",
      "Salt feels shouts for Jaydan Kamason and Bendito Mantano to graduate to the first team are premature.",
      "There is said to be a ‘lot of interest’ in Lacey in regards to a loan away from United, but they are said not to be entertaining any, pointing to him being a player of interest in the first team.",
      "In five Premier League 2 games this season, Lacey, a right-winger, has two goals and an assist.",
      "In EFL Trophy games against senior opposition, Lacey has one goal and one assist in three games, coming against Barnsley and Notts County.",
      "Lacey was the highest-rated player for United’s under-21s in that game, receiving an 8.7 SofaScore rating.",
      "Given Mbeumo and Amad, who are going to be unavailable for a while during AFCON, both play on the right-hand side, there could well be an opportunity coming for Lacey.",
      "Largely a right-winger, but also able to play in a slightly less advanced role if required, he could be in a good spot.",
      "Lacey is not the man it was felt is able to play up in the first team, by former United scout Piotr Sadowski, who named Harry Amass – currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "He said: “In my opinion, Harry Amass is the only player currently capable of making it into the United first-team squad after returning from his loan spell.”"

      "After an inconsistent start to the new Premier League season, Amorim won his first back-to-back league games since taking over at Man Utd in mid-October.",
      "That has now led to the Red Devils going five matches unbeaten in the Premier League with Amorim’s side up to seventh in the table, once place ahead of defending champions Liverpool and four points behind second-placed Man City.",
      "There were critics of Amorim’s decision to stick with his 3-4-3 formation earlier in the campaign as Man Utd failed to pick up results as it looked like he was heading for the sack.",

      "“We are getting better, but I can share my feeling: when we finished the game against Tottenham and I was coming back to Carrington, I was watching the game and my feeling was frustration, that we are far from perfection.",
      "“We are far from being that team that can win every game. So I think we have a lot to do, but I also have the feeling, and I’ve been saying this for many months, that the formation is not the problem.",
      "“The formation is the start of something, then it’s the dynamic, the confidence, the way we play, how competitive we are.",
      "“If you look at the games we struggled in this season, it was not about the formation for me. It was the lack of intensity. We need to be perfect in this league to win a lot of games.”",
      "On the public backing from Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Amorim added: “It’s always really important, but it’s more important for the fans to understand that we have a clear path, and we are going to do everything and continue that path no matter what.",
      "“To be honest, it doesn’t change much for me, because I’m not worried about losing my job. I always have that feeling.",

      "INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe spent over £200m on five new players over the summer transfer window with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon all joining.",
      "But that spend shows no sign of stopping as the club approaches the January transfer market with numerous players being linked with moves to Old Trafford.",

      "However, Man Utd are looking to correct that in the January transfer market with numerous players such as Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba linked.",

      "However, his ‘considerable wage demands look like being an issue for him getting a Premier League move’  and the ‘overall feeling now is that they’ve moved on to other targets as a priority for that position’.",
      "Brus spoke to ‘one particularly trustworthy figure with ties to the agents industry’, who said: “There have been contacts between Premier League clubs and Neves’ representatives, but it’s not progressing – he earns £410,000 a week and that’s seen as too high. Fenerbahce and Galatasaray are the ones to watch now – they want a major midfield signing and Neves fits the bill.”",

      "Perhaps it is ultimately on Mediawatch for seeing a headline of ‘How depleted Arsenal could line up in the derby against Tottenham after Mikel Arteta suffers crushing injury blow in defence’ atop the Daily Mirror website – after a genuinely brilliant and newsworthy round of international games, no less – and expecting a little more than ‘the same ten players and then one of a few eminently viable replacements for Gabriel’.",
      "But yeah, when the biggest story in all of football is apparently not Scott McBallon d’Orminay, Curacao forcing Steve McClaren to seek unemployment or Andy Robertson making everyone cry, and is instead ‘Arsenal might play the really good Cristhian Mosquera or £45m Piero Hincapie for a bit because one of their defenders is injured’, you do have to wonder what the point of this all is.",
      "",
      "It is also a bit weird to see scaremongering stories about how Gabriel could be sidelined until JANUARY (the Daily Mirror and Star both go all caps).",
      "That does incorporate a fairly large number of games in a condensed part of the fixture schedule so is certainly not ideal, but it is also late November so not sure the panicked shouting about JANUARY is really necessary.",
      "",

      "‘Arsenal discover true extent of major injury blow amid Liverpool title race’",

      "Fair enough. Deal done.",
      "“I don’t conflict the two with my job.”",

      "Starting to sound a little less like a ‘hint’ and more like a really good footballer whose ‘transfer preference’ is just generally to reach the highest level possible and play for one of the unnamed ‘top clubs’. Because obviously.",
      "Semenyo was even asked specifically in that October 2024 Athletic interview whether joining Arsenal would be a “dream”, his response to which was simply: “Yeah, any team that plays Champions League, Europa (League) – that’s the aim.” So the idea that something said more than a year ago constitutes an Arsenal boost of any kind is nonsense.",

      "You’d think a ‘clear message to Man United’ would actually reference Man United or at least talk about a competition they’re in, but no.",
      "It does reference Liverpool, however; Gomes called them “a team I would play for”. And the big, grown-up, mature MEN write that ‘while his support for rivals Liverpool might be hard for United fans to hear, football moves on quickly’.",
      "If there are Manchester United fans out there struggling to come to terms with the idea that a potential transfer target once talked up the idea of playing for Liverpool over three years ago, just know that there are people you can talk to and support networks to reach out to for help.",

      "Manchester United are highly unlikely to be drawn into the transfer chase for Antoine Semenyo in January after two top sources outlined where Ruben Amorim’s priorities lie and with the Red Devils putting all their energies into another target instead.",
      "The Red Devils invested heavily into strengthening their attack this summer, spending well over £200m on the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. And while the triple coup is starting to pay dividends, Manchester United could have added a different dimension to their attack had they instead opted to pursue Semenyo.",
      "Indeed, it has since emerged that United had a very serious interest in the 25-year-old Bournemouth star, with Amorim even meeting the player for dinner to discuss a prospective move.",
      "That’s according to transfer journalist, Duncan Castles, who claims Amorim met with the player to assess his personality and with the United boss ultimately informing club bosses he felt the player had what it takes to become a success at Old Trafford.",
      "That comes after David Ornstein had previously described the Portuguese as being “very fond” of the Bournemouth star.",
      "However, United’s unwillingness to pay more than £55m saw the deal collapse and ultimately saw the winger sign a new five-year deal with the Cherries.",
      "This week, though, it has emerged that Semenyo‘s deal contains a release clause worth just £60m, plus £5m in add-ons to prise him away from the Vitality Stadium and sparking something of a mad scramble for the Ghana international.",
      "And while sources have revealed it is Liverpool “ahead in the race”, the player continues to be linked with other sides, most notably Tottenham Hotspur and Man Utd.",
      "Despite that, both The Athletic and our own, Fraser Fletcher, are playing down the prospects of United rekindling a move for Semenyo in January, with the former describing a potential move to Old Trafford as ‘difficult’.",
      "Fletcher, meanwhile, insists while United still very much admire the player, their priorities in the January window and beyond lie elsewhere, with the club’s entire focus now shifted on upgrading their midfield and with three major targets the priority over the next two to three transfer windows…",

      "According to Castles, Amorim met Semenyo for dinner in a London restaurant to discuss a potential move north over the summer and prior to the player inking his extension at the Vitality Stadium.",
      "Castles told The Transfers Podcast: “They used the same strategy with Cunha and Mbeumo in that they agreed personal terms with Semenyo before attempting to agree a fee with Bournemouth.",
      "“They even had Amorim take him for a meal in London at the end of the season so Amorim could judge his character – again a similar process to Cunha and Mbeumo.”",
      "United’s prospects of signing Semenyo ultimately failed when he committed instead to the Cherries, though Castles also explains that United’s willingness to only pay the player 70% of the salaries offered to Mbeumo and Cunha also derailed the prospective deal.",
      "Furthermore, rival interest from Tottenham, coupled with United’s willingness to spend £62.5m to meet Cunha’s exit clause, meant the Cherries felt in a strong position to reject United’s approach and amid a suggestion they were not prepared to spend more than £55m on a player they rated at nearer the £70m bracket.",
      "While Semenyo was a player who ultimately slipped through their net, Castles is adamant he was a player they could have signed in addition to both Cunha and Mbeumo, if the price was right.",
      "And while the interest in the player remains, he is unlikely to be a priority for United, leaving his other suitors free to battle it out.",
      "Meanwhile, Paul Scholes has endorsed United’s pursuit of Elliot Anderson, but the Old Trafford legend wants Amorim to play the Nottingham Forest midfielder in a different role from what he is used to.",

      "Former Man Utd midfielder Owen Hargreaves has likened Red Devils summer signing Bryan Mbeumo to Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah.",
      "Man Utd spent around £200m in the summer transfer market on new attackers with Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all joining.",
      "Only four Premier League clubs scored fewer goals than Man Utd last season with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee scoring seven league goals between them.",
      "The Red Devils top goalscorer in the Premier League this season is Mbeumo on five goals with Sesko and Cunha contributing just three between them.",
      "And Hargreaves has been impressed by Mbeumo, who was signed from Brentford for £71m in the summer, and he insists the Cameroon international reminds him of Liverpool star Salah.",
      "Hargreaves said of Mbeumo: “I think his biggest attribute is that he gives real quality. He reminds me of Mohamed Salah in and around the box.",
      "READ: Antoine Semenyo to Man Utd makes no sense until Amorim addresses biggest problem position",
      "“When he gets the ball, he has a clear picture of exactly what he wants to do. Whether the finish is near post or back post, he almost shows no emotion.",
      "“It’s just business in and around the box, and I love that. You can play it into his feet, he can dribble. [Peter] Crouch mentioned his touch and how sharp he is but technically, I don’t think he gets enough credit.",
      "“People talk about his goal-scoring and rightly so, but he is an exceptional football player.",
      "“Many players have come to Manchester United with big names and struggled with the pressure but that hasn’t been the case with Mbeumo.”",
      "Former Man Utd striker Dwight Yorke reckons Mbeumo has “overperformed” since signing with Cunha not living up to expectations just yet.",
      "Yorke told Snabbare: “It’s been better, but I still think Manchester United can improve.",
      "“Mbuemo has been good. Cunha has shown it in moments but I don’t think he has been as effective as when he played at Wolves.",
      "“In the summer, Cunha was the signing that excited me. If anyone was going to give me that wow factor, it was Cunha. He hasn’t quite lived up to that just yet.",
      "“I think there are spells in games where you see a glimpse of the things he has done but he’s not been dominating games like what I saw from him when he was playing for Wolves.",
      "“If he can show that sort of drive, the skills, the vision and score those sorts of goals in a United shirt then I will say wow, that’s the guy we bought from Wolves.",
      "“From what I’ve seen of him so far, it’s potentially there. We know what he’s capable of doing. He just needs to do it more consistently. We’ve only seen little spells.",
      "“Mbeumo on the other hand, I think he’s overperformed on what I thought he would produce in all honesty.",
      "“I wasn’t quite sure about him coming to United but you’ve got to give people the benefit of the doubt, and I did.",
      "“I think he’s playing at another level since coming to United, and United have improved based on adding Cunha and Mbeumo to the team.”",
      "Liverpool have been told that there is “only” one way for the Premier League giants to sign Bayern Munich standout Michael Olise to replace Mo Salah.",

      "Steve Nicol has claimed that Liverpool boss Arne Slot needs to drop Mohamed Salah as he’s “reached the stage now where the team can’t carry him anymore”.",
      "Liverpool are a complete mess and must take their spending way beyond £400m to fix themselves, with five players needing to be replaced with upgrades…",
      "Did Van Dijk aim quite a thickly-veiled dig at Salah or was it a straight calling out of a Liverpool teammate? You’re part of the team even when you’re losing, ..."

But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "Romano added: “But Amorim sends a clear message also in public talking about January. First of all, he says the window will be open and there is the possibility they will do something. So, not closing the doors to the opportunity to bring in new players, and it’s already an update for Man Utd. But he also says, ‘I don’t want players for the short-term.’",
      "“Amorim is not bringing in a player for just a few months. A player will join Man Utd only if they believe the player could be an option for the long-term. They don’t want to add a player just in terms of numbers, also because Man Utd have one competition this season plus the FA Cup incoming, and they want to focus on the Premier League.",

      "Manchester United are poised for a seismic shift in their midfield engine room, with ambitious plans to offload high-wage veterans and inject youthful dynamism over the next two to three transfer windows.",
      "Under the stewardship of new head coach Ruben Amorim and the strategic oversight of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Man Utd are charting a bold path toward a revitalised future at Old Trafford, prioritising long-term sustainability over short-term star power.",
      "The blueprint is clear: prune the squad of aging stars burdened by lucrative contracts, freeing up financial firepower to chase emerging talents who align with Amorim’s high-pressing, fluid tactical blueprint.",
      "Casemiro, the Brazilian enforcer whose £70m arrival in 2022 now feels like a relic at age 33, tops the exit list.",
      "His declining mobility and £350,000 weekly wage have become symbols of United’s wage bill woes. Casemiro is expected to depart when his existing deal expires at season’s end.",
      "Similarly, Marcus Rashford, the prodigal son turned enigma at 28, will be sacrificed despite his homegrown status – his inconsistent form and off-field distractions have eroded his untouchable aura.",
      "Even talismanic captain Bruno Fernandes, now 31 and nursing a recent dip in creativity, faces scrutiny and is on United’s list of players they need to replace in the next two to three years.",
      "While his ideas and leadership remain invaluable, Amorim’s vision demands relentless energy, and Fernandes’ contract – running until 2027 – may not shield him from a potential sale if a lucrative offer arrives.",
      "Enter the new guard: a trio of promising midfielders earmarked as the vanguard of this overhaul.",
      "Adam Wharton, the 21-year-old Crystal Palace anchor with his composed passing and prowess, embodies the Ratcliffe-backed British talent pipeline. The Eagles are believed to value Wharton at roughly £70m and that figure may well rise if he continues to impress at Selhurst Park.",
      "Carlos Baleba, Brighton’s 21-year-old Cameroonian dynamo, brings tenacity and box-to-box verve, having dazzled in the Premier League’s cutthroat mid-table battles. The Seagulls don’t intend to sell for a penny less than £100m.",
      "Rounding out the trio of ideal targets is Elliot Anderson, Nottingham Forests 23-year-old creative spark, whose silky dribbling and set-piece wizardry could unlock United’s stagnant attack. Man Utd would like to seal a deal for £60m but sources insist £80m would be required to get Forest’s reluctant green light.",
      "This isn’t mere tinkering; it’s a philosophical reset.",
      "Amorim, fresh from Sporting CP triumphs, inherited a squad bloated by past excesses under the Glazer era. Ratcliffe’s INEOS consortium, with its data-driven ethos, has already slashed non-essential spending, signalling a cultural pivot. “We’re building for eras, not seasons,” a club source confided.",
      "The midfield revamp extends beyond recruitment – expect tactical drills emphasising positional rotation and youth integration, with academy gems like Kobbie Mainoo moulded into a player more befitting Amorim’s demands.",
      "Challenges loom: navigating FFP constraints while commanding premium fees for outgoing stars, and ensuring harmony in a dressing room scarred by turbulence.",
      "Yet, if executed deftly, this youth surge could propel United back into Champions League contention by 2027, blending Amorim’s tactical acumen with Ratcliffe’s fiscal prudence.",
      "As Old Trafford braces for change, one truth endures: in football’s relentless cycle, the bold thrive. United’s midfield metamorphosis might just be the spark to reignite the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "In other news, Sir Alex Ferguson heaped special praise on one of Manchester United’s four major signings from the summer, and while two others were hailed too, one was conspicuously ignored.",

      "“They already did a fantastic job with Reece James, so the mission is to do the same now also with Lavia. But in terms of skills, in terms of development, in terms of potential, Chelsea believe in Lavia. Chelsea invested in Romeo Lavia because they are convinced he can be something special in the future.",

      "Everton are ready to break their transfer record to sign former Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay from Serie A giants Napoli, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils allowed McTominay to leave Old Trafford for around £25m in August 2024 with Erik ten Hag looking to reshape his squad at Man Utd.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked a few months later and replaced by Ruben Amorim, with Man Utd ending up with egg on their faces as McTominay helped Antonio Conte’s side win the Scudetto in his first season at the club.",
      "McTominay contributed 12 goals and four assists in 34 appearances in Serie A last term as he took the league by storm – but he has not quite reached the same levels as last season this campaign.",
      "The Scotland international has two goals and one assist in ten appearances in the league as Napoli’s recent form has seen them drop down to fourth in Serie A.",
      "And now Spanish website Fichajes, which doesn’t have the best hit rate when it comes to transfer news, claims that Everton are ‘preparing’ a €70m (£62m) offer to break their transfer record and sign McTominay from Napoli.",
      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "The report adds: ‘At Goodison Park, McTominay is seen as a strategic figure. Moyes values ​​his ability to burst into the box from deep, comparing him to the powerful Marouane Fellaini of old. This quality would give Everton a dangerous option in their attacking transitions, capable of creating havoc in the opposition’s defense.",
      "‘The club is considering a significant investment to bring him back to the Premier League. The estimated sum of 70 million demonstrates their ambition. Recent reports suggest that Everton understands the Scot could be a game-changer for their midfield, both in the short and long term, should Garner leave or lose his place in the starting lineup.’",
      "Naples journalist Vincenzo Credendino explained earlier this year why McTominay has flourished under Antonio Conte, he told the BBC: “Conte changed his system to put him in the best conditions to play.",

      "“It’s not a coincidence. McTominay is perfect for Conte as Conte is perfect for McTominay.”",
      "Speaking in December on why he chose to join Napoli, McTominay told BBC Scotland: “I saw the passionate fans, I saw the coach, I saw the players and I saw an opportunity.",
      "“I took it, I didn’t look back. It didn’t take me long to make the decision because I knew that was what I wanted and I’ll never have any regrets in my life. As soon as I put my mind to something I want to do it, that’s it. There’s no holding me back.",

      "The report adds: ‘For the Real Madrid president, Tchouaméni is completely untouchable , someone who fits perfectly into the new backbone designed to dominate Europe for the next decade. And no offer, however large, can change that view.’",
      "Real Madrid have made a decision ‘in the last few hours’ over Aurelien Tchouameni’s future after Arsenal launched a bid, according to reports.",

      "Sagna added: “If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season.",
      "“As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it’s much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly – rather than joining midway through a campaign.”",

      "Suppose United are convinced that recruiting from lesser Premier League clubs like Wolves, Brentford and Bournemouth is the way to go, they won’t look further than Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton in their pursuit of a new midfielder.",
      "Sure, Semenyo would improve the United squad, but Amorim also has Amad Diallo, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount. Obviously, £65m should be invested elsewhere.",
      "While we aren’t convinced by the financial practicality of United signing Semenyo, we are convinced that Semenyo to Liverpool is a transfer that makes perfect sense.",
      "The Premier League champions also spent big on their attack in the summer, signing Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak for over £200m, while attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz joined for £100m.",
      "However, there is an alarming lack of depth behind Mohamed Salah on the right, with right-back Jeremie Frimpong seemingly second in Arne Slot’s pecking order.",
      "Not only is there no serious competition for Salah, but Liverpool need a long-term replacement for the 33-year-old.",
      "No matter how you look at it, the odds are stacked in favour of Liverpool recruiting a serious downgrade on Salah, because he’s played at an all-time level for the Reds.",
      "The best option is arguably Michael Olise, Bayern Munich’s world-class winger, but even he would be a downgrade on the Salah we saw last season. Unfortunately for Liverpool, they can’t replace the best Premier League winger of all time with someone capable of making the same impact.",
      "So, Semenyo shouldn’t be viewed as an underwhelming replacement, and he probably isn’t, having scored six goals in 12 Premier League matches this term.",
      "Despite record-breaking summer expenditure from Liverpool, they still have money to spend, and they’d be wise to invest their funds into the signing of Semenyo, but only if they sign a centre-back first, in what would likely be a £100m total investment, unlike Man United’s £165m spend on the Bournemouth man and a midfielder like Anderson or Baleba.",

      "Man Utd have been warned by Red Devils legend Dwight Yorke not to sign Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton as they look for a new midfielder.",
      "The recruitment team at Man Utd were criticised over the summer transfer window for not bringing in a new midfielder despite spending over £200m on five new signings.",
      "It was one of the weakest areas in Ruben Amorim’s side last year and early on this season it was once again an issue as Man Utd remained inconsistent.",
      "The Red Devils have been much better in recent weeks with Man Utd currently five unbeaten after Amorim’s side won their first back-to-back Premier League matches under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Man Utd are still looking for midfield reinforcements, though, with rumours that they could make a new signing in that position over the January transfer window.",
      "Crystal Palace’s Wharton is one of many players linked with a move to Man Utd but Yorke doesn’t think that the England international would be the answer for the Red Devils currently.",
      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "Yorke told Snabbare: “I’m not sure Adam Wharton is the answer. He’s still not quite there for me yet and that’s an area of concern we have to look to improve.",
      "“It is a gap in this Manchester United team. You look at the history behind the football club in its most successful years and they always had a fantastic number six in that position.”",
      "Yorke insists that their new midfield sign must be capable of dictating the pace of a game but it will be “a tough gig” to find the right players.",
      "He added: “Casemiro has been hit and miss at times and it’s a key part of your team. You listen to all the great managers, that central area of your midfield is always so important.",
      "“It’s a tough gig that one to find the right players and I think that’s why they’re struggling. They haven’t got that player who can set the floor of the game, as I always call it, and dictate the pace, who defends but passes the ball forwards, and can see the pass.",
      "“These types of players are rare which surprises me as on the face of it it’s not the most difficult job in the world but it’s the most crucial.”",
      "Yorke continued: “Who I would like to see in that position more? I can’t think, honestly, because there’s too much hype around some of these players,’ he continued.",
      "“Bring back Michael Carrick, maybe? There we go. He’d have done a job in this team!”",
      "When asked if he’d been impacted by the links to Man Utd and other teams, Wharton recently told The Athletic: “Not really, to be honest. I don’t really look into it or think too much about it.",
      "“There’s always rumours floating about on social media and things like this. Is it true? Is it not true? You tell me!”",
      "“Honestly, I get my friends all messaging me or my family, my brothers. Everyone will message me and they’ll be like, “Oh, is this true? This club is interested.”",
      "“I’m like, “Thanks for telling me because I didn’t know before you told me!” and I don’t really take an interest to it too much. I don’t really think about it.",
      "“If something is going to be serious, then I can maybe think about it. But if it’s not very serious, if there’s interest, I’m not interested in knowing because interest… you can be interested in anything and nothing can come from it… I don’t really read into it too much.",
      "“I see it and I’m like, ‘Okay,’ and just carry on with my day. United, the big teams, they’re all linked to 10-20 players. If I’m one in 20, it’s nothing special. It doesn’t really mean too much.",
      "“You must be doing something right for them sort of clubs to be interested or wanting you.”",

      "Manchester United have a problem player, but his mooted ‘surprise’ January replacement has the joint-worst record in Europe’s top five leagues this season.",
      "Is ‘personal goal difference’ a thing? Probably not. But it absolutely can be when in need of content ideas in that awkward period between an international break and the Premier League’s return. The gooch, if you were.",
      "We have looked at each club’s best and worst player in terms of the goal difference they have accrued during their time on the pitch this season, with 100 minutes the cut-off point for inclusion.",
      "",
      "Best: Gabriel Magalhaes and David Raya (+15)\nNeither player has missed a minute for a side which has scored 20 goals and conceded just five after 11 games. That absurd Chelsea record is still on the agenda.",
      "Worst: Cristhian Mosquera (+1)\nIt really was an exceptional signing but Mosquera has suffered for his craft as third-choice centre-half, even if none of the three goals Arsenal have conceded with him on the pitch could be at all attributed to him. Gabriel ended up on the floor for two of them (Nick Woltemade and Brian Brobbey).",
      "",
      "Best: Lucas Digne (+6)\nThe one Premier League game Digne didn’t start this season resulted in a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Villa Park. He remains really quite crucial to Unai Emery.",
      "Worst: Tyrone Mings (-5)\nThe former captain did not miss a minute of Villa’s five-game winless start, then was forced off through injury shortly before Ollie Watkins equalised against Fulham in their first win of the season.",
      "",
      "Best: Alex Scott (+4)\nIt was enough to catch the eye of Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Worst: Marcos Senesi (-4)\nThe Italian has played all but 12 minutes of Bournemouth’s Premier League campaign so far; the Cherries just so happened to mount their stirring comeback against Fulham in October immediately after Senesi came off.",
      "",
      "Best: Kevin Schade (+5)\nBrentford haven’t scored a single goal without Schade on the pitch this season. If Spurs want him they will have to pay.",
      "Worst: Keane Lewis-Potter (-4)\nKeith Andrews has spoken about his delight at having “options” at left-back, but Lewis-Potter – rather understandably as a natural forward playing out of position – seems to struggle bringing that balance to the team.",
      "",
      "Best: Georginio Rutter (+6)\nIt does seem to make Brighton tick when Rutter plays – even if the £40m record signing forward has scored precisely none of their 17 goals.",
      "Worst: Kaoru Mitoma (-2)\nIt sums up Brighton perfectly that Mitoma’s six starts have delivered two defeats, two draws and two wins, those victories coming against Manchester City and Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Best: Zian Flemming (+2)\nThe one Burnley player with a positive individual goal difference; only Erling Haaland has scored more Premier League away goals than Flemming so far this season.",
      "Worst: Maxime Esteve (-9)\nNot only has he been on the pitch for every goal Burnley have conceded, Esteve was also taken off five minutes before Jaidon Anthony sealed victory over Sunderland in August.",
      "",
      "Best: Trevoh Chalobah (+12)\nGuilty of some “absolutely awful defending” recently and increasingly scapegoated by supporters used to a certain vintage of centre-half, but the numbers suggest Chalobah still has a role to play.",
      "Worst: Romeo Lavia (-2)\nWherefore art thou always sodding injured, Romeo? The midfielder still hasn’t completed a full 90 minutes for Chelsea since joining in August 2023.",
      "",
      "Best: Jean-Philippe Mateta (+7)\nIn that ludicrous Bournemouth game alone, Mateta ought to have taken his positive personal goal difference into double figures.",
      "Worst: Justin Devenny (0)\nThat is testament to Oliver Glasner and a defence which has conceded fewer goals than every team barring the top two.",
      "",
      "Best: Tim Iroegbunam (+4)\nIt is little wonder David Moyes loves a player who has only been on the pitch for a single conceded Everton goal this season.",
      "Worst: Michael Keane (-3)\nThe manager does also adore apparent Everton jinx Keane, who will probably end up as their top scorer.",
      "",
      "Best: Harry Wilson (+2)\nThe boy absolutely loves a goal against Brentford.",
      "Worst: Timothy Castagne (-7)\nThat’s really not great. Nor is having the worst PPM (0.29) of any non-Wolves player so far this season. Castagne last featured in a Premier League win in April.",
      "",
      "Best: Brenden Aaronson (-1)\nRodrigo, assisted by Weston McKennie and under the management of Sam Allardyce, scored the last Premier League goal Leeds mustered without Aaronson on the pitch.",
      "Worst: Joe Rodon (-10)\nOne of 23 ever-presents in the Premier League, but the only one foolish enough to play for Leeds.",
      "",
      "Best: Alisson (+5)\nFair play to Federico Chiesa, who can match that personal goal difference despite being given a fraction of the playing time because Arne Slot seemingly fundamentally dislikes him.",
      "Worst: Florian Wirtz (-4)\nIt is only by virtue of having played more minutes that Wirtz edges ahead of Conor Bradley and Giorgio Mamardashvili, which neatly underlines how Liverpool have struggled to replace key players in net and at right-back. But those numbers are particularly stark for nine-figure signing Wirtz, who still awaits his first Premier League goal or assist.",
      "",
      "Best: Jeremy Doku (+16)\nManchester City have not lost a Premier League game Doku has started since March. Liverpool felt the Belgian’s entire wrath and the only players in Europe’s top five leagues with a better personal goal difference all turn out for Bayern Munich.",
      "Worst: John Stones (-1)\n“The club will decide what is best for John, we will see how he performs,” said Pep Guardiola of a player who “has not had the consistency” in terms of game time due to injuries. And it has shown.",
      "",
      "Best: Casemiro (+8)\nThe football undeniably left him but has emphatically returned. The only defeat Manchester United have suffered with Casemiro starting this season was on the opening weekend against Arsenal.",
      "Worst: Manuel Ugarte (-7)\nThat is a remarkable swing which emphasises the significant drop-off in quality between the club’s two foremost holding midfielders. Ugarte – and more specifically Ruben Amorim’s insistence on leaning on the Uruguayan as a perennial substitute – has become one of Manchester United’s biggest problems.",
      "",
      "Best: Jacob Murphy (+2)\nThere might be no better, more effective or important Newcastle player than the one Rafael Benitez signed from the Championship eight years ago. And that is damning, no less so because…",
      "Worst: Anthony Elanga (-5)\nIt does feel like £55m should buy you really rather a lot more. The lack of competition at that price point always was a bit of a red flag.",
      "",
      "Best: Taiwo Awoniyi (+1)\nLabelled “a bit of an unsung hero at times” by Sean Dyche, that could be a union which brings the best out of Awoniyi again.",
      "Worst: Matz Sels, Nico Williams, Nikola Milenkovic and Elliot Anderson (-10)\nFour ever-presents largely paying for the crimes of Evangelos Marinakis and Ange Postecoglou. Of course one of them is a legitimate £100m talent.",
      "",
      "Best: Dan Ballard (+6)\nThat just feels right for 2025’s Radhi Jaidi.",
      "Worst: Jenson Seelt (-2)\nThat’s a fairly harsh reflection of a player who went off through injury at 0-0 of a 3-0 thrashing of West Ham, then played the majority of a 2-0 defeat to Burnley before leaving for Wolfsburg on loan.",
      "",
      "Best: Guglielmo Vicario (+9)\nSome doubts remain but Gary Neville reckons “the goalkeeper looks a lot better” and “more solid than he has been” recently.",
      "Worst: Randal Kolo Muani (0)\nEmi Martinez really did break him.",
      "",
      "Best: Callum Wilson (+1)\nWest Ham have won two of the three Premier League games Wilson has started this season. Nuno Espirito Santo has seen the light.",
      "Worst: Max Kilman and Jarrod Bowen (-10)\nTwo players whose standing with the West Ham fanbase is pretty much diametrically opposed, but still the Hammers persist with the clearly detrimental Bowen.",
      "",
      "Best: Fer Lopez (-3)\nPerhaps Rob Edwards will find a use for £19.6m summer signing Lopez; Vitor Pereira rarely seemed enamoured with the idea.",
      "Worst: Joao Gomes (-15)\nIt is, along with Heidenheim pair Diant Ramaj and Patrick Mainka, the worst personal goal difference in Europe’s top five leagues so far this season. Perhaps Gomes isn’t the answer to Manchester United’s Ugarte problem.",
      "Some big names are sweating on a place at the World Cup, with an Arsenal duo joining Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Barca stars in the play-offs…",
      "Antoine Semenyo and Joao Gomes have been linked with Arsenal and Manchester United respectively but they share one really quite obvious thing in common.",
      "If you live in Scotland, you know how much the Scots have had to cling on to history. And now this team has created their own.",
      "There is a reverse clamour building for Jude Bellingham to be omitted from the England team for the World Cup. Would it be the biggest squad exclusion ever?",
      "Arsenal already have a near-complete squad, but they would be in an even stronger position if these five deals happen in a perfect January window for the Gunners…",
      "Scotland will be at the World Cup and it’s a triumph that is lauded by everybody. Why isn’t supporting England this much fun?"

      "The Red Devils spent around £200m on new attacking players over the summer transfer window with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko all joining the club.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term with Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund scoring just seven league goals between them.",
      "Sesko has so far failed to hit the heights expected of him before moving to Old Trafford with the Slovenia international scoring two goals in 11 Premier League appearances and struggling to make an impact on matches.",
      "On Monday, Newcastle and England legend Alan Shearer claimed that Man Utd had “paid too much” for Sesko and admitted that he won’t be expecting huge things from the striker.",
      "And now another legendary Premier League striker, Fowler, has insisted that Sesko currently looks like “an academy player” with Arsenal signing Viktor Gyokeres looking better suited to the league.",
      "READ: Top ten Premier League players in World Cup qualifying features *the* Man Utd flop",
      "Fowler told Adventure Gamers: “For me I think the obvious one is Gyokeres. He’s probably better suited to the Premier League and he understands what is needed in terms of speed, energy and commitment. Whereas Sesko has probably struggled a little at times.",
      "“He looks a little bit, I hope this doesn’t come across wrong, but he looks a bit of an academy player. I have no doubt he’s a good player. No one’s questioning his ability, but at the minute I think out of those two it’s Gyokeres by far who looks better equipped.”",
      "Former Man Utd striker Danny Welbeck has been linked with a potential return to Old Trafford with the Brighton forward performing well this season.",
      "But ex-Arsenal, Leicester and Scotland striker Paul Dickov reckons Welbeck would potentially be relegated to a bit-part player behind Sesko if he makes the move.",
      "Dickov told Best Betting Bonuses: “It would be a big shout, actually, wouldn’t it? Danny’s been excellent. He seems to get better as he gets older. I think he’s the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League this season.",
      "“Danny’s obviously a Manchester boy, came through the academy. But it’ll be interesting to see what United do and for how long Sesko is actually out for.",
      "“Because they spent big on him. He was the one that they wanted in the summer. But with strikers, and I know that myself, we’re very selfish.",
      "“Any striker joining United in the winter will know that Sesko will be coming back, and almost certainly play ahead of him. Are United going to go and spend big and get a centre-forward that’s going to come in and then have two centre-forwards that have got a big price tag? Is one going to sit on the bench?",
      "“Especially in the January market, it’s really difficult to go out there and get the players that you want. Then I know with Danny Welbeck, if United come in, it’s not even certain he will want to leave Brighton or if Brighton would let him leave.",
      "“At the back of his mind, he’s going to be thinking ‘How many games am I going to play?’ Because when Sesko comes back, he’s probably going to be the main No. 9 that they’ve got in their squad. So it’s a really difficult one for him.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano insists that Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee could still be asked to stay at Old Trafford despite “good” injury news on Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer has explained why he thinks Manchester United “paid too much” for Benjamin Sesko in the summer transfer window.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘torn over’ signing a new striker in January after Benjamin Sesko picked up an injury before the international break.",
      "A Manchester United attacker has reportedly been told there is ‘no chance’ that he’ll be allowed to leave in January, with the club to ‘block requests’ in the winter.",
      "England head coach Thomas Tuchel has named one Premier League star who is “very close” to a call-up, while he has made a fresh claim about Jude Bellingham.",
      "Jamie Carragher has explained why he feels Thomas Tuchel decided against picking a striker with 16 England goals, and what he’ll therefore do if Harry Kane becomes unavailable."

      "Manchester United are not going to be able to sign Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace in the January transfer window, sources have told TEAMtalk, amid speculation that the Red Devils have already ‘submitted’ a ‘bid’ for the midfielder that manager Ruben Amorim ‘loves’.",
      "It has been well-documented that Man Utd are on the hunt for a midfielder in the January transfer window, as Amorim aims to take advantage of the team’s promising results of late to make a serious push for the Premier League top four this season.",
      "Sources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer correspondent, Fraser Fletcher, that Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson is Man Utd’s top midfield target in January.",
      "TEAMtalk understands that Man Utd are confident of getting a deal done for Anderson for £60million (€56.8m, $65.5m).",
      "However, the Red Devils are not putting all their eggs in one basket, with Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton also on Man Utd’s wish-list, as reported by Fletcher on September 23.",
      "A report emerged on November 17 claiming that Man Utd have submitted a bid for Wharton, with manager Amorim claimed to love the 21-year-old England international.",
      "The account on X, which has almost 700,000 followers and is run by a ‘team of five elite reporters’, wrote at 6pm: ‘My contact at the club are telling me that bid has been submitted for Adam Wharton.",
      "‘Ruben Amorim loves the player and believes he can sell the project to Adam before Liverpool contact the player.’",
      "While this rumour has to be treated with caution, given that no other media outlets have reported it, TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, has revealed that the “information” that he has been given from sources is that Palace will not sell Wharton in the middle of the season.",
      "When asked if Palace could sell Wharton in January,  Jones told TEAMtalk: “There are no signs of it happening. I just don’t think deals like this are going to happen in January.",
      "“I would love to be able to reveal there was going to be a huge battle to sign him in a mega-money transfer, but all the information I have had on it just doesn’t lead to that.",
      "“I think Palace will keep him at this stage and we will then see what happens at the end of the season.”",
      "TEAMtalk DEBATE 🔴 Liverpool or Man Utd, which move is better for Adam Wharton? – ‘It’s a no-brainer’",
      "In other news, Man Utd have joined Manchester City and Arsenal in the race for one of their best young players in the Bundesliga.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has picked one particular Man Utd summer signing for praise, with the Red Devils’ legend hugely impressed by him.",
      "And finally, sources have told TEAMtalk whether Man Utd would be able to sign Joao Gomes from Wolves in the January transfer window."

      "While these guys rip it up in World Cup qualifying, some Premier League players are yet to get going…",
      "He’s in our Premier League team of the season so far, but he’s behind Bart Verbruggen (and probably Mark Flekken) with the Netherlands, though his move to – and outstanding subsequent form in – the Premier League did at least earn him a first call-up in September. He’s been sat on the bench ever since.",
      "",
      "Yes, he of the long throw and the being really quite excellent for Brentford. He has been extensively capped by his country at Under-18, Under-19 and Under-21 level but remains uncapped for actual Italy, which might be a blessing considering the absolute sh*t-show going on there.",
      "",
      "It’s really quite astonishing that Botman remains uncapped while his lofty Newcastle United teammate Dan Burn is merrily collecting England caps. But Botman faces some very, very tough Premier League competition in Virgil van Dijk, Micky van de Ven, Nathan Ake, Jan Paul van Hecke and Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "",
      "Another centre-half that would absolutely have a little hatful of caps (should you keep a collection of hats in another hat?) if he were English, but Yoro is French and they are spoiled at centre-half even beyond Dayot Upamencano, William Saliba and Ibrahima Konate. He’s roughly 25 injuries away from a call-up.",
      "",
      "We’re old enough to remember when Ryan Sessegnon was definitely going to be England’s left-back for over a decade. He was not. But there is still a chance after he re-established himself as Fulham’s first-choice left-back. And England do have a left-back problem. And this uncapped XI had a left-back problem because Rico Henry went and played nine minutes for Jamaica.",
      "",
      "Very, very expensive for an uncapped player but City paid a January tax on Nico, who had represented Spain at every level bar the big one. He did not make himself indispensable in his first few months in England but he has proved to be a very valuable member of the City squad, starting and scoring in a dominant performance as they battered Liverpool 3-0.",
      "",
      "“He had an excellent Euros and won the title, Lee [Carsley] was full of praise and he did an excellent job in midfield with Elliot Anderson, who is now a regular starter for us. He was very impressive and then he took another step and has become a very regular starter for Bournemouth.",
      "“They are in the top third of the league, overperforming constantly, and he is a starter for them. He puts the intensity in and gets his minutes, so we thought this was the perfect time to reward him, get to know him and see what he can bring to our team.”",
      "The words of Thomas Tuchel when calling up Scott for the first time. It’s astonishing that Anderson was in this uncapped XI as recently as June.",
      "",
      "There was A Clamour in March but Tuchel resisted, with Nwaneri fast-tracked into the England Under-21 set-up instead, and he is now firmly established in Lee Carsley’s starting XI. Unfortunately, Arsenal minutes are a little harder to come by after serious summer investment and he has found himself in the Carabao Cup team with Myles Lewis-Skelly. He could yet play for England but it feels a long way away now.",
      "",
      "A move away from Liverpool was supposed to bring more minutes and a greater chance of an England call-up, but Elliott has struggled to understand Unai Emery’s quite specific tactics at Villa and remains very much on the fringes there. Thankfully, there is so little competition for England in the No. 10 role, that he should walk straight in when he’s ready…",
      "",
      "He’s yet to log a Premier League goal or assist but he has at least established himself as one of four or five wide options at Chelsea, with the Carabao Cup win over Wolves providing something of a breakthrough moment. And he is absolutely part of Carsley’s England Under-21 plans, which might mean that he is at least in Tuchel’s peripheral vision.",
      "",
      "With Tuchel teasing that he will likely take one out-and-out striker to understudy Harry Kane, it could be a straight race over the next six months. And at least Delap is now fit to take his place in the blocks. If Jean-Philippe Mateta can get capped (and score) for France, then Delap can do it for England. Even Eddie Nketiah has an England cap, FFS.",
      "Some big names are sweating on a place at the World Cup, with an Arsenal duo joining Liverpool, Man City, Newcastle and Barca stars in the play-offs…",
      "Antoine Semenyo and Joao Gomes have been linked with Arsenal and Manchester United respectively but they share one really quite obvious thing in common.",
      "If you live in Scotland, you know how much the Scots have had to cling on to history. And now this team has created their own.",
      "There is a reverse clamour building for Jude Bellingham to be omitted from the England team for the World Cup. Would it be the biggest squad exclusion ever?",
      "Arsenal already have a near-complete squad, but they would be in an even stronger position if these five deals happen in a perfect January window for the Gunners…",

      "World Cup qualification is very nearly over and with just a handful of games left to play before the play-offs in March, we bring you the top 10 Premier League players of a campaign which for some nations started way back in September 2023.",
      "Here’s who’s already qualified and here’s what’s next for Republic of Ireland and the other play-off hopefuls.",
      "And here’s a Premier League XI of players yet to be capped.",
      "",
      "10) Declan Rice (Arsenal and England)",
      "There’s a degree of crowbarring an England player in here, and with Premier League judas Harry Kane not available for selection, we’ve plumped for a man described by Lee Dixon on Sunday – with no hint of irony or any notable nod to Alan Partridge – as “the very best corner-kick taker on earth”.",
      "Only one of Rice’s four assists actually came from a corner, but two more from crosses, and while our guess is Mr Dixon’s assertion is largely based on televised Premier League and Champions League games, he is indeed a very fine courier of a football.",
      "",
      "9) Mohamed Salah (Liverpool and Egypt)",
      "A brace against Djibouti in October served as quite the moment of positivity amid the club-level sh*t for Salah, as the Egypt captain secured their place at the World Cup while also becoming the top goalscorer in African qualifying history with 20 to his name.",
      "His nine across the 2026 campaign was only bettered by Algeria’s Mohamed Amoura. Arne Slot may well take nine from him across the 38-game Premier League season on current form.",
      "",
      "8) Cody Gakpo (Liverpool and Netherlands)",
      "More Premier League goals and assists combined (5) than any Liverpool player this season and yet he’s still seen as a weak link by most, who would much rather have Luis Diaz back despite Gakpo going toe to toe with the Colombian for a starting spot last season. We suspect Gakpo would have Liverpool fans looking on just as wistfully had it been him who had made the move to Bayern Munich in the summer.",
      "And he’s got four goals and four assists for the Netherlands having started every World Cup qualifier under Ronald Koeman, taking his career tally to 19 goals and 10 assists in 46 games for his country. For context, Bukayo Saka has 14 goals and nine assists in 48 games for England.",
      "",
      "7) Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford and Denmark)",
      "Those reading this north of the border will hope Damsgaard’s place on this list doesn’t act as some sort of harbinger of doom ahead of Tuesday night’s showdown at Hampden Park. Some advice to Steve Clarke, if we may: stop Damsgaard; stop Denmark.",
      "He has three goals and an assist in five games, chiefly from the left wing but with the license to cut inside and combine with Christian Eriksen in a more central area, behind Rasmus Hojlund. He’s infuriatingly neat and tidy, and his increased influence for Brentford in the last year has built up a level of confidence that he’s now arguably showing to an even greater degree for his country.",
      "",
      "6) Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea and Argentina)",
      "He played and thrived for Argentina, and continued to be heralded as an undroppable star player, through thin times at Chelsea, and Fernandez remains a key cog in Lionel Scaloni’s team now that things are rather thicker for him at Stamford Bridge.",
      "His and Argentina’s zenith came in a 4-1 win over Brazil in March, after which the local press marvelled at his “near to perfect” display. The 24-year-old “dominated” the game playing as the closest midfielder to Julian Alvarez, often with his back to goal, linking the play with the sort of time on the ball only afforded to the most technically gifted footballers.",
      "He’s one reason Argentina are top of our World Cup power rankings.",
      "",
      "5) Jeremy Doku (Manchester City and Belgium)",
      "Doku had been grouped in a herd of not-quite-good-enough Manchester City forwards, and may even have been bringing up the rear behind Savinho, Oscar Bobb and Omar Marmoush before a season in which he’s shown a significant improvement that we’re as guilty as anyone in believing he would never make. We assumed he was destined to be little more than a kick-and-run winger forever.",
      "He comes across as a very intelligent guy in interviews and something of a sponge for advice, previously hailing Thierry Henry for telling him how to improve his number of goals and assists rather than just insisting on the need for an increase. Both Manchester City and Belgium are reaping the rewards of Henry’s suggestion he cut out the “stutters” in his dribbling and avoid thinking he has to beat his man to deliver a cross.",
      "Only Lamine Yamal (7.5) completed more dribbles per game than Doku (5.6), but the key to Doku’s place on this list and his status now as something at least approaching a complete winger is his 3.1 key passes per game, which is the 14th most in European qualifying.",
      "",
      "4) Manuel Ugarte (Manchester United and Uruguay)",
      "Just as none of us can believe Ugarte has ever shown quality worthy of a £53m move to Paris Saint-Germain and then a £44m move to Manchester United given the almost comically lacklustre displays we’ve seen of him in the Premier League, we imagine Uruguayan nationals are similarly perplexed as to how the guy they’re seeing cleaning up at the base of their midfield isn’t having a similarly dominant effect for the Red Devils.",
      "No player has won more than Ugarte’s 33 tackles in South American qualifying, with Moises actual Caicedo behind him in second on 27 having played more minutes, and no player has made more than Ugarte’s 29 interceptions. Incredible.",
      "It is very gratifying indeed to know that no matter the degree to which the floppiness of an Old Trafford flop appears to be down to the player and not the club, it is in fact always Manchester United that is the problem.",
      "",
      "3) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal and Norway)",
      "There’s something of the Wales 2016s about this Norway side in that they’ve got an outstanding goalscorer and playmaker of a similar standing and influence to Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey.",
      "Like Wales, there is talent elsewhere in the side. They had Ashley Williams, Ben Davies and Joe Allen. Norway have Alexander Sorloth, Sander Berge and Kristoffer Ajer. They’re no mugs and would have been an outside bet to qualify anyway, but those questioning whether they can make any sort of mark at the tournament proper without Erling Haaland should have similar doubts over an Odegaard-less Norway.",
      "His seven assists in just five games was the most of anyone in Europe and no-one created more than his five chances per game.",
      "",
      "2) Mikel Merino (Arsenal and Spain)",
      "He’s started all of Spain’s five games and played every minute of the first four, scoring six goals, including a hat-trick in the 6-0 away win against second-placed Turkey.",
      "After two goals and an assist against Bulgaria in October, Spain boss Luis de la Fuente hailed Merino as “an exceptionally complete player with great adaptability”. That versatility is arguably costing him at Arsenal – for whom he’s started just four Premier League games – as he’s neither one thing nor the other, very good at everything but not the best at anything, but he’s made himself undroppable for Spain, and is now always shoehorned into the team, shining whether as a No.8 or No.10.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City and Norway)",
      "He’s now scored an absurd 55 goals in 48 games for his country, stretching his lead as Norway’s all-time top goalscorer dramatically through qualifying, with Jorgen Juve second on 33.",
      "Haaland would be 20th on the list through this World Cup campaign alone, with his 16 goals in eight games just one less than Morten Gamst Pederson managed in 82 appearances.",
      "He scored twice as many goals as anyone else in European qualifying – Harry Kane, Marko Arnautovic and Memphis Depay all scored eight – and is the top scorer in qualifying across all continents, including those where teams play twice as many games.",
      "“We’ve not had someone who’s been an outright superstar in the way that Erling is,” said Norwegian journalist Lars Sivertsen. “I think there’s already a case to be made that he’s our greatest ever player.”",
      "Man City duo Erling Haaland and Bernardo Silva are both pushing for moves to Barcelona ahead of next summer, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal already have a near-complete squad, but they would be in an even stronger position if these five deals happen in a perfect January window for the Gunners…",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are lining up a deal to sign Man City superstar Erling Haaland in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Relegation via a guilty FFP verdict would lead to a Manchester City exodus, so we have ranked their 26-man squad based on exit likelihood in this scenario…",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the Premier League Golden Boot with Erling Haaland disappearing over the horizon already."

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "Thursday 13 November 2025 16:35, UK",
      "A number of Premier League stars have entered the final year of their contracts, meaning they can negotiate a free transfer with clubs outside of England from January.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side have prioritised extending the deals of players at risk of leaving in the near future and the contract situation for the team is in a strong position as a result.",
      "Nothing to report for next summer and with no potential exits on a free, Arsenal can now concentrate on more important matters on the pitch.",
      "Ross Barkley",
      "A seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",
      "Whether that warrants a fresh deal at Villa Park remains to be seen.",
      "Marcos Senesi",
      "In the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.",
      "Talks are reportedly under way regarding a new deal but like the future of his boss Andoni Iraola, there has been no news as of yet.",
      "Adam Smith",
      "The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.",
      "Injuries have hindered his involvement for the first team this season but 11 years into his career at the Vitality Stadium, Smith still has a role to play.",
      "Vitaly Janelt",
      "Talks over a new deal are yet to reach an agreement and the Bees want a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around.",
      "Rico Henry",
      "Brentford hold the option to extend Henry's stay in west London by an additional year so are in no danger of losing the left-back.",
      "Knee injuries and other fitness issues have blighted his time at the Bees but Henry has played a role in cup competitions for Keith Andrews' side, providing crucial depth and experience at left-back.",
      "Mathias Jensen",
      "Another future at Brentford that the club are in control of. Jensen is one of three players with an option of an additional year in his current contract.",
      "The 29-year-old, who will be turning 30 when the transfer window opens, has been used prominently in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Josh Dasilva",
      "Dasilva signed a deal in October to remain at the club until the end of the season after seeing his previous contract expire in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old is yet to return from a serious knee injury suffered in February but head coach Andrews has stressed his importance to the team. Brentford hold an option to keep him for a further 12 months if his return from injury goes to plan.",
      "Myles Peart-Harris",
      "The attacking midfielder is yet to make an appearance for Brentford this season after previously impressing on loan with Swansea in the Championship last season.",
      "He was last included in the match-day squad for the Bees first team on August 26 against Bournemouth.",
      "Adam Webster",
      "A severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Webster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Lewis Dunk",
      "The Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.",
      "Solly March",
      "With game time limited for the 31-year-old in wide areas, it is unclear whether the club will trigger the option to extend his stay by another year.",
      "Danny Welbeck",
      "The forward is ageing like a fine wine in the Premier League and his form for the club warrants a new deal.",
      "The 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.",
      "Joel Veltman",
      "Veltman triggered an option to extend his stay at the club for an additional year last season but is now approaching the end of his contract.",
      "He missed five games with a calf injury but returned in the derby against Crystal Palace, outlining his role to play in Hurzeler's squad.",
      "James Milner",
      "The Premier League veteran will turn 40 when the window to negotiate with foreign clubs opens in January.",
      "Hurzeler said his experience was \"invaluable\" when he signed a one-year extension in June. The likelihood of a similar deal remains unclear.",
      "Martin Dubravka",
      "Dubravka signed a one-year deal with the Clarets upon their return to the Premier League and ranks amongst the best in shot-stopping in the division.",
      "His future at Turf Moor will likely be determined when - and if - Burnley manage to avoid the drop.",
      "Josh Laurent",
      "Laurent has been a useful member of the squad since joining from Stoke City in 2024. He signed a two-year deal when he first arrived at the club, with the option for a third.",
      "Vaclav Hladky",
      "The Czech Republic shot-stopper has only been included in two match-day squads this season - both in the Carabao Cup - and is yet to make an appearance in the 2025/26 campaign after featuring in pre-season.",
      "With 21-year-old Max Weiss currently ahead of him as Dubravka's understudy, an exit feels inevitable.",
      "Ashley Barnes",
      "Barnes signed a deal running until the end of the season after terminating his contract at Norwich City in January, returning to Turf Moor almost 11 years after he first joined the club.",
      "He then put pen to paper on a new one-year deal in the summer but has failed to make an impact in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are known for offering long-term deals to their players and have no one approaching the end of their respective deals ahead of next summer.",
      "Marc Guehi",
      "Arguably one of the most talked-about contract sagas ahead of next summer. Palace stopped Guehi from joining Liverpool on Deadline Day and with no fresh contract in sight, his exit from Selhurst Park feels like a matter of when, not if.",
      "Rumours linking him with a move to Anfield continue to swirl but clubs in Europe, who will be free to open negotiations for pre-contract agreements in the New Year, are also on alert.",
      "Daichi Kamada",
      "Informal conversations have taken place regarding a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.",
      "Naouirou Ahamada",
      "The 23-year-old has spent the vast majority of his time with the U21s side. Ahamada spent last season on loan at Rennes, making five appearances.",
      "Nathaniel Clyne",
      "In his second spell with the Eagles, Clyne signed a one-year contract extension with the club in the summer. However, his role has been reduced this season, making two appearances without a start.",
      "Clyne will be 35 when his current contract expires and an exit in search of more frequent game time in the latter stages of his career could be on the horizon.",
      "Jefferson Lerma",
      "Lerma is a useful and reliable option for Oliver Glasner to turn to, especially as he looks to balance fixture congestion in domestic cup competitions and Europe.",
      "The Eagles hold an option to extend his stay at Selhurst Park for an additional year.",
      "Vitaliy Mykolenko",
      "Mykolenko has confirmed his agent will soon enter talks with Everton regarding a new contract at the Toffees. The 26-year-old remains a key part of the squad with summer signing Adam Aznou yet to break into the first team.",
      "James Garner",
      "Garner is a regular for Everton under David Moyes. Jordan Pickford and James Tarkowski have both been rewarded with new deals in recent months and Garner will likely follow suit to reflect his new status within the team.",
      "Michael Keane",
      "Another mainstay in Moyes' squad. Keane reportedly had offers to leave the Toffees in the summer but chose to remain on Merseyside by signing a new deal and is now benefiting from that decision.",
      "Keane, 32, reportedly has an option to extend his stay for an additional 12 months.",
      "Idrissa Gueye",
      "Gueye signed a new deal in July, running until the end of the season, but the club hold an option for an additional year.",
      "The Senegal international, in his second stint with the Toffees after leaving in 2019 to join PSG for £26m, has been a regular for Moyes in the league so far this season.",
      "Triggering the extension seems like a suitable option for all parties.",
      "Seamus Coleman",
      "The 36-year-old club legend signed a new deal just before the new campaign began to commit to a 17th season with the Blues.",
      "He has been used sparingly but would likely jump at the chance to end his career at Everton with another deal, if he wishes to continue past the 2025/26 season.",
      "Harry Tyrer",
      "Tyrer impressed while on loan at Blackpool last season, making 38 appearances in League One and keeping 12 clean sheets.",
      "Despite showing promise, the 23-year-old is behind Mark Travers in the pecking order for Jordan Pickford's understudy and will likely need to pursue first-team opportunities elsewhere if he wants game time.",
      "Ryan Sessegnon",
      "The Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.",
      "His importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.",
      "Harry Wilson",
      "Fulham pulled the plug on Wilson's move to Elland Road, reiterating he was not for sale, and head coach Marco Silva has since confirmed that he is set for talks regarding an extension.",
      "Adama Traore",
      "Fulham triggered an option to extend Traore's contract until 2026 last season but the winger has found minutes hard to come by in the current campaign.",
      "Raul Jimenez",
      "Jimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.",
      "Tom Cairney",
      "Club captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.",
      "Illan Meslier",
      "The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.",
      "Meslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.",
      "An exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.",
      "Sam Byram",
      "Signed on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.",
      "Karl Darlow",
      "Darlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.",
      "Alex Cairns",
      "Academy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.",
      "Ibrahima Konate",
      "An exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.",
      "Andy Robertson",
      "The veteran defender has insisted he is relaxed about his future at Anfield with his contract coming to an end this season.",
      "Atletico Madrid were interested in signing the Scotland international in the summer ahead of Milos Kerkez's arrival but given the struggles of their new left-back, conversations may be revisited with the 31-year-old, after he confirmed discussions had taken place during the summer to extend his stay.",
      "Freddie Woodman",
      "Woodman joined on a free transfer in the summer following the expiration of his contract at Preston North End.",
      "In the absence of Alisson due to injury, Woodman has operated as Giorgi Mamardashvili's back-up and started in the 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup in October. The club hold an option to extend his contract for a further year.",
      "Rhys Williams",
      "Even with numbers at centre back low at Liverpool following Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury at the beginning of the campaign, Liverpool have not handed Williams an appearance in any of the three competitions they have competed in so far.",
      "Bernardo Silva",
      "Silva spoke openly about his future during the summer, outlining he is focused on the season but is aware he can leave the Etihad Stadium next summer.",
      "He continues to play a crucial role for Pep Guardiola's side and had options to leave but remained at the club.",
      "John Stones",
      "The future of John Stones is yet to be decided, with the England centre-back also approaching the end of his current deal.",
      "Stefan Ortega",
      "Ortega is now third-choice at the club following the arrivals of Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford. The German shot-stopper was linked as a potential target for Burnley in the summer.",
      "Marcus Bettinelli",
      "Signed in the summer before Trafford and Donnarumma arrived at the Etihad, Bettinelli is yet to make his debut for the club.",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "One of the more notable names approaching free agency. Maguire has enjoyed an upturn in his career at Old Trafford over the last two seasons.",
      "Maguire is not a regular starter under Ruben Amorim but adds crucial depth and experience. A one-year extension in his deal was triggered in January.",
      "Casemiro",
      "The club hold an option to extend Casemiro's stay by an additional year but there is a real possibility his contract is not renewed to free up space on the wage bill to strengthen the midfield area next season.",
      "Tom Heaton",
      "Third-choice goalkeeper behind Senne Lammens and Altay Bayindir at the club. Heaton has not featured for United since the 2022/23 season and will be 40 when his contract expires.",
      "Fabian Schar",
      "Schar extended his contract at the club in April and has admitted he would be open to discussing a new deal with the Magpies, while speaking to The Chronicle in October.",
      "Kieran Trippier",
      "Following an injury to Tino Livramento, Trippier has once again emerged as a key part of Eddie Howe's plans this season.",
      "Jamaal Lascelles",
      "The club captain saw his contract extended late into last season and his future will likely be addressed further down the line.",
      "Emil Krafth",
      "Krafth signed an extension in February to keep him at the club until the end of the 2025/26 season. The Sweden international right-back has been rotated into the squad for domestic cup competitions and his agent has downplayed suggestions he could leave in January.",
      "Max Thompson",
      "The 21-year-old goalkeeper is yet to make his senior debut for the club but did impress on loan at Chesterfield last season, keeping five clean sheets in 18 League Two outings.",
      "Mark Gillespie",
      "Local-born goalkeeper Gillespie has not featured for Newcastle since the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "Angus Gunn",
      "Signed for free in the summer window, Gunn is yet to make an appearance for Forest and is the third-choice at the club behind Matz Sels and John Victor, with the latter starting in cup competitions and featuring in Europe.",
      "Willy Boly",
      "Boly signed a new one-year deal at the City Ground last summer but game time is limited with Murillo, Morato and Nikolo Milenkovic ahead of him at centre back.",
      "Dennis Cirkin",
      "Cirkin has been sidelined with knee and wrist injuries since Sunderland returned to the Premier League but recently featured for the U21s as he continues to regain fitness.",
      "Dan Neil",
      "Neil started all 44 of his appearances in the Championship for Sunderland, but has fallen out of favour since the squad was revamped for the top flight.",
      "Bertrand Traore",

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",
      "When Richarlison glanced in Wilson Odobert's cross in the first minute of stoppage-time to make it 2-1 against Man Utd, it seemed certain that fact would change.",
      "However, Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser extended Spurs' winless home run in the competition to five.",
      "In spite of these struggles, and a raft of injuries with 10 players out, Spurs are still third in the table. Sorting those home struggles is crucial if Spurs are to be contenders.Zinny Boswell",
      "Good things can't last forever, and in the case of Arsenal, their run of clean sheets came to its conclusion at the Stadium of Light.",
      "A huge 812 minutes after conceding their last goal, Dan Ballard proved it is in fact possible to beat David Raya and reminded the Premier League that the Gunners are not impenetrable.",
      "That does not mean that Mikel Arteta's side are now going to be conceding goals left, right and centre, but it does mean that at the other end they will need to be more clinical.",
      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard may have scored, but they also wasted good chances. William Saliba may not be the one you would point at to find the net, but he too will look back on today's game thinking they could have got his name on the scoresheet.",
      "Had another clean sheet been secured, this wouldn't have mattered in the grand scheme of things. But, ultimately, this would be costly.",
      "Saka's quality is not in doubt. Trossard's is underrated. Merino is a serviceable option as a No 9. The weight will continue to fall on them while other players regain their fitness, and their production will get called into question if more nights like this one begin to impact their title charge.Callum Bishop",
      "Admittedly, in the second half, the Black Cats were at the mercy of Arsenal, who looked likely to score with almost every attack. In the first, though, it was a very different tale.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side put in a commanding first 45 minutes. And it wasn't by playing the most beautiful football. It was by forcing their opponents to play the game exactly how they wanted it to be played.",
      "The resolute nature of Sunderland's rearguard performance began to irritate the Gunners, and by the time they conceded they were just playing into the hands of the hosts. Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",
      "The fact they were able to do this against a side that could have gone nine points clear at the top of the Premier League had they won, speaks volumes about what the newly promoted side have been able to do. Both tonight and through the season to date.",
      "When people say there are no easy games in the Premier League, Sunderland are the evidence they will continue to point towards.Callum Bishop",
      "Booed off at half-time, given a standing ovation at the final whistle. There was a big mood-shift at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea eventually broken down and then tore apart Wolves.",
      "The Chelsea supporters had been celebrating before kick-off, too, watching Arsenal get pegged back by Sunderland on the TV screens inside the stadium. Those two results, leave Chelsea second in the Premier League title race and just six points off the Gunners.",
      "Are the world champions now Premier League contenders?",
      "That could be the day Chelsea establish serious momentum. Or the day their shortcomings are underlined.",
      "In moments, this is a team so slick and brimming with potential. In others, they look stuck and short of ideas. The return to fitness of Cole Palmer should at least help with their final-third quality but issues at No 9 persist, with Liam Delap and Marc Guiu off the pace right now.",
      "After this third international break of the season, the hard and decisive winter months begin. Chelsea are well placed - just as they were at this stage last season. Can they kick on and go for the crown?Peter Smith",
      "Former Wolves boss Gary O'Neil says the club needs a \"reset\". To stay in the Premier League they'll need a miracle.",
      "Every single top-flight side with two or fewer points at this stage have then been relegated - Man City in 1995-96 (2), Sunderland in 2016-17 (2), Sheffield United in 2020-21 (1) and 2023-24 (1), and Norwich in 2021-22 (2).",
      "The last time Wolves failed to win any of their opening 11 games, in 1983, they were relegated from the top flight. It is near impossible to see how that won't happen again.",
      "Rob Edwards needs to consider very carefully whether it is worth leaving his high-flying Middlesbrough for a side that they could pass on the way up.",
      "Wolves look doomed with their best players sold in the summer and striker Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for service and form. It won't just be a long winter, but a long season.David Richardson",
      "Even in 20 years time, Tomas Soucek will be scoring goals for West Ham in the Premier League. Probably.",
      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role. From his last 44 minutes on the pitch as a striker, the battering ram Czech has scored twice and played a huge role in another goal. You just can't keep him down.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton’s midfield set the tone from the first whistle, with Idrissa Gana Gueye driving the team forward and capping a dominant first half with the opener. His energy and control allowed the Toffees to dictate the tempo and keep Fulham penned in for long spells.",
      "Michael Keane’s late header sealed the points and reflected Everton’s growing confidence under David Moyes. The defender looked assured at the back and dangerous from set-pieces, delivering one of his most complete performances of the season.",
      "For Everton, this felt like a statement of control and composure, a reminder of their growing maturity under Moyes.",
      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",

      "Ruben Amorim was downbeat after Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Man Utd at Spurs and extended their unbeaten run in the league to five games, their longest under him, after throwing away another lead and seeing Benjamin Sesko forced off with a knee injury",
      "Saturday 8 November 2025 22:53, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his team \"have a lot of problems\" as he delivered a reality check after the 2-2 draw at Tottenham.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a point for United to extend their unbeaten league run to five games, their longest under the Portuguese, but Amorim was frustrated to see his side repeat the mistakes of last Saturday's draw at Nottingham Forest.",
      "United led for nearly an hour through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header, but late goals from Spurs substitute Mathys Tel and Richarlison, seven minutes apart, turned the game before De Ligt rescued a draw with his side a player down after Benjamin Sesko's injury.",
      "Amorim said United, who would have gone second had they held on to win, struggled to cope when he took Casemiro and Harry Maguire off with less than 20 minutes to go as he struck a downbeat tone ahead of the international break.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",
      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
