      "Manchester United have given Napoli the green light to sign Rasmus Hojlund on a permanent deal in January. Napoli signed the United flop on a season-long loan in the summer.",
      "But the Italian champions have been so impressed with the striker, they are keen to take up the option and are in talks with United to bring forward the £38m deal. And with United keen to off-load the Danish forward as soon as possible, the English giants will look to conclude negotiations with Napoli in the coming weeks.",
      "Napoli want to exercise their obligation to buy Hojlund, and talks are believed to be at an advanced stage. Hojlund became a laughing stock at Old Trafford after nothing up a dismal scoring record.",
      "Despite costing United £72m from Atalanta, he managed just 14 goals in 62 league appearances.",
      "United bosses were so disappointed with Hojlund, they decided to shell out another £66.3m on Benjamin Sesko this summer. But Hojlund has notched four goals in six appearances for Napoli, to leave boss Antonio Conte impressed.",
      "Hojlund has missed Napoli's last three games due to being injured. But he is said to be loving life on the Amalfi coast, and has no intention of ever returning to United.",
      "Getting a deal done sooner rather than later will be music to the ears of the Old Trafford hierarchy, particularly after last season's Jadon Sancho debacle.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford's debut in El Clasico ended in disappointment as Barcelona fell to defeat against Real Madrid. Jude Bellingham and Kylian Mbappe found the net to seal a 2-1 victory for Los Blancos on Sunday, opening up a five-point advantage at the summit of La Liga.",
      "A second loss in three league matches has left Barca trailing in second spot. But it wasn't entirely doom and gloom for Manchester United loanee Rashford, who was handed a start and played a crucial role in setting up the visitors' sole strike.",
      "It was Rashford's clever movement down the left flank of Real's penalty area and subsequent pass that allowed Fermin Lopez to level matters in the 38th minute. That represented the England international's finest moment before he was shifted to a central attacking role following Ferran Torres' substitution.",
      "Despite the deflating outcome, Rashford earned plaudits from sections of the Spanish press following his display. And his maiden outing in one of football's most prestigious encounters could have gone considerably worse looking back.",
      "\"The Englishman had a good performance in his first Clasico,\" read Rashford's match performance review in AS. \"He set up Fermin to equalize and worked hard in the pressing.\"",
      "Barcelona entered Sunday's clash without a host of crucial players. Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha, Gavi and Dani Olmo were all missing from the attack and midfield alone.",
      "Nevertheless, Sport offered a glowing assessment of Rashford's chances before his maiden Clasico appearance. The Catalan publication praised his stint so far, declaring the Red Devils exile is \"living the dream\" since arriving at the Camp Nou on a season-long loan.",
      "\"So much so that in the most-watched match on the planet, in the sporting event that generates the most passion and impact, he'll be a starter,\" read the report. \"Rashford will have a starring role in a true Clasico. When the ball is kicked off, he'll be one of the surprise guests at the table for LaLiga's most important match.",
      "\"Predictably, with Ferran back in the starting lineup, he'll play on the left wing. A golden opportunity for the British icon to continue showing the world that he's back and on the right path.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo proved far more critical of his display and branded the performance \"baffling.\" And an assist wasn't enough to see more upside in his contribution.",
      "\"His smart assist to Fermin...didn't fix a match in which he seemed capable of creating more danger than he did when he received the ball,\" it read. \"He didn't make the most of his power when he had space. As a No. 9, he was worse than as a winger.\"",
      "Parts of that critique might appear harsh given Rashford's contribution exceeded that of most team-mates. Yet Ruben Amorim will undoubtedly focus on the positives after Rashford scored twice in a Champions League win over Olympiacos just days prior.",

      "Micah Richards and Alan Shearer have heaped praise on Manchester United forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha following Saturday's 4-2 win over Brighton. United have now recorded three successive victories for the first time under Ruben Amorim, following their previous wins over Sunderland and Liverpool.",
      "United raced into a 2-0 lead against the Seagulls on Saturday evening thanks to Matheus Cunha's first goal for the club and Casemiro's deflected strike. Mbeumo scored his third goal for the club since his summer move from Brentford in the second-half with an excellent finish past Bart Verbruggen.",
      "Danny Welbeck's free-kick and Charalampos Kostoulas' header made it a nervy finish at Old Trafford. However, Mbeumo was on the scoresheet once again to round off another impressive afternoon for Amorim.",
      "Since losing 3-1 to Brentford at the end of September, United have now earned maximum points in their last three games and appear to be finally clicking in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. Mbeumo and Cunha, who cost over £120million between them in the summer, have both been key to the turnaround in United's attack.",
      "Speaking on the latest edition of the 'Rest is Football' podcast, Shearer and Richards have credited the duo for their influence on United. \"You've got to give big credit to Man United,\" Shearer said.",
      "\"After their result last weekend, you can imagine if you win at Liverpool and then you don't win at home, you know what the scenario is and what everyone would be saying. [It's a] big win for them.",
      "\"Mbeumo getting a couple of goals. [They were] under pressure in the last few minutes, but then he gets that goal and it's all over. That result, along with the run they're on, will give everyone confidence and a huge belief that his system can work.",
      "\"Let's see, good result, but let's see in the next month or so. Going forward, you've got to say well done to them.",
      "Richards added: \"What Man United have been crying out for is, if you're going to play that system, to be brave. Luke Shaw was very brave in the way he stopped in and they go and get the goal.",
      "\"If you look at the positioning of Cunha, he was filling in that midfield role. The system can work, I just don't think they played it in the right way, or have the players to do that. This is the first time I've been convinced that they know what their roles are.",
      "\"I agree with Alan now, the challenge now is consistency. Mbeumo, you give him time and space, he's going to hurt you and he played really well.\"",
      "Lineker followed that with praise for Cunha, who had previously failed to score for United. \"He's really good Mbeumo,\" Lineker added.",
      "\"I mean he's also, I suppose, the question mark again, someone that's done consistently well at a club like Brentford with all due respect, is to then jump to one of the giants in world football and be able to handle it.",
      "\"Clearly he can. It's not phased him in the slightest. I would say the same for Cunha. Obviously, he's got the experience of Atletico Madrid, which you know, is obviously one of the big boys in Spain, but Manchester United is a little different.\"",
      "Shearer interjected: \"And they've gone there at the most difficult time as well, haven't they? I mean, it's not as if they're going into a football club that's flowing and winning games and all of that.",
      "\"They've gone into a really turbulent club that has had a really tough time and it's toughest time to go in there and perform. He's done really well.\"",

      "He has featured regularly on the left side of Amorim's defence to begin the season and was a standout performer in the win against Liverpool last weekend, helping deal with their bitter rivals' attacking threat well. But he suffered last week with illness and had to be withdrawn after 65 minutes against Brighton, Amorim making the decision to replace him at a point where the game appeared won.",

      "Marcus Rashford's latest impact for Barcelona against Real Madrid on Sunday should serve as a stark reminder to Ruben Amorim of the talent he's missing at Manchester United. The homegrown Red Devils star made the move to Catalonia on a season-long loan this summer, after finding himself sidelined at Old Trafford following Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "Rashford was left out of the Portuguese manager's plans and spent the latter part of last season on loan at Aston Villa as a result. Upon his return from the Midlands, and still not in Amorim's plans, the 27-year-old was eager to secure another move away from United - be it temporary or permanent.",
      "His wish was fulfilled when Barcelona swooped in to secure him on a year-long loan with an option to buy, and it's fair to say that Rashford has flourished with the Catalan giants since.",
      "The striker has already netted five goals in 12 appearances across all competitions, and chalked up his seventh assist of the season against Real Madrid in El Clasico on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Trailing by a goal due to Kylian Mbappe's early effort, Alejandro Balde collected the ball on the edge of Madrid's box 38 minutes in before breaking through the backline to find Rashford.",
      "The Englishman, showing great sportsmanship, passed the ball to Fermin Lopez who blasted it past a helpless Thibaut Courtois.",
      "Barcelona's lead was short-lived as Jude Bellingham equalised just before half-time, resulting in a 2-1 victory for the home side.",
      "Rashford's impressive performance this season should serve as a wake-up call to Amorim that he may have let one of United's brightest stars slip away early in his tenure.",
      "This could be a bargain for Barca if they decide to take up the option, especially considering Rashford's market value is likely to increase if he continues to shine in La Liga and the Champions League.",
      "Despite missing one of their most gifted academy graduates, Manchester United are faring well. The club are currently on a three-match winning streak, thanks to victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and, most recently, Brighton.",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy has been brutally put down by former Leicester City striker Odsonne Edouard. The Manchester United icon was in charge of the forward during his ill-fated spell with the Foxes.",
      "Van Nistelrooy took over from Steve Cooper at the King Power Stadium last November, but won just five of his 27 Premier League matches in charge. Leicester ultimately finished 10 points adrift of safety and became the first top-flight club in history to go nine games without scoring at home.",
      "Unsurprisingly, the spell did not convince many of his managerial merits. Edouard, who was on loan at Leicester last season from Crystal Palace, was not impressed by the Dutchman.",
      "The former Paris Saint-Germain and Celtic striker played six matches under Cooper before being completely cast aside by Van Nistelrooy. Edouard made the bench just once under the ex-PSV Eindhoven boss.",
      "After finding his form with Lens this season, Edouard reckons Van Nistelrooy was not a 'great coach'. The Frenchman has three goals in six Ligue 1 outings this term.",
      "\"Being a great striker doesn't necessarily mean being a great coach,\" Edouard told L'Equipe. \"After training, I would do an even harder session with my fitness coach. I didn't give up.",
      "\"Leicester, it had a professional impact on me. I don't really have any reasons.",
      "\"At the beginning, I played a little [under Steve Cooper], then things didn't work out with Van Nistelrooy.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"I didn’t get along well with Van Nistelrooy. I found myself blocked for seven months without playing.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy is still without a job, having left Leicester in the summer. The Foxes handed the former Manchester United star a stay of execution to avoid a negative impact on their profit and sustainability standing.",
      "“I would like to personally thank the Leicester City players, coaches, academy and all the staff I have worked with for their professionalism and dedication during my time at the Club and to thank the fans for their support, and take this opportunity to wish the Club well for the future,\" Van Nistelrooy said upon his exit.",
      "The Dutch coach's exit was confirmed just days before Leicester returned for pre-season, despite a decision being made on his future after relegation.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has previously joked that he has to be careful with his words in the Manchester United legends' group chat because of 'Rio [Ferdinand] the journalist'. Ferdinand and Ronaldo were team-mates at United from 2003 to 2009, a period which is considered one of the most successful in the club's history.",
      "Both players arrived as promising talents and evolved into world-class stars. Together, they clinched three Premier League titles and the Champions League, and their camaraderie has endured after Ferdinand's retirement and Ronaldo's move to Saudi Arabia. They even sat down for an interview together last year.",
      "The duo also continue to stay connected through a United WhatsApp group, named 'Band of Brothers', which includes players from the 2008 Champions League-winning squad. Former defender Patrice Evra once described the group as 'really active'.",
      "However, Ronaldo has started to exercise caution with his comments due to Ferdinand's thriving YouTube channel and podcast, Rio Ferdinand Presents. The platform features interviews with top current and former players, leading the Al-Nassr star to joke that he needs to be more careful with what he shares.",
      "In a recent interview with The Times, Ferdinand said while laughing: \"It's funny because Cristiano [Ronaldo] calls me a journalist now. He messaged me saying, 'Now I can't say too much in the United WhatsApp group, Rio's in there. Rio the journalist!'\"",
      "Ferdinand recently enjoyed conversations with former England team-mates Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen on his YouTube channel. Before that, he chatted with past and present United stars, including Wayne Rooney, Harry Maguire, Nemanja Vidic and Evra, several of whom are in the previously mentioned group chat.",
      "The 46-year-old once shed light on what the legends discuss, saying they use it to critique the current squad and share jokes just like they did in the changing room. He even joked that Evra \"regularly leaves\" because he \"gets bullied in there\".",
      "Evra himself revealed: \"We are lucky, the United group, we still have a WhatsApp group. Every morning we just laugh with each other. We have still got that.",
      "\"It is most of the players from 2008 when we won the Champions League. It is really active. Every two minutes.",
      "\"Rio created it. We just keep connected and have a laugh. It was not just a team, it was like a family.\"",
      "Stars like Dimitar Berbatov, Edwin van der Sar and Nani are also part of it, while former captain Vidic left after becoming annoyed with the volume of text notifications he was receiving.",
      "\"Vida [Vidic] came in for ten minutes then left,\" Ferdinand revealed. \"How long did you come in for? One day maybe? He didn't like the notifications, the messages coming through - a hundred messages.\"",
      "\"It's a metaphor for the dressing room so you should come back,\" Berbatov told Vidic. \"Change with time, you need to speak. (Laughing) In a way it's like me progressing and you regressing.\"",

      "Scott McTominay could return to the Premier League next year, having reportedly grown weary of his personal situation in Italy. McTominay left Manchester United to join Napoli last year and has enjoyed his time on the pitch but may cut short his time there after two seasons.",
      "The 28-year-old helped Napoli win Serie A last season and is a key player for Antonio Conte’s side, with 17 goals and seven assists in 46 appearances. He is loved by the fans in Naples after being named player of the year in Serie A.",
      "His £25.7million transfer has been hailed as a bargain and McTominay is now playing in a side which also features Kevin De Bruyne and United loanee Rasmus Hojlund. But after enjoying a stellar debut campaign, things have become a little more difficult in 2025/26, with Napoli’s fragilities shown by their 6-2 thrashing by PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League in mid-week.",
      "McTominay scored both of Napoli’s goals in that game and netted again in their 3-1 win over Inter Milan on Saturday to send his side back top of Serie A. Yet The Sun reports that everything isn’t as positive away from the pitch in southern Italy.",
      "The report states that McTominay has found the glare of the club’s passionate fanbase difficult to deal with. While he is happy living with his long-term girlfriend Cameron Reading, he reportedly is unhappy that he can’t go out and do normal things without being mobbed by fans in the one-club city.",
      "McTominay has four goals and one assist in 10 matches this season, with three of those strikes coming this week. He would no doubt be an attractive proposition for a Premier League side, although he is under contract with Napoli until June 2028 and would therefore command a high fee.",
      "Conte would unsurprisingly not want to lose one of his best players as they try to defend their title. McTominay’s goal in the win over Inter on Saturday underlined his importance as they went top of the table.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "“I live the game with my players, for good and bad, and we played against, in my view, the best squad in Italy,” Conte said post-match.",
      "“They dropped some points along the way, but their squad is on paper on a completely different level to all the others. They didn't get to the Champions League final twice in three years because of a fluke.”",
      "Napoli have several injuries to contend with, making their victory even more impressive. “Perhaps someone has cursed us, but we keep going anyway. Inter came here today aiming to, on a sporting level, kill us, as they were in great shape,” Conte added.",
      "“If you understand that moment of the campaign, you have to kill your opponent, but we had no intention of dying. Among all those problems, we put in a great performance.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United were left feeling hard done by after Danny Welbeck's free-kick, which led to Brighton's first goal, was taken at least five yards ahead of where the foul occurred.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were comfortably leading 3-0 when Brighton were given an opportunity to claw one back. In the 72nd minute, Patrick Dorgu was penalised for a tussle with Yankuba Minteh, who was through on goal but had taken a poor touch.",
      "Referee Anthony Taylor showed Dorgu a yellow card, and even after VAR reviewed the incident, it was decided that there was no need to upgrade the caution with the ball having already run through to Senne Lammens. While United supporters breathed a sigh of relief that the former Lecce player wasn't shown a red card, they were left incensed when the free-kick was taken well beyond the five-yard mark from where the foul took place.",
      "Video and photographic evidence clearly show that Dorgu fouled Minteh approximately 28 yards from the goal. However, Welbeck's subsequent free-kick was taken less than 23 yards from the posts.",
      "Despite the fact that the free-kick was taken further forward than it should have been, nothing can detract from Welbeck's superb strike. The former United striker expertly lofted his shot over the wall and past Senne Lammens.",
      "Brighton's Charalampos Kostoulas then managed to score another goal, sending shockwaves around Old Trafford. However, United held their nerve, scoring a fourth goal in stoppage time to secure a 4-2 victory.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo netted twice, with Matheus Cunha and Casemiro also scoring for the Reds as they secured their third consecutive Premier League victory for the first time since August 2024.",
      "Reflecting on his team's triumph over Brighton, Amorim shared after the match: \"I feel good. I think we played well but we suffered in the end, a little bit, our fault in the way we conceded the first goal.",
      "\"You can sense that, in that time of the game, we are near the fourth goal, not to suffer one. But they did everything. They run, they play with the ball, they kept the ball when it was needed. So it was a good game.",
      "\"You have the game under control and then you suffer a goal,\" Amorim continued. \"And then we suffer a little bit. They have a lot of talent. They have a lot of quality with the ball and they control that and they use that momentum to control the game. But we are improving in the way we respond to bad moments, and today, we did it again.",
      "\"We respond a little bit better and that's really important. We know how to suffer. If we suffer together, it's so much easier to win games.\"",

It will not surprise many that they have such ability after they scored 35 goals combined in the Premier League last season while at Wolves and Brentford, respectively.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo Jr is certainly on course to follow in his father's footsteps. The 15-year-old has been called up to the Portugal U16 squad as he continues his rise through the international youth ranks, much like his father did.",
      "Despite representing several of Portugal's youth ranks before making his senior debut in 2003, Ronaldo never played for the U16 side. His son now has the honour of doing so in the upcoming Football Federations Cup.",
      "The teenager, who plays in the academy of Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, was one of 22 players called up for the tournament, which is scheduled to take place in Antalya, Turkey, between October 30 and November 4.",
      "Cristiano Jr is still very much in the infancy of what could be a blossoming football career, but he can count on his father not putting undue pressure on him. The 40-year-old previously told former Manchester United colleague Rio Ferdinand: \"Right in this moment, Cristiano wants to be a football player but I don't make big pressure, I make a little. He has pressure already to be the son of Cristiano [senior].\"",
      "Aspects of the relationship between the father and son have been played out in front of the world, including sporting punishments the young Ronaldo has had to endure and the occasion when the silent treatment existed between the pair.",
      "Ronaldo has long showcased the gym workouts and football practice he'd do with his eldest son, and the Al-Nassr superstar does not let up, even when it comes to his own offspring.",
      "A master from the penalty spot, Ronaldo has looked to improve his son's skills from 12 yards and in a social media post from nine years ago, he told a then 5-year-old Ronaldo Jr: \"If you don't score, you have to do 10 push-ups,\" before giving his son three tries to score a penalty.",
      "After missing on his first attempt, he got closer when hitting the post on his second try and succeeded with his last spot-kick, which he buried. Despite scoring, Ronaldo still instructed his son to carry out the push-up punishment with Ronaldo Jr saying: \"But I scored,\" before being told: \"Do them [the push-ups] anyway. Come on, only 10.\"",
      "Among his many remarkable attributes that has seen Ronaldo enter the club of a select few players regarded among the greatest players in football history, his competitiveness is certainly up there.",
      "It was during a conversation with former team-mate and Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand on his UR Cristiano YouTube channel, that he revealed it's a characteristic that has been passed down to Cristiano Jr.",
      "Ronaldo admitted that his son shares his disdain of losing, as he detailed: \"I was in the Red Sea a couple of days ago, and I played paddle every day, me and Cristiano Jr., and we got mad,\" the 40-year-old said.",
      "He added: \"He won't speak with me for like, two days. This is why I'm happy. Even the small one, Mateo, they are at peace (when they are angry), but I like this, it shows they have personality.\"",
      "Cristiano Jr was born a year after his father left Manchester United for Real Madrid, but was able to witness the love the Red Devils fanbase retained for the Portuguese icon upon his return to Old Trafford in 2021.",
      "In what was a fairytale second debut season for Ronaldo, who scored 24 goals in 38 games, his second and final campaign was a disastrous one amid his breakdown in a relationship with then-manager Erik Ten Hag.",
      "Before his contract was terminated in November 2022, Ronaldo was banned from taking part in a match against Chelsea after his tantrum against Tottenham Hotspur. The striker refused to come on as a substitute in the final minutes against Spurs, before storming down the tunnel and out of the stadium before the full-time whistle.",
      "It was during his bombshell interview with Piers Morgan on Talk TV that Ronaldo opened up about how Cristiano Jr reacted upon learning the situation to suspend his father, admitting it left him feeling \"humiliated\".",
      "He told Morgan: \"I remember arriving home and Cristiano see me and say, ‘Daddy do you not go to the game?’ I say, ‘No, because the club punish me with three days’. And then he said, ‘How are they going to punish you if you are the best player in the world and you're not gonna play?’ I said, ‘No I'm not gonna play because I have not been behave’. And he look at me like, ‘My Daddy not behave, what?\"",

      "It's fair to say the Manchester United legend doesn't know the meaning of rest - and retirement is nowhere near the forefront of his mind. The all-time top scorer in football history, who now has 950 goals for club and country, remains determined to reach the 1,000-goal milestone and add to his 34 major trophies.",
      "Ronaldo is still delivering for Al Nassr, netting seven goals in eight games in all competitions so far this season. His sights remain firmly set on the 2026 World Cup - the one major honour still missing from his distinguished career.",
      "\"I want to keep playing for a few more years - not many, to be honest,\" he admitted earlier this month. \"I'm still producing good things, helping my club and my country. So why stop now?\"",
      "On a separate occasion, he described sleep and a regular routine as two of the most important 'tools' behind his success on the pitch.",
      "\"Sleep is the most important tool that I have,\" he said. \"To be consistent with the time that I go to bed and that I wake up.",
      "\"I mean, like example, I go to bed around 11-12 and I wake up around 8.30. It is my routine. It is the most important thing that we have probably in terms of health-span.\"",
      "Former United teammate Danny Simpson also believes the five-time Ballon D'Or winner's story is far from over, adding that two key targets continue to drive him to play well into his mid-40s.",
      "\"I don't think you can write him off,\" the former right-back told Goal. \"As long as he is scoring goals, as long as he doesn't get any injuries, then it wouldn't surprise me because it's him.",
      "\"I know he wants 1000 goals. And I think he wants to play with his son. Playing with your son, that's probably one of the biggest targets that you can go for once you have won everything.",
      "\"Sharing a pitch with your son must be some feeling. You look at those targets. He does set targets and you look at those - 1,000 goals and play with his son - does he do those and think 'right, I've done it all now?' I don't know where you go after that. He's just a phenomenal person, player. What he’s done for the game, it’s unbelievable.\"",
      "Ronaldo has spoken publicly about his dream to share the pitch with his eldest son, Cristianinho.",
      "\"I would like it, I would like it,\" he said. \"It's not something that keeps me up at night, but I would like it. We'll see. It's more in his hands than in mine. Let’s see if he has the hunger. The hunger is the most difficult.\"",

      "Bellingham, younger brother of England and Real Madrid superstar Jude, was a key part of Sunderland's promotion to the Premier League last season but elected to leave the Stadium of Light in the summer to join German giants Borussia Dortmund. He was hailed as one of BVB's marquee signings when he joined in a £25million deal in July.",
      "But where his elder brother thrived from the off at the Westfalenstadion, the younger Bellingham had made just two league starts before Saturday night's meeting with Koln, failed to score in his 11 appearances in total and has struggled to settle. Making matters worse are the growing tensions off the pitch between Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl and Bellingham's father, Mark.",
      "The pair clashed on the opening day of the Bundesliga season when Bellingham senior, a former non-league striker and retired police sergeant, took exception to his son being substituted at half-time by head coach Niko Kovac. The decision infuriated Mark, who waited in the tunnel after the final whistle to confront members of the club's hierarchy.",
      "The incident led to England World Cup legend Geoff Hurst labelling Bellingham senior a 'disgrace'.",
      "Speaking at an event in Bristol, where he admitted Jude is one of the two England stars he most admires - alongside current captain Harry Kane - Hurst said: \"A thing that has irritated me is a picture in one of the papers about the most powerful man in English football - and it's Jude Bellingham's father. He was complaining when his son was taken off in a game - and that is an absolute joke. If you don't eradicate that kind of thing, that is an absolute disgrace.\"",

Question marks still exist over the viablity of an attack-minded Fernandes and an ageing Casemiro as a midfield pair but Amorim's subtle tactical changes have helped solidfy the central areas.",

      "They're an attractive team right now, and the manager is doing a great job; the owner is doing well. It's an encouraging start for them. Bellingham might do well to come back to somewhere he's well received and get the confidence of playing Premier League football in a decent set-up.",

      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery has explained why Jadon Sancho was taken off after being brought on in the first half of their 1-0 Premier League win over Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "Sancho was called upon in the 29th minute when Emiliano Buendia came off with an injury. Villa had just gone ahead through Matty Cash's long-range effort before Emery was forced into a change.",
      "Since his late summer loan move from Manchester United, Sancho has seen limited game time. Prior to the win over City, he had just made one appearance in the Premier League, coming off the bench in the 1-1 draw against Sunderland.",
      "He did start in the Europa League defeat to Go Ahead Eagles last week after returning from illness, before being handed more league minutes on Sunday. However, he didn't last long at Villa Park and returned to the substitute bench in the 74th minute.",
      "Emery introduced Evann Guessand to help see out the victory, replacing Sancho. As he exited the pitch, the 25-year-old cut a disappointed figure, seeming to avoid Emery before sitting down in the dugout.",
      "After the match, Emery was questioned about Sancho's double substitution, and the Villa boss explained how the plan was always to give the United loanee limited minutes to build his match fitness.",
      "\"Yes, sure he's not happy, but I did it before with Morgan Rogers, with Emiliano Buendia, with Leon Bailey, and he played 60 minutes on Thursday,\" he explained.",
      "\"Today when he (Buendia) was injured, my plan was maybe in case he (Sancho) was going to play 30 minutes, but I decided to play more and he played 45 minutes. But my plan was when he was swapped with Emiliano Buendia, the idea was maybe not playing all the minutes until the last moment.",
      "\"I told him as well, he can feel it, it's embarrassing. Before Morgan, Emiliano Buendia and Leon Bailey, they felt the same when I subbed them, but it was not a punishment. And now it's not a punishment.\"",

      "Manchester United's summer interest in Carlos Baleba disappeared almost as suddenly as it appeared.",
      "United enquired about Baleba to bolster their midfield. When the Seagulls responded with a price tag of £100million, the Reds wisely pulled the plug and insisted they were happy to wait until next summer to re-evaluate the situation.",
      "That decision looks even smarter following the 4-2 victory over Brighton at the weekend. While Casemiro showed signs that there was still life in his career at United, Baleba suffered under the spotlight and was brought off on the hour mark, clearly frustrated.",
      "The Cameroonian could become an excellent player, we must remember he is only 21 and still has room for development. But a £100m player he is not, so with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at four players who could be targeted instead by United.",
      "The former Blackburn Rovers man is the name on everybody's lips at present thanks to his marvellous form for Crystal Palace. His adaptability in central midfield means there will be plenty wanting him in the summer.",
      "Oliver Glasner has already admitted that Marc Guehi is leaving the club at the end of the season, most likely to Liverpool, and the Austrian will be desperate to keep hold of Wharton or, at the very least, pick up a good transfer fee. United will be wary not to overspend on him.",
      "If Casemiro is to leave at the end of this season, United could do a lot worse than replacing him with his fellow countryman. Ederson is the kind of defensive midfielder who will work tirelessly for his teammates.",
      "He has played in a similar system to the one which Ruben Amorim favours so should settle in well. Ederson could also be a lot cheaper than Wharton with the Serie A player valued at just over £48m compared to the Palace man who may cost as much as the £100m mark currently on Baleba's head.",
      "If Amorim was to return to Lisbon to bring a player with him, Hjulmand could be the man to sign. The Dane may possess an Arsenal tattoo on his arm but that should not automatically rule him out.",
      "He was the captain for Amorim at Sporting and adding another leader to the camp would be no bad thing. His familiarity to the system is another bonus but Tottenham's reported interest in a January move could be an issue for the Reds.",
      "The 24-year-old is emerging as Germany's next star and is ready to fill the boots of Toni Kroos. He is highly rated, with Real Madrid believed to be interested in him.",
      "But if United are keen to return to the top, they should not be put off just because Xabi Alonso's side could be interested. Stiller would be able to launch direct attacks for United from deep, adding to their more direct style of play.",
      "He is also valued at £43.6m which is a steal and easily makes him the cheapest player on this list with Hjulmand believed to be worth just shy of £70m. With such affordability comes competition and United could be forced to pay more if they were to try to bring him to Old Trafford.",

      "However, Danny Welbeck's free kick and Charalampos Kostoulas' header in added time set up a nervy finish. But Mbeumo's second in front of the Stretford End ensured the victory.",
      "\"Our idea was the right one but it is about positioning, being on the right foot and having the right positioning towards the opponent. Finding the right teammate with the right man - that is something we lacked today so we are responsible for that defeat and we have to be honest to ourselves and we have to be better.\"",
      "Moments before Welbeck pulled one back for the visitors, Patrick Dorgu looked like he could be shown a straight red card when he brought down Yankuba Minteh when one-on-one with Senne Lammens. Referee Anthony Taylor brandished a yellow card and a VAR check ensured that decision stood.",
      "When quizzed about the call, Hurzeler added: \"No [Patrick Dorgu shouldn’t have got the red card]. They explained to me the rule so we have to accept the rule and that was not the reason why we lost.\"",

When Manchester United is there... and when we feel that this player wants to come here, no matter what, no matter what the position, no matter if it's Champions League or not, we also give everything to bring these kind of guys and that was the case.\"",

      "Aston Villa's loanee Jadon Sancho was brought on in the first half against Manchester City on Sunday, only to be taken off after just 45 minutes on the pitch.",
      "The winger came on for the injured Emi Buendia during the opening period, but was replaced by Evann Guessand 16 minutes from time as part of a double substitution.",
      "Since his late summer loan move from Manchester United, Sancho has seen limited game time. Prior to facing City, he had made just one substitute appearance in the league, although he did start in the midweek Europa League defeat against Go Ahead Eagles.",
      "The 25-year-old recently returned from illness, with his game in the Netherlands marking his first since a period out. However, Unai Emery didn't seem particularly impressed with his performance against City, opting instead to bring on fellow summer signing Guessand to help close out the match.",
      "Sancho did have a chance at goal shortly before being substituted. He made a neat break from the left, forcing a save from Gianluigi Donnarumma, and his subsequent attempt was also thwarted by the City goalkeeper.",
      "Villa were leading 1-0 when Sancho came on, thanks to an early goal from Matty Cash. The score remained the same when the winger was substituted, as Villa sought to disrupt their rivals' title bid.",
      "A late loss to City towards the end of last season hampered Villa's Champions League qualification hopes, but Emery knew that a victory on Sunday could inflict a similar setback on Pep Guardiola's side.",
      "City believed they had salvaged a point late on when Erling Haaland bundled the ball over the line, but the strike was chalked off for offside in the build-up.",
      "When the six minutes of stoppage time elapsed, Cash's first-half effort proved sufficient for a home victory for Villa. Guardiola's side remained fourth in the standings when the final whistle sounded, but their position is precarious.",
      "Villa sit just one point adrift of them, whilst Tottenham had an opportunity to overtake City by defeating Everton in Sunday's late fixture.",
      "In September, Emery outlined his ambitions for Sancho. \"Yes, of course, this is my objective, to get him back to his best - and if he does that, then he'll come back to the national team,\" the Spaniard said.",
      "\"Every player wants to be part of the national team. When he was in Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic. And he played with the national team 25 matches, more or less.",
      "\"Of course, he's still young. He's still being hungry to show his capacity to play with his skills, his qualities, and hopefully we can exploit here, again, his best.\"",

      "Manchester United won 4-2 against Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday evening.",
      "Ruben Amorim secured the biggest win of his tenure against Liverpool at Anfield last weekend and he notched a third win on the bounce against the Seagulls.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and Bryan Mbeumo got on the scoresheet for United before Danny Welbeck scored from a free-kick to give Brighton hope of finding a way back into the game. Charalampos Kostoulas scored late on but Mbeumo's second settled the game.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Has been a breath of fresh air since making his debut against Sunderland. He made a few important saves again, including a stop to deny Yankuba Minteh when the advantage was two goals, but he should have saved Welbeck's free-kick. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Was recalled to the team due to Harry Maguire being absent with a knock. Had a few shaky moments in the first half, but recovered to deliver a decent performance. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Might be enjoying the best season of his career. He has been very good this season and the crowd cheered wildly when he made a crunching tackle in the second half. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Was brought off with a knock in the 64th minute. United fans will hope the injury is not too serious because Shaw has bounced back after a poor performance in the Manchester derby. 7",
      "Amad",
      "Was unplayable at times against Liverpool and looked sharp again down the right. Was denied a penalty in the first half. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Scored through a heavily deflected effort. The 33-year-old broke up play, made some important interceptions and looked good again. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His 300th appearance for the club. Made a genius turn on the stroke of half-time and set the tone from the centre of the pitch. Provided quality in the final 10 minutes when Brighton tried to get back into the contest. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Didn't contribute much going forward and was fine when he needed to defend. Dalot's best position is on the right, so he deserves credit for performing on the opposite side in the last week. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha were the best players on the pitch. He has hit the ground running since arriving from Brentford and deserved his two goals. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Had chances to score but just came up short. The Slovenian is starting to find his feet at Old Trafford. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "His first goal since signing from Wolves in the summer was worth the wait. He was excellent in the closing stages at Anfield and outlined his importance again with a superb display. 8",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Did well after replacing Shaw. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Looked slightly like he lacked match practice. 6",

      "\"I can sing, but not well,\" laughed Bruno Fernandes when he recalled his initiation after signing for Manchester United. \"We had a lot of Latin people, so I went for a Spanish song because I knew they would sing with me.\"",
      "Fernandes was signed from Sporting Lisbon for an initial £46.6million in January 2020. United felt they had sealed a bargain, but nobody could have imagined the impact he would make in Manchester.",
      "Fernandes has scored 100 goals, contributed 84 assists, won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year four times and he is set to make his 300th appearance against Brighton this weekend.",
      "The 31-year-old has given his prime years to United. Fernandes was prolific in his first season for the club and never looked back. \"I don't know why I did it, some people get more difficulties to do it,\" said Fernandes about his electric start to life at United five years ago.",
      "\"It's a huge club, huge league, the difference between this league and any other one in the world is massive, not in terms of quality, but also the intensity, the way the football is played, everything is very different.",
      "\"I don't know, I was just hungry enough to do everything, because for me, I've said this many times, the first chance was the last one, so I had to make it. There was nothing else in my head other than making it in the Premier League, because it was my dream to play for this club for many years.\"",
      "That dream almost came to an end in the summer when Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal made a huge financial offer to sign United's captain. Fernandes puffed his cheeks as he conceded their offer was \"very good\".",
      "He explained: \"I spoke with Cristiano [Ronaldo] about the situation, about Saudi and everything. I wouldn’t say what he told me, but we spoke about it. Obviously, he now has a manager who also spoke with me at the time (Jorge Jesus). He was at Al-Hilal three years ago.",
      "\"The first thing he said to me, ‘Are you too expensive for the club?’. I said, ‘There is no expensive players for that club!’. But I told him the same, I wasn’t eager to move, to go to Saudi Arabia, because I wanted to stay at the club. And he’s a manager I have a big relationship with.",
      "\"He was the one who trusted me to go to Sporting and to play in the biggest stages. But Cristiano told me, he had his opinion on what I should do. It was important for me.",
      "\"Obviously, with all the experience he has and everything, it was important for me to hear what he thought. But obviously, the decision will always come to me and to the club.\"",
      "Fernandes laughed as he agreed that the opinion of someone even closer to him, his wife, Ana Pinho, mattered more than Ronaldo's thoughts.",
      "\"It was very important because it was obviously the first question when I spoke to her,\" he said.",
      "\"I said, look, we have this offer from Saudi. This is because I've never spoke about this is an offer from me. We always speak in the big family. We always say we have an offer from Saudi because obviously wherever I have to go, they have to come. They can choose not, but I'd prefer them to come.",
      "\"And obviously, the first thing she said was, 'Have you achieved everything you wanted to achieve at the club?'. Because she knows I haven't. And when I talk about I haven't fulfilled my dreams at the club, it comes a lot from what she said to me. But if I don't try it, that's for sure I won't make it.\"",
      "Fernandes was asked whether the door to Saudi Arabia was now closed. He responded: \"I don’t know. At the moment, no one spoke with me about anything. As I said last time, I will even say to you, if someone told me, like, ‘In the summer, look, we’ll come again.’ No one told that to me. I don’t think they [Al-Hilal] were very happy for me to reject the offer, obviously. I accept that.\"",
      "He outlined that he was happy at United and would not entertain discussions about his future until after the World Cup. \"We're very happy to be here,\" he said about his family life.",
      "Fernandes arrived to speak with Manchester-based correspondents shortly before 9am on Friday morning, and there was a spring in his step after winning against Liverpool.",
      "\"It was good, obviously, very positive,\" he said about this week's training sessions. \"Ten years to now, we didn't have a good result there, not a good result, but a win, so it was very positive.\"",
      "Fernandes captained United to their first win at Anfield since 2016. He was given the armband two years ago and is seen as the ultimate standard-setter in the dressing room. Fernandes even watched the first team train in the rain when he was given additional time off last week.",
      "He already knows the names of academy players when they are promoted to senior training, and offered to pay for staff to attend the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "The Portugal international is a modern club legend. \"I just try to do things in a way that I can help the team and help the club to be closer to succeeding,\" he reflected.",
      "\"I haven't been much able to give the success that this club wants and deserves, and also the success that I wanted in my head to get when I signed for United, because when I came to the club that was my aim. I knew I was coming for a big club that played for big targets.",
      "\"And that's why I wanted this challenge. I've been lucky enough to do well, but as I always say, I haven't done well enough because I haven't achieved what I want.",
      "\"Every season I come back, I always have the belief that we can achieve something because you can have a very bad season, then you come back, you start the pre-season, you see the mood, because obviously the pre-season the mood is always very soft and very happy.",
      "\"There are tough training sessions and everything. But you always start to see certain things, like this season we might achieve what we want, but obviously, we know there is much more behind that.",
      "\"Everyone knows my aim is to win the Premier League and the Champions League with the club. If I'm going to do it or not, I'm not going to be able to tell you.",
      "\"Because if I were able to tell you, I would be very happy at this moment that I know that I'm going to win in some moment in these three years, [that] I'm going to win either the Premier League or the Champions League, but I can't tell that. If that's my aim and also the aim for the club, as they say, that's the truth.\"",
      "United's victory against Newcastle in the 2023 Carabao Cup final provided Fernandes with his first trophy at the club, but he considers the FA Cup triumph against Manchester City as an even sweeter success.",
      "When asked which trophy meant more, Fernandes said: \"The Carabao Cup is very special because it's the first one, but I think the FA Cup, not because it was against City, but because it's much bigger in England for the fans, for the football, it's the first domestic cup in the world.",
      "\"So it's a big pleasure for us. I had my brother living here before I came, so I knew already about history, about going to Wembley and all these things. I had the chance to go to Wembley in the semi-final against Chelsea, where we lost, but obviously with the empty stadium.",
      "\"I didn't feel the exact mood of the Wembley day. It was very special, obviously, because I know how much it means to the FA Cup, for the fans, for the club and for the country also.\"",
      "Fernandes has been fixated on winning the Premier League. United have gone through ups and downs since his arrival, and he advised decision-makers in the summer to sign players with personalities.",
      "He explained: \"Every time I spoke with anyone who was talking with me, they were asking we need to sign good players and everything else. We need to sign big characters, not good players because at this club, being good players sometimes is not enough because of the pressure, because of the attention we get and everything.",
      "\"I think we brought in players [in the summer] that are very aware of the dimension of the club. You spoke about [Matheus] Cunha. Cunha has that good arrogance to do the good things and the right things, so that's something good.",
      "\"Bryan [Mbeumo], also the same. He's not afraid to take the ball, to do his play, to do his things. We brought two players who were aware of the Premier League. And then we brought a very young goalkeeper [Senne Lammens] and a centre-forward [Benjamin Sesko], and they hit the ground running.",
      "\"Obviously, we know that Ben will be judged by scoring goals or not. But a part of that, he's been doing great, whatever he's being asked to do. He's got his goals already, and I think now it's going to come more and more because he's more than capable of scoring goals.\"",
      "Fernandes continued: \"Senne came probably with the intention of being the number one. He had to wait for his moment. The moment came and he was ready for that. So this is what this club is about. You come, the moment will be there straightaway and you have to take it.",
      "\"I think these four players were very good in taking that opportunity of ‘I want to be the one that is playing every week’. When we speak about Cunha, the thing of having the arrogance to say ‘give me the ball, I want to play, I want to make things’.",
      "\"With time, sometimes it won't be good for people because I've been through that. He always wants the ball, he's always doing this, he's always doing that. But for us, on the inside, we want this Cunha. We want you to take the risks, to shoot, to take people on, to create.",
      "\"Bryan, the same. Bryan, just get your shots on. Sometimes I get upset with him in training because he's like, one touch more, one touch more and everything. I say, ‘Bryan, you don't need that. You can one touch and shoot because you're more than able to do that. You did that against us when you were at Brentford!",
      "\"You just have to make it for us now. The shirts have changed, but you're the same player so we need that from you. Ben is very eager to learn and that's very good from someone that has done very well in the Bundesliga and everything, came with the biggest, probably like the price tag and everything.",
      "\"But in his mind, he's like, 'I want to learn, I want to become better'. Then on the weekends, he transforms himself into a different person on the pitch. He's someone that is like, ‘I know what I have to do. I want to score goals. I'm going to get into the box, I'm going to get into duels. I'm going to win my headers’. And that's very important for us.\"",
      "It was typical of Fernandes that he spent time praising United's new arrivals during an interview organised to mark his 300th appearance for the club - that is the type of person he is.",
      "Fernandes also demonstrated his humour when he was asked about Ruben Amorim jokingly telling Sir Jim Ratcliffe to 'f*** off'. \"I don't know about that,\" he said. \"I haven't said that to Sir Jim yet!",
      "\"When he comes along to the training ground, we always see him. We talk a little bit with him, but he doesn't get much involved in technical things with us. Obviously, I don't think we'll be able to do that as we're not able to do the work he does. But we have a good connection with him.",
      "\"Every player, I think, every time he comes, he tries to see everyone, talk to everyone. More or less, that's it. Obviously, he has Omar [Berrada] and Jason [Wilcox] who are more close to us to get the message through back and forwards. I think that's the normal relationship in a football club.\"",
      "Fernandes' contract expires in the summer of 2027, and there is an option for an extension. \"Yes,\" he answered about whether his time at United has been successful. \"Because when I came to the club, as you said, it was a dream. So to fulfil that dream is success. To be playing football is success.",
      "\"I wanted to play football, but I never dreamed... Not dream, I dreamed, but I was never very sure that I would reach the level I reached. I just wanted to play football.",
      "\"I didn't have a level on my head of how high I wanted to be. I just wanted to be happy doing what I do, because there's not much I can do apart from football. So I would say yes. Obviously, I wouldn't have every trophy in the cabinet that I wanted, but it would still be a success for me.\"",
      "Fernandes admitted he could explore a career in coaching when he eventually retires, but he still has more to give for United. \"I have to run much more than I do anything else,\" he said about maintaining his level.",
      "\"In football nowadays, you have to be able to run. At the high level now, there's so much difference to when I started playing, I had players who played with me that could run 6-7km a game and would be top still.",
      "\"Nowadays, if you run less than 9-10km, I would say you're really down on your numbers already. Obviously, I'm lucky enough to be very able of running and to deal with the demands of the manager, of the league and everything. I can't tell how long I will be able of doing it, but I've never had problems with this side of the game.",
      "\"But obviously, it's not just that. The competition when it comes to the club, I want to have the best competitions to play in my position. For example, as the manager said, I don't think Kobbie [Mainoo] is a competition at the same time, because I think Kobbie is very capable of doing what I can do in a different way.",
      "\"Because obviously, if you look at the numbers, Bruno is more capable of scoring goals, probably Kobbie is more capable of taking on people. We're different as players, but we still can give very good things to the team in a different way. So, I like the competition and the fact of having Kobbie that is very young, but very capable of playing high-level football, because he makes me improve, he makes me be a better player.\"",
      "Fernandes was pictured with a 300th appearance shirt at Carrington shortly after the interview. \"I framed all the shirts from the first game of every club I played,\" he explained.",
      "\"And then I have the special ones, like if I win a cup or win a trophy. For example, with the club, the first time I was captain, we played with the black and white kit in PSG away.",
      "\"So I've kept that one and the armband too. So it's small things, but it's what I'm going to keep from the future. For the future, when I look back, obviously you can go on YouTube and stuff like that, but I would like to keep my own memorable stuff for my kids in the future to look at.\"",

      "Darren Fletcher must burst with pride when he watches his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, play in the academy.",
      "The 41-year-old was in attendance at Oakwell Stadium and had a perfect view of Jack's goal.",
      "Chido Obi brilliantly won the ball from Vimal Yoganathan just outside the Barnsley penalty area, and Jack Fletcher pounced to finish into the right corner thanks to a slight deflection.",
      "Fletcher scored an instinctive volley from 35 yards that dipped under the crossbar when he last played at Oakwell Stadium in 2024. His deflected goal may not have been as impressive, but they all count.",
      "Manchester United signed the Fletcher twins for £1.25million from Manchester City in the summer of 2023. The pair opted to move to United and are now pushing towards being involved with the first team.",
      "United use the EFL trophy to give 'elite young players' the platform to perform in a more pressured environment which prepares them for the first team.",
      "Travis Binnion named an Under-21 team that included players on the cusp of the first team against Barnsley, with Chido Obi, Shea Lacey, Tyler Fredricson and Diego Leon all starting.",
      "Leon made his international debut for Paraguay during the international break. He said it was an \"unforgettable night\" but he was back down to earth starting in South Yorkshire a week later.",
      "In August, there was a sense of frustration among academy staff that Leon had exclusively worked with the first team when he could have benefited from getting minutes in his legs during youth matches.",
      "Leon made his first appearance for the academy in a friendly shortly afterwards. The 18-year-old is still very raw and needs time to adapt to English football after his summer window arrival from Cerro Porteno.",
      "The Paraguay international struggled for the U21s against Liverpool and looked better against Barnsley, although he still has lots to learn, which was highlighted when he attempted to make an adventurous run through the middle of the pitch, only to be dispossessed in a dangerous area.",
      "Binnion shook his head on the touchline. United signed Leon for £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, because scouts believed he possesses first team potential, but he still needs to develop his game.",
      "The U21 boss cut a frustrated figure again just before the interval when Barnsley were awarded a penalty after a foul from Dan Armer. Veteran striker David McGoldrick made no mistake from the spot.",
      "Stephen Torpey sat alongside Jason Wilcox. The pair recently sat together at Old Trafford following Torpey's appointment as head of the academy (succeeding Nick Cox).",
      "Torpey and Wilcox returned to the warmth during half-time while Darren Fletcher passed on tactical feedback to an analyst. Fletcher is the Under-18 manager, but had clearly spotted something.",
      "It didn't take long for Barnsley to take the lead when play resumed. McGoldrick, 37, rolled back the years when finishing beyond Will Murdock again, although Obi produced an immediate response at the other end.",
      "Lacey intelligently won the ball on the halfway line and slipped through a perfectly weighted pass to Obi, who found the net with a classy finish. \"Chido, Chido, Chido,\" sang the small section of United fans.",
      "However, former Ipswich Town, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest striker McGoldrick wasn't done there and netted his hat-trick. Then Jack Fletcher was shown a red card in a bizarre incident with the referee.",
      "It seemed Fletcher received his marching orders for dissent. Perhaps a strange decision, but his father might argue that there is a lesson to learn: you must control emotions on a football pitch.",
      "Barnsley smelt blood after the sending off and scored another two goals to claim a 5-2 victory. Wilcox had seen enough with seven minutes remaining, but Torpey remained in the stands to see the game out.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo is apparently wary of what he says in the Manchester United legends’ group chat now because of ‘Rio [Ferdinand] the journalist’.",
      "Ferdinand and Ronaldo shared the Red Devils dressing room from 2003 to 2009 during arguably the most successful period in the club’s history. Both initially arrived as talented youngsters before transforming into world-class star players.",
      "They won three Premier League titles and the Champions League playing alongside each other, and their bond has remained strong even since Ferdinand’s retirement and the Portuguese’s move to Saudi Arabia, having sat down with each other for an interview last year.",
      "The pair also remain in close contact through a United WhatsApp group - named ‘Band of Brothers’ - that includes players from the 2008 Champions League-winning era, with ex-defender Patrice Evra calling it 'really active'.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, Ferdinand’s recent success with his YouTube channel and podcast, Rio Ferdinand Presents, which includes the ex-England international interviewing top current and former players, has led Ronaldo to joke that he has to be more careful about what he says in front of him.",
      "Ferdinand said while laughing in an interview with The Times: “It’s funny because Cristiano [Ronaldo] calls me a journalist now. He messaged me saying, ‘Now I can’t say too much in the United WhatsApp group, Rio’s in there. Rio the journalist!’”",
      "Ferdinand recently sat down for bombshell discussions with former England team-mates Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen on the platform. Prior to that, he interviewed past and present United stars like Wayne Rooney, Harry Maguire, Nemanja Vidic and Evra, several of whom are in the aforementioned group chat.",
      "The 46-year-old once provided an insight into what the icons speak about, saying they use it to critique the current team and joke around as they did in the dressing room. He even joked that Evra “regularly leaves” because he “gets bullied in there”.",
      "Evra himself said: “We are lucky, the United group, we still have a WhatsApp group. Every morning we just laugh with each other. We have still got that.",
      "“It is most of the players from 2008 when we won the Champions League. It is really active. Every two minutes.",
      "“Rio created it. We just keep connected and have a laugh. It was not just a team, it was like a family.”",
      "The likes of Dimitar Berbatov, Edwin van der Sar and Nani are also involved, while former captain Vidic left after growing frustrated with the number of text notifications he was receiving.",
      "“Vida [Vidic] came in for ten minutes then left,” Ferdinand said. “How long did you come in for? One day maybe? He didn't like the notifications, the messages coming through - a hundred messages.”",
      "“It's a metaphor for the dressing room so you should come back,” Berbatov told Vidic. “Change with time, you need to speak. (Laughing) In a way it's like me progressing and you regressing.”",

      "Wayne Rooney finds himself unable to attend his son Kai's matches for Manchester United's academy due to the overwhelming attention his celebrity status attracts. The 15-year-old is the eldest of four boys shared by Rooney and his wife Coleen, alongside younger brothers Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai, who plays as a striker much like his iconic father, became part of the Red Devils' academy setup in 2016, treading the same path as Rooney Sr, who marks his 40th birthday today. Whilst the youngster still has considerable ground to cover on his route to professional football, he's considered a promising prospect within the Old Trafford ranks.",
      "Sadly for the former England skipper, he must observe his son's performances from afar after the emerging talent requested his father stay away from matches due to the overwhelming media circus that follows him.",
      "This heartbreaking situation came to light during Coleen's stint on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. The 39-year-old claimed second place in the hit reality programme behind McFly vocalist Danny Jones, and it was whilst in the jungle that she revealed the difficult choice her son had made.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen explained last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Whilst he might not be present on the sidelines during Kai's matches, he continues to play a significant part in his footballing development. Rooney has previously acknowledged that he generally leaves the coaching duties to the club's coaching staff, but ensures he offers guidance to his sons during practice sessions at home.",
      "During last month's instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he told Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Considering Kai's position as the offspring of one of England's most celebrated players, Rooney commended his psychological resilience in handling the additional scrutiny and expectations that accompany being his son.",
      "During the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim caught staff off guard when he smashed a TV monitor the last time Manchester United met Brighton.",
      "Back in January, the Red Devils lost 3-1 to the Seagulls, a defeat that infamously led Amorim to brand his team \"maybe the worst in the history\" of the club. Following that match, an enraged Amorim tore into his squad inside the dressing room, blasting them for an uninspired and lethargic display.",
      "Amid the outburst, he reportedly shattered a screen used for tactical briefings. It was an unprecedented moment for the 40-year-old, who is usually known for keeping his post-match comments concise and controlled, regardless of the result.",
      "Normally, Amorim prefers to analyse games with his team the next day, once tempers have cooled, hence the surprise inside Old Trafford at his actions. The incident seemed to spark an immediate reaction, as United went on to win four of their next five fixtures across all competitions.",
      "Nevertheless, the campaign still ended in disappointment. Amorim's men finished 15th in the Premier League - the lowest placement in club history - and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, missing out on Champions League qualification.",
      "As they prepare for Saturday's meeting with Brighton, United's first since Amorim's TV-smashing episode, the mood inside the camp feels completely transformed. Last weekend's 2-1 triumph over Liverpool, clinched by a late Harry Maguire header, has temporarily lifted the mood around Old Trafford.",
      "It marked United's second straight Premier League win - Amorim's first time securing consecutive league victories. Another success against Brighton would make it three in a row for the first time since February 2024.",
      "That, however, will be no easy task given United's recent poor record against the south-coast side. They have lost six of their last eight clashes with Brighton, while Fabian Hurzeler's team completed a league double over them last season.",
      "Amorim will be eager to reverse that trend - not only to gain a bit of revenge, but also to preserve the rare sense of momentum growing at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite the improved results and better performances, Amorim's future is far from concrete. The former Sporting CP boss must find consistency if he hopes to keep his job, and he cannot afford to let this resurgence fade.",
      "Securing a result against Brighton is therefore crucial and could be the key difference between building lasting confidence or sending United spiralling back into another stretch of instability and doubt.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "Ruben Amorim has made no secret of his disappointment in the players who failed his predecessor, Erik ten Hag.",
      "It's nearly a year since Ten Hag was given his marching orders by Manchester United after a dismal start to the 2024/25 season. The Dutchman couldn't capitalise on the potential shown by winning both domestic cups, joining the lengthy list of managers to be ditched since Sir Alex Ferguson's glorious tenure ended in 2013.",
      "It was evident that Ten Hag had a strained relationship with several of his players, including some he had recruited himself. In the final stages of his reign, it came to light that the ex-Ajax boss felt particularly let down by three senior players: Marcus Rashford, Casemiro and Antony. He had previously coached the latter in the Netherlands before signing him for over £80million.",
      "Ten Hag believed the trio could have done more to secure the results that would have prolonged his time at Old Trafford. He was succeeded by Amorim, who has encountered similar challenges in extracting top performances from some of United's high-profile players.",
      "After taking the reins in November last year, he quickly fell out with Rashford, dropping him from his squad and then sanctioning his loan move to Aston Villa. Rashford secured another loan, to Barcelona, in the summer and is keen to make it permanent, cutting ties with his boyhood club once and for all.",
      "Antony was swiftly moved on after failing to make an impression on Amorim. After a loan spell at Real Betis during the second half of last season, the head coach approved his transfer to the La Liga side for around £22m, despite this resulting in a significant loss of £60m.",
      "Amorim was also open to parting ways with Casemiro, both in January and over the summer, but United were unable to offload the high-earning Brazilian.",
      "A £15m fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). With no club willing to stump up that kind of cash for a player in his 30s, he ended up staying put.",
      "Rather than merely seeing out the final season of his contract, Casemiro has proven to be one of Amorim's more dependable players this season, given the responsibility of protecting the back four and disrupting play.",
      "As he looks to build on the momentum of finally securing consecutive league victories, Amorim will need players like Casemiro to maintain their form. However, as Rashford, Antony and others have discovered, Amorim isn't afraid to sideline any player who refuses to buy into his methods.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has laughed off speculation that Man Utd could sign Aleksandar Pavlovic from Bayern Munich in the January transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils started off the season in similar fashion to an inconsistent 2024/25 campaign, which saw them finish 15th in Ruben Amorim’s first term at the club.",
      "However, Amorim – who has been under lots of pressure – seems like he could be turning it around at Old Trafford with Man Utd winning three matches in a row.",
      "Victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have the Red Devils looking up with Amorim’s side now sixth in the Premier League after nine games.",
      "And now Man Utd are turning their attention towards the next couple of transfer windows as they look to provide Amorim with further reinforcements after spending over £200m on five new players in the summer.",

      "READ: Liverpool in ‘transition season’ as VVD ‘declines into Lovren’; Man Utd ‘hope cannot be allowed to fester’",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “For Pavlovic, guys, I can guarantee to you that there is nothing, absolutely nothing ongoing. Pavlovic is a crucial player for Bayern, he’s more than happy at Bayern.",
      "“Bayern – and when I say Bayern it’s the board of directors, but also the most important people at Bayern like Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Uli Hoeness and all the others – they all see Pavlovic as one of the crucial faces of the project for present and future.",
      "“So there is nothing between Pavlovic and Manchester United. I don’t know where this news is coming from but Bayern will NOT sell Pavlovic. So forget about it.”",
      "Man Utd are looking to sign at least one midfielder in the next couple of transfer windows and Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller has been confirmed as a target by Romano.",
      "Romano said last week: “I’m always receiving many questions on Angelo Stiller. There was a report from Bild in the last few days on Man Utd tracking the player. Man Utd have always been following this player. Stiller is really appreciated internally at Man Utd.",
      "“Last summer, we had some stories on Man Utd going on a mission to Germany, negotiating to sign Stiller as a surprise for the final weeks. No, Man Utd never started any negotiations for Stiller in August last summer. That was never a possibility, it was always impossible.",
      "“Stiller was always going to stay at Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, especially in August. There was no chance to change the story in the final days of the window.",
      "“But Stiller remains a player monitored by Man Utd. They are following him. They are closely monitoring his progress.”",
      "Antoine Semenyo is one of the most in-form players in the Premier League this season and the Daily Telegraph has now revealed that Bournemouth ‘rejected £50m offers’ from Man Utd and Tottenham over the summer.",
      "The report adds: ‘It made it easy for them to reject the overtures of United and Tottenham, with Semenyo buying into the idea and agreeing a new contract – with a pay rise – and, crucially, a release clause that his agent is able to tell other clubs about but which is not being made public.",
      "‘Semenyo has been in outstanding form with only Erling Haaland outscoring him. If he carries on like this, the 25-year-old Ghana international will not only be sold for far more than was offered but will also earn twice as much money as was proposed last summer by United and Spurs.’",

      "Arsenal are running away with it on a tide of relentless competence, while the silliness literally everywhere else sees Tottenham third despite having four points from four games at home, Bournemouth second despite selling all of their defenders in the summer, and newly promoted Sunderland sat looking down on four of the Big Six a quarter of the way through the season, just like everyone predicted.",
      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, leaving Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner and Nuno Espirito Santo in clear and present danger of losing his second job of the season.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a five-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. It will very much do, and importantly provides a significant buffer for Le Bris and his team as they continue a tough little run of games.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 18 Premier League games in the last 11 months, and just one from four very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Currently four points outside a largely daft top six, and that won’t do, no matter what the mitigation.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland sees awkward questions resurfacing, though, ahead of what feels a particularly significant trip to Spurs at the weekend.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "In truth, we can’t quite understand why he’s only mid-table here. Feels like he should be out there with Arteta. It would only make sense for him to be here if a big job were currently available, and not even Forest is available for the next six weeks or so.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But it’s now been four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but that’s still significant progress on where they were a month ago when it felt far more certain. And not in a good way.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of last season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City perhaps remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has just engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "With Forest and Spurs up next there is real scope for this to become a decent little run. That lad off the internet might even be able to get his hair cut in a couple of weeks. Amorim, meanwhile, knows ‘a couple of weeks’ is no longer the amount of time he possibly has left in the job. Everybody’s happy.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re approaching a quarter of the way through this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s trio managed.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis has reached full-blown levels, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Have got to pull out of this tailspin soon, or something truly extraordinary really could happen here to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season. And there is nothing obviously helpful on the immediate horizon with Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Man City to come before an interlull Slot genuinely yet ludicrously might not survive.",
      "",
      "Fulham have hit a serious rough patch just as Silva was starting to be talked about for other jobs. Might be coincidence, might not, but the timing wasn’t great. A last-gasp defeat at Newcastle means it’s now four straight defeats, which is only keeping the Cottagers clear of the bottom three because those three teams are all currently just unspeakably awful.",
      "Still feels very much to us like Fulham and Silva are both better with each other than without, and would advise against anything hasty. Does need some points from somewhere soon, though. The good news? Wolves next.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eases the stress significantly.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth ahead of an upcoming run that includes a resurgent Manchester United, Liverpool and a six-pointer against Leeds means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, we do already start to wonder whether he’s the answer to any of those problems. He absolutely could be sacked twice by Christmas, with defeat at Leeds leaving West Ham already four points adrift of safety.",
      "",
      "It is the history of the Wolves. They absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Brighton for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Purchase alcohol for some youths?",
      "But defeat to Burnley in a rollercoaster six-pointer leaves things looking bleak indeed for Pereira.",
      "Gary Neville has revealed that Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has another “big job over the next couple of weeks” after guiding his side to three wins in a row.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has issued a response to Liverpool boss Arne Slot after his “low block and long ball” dig.",
      "According to reports, two ‘struggling’ Manchester United stars face being offloaded next year, while the Red Devils could seal a bargain transfer.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker thinks Ruben Amorim should drop Diogo Dalot with the defender a “liability at both ends”.",
      "Manchester United are among the the Premier League’s biggest underperformers, but they are way behind Newcastle United.",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘huge transfer U-turn’ at Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on Marcus Rashford."

      "Liverpool are still one of the most frequent TV picks in the Premier League so far this season, with Chelsea replaced at the top by three other teams.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Bournemouth) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Sunderland) – £45m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Leeds and Manchester United were the biggest winners from the initial December selections with four more games each.",
      "=1st) Arsenal, Aston Villa, Liverpool and Manchester United (14 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £12.1m in 2024/25",
      "=5th) Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (13 games) – worth around £11.4m",
      "=8th) Manchester City and Newcastle (12 games) – worth around £10.6m",

      "17th) Brighton (8 games) – worth around £7.3m",
      "18th) Bournemouth (7 games) – worth around £6.5m",
      "=20th) Burnley and Sunderland (6 games) – worth around £5.7m",
      "",

      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",

      "Former Man Utd defender Gary Neville has revealed that Ruben Amorim has another “big job over the next couple of weeks” after guiding the Red Devils to three wins in a row.",
      "The Red Devils won their first back-to-back Premier League matches under Amorim when they beat Liverpool last weekend and their 4-2 win over Brighton on Saturday saw them take that run of victories to three on the bounce.",
      "Amorim has spent much of this season under pressure but those three wins saw them fly above defending champions Liverpool in the table and into fourth position.",
      "And Neville has hailed it as Amorim’s “best week in the job” but warns the Man Utd head coach that he’s “not out of the woods yet”.",
      "“I think where we’ve all been with it, I wouldn’t have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",
      "MAILBOX: Liverpool in ‘transition season’ as VVD ‘declines into Lovren’; Man Utd ‘hope cannot be allowed to fester’",
      "“But the victory at Anfield shows you how things can turn around and then obviously this was so important today.",

      "“They’ll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they’ll end up in sixth or seventh but that’s where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "“So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "“A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn’t believe in Ruben Amorim’s system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "“However, one thing that’s been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "“Because I think there’s no doubt he’s not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they’re desperate to win and you’ve seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "“I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "“We’ll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There’s still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "“It feels very different, it feels like the momentum’s with them a little bit and the spirit’s good.”",
      "Neville reckons Amorim still needs to get the best out of Benjamin Sesko over the next couple of weeks with Mbeumo and Cunha now firing.",
      "The Man Utd legend added: “There’s question marks over Sesko. I think he was a bigger risk as a signing. It doesn’t look like he’s quite settled in yet. It would be nice if it could start to look like a front three. It still feels like a front two, with him stood up there. I think that’s the big job over the next couple of weeks.",
      "“It’s more than the goals; it’s the inclusion within the combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, who wasn’t playing today, linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha. You don’t quite see Sesko being part of that mix yet.",
      "“He’s not got up to the pace of it, with how quickly they’re playing with each other. He needs to get his game up to speed and that will only come through time. Obviously, he’s still quite young but he just needs to get there.",
      "“He’s a big signing, and if they can become a front three, that will be huge. It still feels like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.”",

The rest of them have been various shades of crap. Jones and Gravenberch both being injured really spells trouble.",
      "I wrote after Frankfurt to point out that Slot needed to hold his nerve and play the best players. Bringing Salah back in, who has been totally anonymous tonight, was a massive fail. If I were Chiesa I’d be looking for a way out come January and who could blame him.",
      "Mamardashvili might be a decent shot stopper but he literally dived out of the way of the 1 on 1 whilst staying on his line and the penalty was poor. I suspect most Liverpool fans were casting very envious glances at Kelleher tonight. Mama is not helped by everyone passing to his right foot when he’s left footed. But that makes sense because this group looked tonight like they’d never met one another. Just 11 guys pulled together for a match last minute.",
      "A lot of criticism will deservedly be levelled at Slot. Mo, Kerkez and others were all poor but he chose the team and, astoundingly, chose to leave Mo on the pitch when he made his subs. He also somehow saw that joke first half and waited until 60 minutes and 3-1 down to make changes.",

A substitute ref who took 20 minutes to warm up. The game finished at quarter past 10.",

      "What a weekend of football we have had. Naturally, it has been extremely pleasing as a United supporter but there is one thing that stands out as being a major disappointment. The level of additional time consistently given to the team in red from Merseyside is borderline insane!",
      "Yet again, for the 427th time this season, Liverpool scored long after the indicated allotted level of injury time and, I think we can all agree, the amount of Fergie time being afforded to them is simply unprecedented. The ref was too embarrassed to even come out for the second half, and so we got another numerically illiterate official in his place. Who then provided the first instance, in my memory anyway (somebody fact-check that for me), of a team being awarded a corner because the GK held onto the ball too long (more than 8 seconds).",
      "The ref is supposed to provide a visual countdown with his fingers for the last 5 seconds. Watch it back, the GK gets rid around 7/8 seconds and the players complain he wasn’t given proper visual warning by the ref. Bear in mind Brentford did a lot more time wasting against United and weren’t punished in the same manner. They even had the temerity to score another against us in the injury time they had created – sacre bleu!! Don’t get me started on the time wasted by Arsenal-Wimbledon against us too.",
      "It’s a fine line between corruption and incompetence, but let’s give the officials the benefit of the doubt and say it’s the latter. So what can we do to address this current timekeeping debacle you ask? Either all stoppages are clear and transparent, with a specific clock for stoppages that all can see, or the current team of officials should be sent back to primary school to learn how to count and how to tell the time. (There is a third option of not allowing Liverpool any injury time unless they have a narrow lead, but we’ll hold that one back for now to see how things shake out).",
      "The irony of course is that the back-pass rule was basically invented due to Liverpool wasting time, passing the ball between CBs and GK once they had any sort of a lead (somebody fact-check that for me please). Hansen to Grobbelaar again is it? Not on my watch! We need more of that spirit in officialdom and strive to get back to a time when refs favoured the likes of United (as if they ever did).",

      "What’s this, 3 wins on the bounce? Can someone tell me what Man United fans have done to upset Amorim this much? This is real pain! How could he even think we deserve this? We’ve gone and gotten used to having a bit of a laugh every weekend, safe in the knowledge that the game was there to be lost, and was usually lost. The quality of the players and the tactics always made sure of it. We knew our place, and all was right with the world.",

      "The report claims that Man Utd and Man City are both interested in signing Hjulmand, with a ‘January transfer battle’ on the cards.",
      "His form has unsurprisingly ‘caught the attention’ of the Manchester giants and they are ‘following him closely’ ahead of the winter window.",
      "Both clubs have links to Sporting through United boss Amorim and City’s director of football Hugo Viana, which means they both know the 26-year-old well — and that it’s a very easy transfer rumour to make up.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas said there was interest in the summer and that Hjulmand turned down offers to ‘triple his salary’, but the report claims that January could present him with ‘headaches’ as City and United ‘promise’ to move for the midfielder.",
      "Hjulmand will reportedly pick up a loyalty bonus if he stays at Sporting until the end of the season, and the Portuguese club are adamant they won’t negotiate below his €80m (£69.8m) release clause.",
      "On Friday, we covered a story from Fichajes linking Athletic Club’s Oihan Sancet, and another from talkSPORT linking six other midfielders with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Surprisingly, Hjulmand’s name wasn’t mentioned by the latter, which claimed Man Utd are open to signing two midfielders in 2026 — with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Chelsea’s Andrey Santos, Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, and Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller all appreciated.",
      "Hjulmand, a long-time target, becomes the eighth player added to Amorim’s midfield shortlist.",
      "The quantity of midfield targets proves that Man Utd are serious about strengthening in that area — but the quality and variety is confusing.",
      "The fact that Man Utd are reportedly considering signing two midfielders is a caveat, but the different profiles being linked with the Red Devils either shows they don’t know what they want — or that those reporting are just guessing. Or both. Definitely both.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has the ability to drop deep and dictate the tempo, but he’s wasted in those areas. United need him further up the pitch because he’s the most reliable goalscorer and creator Amorim has in his squad.",
      "What he doesn’t have are the defensive capabilities. He’s nothing like a prime Casemiro — the kind Amorim wishes he had — and he’s not a Patrick Vieira type who bombs up and down the pitch, winning tackles and making interceptions.",
      "With Fernandes an undisputed starter in Amorim’s midfield two, it’s clear the Portuguese boss needs a much more industrious player alongside him. Literally, if Casemiro were five years younger…",
      "There will be no unearthing of hidden gems like United almost managed with Moises Caicedo. Unknown quantities like Baleba and Santos — or under-the-radar Premier League and Championship ballers like Anderson and Wharton — are now commanding fees in a completely different stratosphere to what their current clubs paid.",
      "Stiller and Santos are similar in that they can play as a No.6, 8, or 10, but their best role isn’t what United need to become more defensively stable and get the best out of Fernandes.",
      "Gallagher is similar, but everyone knows what you’ll get from him: energy. The guy has an unparalleled engine and is a manager’s dream. But is he someone with the ability to dictate tempo and provide the defensive output required for Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system? Probably not.",
      "Baleba, Wharton and Anderson are all Premier League-proven and the right profile for Man Utd. Brighton midfielder Baleba is the perfect signing for me, Clive.",
      "Hjulmand is similar but lacks Premier League experience. He might be the most attractive signing of all eight players, but there’s no way United should be paying £70m.",
      "And then Sancet barely deserves a mention. He’s an attacking midfielder — and the source is, well, sh**.",
      "We all know Baleba will be the guy United sign at the end of the season. He’s going to cost around £100m, though. And knowing Man Utd, they won’t hesitate to pay it."

      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba has quickly deleted a cheeky social media post that added fuel to speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United.",
      "In recent years, Baleba has emerged as one of the best young midfielders and he attracted serious interest from Man Utd in the summer.",
      "The Red Devils made an audacious move to sign Baleba as they looked to sign a quality No.6, though they were priced out of a move for the £100m-rated Brighton star.",
      "It was widely reported that Baleba was in favour of a move to Old Trafford, while Man Utd left the door open for a future transfer by deciding against signing an alternative.",
      "Baleba has remained heavily linked with Man Utd in recent months, with this impacting his form for Brighton.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Brentford v Liverpool, Man United, Eberechi Eze, Thomas Frank, El Clasico",
      "Baleba made a poor start to this season as he’s also been impacted by a knee injury, though he has returned to form in recent matches.",
      "The centre-midfielder produced his best performance of the season to date last weekend after holding ‘private talks’ with head coach Fabian Hurzeler as Brighton beat Newcastle 2-1.",
      "Baleba is likely to start for Brighton against Man Utd at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, though he has risked annoying Hurzeler and supporters by posting a light-hearted message on social media.",
      "He uploaded an image to preview Saturday’s match, which was captioned: “Coming to Old Trafford [laughing emoji].”",
      "Baleba quickly deleted this post and later played it safe by re-uploading the image without a caption.",
      "Ahead of this match, Hurzeler has explained why he thinks Baleba’s form has changed following his disappointing start to the campaign.",
      "“These were good actions and good behaviours he showed, but he has to make habits out of those good behaviours. That’s the next step in his development, to bring consistency to his performance.",
      "“For me, it’s always important that I’m very transparent with the players. I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.",
      "“It’s important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it’s important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "“Carlos won’t get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That’s where we try to support him and make him better.",
      "Manchester United target Carlos Baleba has reportedly held ‘private talks’ with Brighton over his future, while Fabrizio Romano has provided an update.",
      "Man Utd forward Bryan Mbeumo is attempting to convince Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to move to Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Crystal Palace and Nottingham are definitely at risk as we rank the top ten non-Big Six stars most likely to secure an upwards transfer to a giant in 2026.",
      "Man Utd have bumped Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton above Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in their list of midfield targets, according to reports.",
      "Top Man Utd target Carlos Baleba will ask to leave Premier League side Brighton in the January transfer window, according to the latest reports.",
      "According to reports, Bruno Fernandes and Manchester United have already ‘agreed’ his £100m ‘sale’ and this deal will fund two ‘incoming’ signings."

      "The Red Devils raised funds through several high-profile exits, with Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho among those to move elsewhere.",

      "It is common knowledge that they are crying out for a new No.6 after failing to land Brighton star Carlos Baleba in the summer, though this area is set to be addressed in January or next summer.",
      "This is understood to be their transfer priority, though a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims they have also ‘offered’ 100 million euros (£86m) for AC Milan star Leao.",
      "The Portugal international has been sporadically linked with a potential move to the Premier League in recent seasons, though he has been in fine form in recent weeks. Since recovering from a calf injury, he has scored three goals in two Serie A matches.",
      "Man Utd are said to have ‘accelerated’ for Leao, who also has ‘interest’ from Liverpool and Man City as the latter club ‘considers making an offer’.",
      "The report also claims that three ‘key’ factors will decide Leao’s future as he has an ‘onerous release clause’ in his contract, though the value is not stated.",
      "They added: ‘Secondly, his performance: he must maintain or increase his offensive level in more competitive environments like the Premier League. ‘And third, the player’s will: his personal decision will be key, even more so if he finds the jump to Manchester United or the media exposure of England attractive.’",
      "United have also been looking to the future with their transfer business and have tried to acquire some of the best up-and-coming talents in England and elsewhere.",
      "On Friday, a report from The Athletic revealed that they have ‘completed the signing’ of goalkeeper Charlie Hardy from Championship outfit Derby County.",
      "They have also revealed Man Utd’s plan for the 16-year-old England youth international, adding: ‘Hardy, 16, will go into the club’s academy system and under-18s side managed by Darren Fletcher, having completed the Premier League’s five-step process for registering academy players yesterday.",
      "‘He will sign a scholarship and be eligible for a professional contract when he turns 17 in July.’",
      "Arsenal reportedly have a ‘genuine interest’ in a trio of players they will look to sign after sealing a deal for Crystal Palace attacker Eberechi Eze.",
      "Rafael Leao is attracting interest from Arsenal, Chelsea and Bayern Munich, with AC Milan reportedly open to selling the winger this summer.",

      "Slot did not take this too well as the Liverpool head coach made a petty comment about Man Utd’s style after his team’s damaging 2-1 defeat.",
      "Slot said: “It is always difficult to play against a team that defends in a low block and mainly plays the long ball.”",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Brentford v Liverpool, Man United, Eberechi Eze, Thomas Frank, El Clasico",
      "Slot has since added that these comments were meant as a “compliment” rather than a dig. He added: “We faced a team that had their game plan very well in order.",
      "“There was a bit of a debate over what I said after the game, but it was meant to be a compliment… so, they had a low block and played a lot of long balls. I was asked why it was difficult, and that was the reason.”",

      "“I think a little bit because it’s hard in the moment of our club, all the speculation around the goalkeepers, he’s not a young kid but he’s still young,” Amorim responded when asked whether he has been taken aback by Lammens’ start at Man Utd.",
      "“He coped really well with the pressure, he’s really composed, he’s defending really well. The importance of playing with both feet to kick the ball is so important nowadays, especially when you have to play against Liverpool in a more direct style.",
      "“I’m a little bit surprised, but I was expecting a talented guy. But yes, a little bit surprised.”",

      "Without them, this is still an average side very much trying to find its way.Laura Hunter",
      "\"Even when we don't play well, we're able to score two goals and create more chances than only the two we scored from open play.\"",
      "Arne Slot has, in essence, described the problem with Liverpool. At one end they are dangerous and at the other they are vulnerable. Even then it can be argued their attack is misfiring. He is yet to solve why this side is so imbalanced from back to front.",
      "There is no control from his midfield where, at Brentford, Dominic Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones, two No 8s, were sat behind Florian Wirtz. They are without the nous to receive the ball from the defence and play forward. Alexis Mac Allister is the answer to that.",
      "Then there are more trivial issues like Milos Kerkez, who is so woefully out of form and yet still trying to do everything too quickly rather than building some confidence by simply keeping it simple.",
      "Conor Bradley had one of his better evenings at right-back although is still clearly weighed down by being the heir to Trent Alexander-Arnold's throne. The reality is that he is just not as good.",
      "Not even playing alongside Virgil van Dijk can help Ibrahim Konate this season. The disappointment of missing out on signing Marc Guehi gets worse by the week.",
      "But this Liverpool squad is still stacked with talent and Slot didn't win the Premier League by chance. Now he must solve the biggest challenge of his Liverpool career, working out what his best side is.David Richardson",
      "The scoreline will paint a close game: but it wasn't.",
      "The usual problems emerged for West Ham at Leeds, whose inability to defend crosses and corners struck again to give them a huge uphill task.",
      "It's not a question of: when will West Ham learn? It's when will West Ham give themselves a chance?",
      "When will Nuno Espirito Santo give himself a chance too, after two incorrect line-ups against Leeds and Brentford saw him experiment with inverted full-backs playing on the wrong side and no centre forwards?",
      "After the disastrous first 15 minutes which saw them go 2-0 down, they were lucky this is a fairly misfiring Leeds side as it could have been worse before half-time.",
      "West Ham didn't deserve to get back in this game. Leeds ran nearly seven more kilometres than them, creating chance after chance right through the heart of the team.",
      "Given West Ham have been in this division for over a decade, that's unacceptable.",
      "There are holes in defence, holes in midfield and with Nuno reluctantly using Callum Wilson as their only recognised, fit striker, there's a hole in attack too.",
      "If the Hammers are playing like this against their relegation rivals, what are they going to be like against the better sides?",
      "West Ham are heading down unless Nuno changes - along with his team. It will need a miracle at this point.Sam Blitz",
      "Marc Guiu was one of three teenage goal-scorers against 10-man Ajax in the Champions League on Wednesday and had his chance to impress in his first Premier League start for Chelsea - up against the team he'd briefly been on loan at earlier this season.",
      "But on this evidence, Liam Delap's pending return from injury cannot come soon enough. The England man could be involved in midweek Carabao Cup action - and Chelsea are in real need of a central threat on this stage.",
      "Injured Cole Palmer's creativity is another big miss for a Chelsea team that struggled to carve a way through Sunderland's well-organised defence. That was illustrated by the Expected Goals figures, which showed Chelsea at 0.97 to Sunderland's 1.16 - despite the hosts having 69 per cent possession.",
      "But Guiu was bullied by Dan Ballard, unable to find an angle to receive a pass from his team-mates and then unable to retain possession when he did get it. After 76 minutes he was withdrawn having had just 10 touches.",
      "Joao Pedro later went up top, with sub Estevao going to No 10 but still Chelsea struggled to produce meaningful moments. It was an afternoon to wonder why there was such eagerness to offload Nicolas Jackson in the summer.",
      "Enzo Maresca memorably insisted on playing down any hype about his team in the first half of last season. This performance was evidence that no one should be getting carried away by their recent run of wins.Peter Smith",
      "Paul Merson held his hands up on Soccer Saturday before Sunderland's win at Chelsea, saying: \"I made these the biggest certainty in the history of football to get relegated.\"",
      "He wasn't alone. The Black Cats battled their way through the Championship play-offs and were expected to struggle in the top flight like most promoted sides have in recent times.",
      "But Regis Le Bris has combined a big summer splurge with well-organised tactics to defy the doubters. Sunderland's 17 points from their first nine Premier League games is the best return from a promoted club at this stage since Hull City in 2008/09.",
      "The majority of their points have come at the Stadium of Light, where their raucous home support matches the energy, physicality and intensity of the team. But on the road at Chelsea they showed quality in defence to shut out their hosts and then set-piece and counter-attack threat to hurt them at the other end.",
      "The win moved them up to second in the Premier League. The stuff of dreams for their supporters, who sang 'We're going to win the league' in west London. They face Arsenal in a couple of weeks' time...",
      "More importantly, Sunderland are just nine points off hitting a tally none of the relegated sides could reach last season. And it's only October. No-one is underestimating them now.Peter Smith",
      "There are some players that have a natural ability at rising to an occasion.",
      "Bruno Guimaraes is Newcastle's go-to guy in that regard.",
      "The crowd look for him, his teammates grow around him and opponents shrink.",
      "He comes alive at the big moments. The moments that matter. He defines what this Newcastle team are all about: fight and heart sprinkled with an abundance of quality.",
      "Against Fulham after the equaliser that left the game at 1-1, it was Bruno who grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck and shook off any feelings of fatigue from the Champions League in midweek to get his team the points. He broke up play, launched counter attacks and completely shifted the momentum of the game with his tenacity. And when his team needed someone bursting into the box to slam home a rebound, he made that run and got his reward with the winning goal.",
      "Big players don't just turn up in big games, they decide them. Bruno is doing that, repeatedly.Lewis Jones",
      "Fulham have a couple of problems. The surge of the newly-promoted clubs showing no fear and huge worries concerning their own final-third output which is lacking in freshness and quality.",
      "Despite showing promise in various phases in the defeat at Newcastle, Fulham were blunt in the key moments. To rack up 47 final third entries and 25 touches in the opposition box at St James' Park is a really healthy number but they simply didn't do enough with their territory.",
      "It's now four defeats on the spin and if the goals don't flow soon, pressure is going to mount. That will test the mental resilience of a squad whose recent seasons have delivered stability, rather than battling survival. This is a season that could easily evolve into a tension-ridden relegation fight rather than a comfortable mid-table campaign.Lewis Jones",
      "Carlos Baleba's form is a concern for Brighton. He has been substituted in all nine of his starts this season, departing just before the hour mark in the Seagulls' chaotic defeat to Manchester United. It has been worse. Three times he has been hooked at the break.",
      "After an improving showing against Newcastle, this was a return to the error-strewn efforts prior to that. Baleba switches off out of possession and looks far too loose in it. He was strongly linked with a move in the summer and does not seem to have settled.",
      "\"It is for the experienced players to get around him, ground him, have a couple of honest conversations because he is going to be a world-class midfield player.\" Still only 21 years old, that is most likely true given the potential that Baleba had shown previously.",
      "But this is an alarming dip in form from him now and the demands of the Premier League wait for no man. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler is trying to play his star midfielder back into form but he cannot wait indefinitely. It is on Baleba to do more.Adam Bate",

      "Manchester United capitalised on recent momentum by beating Brighton at Old Trafford as Matheus Cunha scored his first club goal in a frantic and somewhat controversial 4-2 win.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side seem to be one of contrasting fortunes as a torrid start to this season has made way for a particularly productive recent period, with three wins on the spin propelling them, temporarily at least, into the top four.",
      "Man Utd had lost six of their last seven league games against Brighton and rode their luck at times in the first half, needing some wasteful finishing from Danny Welbeck to pave the way for two goals in 10 minutes, scored by Cunha and Casemiro. The opener was sumptuous, the second via a harsh deflection much more fortunate.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should have made it three before Bryan Mbeumo did, driving a devilishly clever strike through Lewis Dunk's legs, despite an obvious foul by Luke Shaw on Georginio Rutter in the phase before. And that was not the only decision under scrutiny on the night.",
      "Man Utd have led by 2+ goals at half time in three consecutive Premier League games at Old Trafford for the first time since November 2008.",
      "Neither referee Anthony Taylor nor VAR awarded Amad a penalty when he was upended by Maxim De Cuyper in the first half, because the defender supposedly \"played the ball\", while Patrick Dorgu only received a yellow for a last-ditch foul on Yankuba Minteh - albeit the forward had probably lost control of possession when the whistle finally went.",
      "The drama did not stop there. Welbeck latterly made his presence felt when guiding a belting free-kick beyond Senne Lammens to rid him of a second consecutive clean sheet, before Charalampos Kostoulas arrived from the bench to force what looked to be a needlessly tense end.",
      "Mbeumo had other ideas, though, finding the net in the 96th minute with an emphatic finish to round off a frenzied finale, with Gary Neville praising Amorim for his \"best and most important week in the job\".",
      "\"The narrative coming into this game was that Manchester United couldn't take a step back after what happened at Anfield last week and the win today was absolutely crucial.",
      "\"I think it has been Ruben Amorim's best and most important week in the job. It gives him a bit of time.",
      "\"I am not saying he's off the hook but Manchester United are up there towards the top of the league and it certainly takes a lot of pressure off him.\"",
      "Only Manchester United can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. This was definitely a banana skin moment. United's recent record against Brighton is woeful and it's a fixture that always throws up drama. This latest instalment trended similarly.",
      "Just when United draw you in, Old Trafford bouncing with unbridled glee at being 2-0 up, they drop you like a sack of bricks. It was easy to be charmed by the first-half performance but the second proved this fragile side are far from flawless. How can they make things look so easy and so hard all at the same time? It's an art.",
      "Until Bryan Mbeumo slammed home a fourth in stoppage time there was a sense of foreboding seeping into the terraces. You could tangibly feel the atmosphere shift. Of the four big chances the hosts created, three were missed. And yet they still scored four times.",
      "That's what Ruben Amorim means when he emphasised in his press conference that this year's squad contains players who \"fit the style\". He's talking about the quality of Cunha and Mbeumo. A new brand of Manchester United matchwinner.",
      "Without them, this is still an average side very much trying to find its way.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (7), Shaw (6), Amad (7), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (6), Dalot (6), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (7), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Heaven (7), Dorgu (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Zirkzee (n/a). \n\n\nBrighton: Verbruggen (6), De Cuyper (6), Dunk (5), Van Hecke (5), Wieffer (6), Ayari (6), Baleba (5), Minteh (6), Rutter (6), Kadioglu (6), Welbeck (7).\n\n\nSubs: Watson (6), Milner (6), Gomez (6), Kostoulas (6), Tzimas (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"The performance was important. We played different games in different moments. It would not be Manchester United without suffering a bit.",
      "\"The best game we did [this season] was against Arsenal, but when you have a different spirit, we are a bit more free playing the game. We have a different confidence.",
      "\"I never had that feeling of embarrassment of not winning games, I felt [Sir] Jim [Ratcliffe] always believed, but to face the fans was difficult in that moment. It's so hard in football, everything can change in one minute.",
      "\"We are improving in the bad moments, and [learning to] respond in a different way. You can feel it with the team. Let's enjoy, but that urgency of this can change must be there.",
      "\"The team play so much better compared to last season. We have players more suited to this type of style. I like more today than last week [beating Liverpool], it was more complete.\"",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler:",
      "\"It's easy to summarise. Too many easy mistakes. We gave the balls away too easy, like this you can't win the game. We had control and good actions, always created a danger, but in the end it's easy mistakes. [The goals are] like four presents.",
      "\"United pressed well but we have to do the small margins right. We weren't on the highest level and then we make mistakes. When we were in a structure we didn't give away many chances, but it was just the mistakes. We decided the game ended in a negative way. The execution was not good enough.\"",
      "Speaking about the difference in threat of Manchester United from last year to now, Hurzeler said: \"Much more intense, compact, and defending forward. Even more individual quality - money was well invested.\"",
      "Commenting on the officiating performance, he added: \"I will never make the referee responsible for our losses. We have to make it better. We can't lose the ball that easily.\""

      "\"I think where we've all been with it, I wouldn't have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",
      "\"But the victory at Anfield shows you how things can turn around and then obviously this was so important today.",
      "\"He's not out of the woods yet and it's certainly not time to get carried away but I think Manchester United are now where they thought they probably would be.",
      "\"They'll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they'll end up in sixth or seventh but that's where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "\"So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "\"A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn't believe in Ruben Amorim's system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "\"However, one thing that's been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "\"Because I think there's no doubt he's not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they're desperate to win and you've seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "\"I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "\"We'll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There's still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "\"It feels very different, it feels like the momentum's with them a little bit and the spirit's good.\"",
      "Neville pointed to Mbeumo and Cunha's encouraging form when asked what he still wants to see to be convinced by United.",
      "\"I suppose consistency. It's been a team and a club that you can't really rely on for so long.",
      "\"The idea of winning two or three matches doesn't take that away. You can't build that trust back in an instant. That's still not there but I think that there's something happening there.",
      "\"With Mbeumo and Cunha the risk was removed from those signings in the sense that they've been in the Premier League before and they've got that hunger to deliver at a different level.",
      "\"There was a lot of things about those signings that you felt more comfortable with and when I look at United now and Mbeumo looks like he belongs, he looks hungry, he looks like he wants to score goals.",
      "\"It wasn't quite happening for him and Cunha in the first maybe four or five matches when they were getting into the positions they always wanted the ball but they weren't maybe taking their chances.",
      "\"But Manchester United have got something to build on. Those two will win a lot of football matches for this club.",

      "\"I think it could be sort of a recipe for Manchester United to have a decent season to get into the top six.\"",
      "The third member of United's attacking triumvirate has not made such a big impression just yet. Benjamin Sesko came back into the team after being benched for the win at Liverpool but did not get among the goals.",
      "\"There are question marks over Sesko,\" said Neville. \"He obviously was a bigger risk of a signing and a lot more of an unknown. He doesn't quite look like he's settled in yet.",
      "\"It's more than the goals. It's the inclusion within the actual combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and [Mason] Mount, who wasn't playing today, but you see those two linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha.",

      "\"That'll only come through time and obviously he's still quite young. But he just does need to get there because it's a big signing still, he's £80m. If they can become a front three, then obviously that'll be huge.. At the moment it feels to me like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.",

      "Saturday 25 October 2025 17:38, UK",
      "Brighton face Manchester United on Saturday with six wins from the last seven Premier League meetings between the sides. Two of them were masterminded by Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngest head coach in the country is going for a third.",
      "The trip to Old Trafford, scene of a 3-1 victory in January, is another chance for the 32-year-old to show his potential to be one of the game's next elite coaches and comes with Brighton unbeaten in five games following last weekend's win over Newcastle.",
      "\"Don't prove it only once, we have to prove it twice, maybe a third time, that we are able to compete with the best teams in the league.",
      "\"And this will be the challenge against Manchester United as well because they are one of the best teams in the league. They have unbelievable individual quality. Of course, they had a big win against Liverpool, so we expect them with a lot of confidence, with a lot of belief. But we will go there to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We will go there to win this game.\"",
      "They will aim to do it by applying the lessons of their last visit.",
      "\"First of all, it's always a big challenge to go there because it's just a special atmosphere,\" says Hurzeler. \"The second thing is that you have to go there and play with a lot of belief and a lot of courage, especially in possession. You can't go there and only defend.",
      "\"What I learned from last season is that you have to be at the highest level in all the small match-ups. That's the main thing against United, especially with the individual quality they have. They can decide a game with one action, in one moment.\"",
      "Brighton's win there in January, secured by goals from Yankuba Minteh, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter, prompted Ruben Amorim to describe his side as \"maybe the worst in Manchester United's history\". Are they a different proposition now?",
      "\"Every time teams bring more individual quality into their team, it gets more and more difficult to beat them,\" says Hurzeler. \"They play a similar formation to last season but they seem to be more stable. They seem to get more and more into their rhythm.",
      "\"For sure, the more the teams spend, the better they will be and the higher the challenge is, but we never hide, we are never afraid. We have a lot of respect for every team and every player but we go there with the biggest self-belief that we can beat every team.\"",
      "Hurzeler knows what to expect tactically. Manchester United have started every game under Amorim with a back three. The Brighton boss is something of an expert on the system having used it at his former club St Pauli, even if he terms it differently.",
      "\"I played a lot with a back five at my previous club, so I know that you can defend the whole width of the pitch,\" says Hurzeler. \"It's easier to do that so I think that's one advantage.",
      "\"You need to be very good between the lines. You need to have centre-backs who defend forward, otherwise it's easy for the opponent to turn in front of the defence.",
      "\"One of the challenges when you play against a back five is that you always face a very compact team, with very short distances between each player. When you face a four, you have a little bit more distance between the opposition players.",
      "\"The challenge is to find the gaps, to be patient, to not force it, because if you force it with the first action, then for sure they are going to transition.",
      "\"So, you have to be patient, you have to switch the play, you have to create overloads on the wings to make them move, then find the gap where you can play through or run through.\"",
      "There are parallels between Hurzeler and Amorim as up-and-coming coaches who earned their moves to the Premier League having built their reputations on the continent. But they have approached their respective tasks very differently.",
      "While Amorim has rigidly stuck to his favoured system at Manchester United, Hurzeler has embraced change at Brighton, using a back four in all but one of his Premier League games in charge despite having used a three consistently at St Pauli.",
      "\"I think the most important thing is to understand the profiles of the players,\" he says. \"So, what is the natural system for the club? What is the natural system for the players? In which position and on which base can the players show the highest potential?\"",
      "Hurzeler points out that his system is fluid and interchangeable.",
      "\"I always stick to my principles, but principles don't mean you always have to play a back four or always a back five,\" he explains. \"In the game you have thousands of different situations and patterns, so you always have to be able to react.",
      "\"We really try to train decision-making from the players, and in my experience this decision-making is better when you stick to your principles. You need to adapt or adjust without losing your style of play and that's what we try to do consistently.\"",
      "One of Hurzeler's principles is to press opponents aggressively.",
      "Brighton have forced more high turnovers than any other Premier League side this season. Opta's advanced metrics show they hold one of the highest defensive lines in the Premier League.",
      "How might he adapt, then, to Manchester United going direct? Their goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, has sent 83 out of 90 passes long in their last two Premier League games. Arne Slot highlighted the issues they caused by bypassing Liverpool's press.",
      "\"United played a lot of long balls in the last two or three games, they were quite efficient on that,\" says Hurzeler. \"They are really keen on winning the second ball. It's a very effective way of being successful. They proved it can be very powerful.",
      "\"The main thing you need to understand is that it starts with the press, how you attack the goalkeeper, which centre-back you want to attack. And then make sure that you're ready for the long ball.",
      "\"When the long ball is played, there are two things that are very important: that you try to win the second ball, and that, if you don't win the second ball, you have good positioning for the third ball.",
      "\"Make sure that, with your last line, you always cover the inner line, so when they try to flick the ball, especially with [Benjamin] Sesko, you can defend against the deep runs from [Matheus] Cunha, from [Bryan] Mbuemo, from [Mason] Mount.",
      "\"They are very good at these things, so it's a job for the whole team, not only of the defensive players. The main thing is to keep the compactness, make sure you have close distances, that you close the gaps, and that you're really intense for the second ball.\"",
      "One player who can help them is Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old made an indifferent start to the season following strong interest from Manchester United in the summer but he looked back to his best in the win over Newcastle after Hurzeler urged him to \"take responsibility\" for his situation.",
      "\"I saw a Carlos Baleba who stepped up,\" says Hurzeler. \"These were good actions and good behaviours he showed, but he has to make habits out of those good behaviours. That's the next step in his development, to bring consistency to his performance.\"",
      "Hurzeler wants him to \"overcome the noise\" around his future at Old Trafford on Saturday. He has been firm with Baleba and continues to push the midfielder, even if it risks upsetting him.",
      "\"For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players,\" he says. \"I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.",
      "\"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Baleba is of course just one of many young players to have excelled at Brighton, a club with an exciting trajectory and a head coach whose appetite for improvement is abundantly clear.",
      "\"I always say that learning has no finish line, so you will never be finished with progressing,\" Hurzeler says. \"That is what we try to live as a club, and what I try to live as an individual.",
      "\"We see the progress, but the main thing is to keep going, to keep trying to improve things, because the other teams, they won't rest. You always have to be ready to adapt and develop.\"",
      "It is a mantra that is serving Hurzeler and Brighton well.",
