      "Murillo could leave Nottingham Forest in the summer(Image: Neal Simpson/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are reportedly targeting Murillo for a summer transfer, but they might have some difficulty in persuading the Nottingham Forest star. Murillo has emerged as a target for United as they consider replacements for Harry Maguire this summer.",
      "Maguire’s contract with United is due to expire in June and the club’s recruitment department is planning ahead by considering possible replacements. Murillo has impressed since joining Forest from Corinthians for £10million in 2023 and is understood to be open to leaving at the end of the 2025/26 campaign, despite signing a new deal a year ago.",
      "United are keen on both the defender and the midfielder, but know they will face fierce competition, especially if they don’t get back into Europe under Michael Carrick’s guidance. In the case of Murillo, they also have his stated desire to play for their biggest rivals.",
      "The 23-year-old told the Benja Me Mucho podcast a year ago: “I had the dream of playing in the Premier League and I had that thought. I thought, ‘I’ll go to Nottingham Forest, have a good year and then I’ll go to a big club’.",
      "“I had that in my head. I’d choose Manchester City but it would be more difficult for me to be a regular starter given the players they have in their squad. There’s City, Arsenal as well who are fighting for the Premier League title. I wouldn’t discard Liverpool either. It would be a good opportunity for me to show my football in a big club.”",
      "Back in January 2025, it was Liverpool who were most strongly linked to Murillo and the Reds will also be on the lookout for centre-backs this summer, with Ibrahima Konate’s current deal set to expire.",
      "Manchester United may face competition for Murillo this summer(Image: Joe Prior/Visionhaus via Getty Images)",
      "They saw a £35m deal for Marc Guehi collapse on deadline day in the summer and are facing competition for the Crystal Palace star from Manchester City, who have injury problems of their own.",
      "Murillo has made 96 appearances for Forest since arriving two and a half years ago and has formed a solid partnership with Nikola Milenkovic. Interest in his services is nothing new for Forest, who also rejected a 'club-record offer' to cash in on him last year from Chelsea.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United have long been in the market for midfield reinforcements, with Anderson among a host of names being mentioned as potential targets.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Wolves' Joao Gomes and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have all been mentioned as possible arrivals at Old Trafford in recent months, alongside Anderson.",
      "Despite making four signings last summer, United opted not to bolster their midfield options. Multiple reports now suggest the Red Devils will seek to address this midfield either before the February 2 deadline or during the summer window.",
      "A report in the Daily Mail has provided more insight further on Anderson's situation, including Tuchel's assessment of the midfielder, whom he is expected to manage for England at this summer's World Cup.",
      "Tuchel has reportedly described Anderson in private as a \"gift\", which will be encouraging news for United if they remain genuinely interested in securing the England international's services. Anderson shone for England's Under-21s last summer at the Euro U21 Championships in Slovakia, with the Young Lions triumphing over Germany in the final.",
      "The Forest midfielder was instrumental in that final victory, and it was that performance which earned Anderson his promotion to Tuchel's first team.",
      "“That was the lightbulb moment,\" the Daily Mail quotes a source close to Tuchel as saying. “We suddenly realised he was the answer to our problem.”",
      "United could face Anderson themselves before the season concludes, with the Red Devils set to meet Forest in their penultimate Premier League fixture in May.",

      "Murillo, 23, has been one of the Premier League's most impressive young centre-backs over the last two seasons after joining Forest from Corinthians for just £10million. And his form has not gone unnoticed at Old Trafford, with United's top brass already making plans ahead of a big summer, where they will decide on a new permanent head coach.",
      "Nottingham Forest are in a strong position when it comes to transfer interest in Murillo having tied the Brazilian down to a new four-and-a-half year contract last January. But The Mail claim the United target is open to the idea of a move at the end of the season.",
      "The report goes on to add that Murillo is among the options Manchester United are considering ahead of the summer as they plan to bolster their defence, potentially with a view to replacing Maguire, who is now inside the final six months of his contract.",
      "It's claimed United's chances of landing Murillo from Forest would be strengthened if they qualify for the Champions League, with Forest unlikely to be in Europe next year unless they win the Europa League.",

      "With United's interest in Murillo, it remains to be seen if the Red Devils will offer Maguire, 32, fresh terms, or whether the club's former captain will be free to depart Old Trafford on a free transfer at the end of the 2025-26 campaign.",

      "Gareth Southgate remains out of work since resigning as England manager(Image: ADRIAN DENNIS, POOL/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Gareth Southgate has said he has no concerns about directors of football undermining a manager's power following Manchester United's decision to part ways with Ruben Amorim. The former England manager believes the fundamental reason behind Amorim's downfall was a battle for control with senior club officials.",
      "United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, a former England colleague of Southgate's, ultimately prevailed in the dispute. Whilst discussing the distinction between a manager and a head coach, Southgate - who was previously touted as a potential United appointment - disclosed that he demanded his job title be changed from head coach to manager when offered the England position.",
      "He now describes himself as a 'leader, manager, coach - in that order'. An extensive LinkedIn article entitled 'Manager v Head Coach', which Southgate characterises as his \"thoughts on the importance of the title of manager as opposed to head coach\", adds his voice to the conversation.",
      "It reads: \"In the last fortnight, three of Europe's biggest football clubs, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Chelsea, have parted company with their head coaches. Of the three, Enzo Maresca served the longest period at 18 months.",
      "\"Although each coach left under slightly different circumstances and for more than one reason, power struggles either with club executives (Amorim), club employees (Maresca) or players (Alonso) were ultimately the root cause of the end of each tenure.",
      "\"The erosion of a manager's authority has been a gradual process over many years. It has accelerated with the widespread introduction of football, technical, or sporting directors, who now oversee long-term football strategy, report directly to CEOs or owners (or both), and sit structurally above the head coach. Personally, I have no issue with this evolution.",
      "Gareth Southgate has plenty to say about the manager vs head coach debate(Image: PA)",
      "\"Strategy, culture, planning, and continuity are critical to success in any organisation - and a football club is no different. A head coach neither has the time nor, in many cases, the specialist expertise to manage complex player contracts, oversee global scouting networks, or run sophisticated data operations. Equally, it makes little sense to dismantle medical or sports science departments every time there is a change of head coach.",
      "\"However, in a classic example of Parkinson's Law (where time saved by reducing responsibilities is quickly filled by something else), the modern head coach now finds themselves managing larger squads, bigger backroom teams, far greater analytical demands, and ever-increasing media and commercial obligations.\"",
      "Southgate's remarks about backroom staff emerge just days after the revelation that his former England number two, Steve Holland, would be joining Michael Carrick at United temporarily until the campaign concludes. The ex-Chelsea assistant forms part of a coaching setup that also features Craig Mawson, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "Southgate's post goes on to say: \"Contrary to the belief of some fans that the role has become simpler (\"they just need to coach\"), the opposite is true. Add to this the complexity of managing modern-day players (many of whom are effectively individual brands), alongside the financial stakes for clubs, and the relentless scrutiny of both traditional and social media, and you have a significant melting pot of problems and pressure. This is not helped by the subtle, sometimes unintentional, shift in power and status implied by moving from the title of manager to head coach.",
      "\"People may argue that 'it's just a title', or merely semantics. From personal experience, it's not. So much so that when I was offered the role of head coach for the England National team, I insisted on changing the title to manager. Even though I consider myself calm, collaborative and confident, I understood the importance of authority, influence and control when leading a football operation.",
      "\"You may have noticed that my current LinkedIn title reads 'leader, manager, coach' - in that order. That is entirely intentional. It reflects the hierarchy of skills I believed were required to run the England team effectively.",
      "\"The leader operates in the public eye, engaging fans, setting the vision, shaping the culture, and championing and protecting the players and staff.",
      "\"The manager is 'managing' stakeholders, departments and people, maximising collaboration and making plans stay on track. Oh, and don't forget the role of persuading 25 financially independent elite performers to put collective purpose ahead of their ego.",
      "\"Finally, the coach works on the pitch, setting the style of play, preparing tactics to exploit opponents, and developing the technical abilities of individual players.",
      "\"My belief is that we should embrace a modernised version of the traditional manager, where we recognise the people they lead, manage and coach. As I once said to my bosses at England: players are not magnets on a tactics board that can simply be moved around. They are human beings. And managing that reality is at the heart of modern football leadership.\"",

      "Carlo Ancelotti has previously taken aim at the Glazers for their running of Manchester United, as the legendary boss has been suggested as a potential option to replace Ruben Amorim in the summer. The hierarchy at Old Trafford decided to wield the axe on the head coach, following an outburst that seemingly criticised his role in the club.",
      "The Portuguese coach was the first full-time hire made by Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe as part of their co-ownership of United, which has looked to transform the sporting departments of the club. With no clear favourite lined up to immediately replace Amorim, they have turned to Michael Carrick as caretaker manager.",
      "As a result, the shortlist of potential names for the summer continues to grow, with international coaches such as Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, and Julian Nagelsmann among those who may be available. There is also the case of Ancelotti, who is in charge of the Brazilian national team, with former United assistant Rene Meulensteen believing he should be on the club's radar.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti is the guy with the type of pedigree who can handle it because he’s done it, he’s seen it and he knows what a winning culture looks like,\" he said. \"I don’t think Ancelotti would listen to anybody else. Ancelotti would say this is what I’m doing. I’m managing what I’m here to do.",
      "“Football has changed. You’ve got Directors of Football now or Sporting Directors and Technical Directors who are there to safeguard the big picture of the whole football operation at a club and then you’ve got a Head Coach who should be working with the squad of players.",
      "“As a coach, you need to be very clear on that. That’s why Ruben Amorim ran into trouble. They obviously weren’t aligned. He had different ideas about how it should be run than the people in the background.”",
      "It's unclear whether Ancelotti would be open to making the move to Old Trafford, or whether the hierarchy at the club are even looking at the former Chelsea and Real Madrid man. However, when it comes to alignment, there may be concerns over the role of the Glazers.",
      "While the partial sale of the club saw Ineos and Ratcliffe take a minority stake, along with control on the sporting side of things, the American family are still the majority shareholders. This may cause some friction, not least as Ancelotti made it clear exactly what he thought about the family back in 2016.",
      "The Glazer family, including Avram Glazer (left), have been a majority shareholders at Manchester United since 2005.(Image: (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images))",
      "He said: \"I was fortunate to be able to coach Real Madrid, although then the club decided to change managers. That is part of the job, we are exposed to that. In the big clubs it is difficult to stay a long time because the expectations of results are so high.",
      "\"Madrid’s history and demands mean that if a coach doesn’t win trophies, a change is made. You have to respect that. It’s true that there are other clubs like Manchester United, where [Sir Alex] Ferguson was there many years, and now [Arsene] Wenger at Arsenal.",
      "\"These cases are different, as their owners are from the US and they are more interested in the financial aspect than in who is coach.”",
      "It remains to be seen whether Ancelotti is a serious target for United or not in their search for a new head coach, but it will continue talk surrounding what the club wants or needs for the future. The 'Man United DNA' has been a common theme surrounding discussion on who should be the next appointment.",
      "Figuring out exactly what that means, and how to deploy it into action, will be the job of the sporting department. Director of Football Jason Wilcox will be in charge of deploying a game model that can align through the club, uniting the recruitment team, directors, and the management team.",
      "The appointment of Carrick has bought them time to make those key decisions, but they will have to be spot on to help rebuild the team for the future.",

      "Any agreement for an investor to purchase the Ineos stake in Nice would bring an end to nearly seven years of the company's ownership of the French club, which has produced mixed results. Currently, Les Aiglons sit 14th in the league with just a six-point cushion above the relegation zone.",
      "Those struggles have been exemplified in Europe, as they are yet to register a single point in the Europa League, with criticism mounting over the club's management in recent years. This comes at a time when United face their own challenges and turbulence under the part-ownership of Ineos and Ratcliffe.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has slashed the price of Nice amid a potential sale of the French club(Image: (Photo by Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images))",
      "There have been glimmers of progress following last season's disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League, but turmoil has erupted in the wake of Ruben Amorim's dismissal. The Portuguese coach was the first permanent appointment under the new ownership and sporting structure, a move by Ratcliffe's group to overhaul the club's behind-the-scenes operations.",
      "This evidently created friction for Amorim, who made it clear that he saw himself as a manager rather than a head coach at the club, despite the new setup including a director of football, Jason Wilcox. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he declared in early January when questioned about his rapport with the board.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club.",
      "\"No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "His departure, coupled with Michael Carrick's appointment as interim boss, highlighted the pressure on Ineos to make the correct choice for the next permanent manager to steer United back on track, whilst questions have been raised about the circumstances surrounding the outgoing head coach.",
      "That shift in approach must align with a coherent playing philosophy established by the sporting department, alongside targeted recruitment of players who fit specific tactical requirements.",
      "Whether the club can achieve that unified vision across its leadership structure is yet to be determined.",

      "Michael Carrick's Manchester United will face Manchester City this weekend(Image: PA)",
      "As we approach the halfway point of the January transfer window, Manchester United have yet to add any new players to their squad. There has been a change in the dugout, though, with Ruben Amorim sacked and Michael Carrick taking interim charge until the end of the season.",
      "The deal for former United midfielder Carrick was confirmed on Tuesday and he will be thrown straight in at the deep end. United play host to Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime, looking to gain revenge for their 3-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium back in September.",
      "It remains to be seen whether there will be a great deal of transfer activity without a permanent manager in place. United signed Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven during the winter window last season but may end up waiting until the summer this time.",
      "Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes is one of the Premier League stars on United's radar as they aim to plug gaps in their midfield. The Premier League side already knew Napoli could rival them for the Brazil international, but a new name has now entered the fray.",
      "Gomes, who joined Wolves from Flamengo in 2023, appears to fit the bill. However, Wolves are said to be keen to hang onto the midfielder - who they value at north of £40m - until the end of the season.",
      "Joao Gomes in action for Wolves(Image: Wolves via Getty Images)",
      "The 24-year-old was eased into the team after joining under Julen Lopetegui in January 2023 but has been a fixture in the side since the Spanish manager's departure. He has missed just seven Premier League matches across the last three seasons, and his suitors haven't been put off by the fact that the team are 14 points from safety.",
      "United have been long-time admirers of Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, but they aren't the only ones. According to Sky Sport Italia, Juventus have made an approach for the French international, which has been rebuffed by Palace.",
      "Those reports in Italy claim Juve offered just over £30m for the striker, who is out of contract at the end of the 2026/27 season. That's some way shy of the £50m asking price reported in 2025, but it has been suggested his contract situation is responsible for the drop.",
      "Mateta, 28, has scored eight goals in 21 Premier League appearances this season after hitting double figures in each of the previous two campaigns. He also has two goals in three senior France caps after making his debut for Les Bleus in October.",
      "Mateta has declined to extend his Palace stay thus far(Image: Rob Newell - CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "Juventus, who were linked with Roma-bound Donyell Malen earlier in the window, are looking for attacking reinforcements after losing Dusan Vlahovic to injury. Serbia striker Vlahovic, who is out of contract in the summer, hasn't played since late November due to an adductor injury.",
      "United, meanwhile, filled their striker vacancy with the £73m arrival of Benjamin Sesko last summer. However, the Slovenian has appeared far from the finished product this season, and with Joshua Zirkzee seemingly bound for an exit this year, Mateta could remain on United's watchlist.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's hierarchy want to overhaul their midfield in the summer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are reportedly growing more and more confident that they will be able to prise Carlos Baleba away from Brighton in the summer transfer window. United have been long-term admirers of Baleba and believe their chances are increasing.",
      "United have made little secret of their interest in the Cameroon international, who was one of their primary targets before the 2025/26 season began. Brighton held firm in the summer, quoting a price north of £100million, with the £115m they landed from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo setting the bar high.",
      "The Seagulls have continued to insist publicly that Baleba is not for sale, but United are still monitoring the 22-year-old midfielder. And they have been given hope that a deal can be struck in the upcoming off-season, partly due to a gradual decline in his performances for Fabian Hurzeler’s side.",
      "The Sun reports that United are ‘increasingly confident’ of getting their man this summer, with an overhaul of midfield in the works. Baleba is under contract with Brighton until June 2028, but the club have shown time and again that they are willing to do business because they back their recruitment system to find a replacement.",
      "Baleba may not be the only arrival at Old Trafford in the summer, too, with United hoping to sign more than one central midfielder. Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Bournemouth’s Alex Scott are also being monitored.",
      "Casemiro is expected to leave United upon the expiry of his contract in June, while there are growing concerns about the future of Bruno Fernandes following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim. Meanwhile, Kobbie Mainoo has been unsettled this season amid interest from Napoli.",
      "United are currently being managed by Michael Carrick but will appoint a long-term successor to Amorim in the summer. While the identity of their new boss and their tactical outlook will shape their transfer plans, the hierarchy have already started work on targets for what will be a hugely important summer.",
      "Carlos Baleba could leave Brighton in the summer(Image: Warren Little/Getty Images)",
      "Brighton have shown themselves to be tough negotiators, driving hard bargains for their star players previously, and deputy chairman Paul Barber recently set out their stance. “[We’ve had] no call from Old Trafford, no call from anyone connected to Manchester United,” he said this month.",
      "“We have no plans or desire to sell Carlos Baleba in this window or any future window. We know he’s a talented player and I am sure he’s got a lot of options ahead of him in the future. For us he’s an important player in the second half of the season and we’re looking forward to having back from AFCON.”",
      "Meanwhile, Brighton chairman Tony Bloom told The Argus in October: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga. There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn’t available this summer and they went away.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roy Keane poked fun at comments made by Michael Carrick's wife(Image: Stick to Football)",
      "Roy Keane aimed a dig at new Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick's wife while discussing the 44-year-old's return to Old Trafford. Carrick was confirmed as United's boss until the end of the season on Wednesday following Ruben Amorim's sacking earlier this month.",
      "Carrick previously took charge of three games in 2021 before joining Championship side Middlesbrough. He returned to the club this week following positive discussions with the club's hierarchy.",
      "His appointment was a main talking point on the Stick to Football podcast and Keane seemed to reignite a previous feud with Carrick's wife, Lisa, when discussing the chances of success this season. When speaking about the impact of Carrick on the United squad, Keane said; \"His wife can always come in [if Carrick doesn't do well], cause she's got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She's probably doing the team talk.\"",
      "In 2014, Lisa responded to Keane's criticism of Carrick's performance and post-match interview following the 2-0 defeat to Greek side Olympiacos in the Champions League. Carrick's wife posted on Twitter, now X: \"Roy Keane what a ****, says anything to provoke a reaction.\"",
      "She then deleted the tweet and apologised for her words. \"Deleted my tweet... Emotions got the better of me,” she wrote.",
      "Keane was also critical of Carrick's backroom staff members. Former England assistant manager Steve Holland will be Carrick's number two, with Jonny Evans, Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion making up the management team.",
      "\"He's on the beach two weeks ago, Jonny Evans,\" Keane said. \"Jonny Evans leaves Man United four or five weeks ago as a loans manager and then Darren Fletcher gives him a job, strangely enough gives him a job.",
      "Jonathan Woodgate has joined Man United's coaching staff(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "\"He has two games, Fletch goes and Carrick gives him a job, great isn't it. We should all go to Barbados for a week. You're on about getting your coaching staff in, you're praising one of them saying he's experienced and then we just let the other two go, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans.",
      "\"What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach of Man United's first team? He left the job four weeks ago - loans manager, and ironically comes back working with the first team. That's a big step up, isn't it?\"",
      "He added: \"My point is, if Steve Holland is on the training pitch at least you know they're going to get top class training sessions. I'm not saying they weren't before because they probably were as well. I don't know what Evans or Woodgate are like as coaches, don't know what Carrick is like as a coach.\"",

      "Michael Carrick will lead Manchester United for the rest of the season(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have been warned that making Michael Carrick the club's permanent head coach would be repeating past failures. The former Red Devils midfielder was appointed interim manager earlier this week, relieving Darren Fletcher of his caretaker post following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "While Carrick's time at the helm will only last until the end of the season, United do have previous when it comes to rewarding temporary managers with permanent contracts following a run of good form.",
      "It was over seven years ago, in December 2018, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer returned to Old Trafford as a caretaker manager after Jose Mourinho was dismissed. And three months later, the Norwegian, who won 14 of 19 games in charge, was handed a three-year deal as the club's new head coach.",
      "United's good form and performances led to former players, including Rio Ferdinand, pressuring the board to appoint Solskjaer on a permanent basis. Rio Ferdinand infamously told the club to give the Norwegian a blank cheque after Man United knocked PSG out of the Champions League.",
      "An excitable Ferdinand said live on BT Sport after United's 3-1 win in Paris: \"Listen, Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done now since he's come in.",
      "\"Let him sign the contract and go. Ole's at the wheel. He's doing it, he's doing his thing. Man United are back!\" Ferdinand's comments are infamous for a reason, as United never returned to the same form they showed during Solskjaer's reign.",
      "They went without silverware in the three years he was at the club before he was sacked following an embarrassing 4-1 defeat by Watford. It was on talkSPORT that former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy urged United not to make the same mistake when it comes to Carrick's situation.",
      "The Manchester United icon infamously claimed \"Ole's at the wheel\" three years ago after the club knocked PSG out of the Champions League(Image: BT Sport)",
      "When asked by Jim White if there was a possibility Carrick could be handed the permanent job should he transform United's fortunes, Murphy said: \"I don't think so this time, I think they'll have learned from their mistakes.",
      "\"Even if he has a really good spell and they have a bump and start playing some good stuff and even sneak into the top five or top four depending if we get the five places.",
      "The Norwegian was sacked after three years in charge of United(Image: Getty)",
      "\"Will they go down that line again of rewarding and then giving him a contract and a year later be thinking 'now we need a proper manager or a senior manager'. I don't think they'll make it. I think he knows it's interim. I don't think whatever he does is going to become permanent, I really don't.\"",
      "Former Middlesbrough manager Carrick has quite the test in his first game on Saturday as his side host Manchester City, who have one foot in the Carabao Cup final after beating Newcastle United 2-0 at St James' Park on Tuesday.",

      "Thomas Tuchel's current deal with the Football Association expires after the World Cup(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Without giving away trade secrets, there is a strong possibility the next question a member of the media puts to Thomas Tuchel will not be exclusively about England. It will also be about Manchester United.",
      "At the moment, Tuchel is the fourth favourite to be the manager of United for the first game of the 2026/27 season, behind Michael Carrick, Oliver Glasner and Sir Gareth Southgate. Odds of 10-1 against Tuchel being at Old Trafford next season seem quite tempting.",
      "Because in the cold light of day, he is the outstanding candidate. For what it is worth, I am not alone in believing Carrick will get a long-term crack at it if he inspires an upsurge in form and secures a place in next season’s Champions League.",
      "And I am not alone in believing Carrick could make a very decent long-term fist of things. He is a well-respected character and could prove to be a good coach of elite players.",
      "But Tuchel’s credentials at the highest level of club football are first-class. He has won three domestic league titles, a Champions League, two domestic cups and a Club World Cup, amongst other things.",
      "He has been voted UEFA Coach of the Year and The Best FIFA Football Coach. Carrick failed to get Middlesbrough promoted from the Championship.",
      "And, as it stands right now, Tuchel is available towards the end of July - no compensation payment required. But Ruben Amorim’s departure and United’s current situation will be the subject of a lot of discussion in the corridors of Football Association power.",
      "Michael Carrick has been given until the end of the season as Manchester United's head coach(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "They really should not do it - remember Fabio Capello and his contract improvement ahead of a disastrous World Cup 2010 - but do not be at all surprised if the FA, privately at least, make it clear to Tuchel that they want him to stay on for the home Euros in 2028.",
      "Qualifying was always going to be routine but Tuchel has been a big hit with the FA and it is certain they would like him to lead England into the Euros. At the last international gathering, Tuchel said he was happy with the short-term arrangement that has the World Cup as his one, only and final target, and that the arrangement was at his insistence.",
      "It helps when you win games without conceding goals but Tuchel has looked increasingly enamoured with life as England boss. There is a twinkle in his eye.",
      "Ruben Amorim lasted only 14 months in charge at Old Trafford(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Would he fancy two more years? There has to be a chance of that. Which should be on the agenda when Manchester United’s executive committee meeting takes place.",
      "If they do want Tuchel as their next manager, they should act now. It would show the German they mean business, it would show him they really want him, rather than having a plan that consists mainly of seeing how the land lies in mid-summer.",
      "A national coach agreeing a club deal prior to a major tournament is certainly not without precedent. In fact, it is not without precedent in United’s recent history.",
      "Louis van Gaal took charge of Manchester United after leading the Netherlands in World Cup 2014(Image: Action Images)",
      "In May, 2014, Louis van Gaal was confirmed as the club’s next manager ahead of the Dutchman taking his country to the World Cup in Brazil. Van Gaal then took the Netherlands to a semi-final penalty shootout defeat to Argentina and a third-place playoff win over Brazil.",
      "But you can rest assured the FA would not be happy if United approached Tuchel in the build-up to the finals. That, though, should not be United’s concern.",
      "They might not fancy a manager who has never really hung around too long in a particular job, they might be more than happy to hope Carrick makes a good case for himself. But if they do want Tuchel and if they are a serious operation, they need to act sooner rather than later.",

Michael Carrick has been appointed interim manager until the summer, when Ratcliffe & Co are expected to make a permanent appointment.",

      "Meulensteen said: \"Since INEOS and Jim Ratcliffe have come in, do they actually know what they're doing? You need to look at everybody in those positions, and they have to take responsibility in those important positions. Have they got the pedigree?",
      "\"If you look at Jason Wilcox (director of football) and how he’s ended up in that position, it was from being a youth coach, then ended up at Southampton, then you’re the technical director and the main man responsible for things at Manchester United.",

      "Jonny Evans, another of the club's former players, will form part of the staff. As will ex-Leeds star Jonathan Woodgate, who served as Carrick's assistant when he was in charge of Middlesbrough.",
      "Former England No.2 Steve Holland, who worked alongside Gareth Southgate, was the surprise appointment but Neville claimed he was \"a serious operator\" - but Keane called out the other men Carrick bought in.",
      "The former captain said on Stick to Football: \"He's on the beach two weeks ago Jonny Evans. Jonny Evans leaves Man United four or five weeks ago as a loans manager and then Darren Fletcher gives him a job, strangely enough gives him a job.",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville had a frank exchange about the make up of the Man Utd backroom staff(Image: )",
      "\"He has two games, Fletch goes and Carrick gives him a job, great isn't it. We should all go to Barbados for a week. You're on about getting your coaching staff in, you're praising one of them saying he's experienced and then we just let the other two go, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans. What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach of Man United's first team?\"",
      "Keane then targeted the decision to bring in Holland as the assistant manager, which led to Neville defending the former England man. He said: \"My point is, if Steve Holland is on the training pitch at least you know they're going to get top class training sessions. I'm not saying they weren't before because they probably were as well. I don't know what Evans or Woodgate are like as coaches, don't know what Carrick is like as a coach.\"",
      "Jonny Evans credentials have been questioned after he was hired(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Keane questioned whether former pros \"warranted\" their roles on the coaching staff but Neville defended the decision to bring in ex-players insisting, despite the criticism levelled at those in Manchester, that plenty of clubs have done so in the past.",
      "\"I can see why you'd bring in an ex-player who knows the club, Mourinho did that at Chelsea, that's not an unusual thing,\" he said.",
      "Keane then fired a fresh dig at Sir Alex Ferguson and highlighted how Darren Fletcher, another former player, didn't get any benefit from his experience at the club. He said: \"Before Burnley and Brighton at home.... Fletch knows the club, works with the academy, he knows the girl in the canteen, he rings Sir Alex Ferguson to ask him what colour socks he's going to wear in the morning. How did the two games go?\"",
      "As the pair continued to clash over the backroom staff Keane diverted away from Holland and continued to seek answers about how and why Evans has been included.",
      "He remarked: \"You don't know anything about Jonny Evans' coaching - because he's never coached! That's my point! But he's gone into Man United - but that's ok because we've got Stevie Holland, our new guru! So excited about these people their experience, you worked with him at England...\"",

      "Manchester United will make three appointments following Sir Jim Ratcliffe complaints(Image: (Photo by Matt West/Shutterstock))",
      "Manchester United are set to make three new additions to their data department following complaints from Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Director of data Michael Sansoni arrived this past summer and has been challenged to help modernise the club's data set up with a trio of new additions planned.",
      "\"Think APIs, machine learning, AI, web tools and streaming data pipelines, we’re working on it all to drive performance on the pitch and across the whole club.\"",
      "The three new staff members would all conduct their work out of the club's Carrington training ground following a £50million refurbishment. Ratcliffe has previously been critical of United's data department with these appointments expected to help.",
      "During an interview with United We Stand magazine, he said: \"Until we are as good as anyone in the world, then it’s not good enough for Manchester United. We must have the best recruitment in the world.",
      "\"Data analysis comes alongside recruitment. It doesn’t really exist here. We’re still in the last century on data analysis here. There’s an immense amount of useful data that we can get from data analysis and we’re in the 'very poor' bracket with data analysis here.",
      "\"These things don’t happen overnight. You can’t just flick a light switch and sort out recruitment. It’s all about people and we need to find the right people.”",
      "Comments from Sansoni emerged during the summer transfer window as he stated that \"meaningful progress\" was being made with \"new methodologies starting to take shape and two fantastic signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\". He added: \"I’ve inherited a brilliant team: smart, committed, and hungry to make a difference and together we’re building a world-class data and AI function to power decision-making across football and the wider club.",
      "\"The challenge is great, but so is the opportunity. We’re just getting started.\"",
      "Michael Carrick was confirmed as Manchester United's interim head coach earlier this week(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "United have already confirmed several new appointments in the last week with Michael Carrick joining as interim head coach. He will be joined in the dugout on a temporary basis by Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Travis Binnion, Jonny Evans and Craig Mawson.",
      "Carrick's first game in charge is quite the challenge with Pep Guardiola's side heading to Old Trafford for the Manchester derby on Saturday lunchtime. No European football and early exits from both domestic competitions means United will only play 40 games this season which could be an advantage on others that have packed fixture schedules.",
      "Following the visit of Manchester City, United face Arsenal, Fulham, Tottenham, West Ham United, Everton and Crystal Palace over the next six weeks.",

      "David Moyes could welcome some new faces at Everton this month(Image: Getty)",
      "Everton and David Moyes are welcoming a new era at Hill Dickinson Stadium this season and so far have left the January transfer market alone. But before February arrives, there could still be some incomings for the Toffees.",
      "With a new place to call home, the Friedkin Group's first full season as owners of Everton has so far been satisfactory. After 21 games played, they sit 12th in the Premier League, but just six points away from fourth-place Liverpool.",
      "The summer window saw the arrival of some pivotal puzzle pieces. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was signed from Chelsea for £25million and although he is currently sidelined, his dynamic left-footed playmaking and stellar set pieces have been crucial to the Toffees' successes.",
      "Jack Grealish has become a player renewed at Hill Dickinson Stadium and the promise of £40m man Tyler Dibling remains untapped. But some areas of the squad require improvement.",
      "Thierno Barry was another summer recruit and he cost a whopping £27.5m when he signed from Spanish side Villarreal. He had bagged 11 goals in all competitions for them in the previous campaign.",
      "Aged just 23, it seems too late to write him off, but the striker just isn't cutting it in the No. 9 position. Beto was another big-money signing in the final years of Farhad Moshiri's ownership, and he too has shown little to convince fans that he can be Everton's starting striker for years to come.",
      "With goals clearly an issue, rumours have suggested that Fenerbahce's Youssef En-Nesyri could be snapped up for £20m. He has scored eight goals in all competitions for the Turkish side this season.",
      "En-Nesyri is reportedly on Everton's radar(Image: Getty)",
      "However, En-Nesyri is already 28 and the price mooted for an ageing player may not be a wise financial choice. Instead, eyes should turn to a cheaper, short-term option, with the view that either Barry can develop, or a younger marksman with potential arrives in the summer.",
      "Everton should look no further than West Ham ace Callum Wilson. In a disjointed team, Wilson has managed four league goals this season but has been pushed down the pecking order due to a flurry of new striker arrivals. He is not a glamorous name, but he knows Moyes, has an eye for goal, wouldn't step on any toes and would be cost-effective on a short loan.",
      "Since he arrived from Manchester United in 2022, James Garner has swiftly become one of the Toffees' most loyal and impressive servants. This season, his creative play has become a key component of Moyes' improved results and his versatility cannot be overlooked. He is more than comfortable pulling the strings in midfield or slotting in at right-back.",
      "At 24, he has many years at the top ahead of him, but his current deal at Hill Dickinson Stadium expires in June 2026. The club do have the unilateral option to extend his contract by an extra year.",
      "Reports suggest that negotiations have begun with Garner over a new long-term deal and these must be concluded quickly. This is because the Daily Mail reports United could return and try to re-sign Garner this window in a cut-price deal, thanks to his expiring contract.",
      "Garner has been exceptional this season(Image: Getty)",
      "Although Garner and Jake O'Brien have performed well in the right-back position this season, there is still an underlying concern that neither naturally plays there. Seamus Coleman for so many reliable years manned the right-back spot for the Toffees and now could be the time to bring in a long-term successor and give O'Brien and Garner the chance to feature elsewhere.",
      "Brooke Norton-Cuffy is a former Chelsea and Arsenal academy full-back who moved to Genoa in Italy in 2024. The England under-21 star had previously spent time on loan at Coventry City and Millwall.",
      "Norton-Cuffy has impressed for Genoa(Image: Getty)",
      "However, in Serie A he has become a powerful and dominant wing-back with his game stepping up to a whole new level. Norton-Cuffy is one of the league's finest defensive talents, now 22 years old, and he possesses eye-watering pace, physicality and strength.",
      "Everton are reportedly monitoring the young defender and should make a move this window for a £17.5m-rated player who holds homegrown status. Though they would face competition from the likes of Juventus for his signature.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

United are currently searching for a permanent boss after sacking Ruben Amorim last week.",
      "Club legend Michael Carrick has been named interim head coach until the summer, tasked with dragging United back into the Champions League. The ex-Middlesbrough manager impressed United's hierarchy in discussions and will be backed by coaches Steve Holland and Travis Binnion at Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick will take charge for Saturday's Manchester derby against Manchester City (12.30pm). However, his temporary appointment hasn't stopped speculation swirling around who will permanently fill the manager's office.",
      "The Red Devils are expected to name a permanent head coach once the campaign concludes, with a host of potential candidates in the frame. One of those being linked is PSG's Enrique, who still has 18 months remaining on his deal with the French champions.",
      "Match of the Day pundit Murphy has shared his thoughts on why the United role might tempt the former Barcelona boss. He told Boyle Sports: \"If there's an opportunity to get Luis Enrique, absolutely Manchester United have to go for it. He's a top coach, plays the right way, is really attack-minded, and demands a lot from his players.",
      "\"He'd need a revamp of the squad to play the way he does with the PSG team, but he's obviously one of the best coaches out there. So, yes, if there's even a one percent chance he won't sign a new deal, jump on it and try to get him.",
      "\"The appeal of United is still there for any top manager. They are one of the biggest clubs in the world, and if you can be the man to get them back on top and competing again, you're going to be idolised.",
      "Luis Enrique led PSG to Champions League glory in May(Image: 2025 Getty Images)",
      "\"I think that's a challenge someone like Enrique would relish. Thomas Tuchel, even, is another top coach who is supposed to finish after the World Cup.",
      "\"Maybe Tuchel is a bit more confrontational, willing to speak his mind and go against the grain at the clubs he's been at, so that might be off-putting for the hierarchy at Manchester United, whereas Enrique seems to get on with it. But yes, there's not a United fan anywhere that wouldn't be delighted with Enrique.\"",
      "This follows Enrique's recent comments about his future in Paris, where he dismissed rumours of him turning down a new contract at PSG as \"fake news\". The ex-Barcelona boss said: \"These are rumours that always circulate at PSG.",
      "\"We are used to them, they are private matters and will remain so. There is a lot of 'fake news' and they will not destabilise either the players or the team.",
      "\"It's normal to have talks, but they remain private. We know what we want, and that's the most important thing. We are calm and relaxed.\"",

The former Middlesbrough head coach will be tasked with guiding United to a respectable finish in the Premier League season with the club already knocked out of the FA Cup to Brighton and League Cup to Grimsby Town.",
      "William Hill's spokesperson Lee Phelps said: “Michael Carrick is the latest former Manchester United player to step into the dugout at Old Trafford to try and steady the ship, and we make him 11/2 to lead his side to a top-four finish.",
      "“It looks likely to be a baptism of fire for Carrick though, with a Manchester derby, league leaders Arsenal and a clash with a tough-to-beat Fulham side upcoming in his first three games and we are 11/1 that United lose all of those games, while it’s 15/8 that they concede six or more goals.",
      "“The Premier League giants are 7/2 to finish the season in the bottom half of the table under Carrick, but the former United midfielder could be given time, and we price him at 11/10 to be in the Old Trafford hotseat come the beginning of next season.”",
      "Carrick spent two and a half years at Middlesbrough, guiding the club to a play-off finish in his first season. However, his subsequent two campaigns were less successful, leading to his dismissal last June. After discussions with United CEO Omar Berrada and sporting director Jason Wilcox, Carrick has been identified as the ideal candidate to guide the team forward on an interim basis. The club opted for a temporary appointment following the sacking of Ruben Amorim last week. Amorim’s departure, after just 14 months in charge, came in the wake of a turbulent festive period and a well-publicized falling out with Wilcox.",
      "United will now begin an extensive search for a permanent manager, with England boss Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti, and Mauricio Pochettino reportedly among the leading candidates. During his playing career, Carrick won 17 trophies with Manchester United, including five Premier League titles and a Champions League. The club’s FA Cup victory in 2016 ensured that the 34-time England international completed the set of major club honours.",

      "Steve Holland is not a coach to be messed with. Having worked with some of the biggest superstars in the game, he takes no prisoners when it comes to reputations and egos. And his attention to detail has become the stuff of legend. Just ask Arsenal defender Ben White.",
      "During the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, White was part of the England squad preparing for a group game against the USA. And Holland was less than impressed with White's attitude, when he decided the full back didn't share the same obsession with football he had - or expected. One barbed comment towards White, which is understood to have been made in front of teammates, left White so upset he asked to go home.",
      "Which he did, with Gareth Southgate's blessing. White hasn't pulled on an England shirt since. Southgate wanted him to, but White refused the invitation.",
      "It must be assumed White had no desire to work under Holland again, given what happened at England's training base at Souq Al Wakra, on the outskirts of Doha. Yet the fall-out between White and Holland is a cautionary tale for the Manchester United squad, now Holland has been appointed No.2 to Michael Carrick.",
      "United have broken with tradition and made a shrewd appointment. Let's be honest, the current United team needs an experienced hand to guide it out of the current carnage, not to mention give certain individuals a kick up the backside. United need some structure and identity.",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick has overseen two training sessions at Carrington with 26 players confirmed to have taken part ahead of Saturday's derby vs Manchester City. The former midfielder was appointed until the end of the season on Tuesday.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad have been pictured back at Carrington after Cameroon and Ivory Coast exited the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) last weekend in the quarter-finals. Before leaving for AFCON, both men had enjoyed a good start to the season.",
      "Amad had recorded two goals and three assists for the Reds this season. Meanwhile, Mbeumo is the club's top goalscorer with six to his name in 16 matches. Bruno Fernandes is now just one goal behind him on five for the season.",
      "The captain was among the senior players training alongside some of the academy stars who were given the chance to train with the first team. Habeeb Ogunneye spent the first part of this season on loan at League Two Newport County but his spell in south Wales ended on Wednesday.",
      "Matheus Cunha was pictured along with Bryan Mbeumo(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Ogunneye trained with the first team after his return to Carrington ahead of the derby. Shea Lacey also joined the list of players who trained with the first team on Wednesday.

      "Michael Carrick was confirmed as head coach this week.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Manchester United are not expected to deviate from their January transfer window plan following Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach. Carrick returned to United this week to oversee the remainder of the season, and there has been speculation that he could be backed with new additions.",
      "It's understood, however, that United are unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets are not available in the winter window. United committed an outlay of £215million (excluding add-ons) to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in the summer window, which the club views as the preferred time to land their top targets for value-for-money transfer fees.",
      "Carrick has just 17 games to oversee in the Premier League due to United's early exits from cup competitions, and the 44-year-old will try to steer the club into the Champions League. Investment has already been earmarked to strengthen United's midfield at the end of the season. Casemiro is out of contract in June, while Bruno Fernandes is expected to consider his future after the World Cup.",
      "Speaking in October, Fernandes said: \"I haven't spoken with anyone. I could tell you that there are still people talking to me and saying that they will be very eager to have me next year, of course.",
      "\"But from my side, that's not talked about. Because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's future at his boyhood club remains uncertain. Mainoo has not made a start in the Premier League this season and has been frustrated with his lack of game time.",
      "United considered a move for Carlos Baleba last summer. Brighton valued the midfielder in excess of £100million, and United focused their resources on other areas of the team. Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have also been tracked.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and at least one member of the Glazer family visited Carrington on Thursday for the latest Manchester United executive committee meeting. It is the first time a Glazer has seen the refurbished Carrington.",
      "The meeting was originally scheduled to take place in a different location, but it was relocated to Manchester so the club's leadership team could be on-site to support Michael Carrick following his appointment. Ratcliffe is a United co-owner and has control of football operations. The six Glazer siblings are the majority owners of United and still rubber-stamp all important decisions at the club.",
      "It's thought at least one of Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer has visited Carrington for the meeting, which is also set to be attended by Omar Berrada, chief executive, and Roger Bell, chief financial officer.",
      "Carrick will be spoken to by United's hierarchy ahead of the Manchester derby this weekend, his first game as head coach. United decided to sack Ruben Amorim amid rising tensions with the board.",
      "United's executive committee meetings are usually held in Monaco, but relocating to Manchester has given the hierarchy a chance to speak to Carrick in person for the first time since his return. Carrick has inherited a side that could still secure European football. Darren Fletcher, speaking during his stint as caretaker, stressed that a return to the Champions League must be the target, and United are just three points adrift of Liverpool in fourth position.",
      "When Carrick's appointment was announced, he said: \"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour. I know what it takes to succeed here, my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",

      "“If he wins every game, look, we could be sat here in the season where he’s done unbelievably well, and we’re always thinking the fans are up and they’re in the Champions League places, fifth or whatever. It could happen if there’s a good run and we could all be getting swayed with it.",

She's probably doing the team talk.\"",
      "In 2014, Lisa responded to Keane's criticism of Carrick's performance and post-match interview following the 2-0 defeat to Greek side Olympiacos in the Champions League. Carrick's wife posted on Twitter, now X: \"Roy Keane what a ****, says anything to provoke a reaction.\"",

United have been linked with a move for the Brazilian ever since last summer, but the club opted not to bring a new midfielder to Old Trafford ahead of the current campaign.",
      "Midfield has been an area of the squad that United have been heavily linked with strengthening for several months, and the rumours have continued into the January transfer window.",
      "Gomes’ future at Wolves has been the subject of speculation for some time, but now there is more than just United in the running for his signature.",

      "The report also claims that United’s former head coach, Ruben Amorim, specifically requested that United explore a move for Gomes. However, it remains to be seen if the Old Trafford hierarchy will do so now that Amorim has been replaced by interim head coach Michael Carrick.",
      "Wolves reportedly value Gomes at around £43million (€50million), but it’s still unclear if that is a price that United would be willing to meet before the transfer window closes.

      "Michael Carrick has returned to Manchester United for his second spell as interim head coach(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Few managers have had as tough a first test as Michael Carrick will face this weekend when he leads Manchester United for his second stint as interim head coach. Facing Manchester City under ordinary circumstances is a fixture that piles on the pressure for whoever is in the Old Trafford dugout.",
      "But considering Carrick returned to Carrington on Tuesday and held his first training session on Wednesday, the prospect of the derby now becomes an even tougher challenge than it already was. In these sessions before the game, the 44-year-old will get a good gauge of which players should start against City.",
      "Fortunately for Carrick and United, there are a few players in the current squad who are certainties to start against City. The first has to be Senne Lammens.",
      "When it became clear Andre Onana had no future at Old Trafford, eyebrows were raised when Lammens was signed to replace him. He had only played one full season for Royal Antwerp and there were concerns the leap to United would be too big.",
      "With Onana gone, Altay Bayindir initially stepped in to replace him but after the defeat to Brentford, Ruben Amorim decided to give the Belgian a chance and he has not looked back since.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is another certainty to be picked this weekend. The captain has been the best signing since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club. His consistency for the Reds has been unmatched and he has managed this in teams that fall below the lofty expectations at United.",
      "Fernandes is one of the few players United have who can create something out of nothing and that quality cannot be underestimated. The Reds will expect to have less of the ball, despite being at home on Saturday, considering City's possession-based style.",
      "But if United are going to utilise their potentially limited chances, they need Fernandes to be in attacking midfield, creating opportunities for the third player in the squad who has to start on Saturday. Benjamin Sesko would not have been a guaranteed starter as recently as a few weeks ago, but how things have changed in such a short period of time.",
      "His brace against Burnley followed by another at home to Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup will have boosted Sesko's confidence. With the Slovenian back amongst the goals, it would be a mistake not to pick him and effectively risk him losing form.",
      "It also helps Sesko's case that there is no standout alternative to him. Matheus Cunha leading the line is an option but he does not have as much influence on the game in the centre-forward role as he would in Carrick's attacking midfield three.",
      "With those three inclusions effectively locked in, the interim head coach now has the small task of choosing which of their teammates line up alongside them. No pressure.",

      "Harry Maguire could leave Manchester United in the summer(Image: Martin Rickett/PA Wire)",
      "Manchester United are said to be considering signing Murillo from Nottingham Forest during the summer transfer window as a replacement for the out-of-contract Harry Maguire.",
      "Maguire's current deal is due to expire at the end of this season, after only signing a one-year extension with the club last summer. The former United captain has started just four matches this season due to a hamstring injury.",
      "Ayden Heaven has stepped up in his absence to start the club's last eight Premier League matches. United have Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt as their other central defenders in a back four.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that United are targeting a replacement for Maguire, with Murillo one of the prominent options on their radar. Just a year after signing a new contract, the Brazilian is reportedly open to a move away from Forest.",
      "Murillo, whose transfermarkt value is £48million, said after committing his future to the club: \"I'm very thankful and very happy that there are four more years to come. I'm thankful to everyone for the support – not just to me, but to my family as well.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"Everywhere I go, every shop, wherever it is, they treat my family and me really well, so I'm very grateful for everything they do for the team and for me. I'm sure that we've got a big future in front of us.\"",
      "Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis also added: \"We dream big, and so does he. He believes in the power of what we are doing at this great club. When we share the same bold ambitions, there is no limit to what we can achieve together.\"",
      "They are seven points clear of the relegation zone, but Forest are also sure not to be competing in any UEFA competitions next season unless they win the Europa League. United are 11 points better off than Murillo's current club and are aiming for a return to Europe next season.",
      "Maguire, meanwhile, has already spoken about the reality that, as it stands, this is his last year at the club. He said after United beat Liverpool in October: \"I've been here seven years now, so it's been tough not getting that win.",
      "\"It's been on my mind a little bit, to be honest. I'm in my last year now, so this could be the last time I played at Anfield for this club, so it's really important that I've come here and ticked that one off.\"",
      "Speaking about his contract extension in August, Maguire said: \"Last year, the clause was in their hands, so there was no option for me there. There was no talking; it was just that they activated it, and it got extended.",
      "\"This year, obviously, I'm up at the end of the year. I'm pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can't leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract.",
      "\"I'm sure over the next few months they'll sit down, and we'll have to have a conversation about where we want to go and if they want to extend, or obviously the transfer window will open again in January.",
      "\"Obviously, I have something in my mind about what I want to do and what I want to be. I don't want to put it out there to everybody, but it's an amazing club to play for, and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.\"",

      "Michael Carrick is back at Manchester United as interim manager(Image: PA)",
      "As we near the midpoint of the January transfer window, Manchester United have yet to bolster their squad with new signings. However, there has been a shake-up in the managerial department, with Ruben Amorim being dismissed and Michael Carrick stepping in as interim manager for the remainder of the season.",
      "The appointment of former United midfielder Carrick was announced on Tuesday, and he will be immediately thrust into the thick of things. United are set to host Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime, aiming to avenge their 3-0 loss at the Etihad Stadium last September.",
      "It's uncertain whether there will be significant transfer activity given the absence of a permanent manager. Last winter window saw Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven move to Old Trafford, but much of the transfer talk around United appears to relate to the summer window.",
      "Despite this, the potential of rival clubs vying for players on United's radar could alter this approach. Two such players form the focus of our Manchester United transfer round-up.",
      "Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes is among the Premier League talents to be linked with United as they look to strengthen their midfield. The club was already aware that Napoli could pose competition for the Brazilian international, but now another contender has emerged.",
      "Gomes, who transferred to Wolves from Flamengo in 2023, seems to be the perfect fit. However, it's reported that Wolves are eager to retain the midfielder - valued at over £40m - as they continue their battle against relegation.",
      "The 24-year-old was gradually integrated into the squad after signing under Julen Lopetegui in January 2023 but has been a regular since the Spanish manager's exit. He has only missed seven Premier League games since the start of the 2023/24 season and his potential suitors aren't deterred by the fact that his team are 14 points away from safety.",
      "United have long admired Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta but they're not the only ones. Sky Sport Italia reports that Juventus have made a bid for the French international, though Palace appear to be holding out for move than the £30m on the table.",
      "Mateta's contract expires at the end of the 2026/27 season and it has been suggested that his contract situation is responsible for the decrease in the valuation. United were linked in 2025 only to seemingly be put off by an asking price approaching £50m.",
      "Crystal Palace star Jean-Philippe Mateta has plenty of admirers(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Former Mainz striker Mateta has netted eight goals in 21 Premier League matches this season, following double-digit tallies in the previous two seasons. The 28-year-old also boasts two goals from three senior appearances for France, having made his debut for Les Bleus in October.",
      "Juventus, who look set to miss out to Roma in the hunt for Donyell Malen, are on the hunt for attacking reinforcements after losing Dusan Vlahovic to injury. Serbian striker Vlahovic, whose contract expires in the summer, hasn't seen action since late November due to an adductor injury.",
      "On the other hand, United filled their striker void with the £73m signing of Benjamin Sesko last summer. However, the Slovenian has yet to fully hit his stride this season, and with Joshua Zirkzee seemingly set for a departure this year, Mateta could continue to be on United's radar.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate has plenty of thoughts on the importance of the title of manager as opposed to head coach(Image: PA)",
      "Gareth Southgate says he has no issue with directors of football eroding a manager's authority after Manchester United sacked Ruben Amorim.",
      "The former England boss describes the root cause of Amorim's demise as a power struggle with club executives. United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, who is a former England teammate of Southgate's, won out in the end.",
      "While debating the difference between a manager and a head coach Southgate - previously linked with a move to United - revealed that he insisted on changing his title from head coach to manager after being offered the role. He now refers to himself as a 'leader, manager, coach - in that order'.",
      "A lengthy LinkedIn post titled 'Manager v Head Coach', which Southgate describes as his \"thoughts on the importance of the title of manager as opposed to head coach\", reads: \"In the last fortnight, three of Europe's biggest football clubs, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Chelsea have parted company with their head coaches. Of the three, Enzo Maresca served the longest period at 18 months.",
      "\"Although each coach left under slightly different circumstances and for more than one reason, power struggles either with club executives (Amorim), club employees (Maresca) or players (Alonso) were ultimately the root cause of the end of each tenure.",
      "\"The erosion of a manager's authority has been a gradual process over many years. It has accelerated with the widespread introduction of football, technical, or sporting directors, who now oversee long-term football strategy, report directly to CEOs or owners (or both), and sit structurally above the head coach. Personally, I have no issue with this evolution.",
      "\"Strategy, culture, planning, and continuity are critical to success in any organisation — and a football club is no different. A head coach neither has the time nor, in many cases, the specialist expertise to manage complex player contracts, oversee global scouting networks, or run sophisticated data operations. Equally, it makes little sense to dismantle medical or sports science departments every time there is a change of head coach.",
      "\"However, in a classic example of Parkinson's Law (where time saved by reducing responsibilities is quickly filled by something else), the modern head coach now finds themselves managing larger squads, bigger backroom teams, far greater analytical demands, and ever-increasing media and commercial obligations.\"",
      "Southgate's comments on backroom teams come days after the announcement that his former England assistant manager, Steve Holland, will support Michael Carrick at United until the end of the season. The former Chelsea assistant is part of the coaching team alongside Craig Mawson, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "Southgate's post continues: \"Contrary to the belief of some fans that the role has become simpler (\"they just need to coach\"), the opposite is true. Add to this the complexity of managing modern-day players (many of whom are effectively individual brands), alongside the financial stakes for clubs, and the relentless scrutiny of both traditional and social media, and you have a significant melting pot of problems and pressure. This is not helped by the subtle, sometimes unintentional, shift in power and status implied by moving from the title of manager to head coach.",
      "\"People may argue that 'it's just a title', or merely semantics. From personal experience, it's not. So much so that when I was offered the role of head coach for the England National team, I insisted on changing the title to manager. Even though I consider myself calm, collaborative and confident, I understood the importance of authority, influence and control when leading a football operation.",
      "\"You may have noticed that my current LinkedIn title reads 'leader, manager, coach' - in that order. That is entirely intentional. It reflects the hierarchy of skills I believed were required to run the England team effectively.",
      "\"The leader operates in the public eye, engaging fans, setting the vision, shaping the culture, and championing and protecting the players and staff.",
      "\"The manager is 'managing' stakeholders, departments and people, maximising collaboration and making plans stay on track. Oh, and don't forget the role of persuading 25 financially independent elite performers to put collective purpose ahead of their ego.",
      "\"Finally, the coach works on the pitch, setting the style of play, preparing tactics to exploit opponents, and developing the technical abilities of individual players.",
      "\"My belief is that we should embrace a modernised version of the traditional manager, where we recognise the people they lead, manage and coach. As I once said to my bosses at England: players are not magnets on a tactics board that can simply be moved around. They are human beings. And managing that reality is at the heart of modern football leadership.\"",

      "Carlo Ancelotti has been tentatively linked with the Man United manager's job(Image: Burak Akbulut/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Carlo Ancelotti has previously criticised the Glazers for their management of Manchester United, leading to speculation that the esteemed manager could be a potential candidate to succeed Ruben Amorim in the summer. The Old Trafford hierarchy chose to part ways with Amorim following an outburst that appeared to question his position within the club.",
      "Amorim was the first full-time appointment made by Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe as part of their joint ownership of United.",
      "With no immediate successor for Amorim in sight, they have appointed Michael Carrick as interim head coach until the end of the season..",
      "Consequently, the list of possible candidates for the summer is expanding, including international managers such as Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, and Julian Nagelsmann who may be available, reports the Mirror.",
      "There's also Ancelotti, currently managing the Brazil national team, whom former United assistant Rene Meulensteen believes should be considered by the club.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti is the guy with the type of pedigree who can handle it because he’s done it, he’s seen it and he knows what a winning culture looks like,\" Meulensteen said. \"I don’t think Ancelotti would listen to anybody else. Ancelotti would say this is what I’m doing. I’m managing what I’m here to do.",
      "“Football has changed. You’ve got Directors of Football now or Sporting Directors and Technical Directors who are there to safeguard the big picture of the whole football operation at a club and then you’ve got a Head Coach who should be working with the squad of players.",
      "“As a coach, you need to be very clear on that. That’s why Ruben Amorim ran into trouble. They obviously weren’t aligned. He had different ideas about how it should be run than the people in the background.”",
      "It remains uncertain whether Ancelotti would consider a switch to Old Trafford, or if the club's decision-makers are even considering the former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss. Nevertheless, when it comes to alignment, questions may arise regarding the Glazers' involvement.",
      "Whilst the partial sale saw Ineos and Ratcliffe acquire a minority share of the club, alongside control of footballing matters, the Glazer family retain majority ownership. This could potentially create tension, particularly given Ancelotti's candid remarks about the family back in 2016.",
      "\"I was fortunate to be able to coach Real Madrid, although then the club decided to change managers,\" Ancelotti said.",
      "\"That is part of the job, we are exposed to that. In the big clubs it is difficult to stay a long time because the expectations of results are so high.",
      "\"Madrid’s history and demands mean that if a coach doesn’t win trophies, a change is made. You have to respect that. It’s true that there are other clubs like Manchester United, where [Sir Alex] Ferguson was there many years, and now [Arsene] Wenger at Arsenal.",
      "\"These cases are different, as their owners are from the US and they are more interested in the financial aspect than in who is coach.”",
      "Whether Ancelotti genuinely features on United's shortlist for a new head coach remains uncertain, but speculation will persist about the club's requirements moving forwards. The notion of 'Man United DNA' has become a recurring talking point in debates over the next managerial appointment.",

      "Michael Carrick takes charge of his first United training session(Image: )",
      "It's rarely quiet at Old Trafford but the first two weeks of 2026 have been explosive even for the standards of Manchester United. Michael Carrick is the club's third head coach of the year already.",
      "Ruben Amorim's dramatic end and Darren Fletcher's caretaker spell have led to the appointment of Carrick until the end of the season and the challenge that now awaits is to steer the club back into European competition.",
      "That won't be easy and the start is a daunting one, but there is now a sense of calm at Carrington once more. This is the story of a remarkable two weeks and how United got to the point where 44-year-old Carrick was summoned from a beach in Barbados to take charge of the first-team.",
      "There was frustration bubbling away at Carrington on the second day of 2026, but no sense of the explosion that was about to go off at the club's training ground.",
      "The failure to beat Wolves a few days earlier had stuck in the craw of key executives, particularly given Amorim had gone back to his favoured back three formation. Wolves boss Rob Edwards revealed post-match he had always expected Amorim to do just that, while the United head coach said he had wanted to match up the visitors.",
      "That negative approach set alarm bells ringing again. Amorim had gone to a back four and a more attacking ethos against Bournemouth and Newcastle, but reverted to type for a game against a team that, at that point, were still to win in the Premier League.",
      "When director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to Amorim about it at a pre-planned meeting on the morning of Friday, January 2, the head coach \"blew up\". He hinted at the unhappiness in his press conference ahead of the game and then cancelled a planned broadcast interview.",
      "The Amorim era came to a dramatic end at Leeds(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Two days later, he used the final question of his post-match press conference to essentially air his grievances with Wilcox in public. If it was a power play, it was never going to succeed.",
      "Amorim pulled into Carrington the next morning well aware he was about to be put out of his misery. His dismissal was about results, but it was also about his behaviour, not just in that showdown with Wilcox, but in the public criticisms he had aired against some players as well.",
      "There is a feeling that Amorim never quite 'got' United. He never understood the club's values or bought into the tradition of the type of football they should play. He certainly didn't sound like a United manager at times.",
      "It has been suggested that the 40-year-old was taken aback by the sheer scale of the task at hand and the noise that reverberates around the club. He called out people paying too much attention to pundits in his final press conference, but he has never had to deal with a struggling super club before and the spotlight will always be harsh.",
      "It's something Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag had to come to terms with as well, so with only 17 games left to salvage something from this season, United couldn't afford to appoint someone who needed time to get their feet under the table. That is why Wilcox looked to the days of United's past.",
      "Jonny Evans oversees United training on Wednesday(Image: )",
      "There was some schadenfreude at a shortlist of Carrick, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the nostalgia was deliberate. All three understand the club and are used to the noise. There will be no adaptation period required.",
      "In what became a straight shootout between Carrick and Solskjaer, the former's knowledge of a group of players who are yet to click together this season impressed Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada. He is also a progressive appointment whose best days as a coach might be ahead of him, whereas it feels like Solskjaer's best days in management are in the rearview mirror.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox also felt Carrick could work in a collaborative structure that Ineos are putting together at Old Trafford. He is a hands-on coach, whereas Solskjaer's experience at United is more managerial, although that is partly due to the absence of a clear structure when he was in charge between December 2018 and November 2021.",
      "Carrick's coaching pedigree helped him win the race and it didn't harm his cause that he had made an impact with some of these players as well. His three-game stint as a caretaker in 2021 is remembered fondly, but he also led much of the training when Solskjaer was in charge, along with Kieran McKenna.",
      "He is still a popular figure with some members of that squad who remain at Old Trafford and his ability to quickly assemble a coaching staff has gone down well. In particular, the appointment of experienced No. 2 Steve Holland is considered a wise move.",
      "For a while under Ineos, it felt like the sight of Holland pulling into Carrington was inevitable, alongside former England boss Sir Gareth Southgate. However, interest in Southgate has waned, and Holland's appointment isn't directly related.",
      "Instead, the search is now underway for a permanent head coach, although there is intrigue surrounding the removal of the word 'interim' or 'caretaker' from Carrick's job title. His job is simply that of head coach, albeit on a contract that runs until the end of the 2025/26 season. Solskjaer was named caretaker manager until the end of the 2018 season, and Rangnick was the interim manager in November 2021.",
      "United stresses that those decisions were made under a different regime, and the decision not to use the words 'interim' or 'caretaker' is due to the length of time he will be in charge. The process to appoint a permanent head coach will be a thorough one, but Carrick will inevitably be in the picture. The results will dictate the strength of his case.",
      "Carrick, Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion were in place at Carrington on Wednesday morning to welcome the players. There were \"good vibes\" around the place, as one source put it.",
      "Plenty of the squad already know Carrick and some know Holland as well. Carrick's career means he commands respect from the squad. He held a relatively brief introductory team meeting on Wednesday morning before a first training session on the grass which was watched by Wilcox.",
      "Gym work followed for many of the squad, but there were no significant changes implemented by Carrick on day one. Although club media filmed some of the session, there was a desire not to reveal too much.",
      "There will be two more sessions before City arrive on Saturday and the Carrick era truly begins.",

The 26-year-old was part of the club's 'bomb squad' alongside Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, but those four all secured exits from Old Trafford over the summer.",
      "It was a permanent move to Chelsea for the latter with Antony re-joining Real Betis, Rashford signing for Barcelona on a season-long loan and Sancho making a temporary switch to Aston Villa. Malacia was primed for a deadline day move to Elche, but that collapsed at the eleventh hour.",
      "Despite being frozen and spending the following two months out of the team, the Dutchmen returned to the fold as an unused substitute for the 4-2 win over Brighton. He was named in the following six squads before coming on for the final two minutes against Newcastle United.",
      "Injured stars returning have resulted in him featuring for the under-21s and he scored in a 45-minute appearance for the developmental side against Wolves earlier this week. With his future unclear, Malacia is looking for clarity from Carrick before making a final decision, according to The Sun.",

      "Ryan Giggs had his say on Kobbie Mainoo(Image: Jan Kruger/Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs has revealed he would like to see Kobbie Mainoo stay at the club as a deadline approaches for a decision on his future. The young midfielder had been widely linked to a number of clubs before Ruben Amorim was sacked earlier this month.",
      "Michael Carrick has now been placed in charge until the end of the season and quickly has the Manchester derby to take his attention. But little over two weeks are available to shape his squad and to ship out any unwanted players before the transfer deadline.",
      "Mainoo is set to remain at Old Trafford for the rest of the season, and was rejected the opportunity to move on loan earlier in the term, with Napoli interested. But come the summer, he will reach the final 12 months of his contract.",
      "Talks over an extension have stalled, and Mainoo remains one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, on a deal he signed way back in February 2023. Chelsea have even been said to be lurking.",
      "The 20-year-old has started just twice in 2025/26, and both have come with cup exits. Giggs reckons Mainoo must show patience.",
      "\"As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United,\" Giggs told BetSelect.",
      "Michael Carrick is in charge of Kobbie Mainoo for now(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"It's like a striker. You don't see many really young strikers playing for Man United because it is difficult.",
      "\"But yeah, we all feel that he should be getting more minutes, but he needs to be patient.",
      "\"He's still young, he's still learning the game. And when he does get his chance, he needs to take it. So I’d like to see him stay.”",
      "It appears Carrick already has a vision for how to best use Mainoo. Speaking to Rio Ferdinand in September, Carrick said: \"He's more of an attacker.",
      "\"I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom.",
      "\"He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing completely. I see him playing that little bit higher and creating.",
      "\"I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",
      "Patience could yet be key as Mainoo seems likely to remain in competition with Bruno Fernandes unless Carrick opts to use the England international in a midfield pairing, while Fernandes becomes United's No.10.",

      "He has been able to welcome back Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo who returned from the Africa Cup of Nations shortly after Cameroon were knocked out by hosts Morocco and Ivory Coast were beaten by Egypt in the quarter-finals. Carrick was joined by his assistants Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, while first team coaches Jonny Evans, Travis Binnion and Craig Mawson also got involved.",

      "The former England assistant manager was deeply involved with training, suggesting his influence will be key at United.",
      "Having shared the dressing room only recently, Jonny Evans will be a key link between Carrick and the players.",
      "Having only recently lost to Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations, Bryan Mbeumo has wasted no time in getting back into training with United.",
      "Carrick was right in the middle of all the sessions, suggesting he will be looking at every small detail while he is in charge.",
      "Carrick's assistant Jonathan Woodgate was snapped talking to Senne Lammens, suggesting there could be more work with the ball required from the goalkeeper.",

      "Ex-England No.2 is Michael Carrick's new right-hand man at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "If Michael Carrick represents a gamble for Manchester United, then Steve Holland is the banker. It is such a shrewd move on United’s part to bring on Holland because he represents the tried and trusted, experienced and highly-respected No.2 in Carrick’s new backroom team.",
      "Carrick is still relatively inexperienced as a manager and appointing Holland could genuinely give him a chance of passing this five-month audition to get the job on a permanent basis. Holland is the senior figure in Carrick’s backroom staff of Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans, former youth coach Travis Binnion and keeper coach Craig Mawson.",
      "There are obvious parallels because, just like former England boss Gareth Southgate, Carrick managed Middlesbrough and cut his teeth under a strong, supportive chairman Steve Gibson. Southgate always spoke about Holland as if he was an equal. He ran every big decision by him and even talked about having a lunch together to discuss whether to quit before the 2022 World Cup. They stayed on. They were a package because that was how much faith and store Southgate put in his No.2.",
      "Holland, 55, spent six years at Chelsea working under the likes of Jose Mourinho, Rafa Benitez, Antonio Conte and Guus Hiddink. His playing career was curtailed by injury and he immediately set his sights on coaching. He is regarded as someone with an eye for detail, a diligent planner and former Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas said he has a “meticulous coaching brain.”",
      "He is very happy to be in the background and out of the limelight. A brief spell in charge at Crewe ended amid mixed messages about his role and he had a stint as caretaker at Chelsea.",
      "But this is a man who has never courted the limelight or been particularly comfortable in it. He did not seem to enjoy the rare occasions when he had to do press conferences at Chelsea.",
      "Back in Covid times, scouts would often sit in random places in near-empty stadiums. Holland ended up a few seats away from me in my seat at an Arsenal game. I could tell he was not hugely impressed to look across and see me being the closest person sat to him in the stadium.",
      "Next time we saw each other there was a bit of small talk and he would pass the time of day if you saw him around an England camp. But generally there is this cliche about coaches being the conduit and the nice guy to the touch manager.",
      "Steve Holland speaks to Gareth Southgate during Euro 2024(Image: Getty Images)",
      "With Southgate and Holland, it was role reversal. Southgate was the likeable, friendly face whereas Holland was happy to be in the background. He is serious and intense.",
      "His reputation on the training ground is far more important, of course. Players talk about good, well-thought out sessions and he is strong on tactics and planning.",
      "He is fiercely secretive. He hates any details getting out and, for example, the theory was always he was more sensitive about the opposition having any clue about England’s tactics and the line-up than Southgate. But if you look at his CV, the managers he has worked under, this is a manager with a stellar reputation. He will bring gravitas to Carrick’s coaching staff.",
      "Younger managers often bring in older heads and this is a shrewd move by Carrick. He could not have done better than Holland.",
      "It is also a reason why, if things go well in the next few months, Carrick will feel as if he has a genuine chance of being a long term United option.",

      "Darren Fletcher deserves credit for his work at Manchester United last week(Image: )",
      "There was the slightest hint of a crack in Darren Fletcher's voice as he spoke for the final time as Manchester United's caretaker head coach. Although Fletcher had just revealed he had been told to report to Carrington on Monday morning, he would have known his time in the hot seat was up.",
      "You could see how much it had hurt him not to be able to deliver a victory. A Premier League draw with Burnley and an FA Cup defeat to Brighton was the kind of ending Fletcher didn't deserve, and it pained him to come to terms with that.",
      "\"I've given it my best, and ultimately, I'm disappointed to not be able to win a game or to get a result,\" he said. \"But I feel like there were some good things in there, created a lot of chances, shots, things like that.",
      "\"Ultimately, it wasn't enough. I am more disappointed than anybody really because I care for the club and I want the club to do well.\"",
      "Fletcher was spoken of as a candidate for the job until the end of the season and spoke to chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox at Carrington. However, he always knew this was a two-game deal and that the powerbrokers preferred experience to see them through until the end of the campaign.",
      "When Michael Carrick's appointment was confirmed, Fletcher was offered the chance to stay on the first-team staff but opted for a return to his role as head coach of the Under-18s. He has had a spell as technical director at Old Trafford and been on the coaching staff, but taking charge of the age-group side offers the chance to continue his development as a head coach.",
      "And whatever the results last week, he has shown enough around Carrington and within games to suggest that he has a bright future in that department and that he is someone United should look to nurture over the next few years. United officials were said to be impressed by the way he conducted himself and rate him very highly.",
      "Certainly, the performance against Burnley was encouraging. United had 30 shots and drew a game they should have won handsomely. It was one of the best attacking displays they have produced all season.",
      "Fletcher was disappointed not to get a win during his two games in charge(Image: )",
      "Fletcher certainly spoke like a United boss and he carried himself with class and dignity. He was open and engaging in his press conferences, particularly his first one, when he made all the right noises and said all the right things. That he had switched by Sunday night to delivering a slightly harsher critique of the players and demanding they now step up showed he got the tone right when required.",
      "One particularly memorable moment is the smile he flashed when told of comments he had made as a pundit in 2018, when Jose Mourinho was sacked and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brought in as a caretaker. Fletcher has said, \"They're almost writing off this season\". As the quotes were read back to him, he could see what was coming.",
      "“Good research, that! I was young and naive when I said that, wasn’t I?\" he joked.",
      "“That was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in the context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.\"",
      "Fletcher handled a potential grenade with warmth and humour, and it was diffused with relative ease. It was a far cry from the fireworks that often emanated from a Ruben Amorim press conference.",
      "But being sure-footed with the media and sounding like a United manager are irrelevant if you can't deliver. Strip away the results, and Fletcher's two dealings with United players marked out his ability as a man-manager.",
      "First of all, he took Benjamin Sesko aside at Carrington on his first day in the job. He had no prior relationship with the £73million summer signing and wanted to get to know him, but he was aware his confidence needed a lift as well after two goals in 17 games under Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese had been critical of Sesko at times and only days earlier had refuted a suggestion that his teammates needed to be better at finding his runs. Fletcher showed the 22-year-old videos of his movement and assured him the goals would come if that continues. He also contradicted Amorim and told the striker his teammates did have a responsibility to find him.",
      "Fletcher got a tune out of Sesko, who scored three goals in his two games in charge(Image: )",
      "It came together immediately at Turf Moor, when Sesko scored twice and could have had more. He scored again on Sunday and a return of 13 shots in two games showed Fletcher had got him back on track and Carrick will be grateful for that.",
      "Then there is Shea Lacey. Amorim had shown little desire to trust youth at Old Trafford, especially young attacking talents, and Lacey was restricted to six minutes off the bench despite being named as a substitute in eight games. In seven of them, he didn't get on, despite United chasing goals against Everton, West Ham, Wolves and Leeds.",
      "Fletcher used the 18-year-old twice, for six minutes at Turf Moor and then for 27 against Brighton. He showed trust in a player he clearly rates and the instructions he gave him against Burnley resulted in a dazzling cameo in which he was unlucky not to score.",
      "\"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that,\" Fletcher said. \"I know he's gonna make an impact. I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless and he hit the crossbar and he had another shot so he had a really bright game.",
      "\"I'm pleased for him because there's a lot of injuries in recent years and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future, I've no doubt it's about that.\"",
      "It was exactly what Lacey needed to hear after being underused by Amorim and the confidence boost did the trick. Those examples show that judging Fletcher just on the results last week doesn't tell us the full story.",

Michael Carrick is the latest to occupy the Old Trafford hotseat, with former interim boss Darren Fletcher moving back to his role as Under-18 coach.",
      "Including interim bosses, seven different managerial appointments have been made at Old Trafford in little over four years, a list bookended by Carrick. There's every chance an eighth will be added come the summer, but for now it is Carrick who will have the chance to show his credentials.",
      "A manager sacked by Championship side Middlesbrough just seven months ago was always going to jump at the chance to manage United, but the fixture list has thrown up something of a hospital pass for Carrick. A Manchester derby followed by a trip to the league leaders leaves no time for him to settle in. United need a spark and with the halfway point of the Premier League season disappearing in the rear-view mirror they need one fast.",
      "But anyone looking for a crumb of comfort as United look to navigate their way through yet another period of crisis need only look at Carrick's previous spells as a manager.",
      "Solskjaer waved goodbye at Vicarage Road in November 2021, having won just 3 of his previous 11 games, yet Carrick's promotion to interim boss saw an immediate upturn in results with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal sandwiched by a creditable draw away at Chelsea. While it's a small sample size to work with, the way in which United's season unravelled under Ralf Rangnick and the turbulence prior to Carrick's appointment shines a light on the impressive work he did in such a short time.",
      "He enjoyed a similar new-manager bounce during his time at Middlesbrough. Defeat in his opening game was followed by a run of 15 wins from 19 league games, with relegation worries exchanged for promotion hopes in a matter of months.",
      "From a team that looked lost under Chris Wilder, suddenly Boro were on an upward trajectory. The atmosphere at the Riverside was electric and there was a real sense of unity between players and fans, something that had been missing for far too long. Middlesbrough's Chuba Akpom finished as top scorer in the division and was named Championship Player of the Season, with Boro finishing in fourth - not bad for a team embroiled in a relegation battle when Carrick arrived.",
      "Unfortunately for Carrick, he was unable to build on what had been a superb start to life at the Riverside. Defeat in the play-offs in 2022/23 was followed by near misses in the next two seasons, and it was clear the former midfielder had reached the end of the road on Teesside last summer.",
      "Opposition sides became wise to Boro's play, with no real urgency to their attack and a manager who struggled to impact matches with in-game changes.",
      "United fans may shudder reading that, given what went before Carrick, but the impact he made at Boro in such a short space of time cannot be ignored.",
      "If United want a manager who can pick a dressing room up and spark an upturn in results, then they might just have the right man. Should that scenario come to pass, the real question will be what they do in the summer.",
      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022 and became Head of Football in August 2024.",

      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",

      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "Carrick is being assessed during his interim spell as United weigh up a permanent appointment this summer.",
      "England boss Thomas Tuchel is under contract until after this summer’s World Cup and has previously held talks with United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, while Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner and Paris Saint-Germain’s Luis Enrique are also out of contract.",
      "Ratcliffe reportedly wants an elite, title-winning manager rather than a younger coach tasked with leading a long-term project.",
      "It is an interesting philosophy considering how far this group of players are from competing for the Premier League title, but the club’s hierarchy want to restore the glory days as soon as possible.",
      "Even if Carrick shows every indication that he is capable of doing just that, Neville believes he should not be considered.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Neville said: “I hope Michael does really well.",
      "“We could be sat here at the end of the season with the fans up, with the team fifth in the table and back in the Champions League spots, and we could all be getting swayed with it.",

      "Having previously managed a star-studded Barcelona side and a PSG squad full of highly paid players, Enrique has proven he can handle egos.",
      "Alonso reportedly tried to change too much at Madrid, which annoyed several players, and club president Florentino Perez is keen to avoid a similar situation. It is believed Enrique is the ‘strong figure’ players like Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior need.",
      "The biggest issue is that Enrique ‘isn’t a beloved figure among Real Madrid fans’, having left the club for Barcelona in 1996. His relationship with the supporters was strained even further by his success as Blaugrana boss.",
      "If he does replace Alonso, winning games and trophies would win sceptical supporters back over.",
      "The report adds:",
      "The debate is open. From a sporting perspective, Luis Enrique would be one of the most qualified coaches for the challenge. From a social perspective, his appointment would be a bold, even unpopular, move. But the club has made similar decisions in the past when it deemed them necessary.",
      "Real Madrid needs a manager who commands respect from day one. Luis Enrique fits that profile, even if he isn’t the fans’ favorite. In a time of rebuilding, sporting logic can outweigh emotional appeals. That’s why, despite some reservations, Luis Enrique remains a real option to return Real Madrid to the top in La Liga and in Europe.",
      "Appointing Enrique, should he be willing to join, would be a no-brainer for United – even without Premier League experience.",
      "He has shown an ability to adapt, moving from La Liga to international football and back into club management in a different country. He is clearly a world-class coach.",
      "United do not want a project manager; they want someone capable of restoring their glory days.",
      "The issue is that they do not currently have the players to support that ambition. Enrique’s teams have included Lionel Messi, Neymar, Andres Iniesta, and more recently Ousmane Dembele, Vitinha and Achraf Hakimi.",
      "United arguably have just one world-class player in Bruno Fernandes. The rest of the squad is not close to competing for the Premier League title, and it is even debatable whether they are good enough to finish in the top four.",
      "Enrique would be required to get the best out of a fairly average group of players, which is something he has rarely been asked to do during his managerial career.",

      "You wouldn’t blame Fernandes if he felt like a change of scene. Since he arrived at Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020, just as the world was about to get very weird indeed as Covid took hold, the Portuguese playmaker has been the one (positive) constant United fans could cling to during an unsettling six years.",

Sure, antipathy from outsiders is to be expected but even some who root for United have spent far too much of Fernandes’ time thinking that somehow he’s A Problem. When, in fact, he has been the single thing United haven’t had to fret over in the last half-dozen years.",
      "Even with one of the most creative forces of the Premier League era, United have still been tough to follow or fathom. It doesn’t bear thinking about how bad things would have been without Fernandes, last season especially, when he scored more goals and offered more assists than any team-mate in a side that finished 15th. Take Fernandes out of that sorry team, and only the wretchedness of the bottom three might have spared United from relegation.",

      "In all but one of his full seasons at Old Trafford, he’s led the way for assists, usually by a long way. In the only season he was second for creativity, in 2020/21, he was United’s top scorer with 28 goals in all competitions, seven more than anyone else. During the darkness of last season, he scored eight more goals than any team-mate and created nine more, 19 of each in total. This term, from a deeper position that doesn’t play to his strengths, he’s had a hand in 14 goals – six more than any other United player.",
      "If his current form was out of the ordinary for Fernandes, it might be suggested that the captain is being fuelled by the ‘hurt’ he felt at United’s apparent willingness to sell him to Saudi last summer. That, above all of the other rotten decisions Ratcliffe, Wilcox and co. have made, would have been the worst of their calamities.",
      "And even a year later, it seems a prospect too stupid even for this leadership group. But you just know that if Fernandes decides he wants a different environment, something perhaps bordering on functional, United would only look at the fee being banked rather than the cost of losing the skipper.",
      "As has already been highlighted, his form is hardly diminishing, and his reliability has never been an issue. Actually, he has showed superhuman levels of robustness, missing three games in nearly six years to injury or illness prior to his recent hamstring injury. From which he recovered in double-quick time.",
      "Fernandes is 31. He’ll be 32 in September. On a spreadsheet, that might be a red flag to any of Ratcliffe’s bean-counters but the Portugal star is far from finished. It’s weird that it even needs to be pointed out. Yet seemingly it does to those at Old Trafford who really should know their skipper better by now.",
      "No wonder Fernandes feels affronted. Not only by how dispensable he is viewed at United, but by the assumption that he will be off to Saudi. Sure, the sheikhs will be queueing up, but so too will be big hitters across Europe. And if the likes Bayern Munich are eager to take him, that in itself ought to prompt someone – anyone – at Old Trafford to suspect that they might be missing the bleedin’ obvious.",
      "MORE: Ian Wright would take Bruno Fernandes at Arsenal ‘tomorrow’",
      "Fernandes’ will, seemingly, is the only reason he remains at United. As he said just last month: “I decided not to go, not only for family reasons but because I genuinely love the club.” But you can push anyone only so far.",
      "Wilcox and Ratcliffe ought to be love-bombing Fernandes, or at the very least, making him feel the appreciation that was sorely lacking in the summer. Because hiring a new head coach, especially one of the calibre required, will be even more difficult when candidates learn that the one and only player five of his predecessors have all been able to rely on is being discarded for no good reason.",
      "United are already facing a summer in which they need a new manager and at least one new midfielder. Perhaps the board will surprise us all in those processes. But finding a new Bruno, replacing his attacking contribution amid the other upheaval, is almost certainly beyond them.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have received a ‘substantial offer’ for Bruno Fernandes worth around £86m as he looks increasingly likely to leave.",
      "William Saliba is sick and ‘tired’ of having ‘nothing in my pockets’, with the Frenchman among nine Arsenal and Manchester City players eyeing a Quadruple.",
      "Chelsea have an ‘immature bunch’ of players and that showed v Arsenal, who might well be on for the Quad.",
      "There are three England linchpins in a top four headed by a Real Madrid star, while Arsenal, Man City and Man Utd all have talking to do…",
      "Three excellent centre-backs – well two very fine and one woefully out-of-form – are approaching free-agency, with Liverpool keen on at least two of them…",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was left ‘baffled’ at one point in the Manchester United manager race which ‘hands-on’ Michael Carrick won despite a media ‘campaign’."

      "A new report has explained why Manchester United are ‘growing increasingly confident’ regarding their chances of signing Brighton star Carlos Baleba.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd made an audacious attempt to sign Baleba from Brighton, but they were priced out of a move for the young centre-midfielder.",
      "Baleba has established himself as one of the best young midfielders in Europe over the past couple of seasons and he has been mooted as a potential long-term replacement for Casemiro.",
      "However, after Man Utd spent around £230m on signings and failed to offload Bruno Fernandes, they had little funds remaining to invest on a new midfielder and they certainly could not afford a deal for Baleba, which would have cost around £100m.",
      "Therefore, Man Utd have kicked their midfield issues down the road until this year and a significant overhaul is expected in this department in the coming months.",
      "READ: Man Utd boss Carrick handed ‘£20m transfer boost’ after dramatic ‘DAWN RAID’",
      "Recent reports have indicated that Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and/or Bruno Fernandes could leave, while Baleba remains ont the radar with several other targets, including Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.",
      "Regarding Baleba, a new report from The Sun claims the Red Devils are ‘growing increasingly confident of securing him’ this year as they ‘plan to resurrect’ their midfield.",
      "The report claims: ‘According to well-placed sources, United are becoming more optimistic about prising Baleba away from the Amex in the summer.",
      "‘The 22-year-old central midfielder is tied to Brighton until 2028 but his stock has dropped since United’s interest surfaced last year.’",
      "They claim that the Red Devils have ‘made a January transfer decision’ as ‘they are not expected to deviate from their January transfer window plan following Michael Carrick’s appointment as head coach’.",
      "Regarding the two reasons for this stance, the report explains: ‘Carrick returned to United this week to oversee the remainder of the season, and there has been speculation that he could be backed with new additions. It’s understood, however, that United are unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets are not available in the winter window.",
      "‘United committed an outlay of £215million (excluding add-ons) to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in the summer window, which the club views as the preferred time to land their top targets for value-for-money transfer fees.’",
      "Would ‘main target’ Luis Enrique say yes to Manchester United? Probably not, but this could be the XI he would pick if he did replace Michael Carrick…",
      "After Antoine Semenyo, Manchester City’s latest ‘hijack’ on Manchester United leaves INEOS with the lesser of two £100m signings…",
      "Oliver Glasner is the ‘top candidate’ to be Manchester United’s next permanent head coach, with this the XI we think he would select if he’s appointed…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could still offload Manuel Ugarte this month, while they have been ‘set a price’ for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",
      "Man Utd could face competition from Liverpool as they look to bring Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to Old Trafford, according to reports.",

      "United‘s dire decline under Amorim and the head coach’s fractured relationship with club chiefs made his position untenable, with the Premier League giants opting to appoint an interim before bringing in a new permanent manager in the summer.",
      "More tempting candidates will be available in the summer due to expiring contracts and the upcoming World Cup, but Man Utd cannot afford to get this appointment wrong.",
      "The Red Devils also cannot fall into the trap of keeping Carrick beyond this season if he does well. Neville does not think this can be given “any consideration”.",

      "“But there cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond the end of this season, for the sake of Michael and the club, even if he wins every single game.”",
      "Neville went on to name four “standout” contenders to replace Carrick, explaining why these bosses need to tick six boxes.",
      "“Manchester United have tried everything when it comes to appointing a manager, absolutely everything,” Neville added.",
      "“They just have to try to remove risks now. Who can handle the media? Who can sort the dressing room out? Who can handle the owners? Who plays a style of football that fans will at least enjoy watching? Who has Champions League experience? Who has big‑game experience?",
      "“The three that standout are Tuchel, Ancelotti and Pochettino. They could all be available after the World Cup. Eddie Howe – who has won a trophy, finished in the top four, and managed a big club in Newcastle – is another.",
      "“To make United an attractive club for players, Tuchel and Ancelotti bring a seriousness to matters. If you appoint a younger manager, United will miss out on players.",
      "“United are going to miss out on a lot of players anyway, but someone like Ancelotti would encourage players to come. They need that right now, because I’m not sure players are queuing up to join unless there is someone to believe in.”"

      "Roy Keane has ripped into Manchester United over their new coaching setup as the legendary captain engaged in a tense discussion with Gary Neville.",
      "Michael Carrick will lead United on an interim basis for the rest of the season having replaced Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford and has chosen former England assistant Steve Holland, Carrick’s ex-Middlesbrough No 2 Jonathan Woodgate, retired defender Jonny Evans and Under-21s boss Travis Binnion to join him on his staff.",
      "Keane is far from impressed by the quartet chosen by Carrick to aid him at United, rejecting the suggestion that Holland’s experience makes him some kind of “guru” and questioning how Jonny Evans has been handed such a significant role having left his post as loans and pathways manager at United in December.",
      "Speaking on the latest episode of the Stick to Football podcast, Neville said: “Steve Holland, I’m not saying it’s going to bring success, but he is a serious operator. I think it’s made Carrick’s staff better.",
      "Keane was quick to follow up, asking: “What about the other coaches he’s brought in?",
      "“The other two look like people he’s sort of relied upon. I don’t know I’ve never seen the other two coach,” Neville admitted.",
      "Keane went on: “He’s on the beach two weeks ago Jonny Evans. Jonny Evans leaves Man United four or five weeks ago as a loans manager and then Darren Fletcher gives him a job, strangely enough gives him a job.",
      "“He has two games, Fletch goes and Carrick gives him a job, great isn’t it. We should all go to Barbados for a week.",
      "“You’re on about getting your coaching staff in, you’re praising one of them saying he’s experienced and then we just let the other two go, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans. What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach of Man United’s first team?",
      "“He left the job four weeks ago – loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That’s a big step up isn’t it?”",
      "Neville then tried to clarify his point, adding: “When Michael gets announced I think, “okay he’s going to come under a lot of pressure, needs to make sure his information on the training pitch is s*** hot”. If he’d have just brought in Woodgate and Evans that would have made his job a lot harder I think.",
      "Keane then wanted to drill down on Holland becoming the assistant manager.",
      "He said: “Going back to what I said earlier, with Steve Holland, you think what United need at this moment in time, is it just about coaching then?",
      "Neville replied: “My point is, if Steve Holland is on the training pitch at least you know they’re going to get top class training sessions. I’m not saying they weren’t before because they probably were as well. I don’t know what Evans or Woodgate are like as coaches, don’t know what Carrick is like as a coach.",
      "“My point is he has a lot of experience, are you against the appointment of Steve Holland?”",
      "Keane thought Neville was deliberately ignoring the counter point to his experience argument about Holland but failing to point out the lack of top level coaching in the rest of Carrick’s staff.",
      "“On one hand you’re sitting here going, ‘I’m so happy they brought Steve Holland in’, but they brought another two staff in who you’re dismissing as ‘I’m not really bothered about them,'” he said.",
      "“I wish we were sitting here with you saying he’s brought three staff in and they’re all brilliant, so we think Steve Holland is the man now?”",
      "“I think he’s got a lot of experience, a good coach,” Neville reasoned.",
      "Keane was quick to point out that experience does not guarantee coaching success and gave examples of previous staff members in the post-Ferguson era who did not work out.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Gary Pallister has hit back at Roy Keane after his former team-mate accused the club’s legendary manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, of having a damaging influence at the club since he stepped down in 2013.",
      "Pallister’s move to United set a British transfer record fee for a defender when he signed for £2.3m in August 1989, with the Old Trafford club then paying a British record transfer fee to sign Keane from Nottingham Forest in the summer of 1993.",
      "The duo went on to play a part in three Premier League title successes under Ferguson, including a league and FA Cup double in their first season together at United.",
      "Yet Keane famously fell out with Ferguson when he left the club in acrimonious circumstances in November 2005, with his animosity towards his former manager barely waning more than two decades later.",
      "Even though Ferguson stepped down as United manager in 2013, Keane suggested his input behind the scenes at the club remains strong, as he hinted the Scot is still influential in the hiring and firing of managers.",

      "“You see who’s making the decisions at Man United… you still have [Alex] Ferguson and David Gill [former chief executive] hanging around like a bad smell.”",
      "Those comments predictably created a stir, with Pallister suggesting Keane was wrong to reopen his feud with Ferguson, as he encouraged new United interim manager Michael Carrick to seek out the advice of his former manager after taking on the role at Old Trafford after the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "“I wouldn’t agree with Roy. I think those comments have more to do with the relationship between the two of them,” Pallister told Football365 with Spreadex Sports.",
      "“We know there is no love lost there. There is not going to be any bouquets being exchanged between those two [Ferguson and Keane].",
      "“He also had a little go at David Gill as well, but David was a consummate professional and a great guy to work with.",
      "“Listen, you expect Roy to be controversial and he doesn’t disappoint, but I’m sure Michael Carrick will speak to Sir Alex about the job he has taken on and he would be mad not to.",
      "“I always remember sitting down and chatting to Sir Alex about his difficult times and that was just after I arrived at the club and the banners were there saying, ‘Enough is Enough’ and ‘Fergie Out’.",
      "“He was chatting about that period and told me how good it was for him to be able to go and talk to Sir Matt, who still had an office at Old Trafford",
      "“Sir Alex said speaking to the club’s greatest manager at the time was invaluable and why wouldn’t you lean on all of those years of experience? Especially with someone who has been manager at Manchester United. It’s a difficult place to manage because the expectation is huge.”",
      "Pallister went on to give his verdict on Amorim’s exit, as he suggested the Portuguese tactician appeared to throw in the towel when he knew the axe was about to fall after a fall-out with Sporting Director Jason Wilcox.",
      "“When you hear the explosion he had at his last press conference, it was probably a build up and when you hear him talk the way he was talking, maybe he’d had enough,” he added.",
      "“You read in the papers that the decision had been made the day before and he might have got wind of it and aired his grievances.",
      "“In the end, you have got to base it on results and his winning ratio wasn’t great and even though he was given the backing of the club, results speak louder than words.",
      "“It was better than last year, but did we have any real confidence of getting into the Champions League slots? I don’t think so.",
      "“What was damning in the end was the Newcastle game. We went to four at the back, we got a result and while you can say Newcastle deserved something from that game, we all waited to see what would happen next.",
      "“Then he went to five at the back for the Wolves and people were asking why he went for that when statistically, they were playing one of the worst teams in the history of the Premier League. It didn’t make sense.",
      "“Ultimately, we didn’t do great against Wolves and if you are Jason Wilcox, maybe it is your job to ask questions.",
      "“The manager didn’t like being asked and I kind of get that as well because he has to be allowed to pick the players and pick the team.",

      "“What I saw in both of the games [under Darren Fletcher], there’s gaps all over the place and opposition will exploit that. He has to come in, especially in the games against City and Arsenal coming up, and make sure that’s sorted.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was left ‘baffled’ at one point in the Manchester United manager race which ‘hands-on’ Michael Carrick won despite a media ‘campaign’.",
      "Carrick was finally appointed Manchester United manager on a deal up to the end of the season in the aftermath of Ruben Amorim’s sacking earlier this month.",
      "In what has been called a ‘close-run’ race between Carrick and Solskjaer, the former won for a variety of reasons, as predictably detailed by the numerous inside stories published since.",
      "They explain how director of football Jason Wilcox told the players that Champions League qualification was their target for the remainder of the season – they were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton days later so good work – and that He Knows The Club was indeed their bar for caretaker consideration.",
      "Wilcox made first contact with Carrick and Solskjaer over the phone on Tuesday, conducted face-to-face meetings with them on Thursday and Saturday respectively, then relayed the club’s decision the following week.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy, bless him, was interviewed over the phone and promptly rejected.",
      "All three ‘impressed’ but Carrick was, as phrased by many writers, the ‘unanimous choice’ in the end.",
      "But much like in the hours after Amorim’s demise, a great many journalists with contacts in and around Old Trafford have shared what went down in that fateful week leading up to Carrick’s anointment.",
      "",
      "Roy Keane might well have sensed “a bad smell” emanating from the halls of Carrington in the week of Amorim’s dismissal, for Sir Alex Ferguson had a degree of involvement from the off in deciding the Portuguese’s successor.",
      "Rob Dawson and Mark Ogden of ESPN write that Ferguson was called to ‘a breakfast meeting’ with Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada two days after Amorim was sacked, which ‘set the course’ for Carrick’s eventual coronation.",
      "Ferguson ‘was invited into the training ground to give his verdict on the manager search,’ with Wilcox a source adding:",
      "“Omar and Jason spoke to Sir Alex. They met over breakfast to discuss three guys who had all played under him in the past. Some might criticize that, so you can’t win. But Sir Alex knows Michael, Ole and Ruud better than anyone, so Omar and Jason canvassed his opinion.”",
      "The ESPN pair add that it is not known ‘whether Ferguson directly anointed Carrick as his favoured choice,’ but the Scot is described as ‘wholly positive about his former midfielder and fully supports his appointment’.",
      "Four Athletic writers team up, however, to say that of the final choices Solskjaer and Carrick, Ferguson is ‘known to have favoured the latter’s candidacy’.",
      "Carrick will be giving him a call soon.",
      "",
      "If the many reports are to be believed, Ferguson might well prescribe to a widespread notion summed up by the oft-cited difference between Carrick and Solskjaer, as summed up by one phrase: ‘more hands-on’.",
      "ESPN, The Athletic and BBC Sport all use that wording to explain in part how Carrick edged ahead of Solskjaer in the race.",
      "Sami Mokbel of the BBC says that the idea Carrick ‘arguably provides greater hands-on coaching expertise than Solskjaer was at the heart’ of Manchester United’s decision.",
      "The general vibes-based approach of Solskjaer was a ‘key consideration’ in the early stages of the process as the desperation to ‘inspire a squad so clearly in need of a pick-me-up’ was identified, but Carrick’s general coaching acumen ‘ultimately became one of the overriding factors behind the decision’.",
      "Another tick for Carrick was his willingness to operate within the Manchester United power structure, which basically means he is fine getting daily texts off Wilcox and Ratcliffe with tactical ideas based on Gary Neville’s latest podcast.",
      "‘He also impressed in interview in terms of his ability to lead a team, and his strong knowledge of the players already at the club.’",
      "That greater understanding of the current squad is echoed by other outlets as another advantage Carrick held over Solskjaer, who presumably asked where Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard were.",
      "The well-connected Rich Fay says Carrick’s ‘strong knowledge of the players’ at his disposal was a positive, with the Athletic appraising his ‘pre-existing knowledge of the squad’.",
      "We simply must know who Solskjaer thinks is still there.",
      "Carrick’s philosophy also ‘aligns with the type of football Wilcox wants to see this United squad play,’ according to Dorsett and Khan, who say there was ‘a unanimous feeling that his experience and tactical nous could prove invaluable’.",
      "Mokbel touts a reported switch to a 4-2-3-1 formation, adding that ‘it also has not gone unnoticed by United chiefs’ that Carrick ‘oversaw a transition from a three-at-the-back system deployed by predecessor Chris Wilder’.",
      "And when Carrick ‘outlined his vision for the remainder of the campaign’, Wilcox and Berrada were described as ‘impressed by those plans, as well as Carrick’s enthusiasm for taking on the role,’ according to Mark Critchley and others of The Athletic.",
      "",
      "In some ways it was a race Solskjaer lost as much as one Carrick won.",
      "It is claimed by numerous outlets that the Norwegian was eager to discuss a more permanent arrangement. The Athletic say his ‘preference would have been to take the job again on a permanent basis, working for the long term’ on ‘a major rebuild’.",
      "But another phrase which crops up regularly in these insides stories is ‘backwards step’; Solskjaer’s three-year reign at Old Trafford seemed to count as much against him as for in the end.",
      "Carrick, however, expressed a ‘willingness to take on the role with no guarantee’ of anything beyond the end of the season.",
      "One of Solskjaer’s biggest issues was the composition of his backroom staff. The Athletic call that a ‘stumbling block’ considering his last assistants at Old Trafford were Carrick and current Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna, neither of whom would be prepared to back him up this time around.",
      "That was especially pertinent, as this line from Mokbel makes clear of Solskjaer:",
      "‘It is also acknowledged that much of the coaching during his reign was completed by Carrick and McKenna, who were his assistants.’",
      "One last obstacle for Solskjaer is presented by Pete Hall of The I Paper, who points out that ‘in the eyes of Ineos’ power brokers’, Carrick ‘has more recent experience in the dugout’ than Solskjaer, whose only spell since leaving Manchester United in November 2021 – a seven-month reign ended by his sacking at Besiktas in August – ‘was not the kind of experience needed to steady a sinking ship’.",
      "",
      "With complete deference and humility, of course.",
      "Solskjaer – along with Van Nistelrooy – was informed by Wilcox of the decision on Tuesday and, if an ESPN source is to be believed, “took the news like a gentleman”.",
      "The Athletic say Solskjaer was ‘naturally disappointed’ but remains ‘fully supportive of Carrick’. And even ‘carved out a few hours’ during the search ‘to go to the cinema and watch Marty Supreme’.",
      "That is pure, uncut Athletic inside story long read.",
      "",
      "In a word: no.",
      "But there were those within Manchester United who were left ‘suspecting’ that a concerted effort was being made ‘to push his name through the press and social media,’ in the words of The Athletic.",
      "They immediately clarify that there was no suggestion such a drive actually came from Solskjaer, who himself was ‘personally baffled by suggestions that he was keen to take the role before he had even been approached about it’.",
      "Solskjaer felt ‘he had the support of Wilcox and Berrada’ but less ‘backing from the club’s ownership’ in the Glazer family and Ratcliffe.",
      "Manchester United, for their part, ‘insist that at no point did anybody within the ownership challenge Wilcox’s recommendation to appoint Carrick,’ because why would you challenge a man who has just sacked his last recommendation after 14 months and hundreds of millions of pounds being spent?",
      "",
      "The current candidates range from unoriginal to unexciting and unlikely.",
      "It is fairly obvious that at some point Wilcox will stop “interfering” and simply take the reins himself.",
      "But who will inherit Carrick’s Manchester United and lead them into next season?",
      "There is a deeply Championship Manager-influenced belief that with this being a major international tournament year, the list of the best available managers will be further boosted in the summer once the World Cup is finished and every nation besides the winner has done away with their coach in a massive panic.",
      "It worked with Louis van Gaal so yeah, crack on.",
      "Thomas Tuchel is thrown into the ring by The I’s Hall, the German having ‘cropped up in several conversations’ with ‘a feeling that after the World Cup’ he will seek ‘a fresh challenge’.",
      "Fabrizio Romano corroborates the very idea Manchester United want him, but Tuchel might be harder to convince.",
      "On a similar note, Richard Jolly of The Independent crops up with a delightful clarification: Steve Holland’s arrival as part of Carrick’s staff ‘is not, United insist, a prelude to bringing in Gareth Southgate’.",
      "But the former England No.2 ‘was suggested by the club’ as someone who could work closely with Carrick and help him ease into such a pressured role. So Michael Owen ought to be ignored as Sir Gareth takes to the Manchester United throne in June.",
      "Over at Sky, Dorsett and Khan provide a helpful list of options in Tuchel, Oliver Glasner, Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique and Marco Silva.",
      "It remains to be seen who of those the great overseer Ferguson will recommend.",
      "Roy Keane joked Michael Carrick’s wife ‘will probably be doing the team talks’ at Man Utd as she ‘has got a bit of a big mouth’.",
      "Man Utd are carrying on as if losing Bruno Fernandes this summer isn’t a massive problem. They cannot simultaneously find a new manager and sell their best player by far…",
      "Manchester United chef Jason Wilcox is now ‘accelerating plans’ to sign a new left winger after talks with caretaker manager Michael Carrick this week.",
      "William Saliba is sick and ‘tired’ of having ‘nothing in my pockets’, with the Frenchman among nine Arsenal and Manchester City players eyeing a Quadruple.",
      "Chelsea have an ‘immature bunch’ of players and that showed v Arsenal, who might well be on for the Quad.",
      "There are three England linchpins in a top four headed by a Real Madrid star, while Arsenal, Man City and Man Utd all have talking to do…"

      "Unsurprisingly there is a vast torrent of guff to navigate in light of Michael Carrick’s appointment as Manchester United interim boss.",
      "Without giving too many spoilers away, we now live in a world where people are apparently surprised to discover mornings can be quite dark in northern England during January.",
      "Plus there’s all the usual transfer boosts and scaremongering and all such tishes and fipsies.",
      "",
      "Unusual for The Sun, usually a more calm and thoughtful voice in these troubled times, to claim this prize but they’ve smashed it out of the park here.",
      "The story? New Man United interim boss Michael Carrick gave his assistant Jonathan Woodgate a lift to Man United training this morning.",
      "The headline?",
      "DAWN RAID",
      "We spent longer than we care to admit desperately scouring those eight apparently wildly overexcited letters to try and find the cheeky bit of harmless wordplay concealed within and drew a blank.",
      "Luckily the standfirst was there to explain it for us, and to give away the fact that even The Sun knew it might be a bit much because they realised they needed to explain themselves.",
      "Michael Carrick gives Jonathan Woodgate a lift to training before dawn as he prepares for Man Utd baptism of fire against City.",
      "Surely there’s something crack/Carrick of dawn here. We can’t quite get there ourselves, but that’s not our job. It’s The Sun’s and they have let us down badly.",
      "",
      "The Sun are not the only ones leaning into this, though. Over at the Mail they are blown away entirely by the concept of anyone arriving for work in January ‘when it was still dark outside’.",
      "Michael Carrick is wasting no time getting down to business as Manchester United’s interim manager, with the club legend arriving to training while many are still asleep.",
      "Sunrise this morning in Manchester was at 8.17am. Arriving to work before that time is neither unusual nor noteworthy. Mediawatch is frankly jealous of the ‘many’ who are still asleep at that time.",
      "As ever, this feels like a story that fails the Mediawatch Test: would the opposite be more newsworthy? Carrick casually sauntering in for his first day with a coffee and an almond croissant at 10am would surely be more notable than arriving at the training ground, as the Mail so wonderfully put it, ‘just several hours’ after being appointed interim boss.",
      "And now we find ourselves entirely obsessed by just where exactly the cut-off exists for this. At what number of hours does the tabloid standard ‘just hours’ require the addition of a ‘several’ so as not to be too overtly taking the p*ss. And can you in fact even have ‘just several’ of anything? Is it not an oxymoron?",
      "It’s no life, this, is it?",

      "Man Utd news: Michael Carrick gets £20m transfer boost as move ‘100 per cent happening’",
      "We read the whole story to piece this together, so we trust you’re grateful.",
      "The ‘£20m transfer boost’ is itself clumsily welded together from two separate pieces of information: the first being The Guardian saying ‘transfer funds will be available’ and the second a Mirror story speculating that long-time United target Ruben Neves could be available this month for, you guessed it, 20 million of the King’s pounds.",
      "The move that is ‘100 per cent happening’ does, of course, have absolutely nothing to do with any of that. It is in fact the chances of Manuel Ugarte leaving United, according to a Turkish journalist.",
      "",
      "Adding up a list of players to get a scary final number has long been a staple of online football journalism, and the key was always not to worry at all about whether the players towards the bottom of your list of those who ‘could be SOLD’ or were ‘set to MISS’ some game or other were players who ever actually played games or contributed anything of value anyway. You could bundle in as many bomb-squadders and youth-teamers as your conscience would allow to get those numbers up, up, up.",
      "Which makes it slightly surprising that it’s only relatively recently that these outlets appear to have cottoned on to what now in hindsight seems the obvious fact that if you’re talking about players missing a match you can simply combine a scary big number from each club and come up with an even bigger and scarier number.",
      "Whichever content monkey came up with that deserves a raise.",
      "Anyway, it’s now entirely standard practice, and we’re delighted to report has led to zero reduction in deployment of the previous one-club dark arts.",
      "Take this one from the Mirror about tonight’s foaming pint of delicious Carabao.",
      "13 players who could miss Chelsea vs Arsenal Carabao Cup semi-final first leg",
      "Let’s get past the actual valid injury doubts on both sides. Boring. No interest in that genuine content. We want the p*ss-takes and the number-padders.",
      "There are bonus points straight away for turning it into a four-page photo gallery story, of course. Clicks ahoy! Further bonus points for managing to even find a picture of Dario Essugo in Chelsea action.",
      "Grudging acceptance that listing Arsenal first-team starters who ‘missed’ the Portsmouth game as continued ‘doubts’ for this one is very clever-stupid.",
      "But mainly just a round of applause for confirmation that Chelsea appointing Liam Rosenior as manager hasn’t magically ended Mykhaylo Mudryk’s ban.",
      "",
      "Another of Mediawatch’s favourite genre of headline here from the Mirror, in which the absolutely vital story-killing words have, by definitely real and necessary reasons of space, sadly had to be excised from the headline and left instead on the cutting-room floor, leading to the desperately unfortunate situation that nobody wanted where the headline is left looking like it might be atop an actual news story rather than just some guff.",

      "Brentford are in the middle of their best unbeaten Premier League run of the season - six games without defeat, winning four of the last five. And since December 14, no Premier League team has picked up more points than the Bees (14). They are 11/10 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "Leeds are a great watch and their games are quite chaotic by design. They play on the edge, get in your face and they ask questions of the opposition, but they also invite pressure. Across their last 18 fixtures their games are averaging 3.5 goals and they've kept just one clean sheet in that period.",
      "Fulham arrive as the perfect dance partner to punt on goals with over 2.5 looking very generous at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "They've scored in their last 12 matches across all competitions, showing a level of attacking consistency that travels well. Marco Silva's side don't need huge dominance to find the net either - they're sharp in transition, clever in the half-spaces and dangerous from wide areas.",
      "Arne Slot's Liverpool are beginning to look like a serious team again.",
      "The big shift has come in their structure in defence. Slot has clearly prioritised control without the ball, giving Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate proper protection in front of them rather than leaving them exposed, which in turn has cut out the silly errors costing them goals.",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have conceded just five goals. That's not smoke and mirrors either. The expected goals against data backs it up nicely at 0.8 per 90, pointing to a side that is limiting high-quality chances rather than relying on last-ditch defending or goalkeeping heroics.",
      "When you combine Liverpool's improved defensive process with Burnley's limited attacking threat, Liverpool to win to nil shapes up as a shrewd play at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Crystal Palace arrive off the back of that damaging FA Cup exit, knocked out in the third round by non-league Macclesfield. The instinctive reaction is to expect a fierce response. But history strongly pushes back against that idea.",
      "Looking at the last 13 Premier League teams dumped out by League One opposition or below at that stage, the next-game record reads poorly: three wins, four draws and six defeats. And even those three wins were by the bare minimum - a single-goal margin. There's no evidence of a bounce-back surge. If anything, the hangover lingers.",
      "Sunderland remain unbeaten at home this season - a run built on energy, structure and a crowd that turns the Stadium of Light into a very uncomfortable place to visit. They look a great price on the draw no bet at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville are the livewires for West Ham. Stop them, and you largely stop West Ham.",
      "The problem for the visitors is that they're running into a Tottenham side specifically designed to take that weapon away.",
      "One of the defining traits of Thomas Frank's Spurs is how well they manage transition moments. They don't allow games to become stretched, they recover their shape quickly and they suffocate counter-attacks before they ever get going. That's backed up by the numbers.",
      "Across the season, Spurs have conceded the second-fewest fast breaks in the league (11) - and crucially, they haven't conceded a single goal from a fast break.",
      "There's also a very strong angle under Frank in that nine of his 10 wins as Spurs boss have come to nil. When Tottenham win, they don't just win, they shut the door. It's 2/1 with Sky Bet to land again.",
      "Gabriel Magalhaes is quietly becoming a magnet for fouls. Not because he's theatrical, but because of how Arsenal use him. He steps in aggressively during build-up, carries the ball forward into pressure and is constantly involved in physical duels at set pieces. That combination naturally invites contact and referees have been happy to blow the whistle.",
      "The recent numbers underline that trend. Gabriel has been fouled at least once in nine of his last 10 starts, averaging 1.53 fouls drawn per 90. That's a healthy baseline for a centre-back, and it puts the 2+ fouls line well within reach in the right type of game at 11/4 with Sky Bet. Here, he's coming up against Igor Jesus.",
      "The Forest striker is aggressive, raw and still learning when to step in and when to back off. He's committed 22 fouls across his recent matches.",
      "Wolves have quietly become a very difficult team to score against. The standout trend in their recent performances is defensive improvement, and it's backed up by serious underlying numbers.",
      "Across their last six games, only Arsenal can better Wolves' expected goals against process of 0.99 per 90. That's elite territory. Wolves have faced Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United in that spell. So while the sample size is small, the quality of opposition gives those numbers real credibility.",
      "We know Newcastle are a very different proposition away from St James' Park - and it's the attacking drop-off that's most striking. In their last 17 Premier League away games, they've scored more than 1.5 goals just three times.",
      "On average, Newcastle are managing just 1.2 goals per away game in that run, struggling to generate sustained pressure or high-quality chances on their travels. The 6/5 with Sky Bet on them scoring under 1.5 goals again on the road looks a winner in waiting.",
      "David Moyes' record away from home against top-level opposition is horrendous.",
      "Going all the way back to his West Ham days, his record away at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City reads 20 losses from 21 games. It's a brutal return.",
      "Those games tend to follow the same script too: sit deep, limit damage, slow the tempo and hope to stay in the contest for as long as possible. Now, this fixture doesn't technically fall into that bracket - but at what point do we start calling Aston Villa an elite home side?",
      "Villa Park has become a fortress. They've won their last 11 home games, a run that includes statement victories over Arsenal and Manchester City. The intensity, structure and belief Unai Emery has created there is right up there with the very best in the league.",
      "Moyes' away games are rarely chaotic though. Since returning to Everton, just two of his 20 away matches have gone over 3.5 goals, with the average sitting at just 1.8 goals per 90. That's why combining a Villa win and under 3.5 goals makes sense at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth's away games this season are bonkers. They're averaging 4.8 goals per game on the road. Nope, not a typo. Yes, almost five goals per game.",
      "The markets are fully aligned for goals in this one though, which naturally pushes us toward the anytime goalscorer angle.",
      "And who better to target than Kaoru Mitoma? The Japanese winger is starting to look like his old sparky, nightmare-for-defenders self. His movement, bursts in behind and instinct for goal are all back in evidence - as shown by his goal vs Manchester City.",
      "History gives us even more confidence. Mitoma has scored five goals in his last six games against Bournemouth - that bit of a psychological edge over the opposition isn't factored into the prices at 5/2 with Sky Bet.",

      "Gary Neville says Michael Carrick must not be Manchester United manager at the start of next season, and has offered his three-man shortlist he would like installed instead.",
      "Carrick succeeded Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford on Tuesday and has been tasked with leading the club - where he won five Premier League titles as a player - to European qualification before the season ends.",
      "Neville wished his former team‑mate well but warned any new‑manager bounce under Carrick, however transformative, should not be viewed as a long‑term solution.",

      "Neville accepted the decision to sack Amorim and hand Carrick the reins until the end of the season was ultimately the right one, but could not hide his disappointment at the sense of déjà vu it left.",

      "\"I don't think there was any other option for the club right now. Most United fans will agree with the decision to get to the end of the season because of the managers who are becoming available.",

      "💥 Semenyo's instant impact at Man City🔴 Attack best form of defence for Carrick📈 Fernandes' return to No 10 role🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Antoine Semenyo has only been a Manchester City player for a week following his £64m arrival from Bournemouth but he has wasted no time in showing just how much he has to offer his new side.",
      "After starting on the left flank and scoring with his right foot in his first game against Exeter, he started on the right flank and scored with his left foot in his second against Newcastle.",
      "One goal came from a run in behind, the other from a back-post tap-in. There was even a demonstration of his set-piece threat with his ludicrously ruled-out second goal on Tuesday night.",
      "He has arrived at the Etihad Stadium with a total of 10 goals in 20 Premier League games which puts him behind only Igor Thiago and his new team-mate Erling Haaland this season. The 26-year-old ranks similarly highly for shots and shots on target.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that he will ease the scoring burden on Haaland, who has scored a higher percentage of his side's goals than any other Premier League player this season.",
      "But he has been signed for the variety as well as the volume of his attacking output. His two-footedness has been cited by Pep Guardiola as a major part of his attraction. Semenyo has an almost even split between right and left-footed goals in the Premier League and ranks as one of the most two-footed shooters in Europe.",
      "His versatility is another factor. Semenyo is comfortable on either flank, as he has already shown in City colours, and that's not all. \"He can play as a striker too with his pace,\" said Guardiola.",
      "Semenyo as a No 9 is an intriguing possibility, especially with Guardiola describing Haaland as \"exhausted\" after the Newcastle game. Maybe Omar Marmoush is not his only rotation option. But it is of course on the flanks that Semenyo can bring the most value.",
      "He was mostly used on the left by Bournemouth this season but Manchester City already have Jeremy Doku there. Semenyo gives them another option but it is worth noting he played more minutes on the right over the course of his time with his former club.",
      "Semenyo's goal against Newcastle, swept home from close range after Bernardo Silva had flicked on Doku's low cross from left to right, was a first glimpse of how the two wingers can combine.",
      "It also typified their different styles as wide players.",
      "While Semenyo is more of a goal threat, shooting roughly twice as frequently as his new team-mate, Doku excels as a provider, creating nearly twice as many chances for team-mates as Semenyo.",
      "The numbers further illustrate how Semenyo gives Guardiola something different. His penchant for the spectacular is another asset. His long-range strike against Spurs in his final Bournemouth appearance was his fourth from outside the box in the Premier League this season. No City player has scored more than two.",
      "He has scored in each of his last three appearances against Manchester United, giving him the chance to become only the fourth player in Premier League history, after Mohamed Salah, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Sergio Aguero, to find the net in four consecutively.",
      "A look back at those previous three goals offers another reminder of the variety of his threat. While one was fired in off the post with ruthless precision following a run in behind, the others were dispatched first-time, with his supposedly weaker foot, having found space to finish in the box, just as he did on Tuesday night.",
      "Michael Carrick faces Guardiola for the first time in his managerial career on Saturday but he knows better than most how disorientating a meeting with one of his teams can be.",
      "Carrick was part of the Manchester United sides outplayed by Guardiola's Barcelona in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals. The first, he later revealed, left psychological scars.",
      "Present-day Manchester City are a different proposition to peak Barcelona. Guardiola has adapted his style in recent years. But they have the same capacity to blow teams away.",
      "Opponents tend to err on the side of caution against them. Manchester United did just that when they ground out a goalless draw in last season's Old Trafford meeting under Ruben Amorim. But attack might be the best form of defence for Carrick as he plots his first game as Amorim's successor.",
      "Manchester United have, after all, displayed attacking improvement amid their inconsistency this season. Only Manchester City and Arsenal have scored more goals, while only City have a higher 'expected' total. They rank top for shots and shots on target.",
      "Carrick's efforts to build on that attacking improvement will be helped on Saturday by the return of two of his most dangerous offensive players in Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo following their involvement at AFCON. It was Amad, of course, who inspired the late victory at the Etihad Stadium last season.",
      "In support of an improving Benjamin Sesko, who has scored three goals in his last two games, they should be confident of causing problems for what is likely to be a makeshift City backline.",
      "Abdukodir Khusanov and Max Alleyne impressed in helping Guardiola's side keep out Newcastle on Tuesday but they are 21 and 20 respectively and only have 11 Premier League starts between them. Carrick should make it his mission to test them at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United's back three is no more. Amorim's exit may also signal the end of Bruno Fernandes playing in a midfield two. He returned to the No 10 role in Darren Fletcher's two games in charge and will surely continue there under Carrick, who used a 4-2-3-1 formation in 112 of his 124 league games in charge of Middlesbrough.",
      "Fernandes' heat maps show an increase in activity in his own half in the last two seasons, illustrating how his role changed under Amorim. It is to the 31-year-old's credit that, despite being asked to play deeper, crowbarred into a system that did not suit him, he continued to carry the same influence in the final third.",
      "This season, he ranks either top or second among Premier League players in a host of creative metrics. His total of 56 chances created is the highest by any player not just in the Premier League but in any of the major European leagues.",
      "Not bad for a guy playing out of position.",
      "Now what can he do back at No 10?",
      "Join David Jones and Jamie Carragher for Brighton vs Bournemouth on Monday Night Football from 7pm, kick-off 8pm.",
      "The last column looked at the significance of Martin Odegaard's return to form for Arsenal and the qualities that make him unique.",

      "\"Free Kobbie Mainoo.\"",
      "That's the sentiment that a number of Manchester United fans and even members of Mainoo's own family haven't been shy in making known over the past year. Under Ruben Amorim, it's fair to say the 20-year-old's early career and momentum hit a major bump in the road.",
      "The midfielder - who Gary Neville once said had \"the world at his feet\" after his maiden games - played a key role for England as the Three Lions reached the Euros final in 2024.",
      "Now, still yet to make a Premier League start this season but still harbouring hopes of making a sensational return to the national team fold, Mainoo has Michael Carrick to learn from.",
      "United's new interim head coach patrolled the midfield to great distinction in his playing days. Now, with the middle of the park a lingering concern at Old Trafford, one of his many tasks will be freeing Mainoo.",
      "\"I think he's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder,\" Carrick said in the summer on Rio Meets, asked about Mainoo.",
      "\"He's probably that line above with that little bit more freedom. I think there are different ways of defending. You can defend on that higher line a little bit but defending right deep around your centre back is a bit of a different thing.",
      "\"I've seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom and create and take the ball. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience and that little bit of break again, which I'm sure he'll get.",
      "\"He's got it and he's shown that. It's a breath of fresh air the way he takes the ball and plays forward and commits people, can play, can dribble, can pass. That doesn't leave you and I think it's just waves that can come and go with time. I've seen it so many times.\"",
      "Asked a direct question whether he'd build the current United team around him, Carrick said: \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think you have to.",
      "\"United's got to have an element of that. Always has done, always should, always have.",
      "\"To have a talent like that he's shown already, you've got to have players like that, you can say they get it, they know it, let's help them, let's build them and stick with them and I think there's definitely a place for him there for sure.\"",
      "The same thoughts were echoed by Carrick, who told Rio Ferdinand that a \"good midfielder can play in different ways\". Mainoo has been the subject of an experiment to test that theory since he broke through.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, the then 18-year-old was handed his first start at the foot of United's midfield at Everton, impressing alongside Scott McTominay. A flash in the pan turned to a crash in the box as his first season as being involved in the first game culminated in a winning goal in the FA Cup final, again, as part of a midfield two - this time partnering Sofyan Amrabat.",
      "For England, Mainoo would go on to fill a similar role as a No 8 alongside Declan Rice at the Euros, starting every game from the last group stage onwards.",
      "Amorim's eventual arrival at Man Utd plunged Mainoo's role into doubt. Initially used as part of a two, sat ahead of Amorim's infamous back three, Mainoo would go on to be deployed as a No 10 and as a false No 9 at times throughout the course of the season.",
      "In this campaign, Amorim made it clear that Mainoo would be challenging for a spot in the team against an immovable Bruno Fernandes. The United captain, up until his injury in December, had started every game this season bar United's Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby.",
      "However, his injury didn't provide an opportunity for Mainoo as he too picked up a knock that ruled him out until Fernandes' return. The 3-4-2-1 didn't suit Mainoo but in a return to a flatter back four upon his return to the team under Darren Fletcher, he showed some promise.",
      "The 4-2-3-1 was Carrick's most-used formation during his time at Middlesbrough, with the former Man Utd midfielder setting up that way in 90% of his matches in charge at the Riverside.",
      "Mainoo could emerge as one of the key beneficiaries of Carrick's 17 games in charge at his old stomping ground. Maybe then, we might see a change in matchday attire for any members of the Mainoo family concerned about his lack of 'freedom'.",

      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:40, UK",
      "Manchester United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as the frontrunner for the role after the club held discussions with the former midfielder and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the departure of Ruben Amorim on January 5.",
      "United have only the Premier League to focus on following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, which was overseen by caretaker boss Darren Fletcher. Plans to appoint an interim head coach were accelerated following that defeat.",
      "Gareth Southgate's former England assistant coach Steve Holland will be Carrick's No 2, while ex-Boro assistant and Leeds player Jonathan Woodgate, current U21s coach Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans, who rejoined the club during Darren Fletcher's interim period, will also all form part of the backroom team.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United.",
      "\"He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "United did not want to be in a position of changing head coaches mid season but results and behaviours meant they needed to act immediately in order to have the best chance of still achieving their objectives this season.",
      "Wilcox began the process of identifying a head coach until the end of the season to give them time to run a thorough process for a permanent coach.",
      "United wanted to bring in someone who knew and understood the club to reduce the risk of a period of adaptation and after speaking to three candidates, Carrick was the unanimous choice.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to identify and select the right profile of coaches to support him and agreed to approach Holland and Woodgate. Neither had worked with Holland but felt his skillset and experience would be beneficial. Carrick worked closely with Woodgate, an accomplished coach, and has a strong relationship with him.",
      "Meanwhile, all at United are aligned for Fletcher, who has impressed the hierachy, to return to U18s in order to support his desire to further his development and keep an excellent coach in a key position.",
      "Carrick made 464 appearances for the club across his 12 years at Old Trafford but remained there as part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff when he retired in 2018.",
      "After Mourinho was sacked in December of that year, Carrick was briefly named interim manager before joining Solskjaer's backroom staff upon his arrival on an interim basis.",
      "The duo, who were both in the running to temporarily succeed Ruben Amorim, then remained at the club permanently when Solskjaer was handed the role in March 2019.",
      "The Norwegian coach was sacked in November 2021, and Carrick resumed the position of caretaker boss, going unbeaten in his three games at the helm with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, as well as a point at Chelsea.",
      "Carrick stepped down from his role and left the club when Ralf Rangnick arrived before then taking charge at Middlesbrough in October 2022.",
      "Boro were 21st and one point above the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but narrowly missed out on promotion after losing to Coventry City in the play-off semi-finals that year, after rising to a fourth-place finish.",
      "Carrick then guided the team to eighth and 10th-place finishes in the following two seasons, leading to his departure in June 2025.",
      "Carrick predominantly deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, occasionally reverting to Sir Alex Ferguson's favoured 4-4-2 on six occasions - more than the five times he opted for a three-at-the-back system.",
      "Under his management, Middlesbrough recorded league-leading numbers for high turnovers and fast breaks, while also ranking among the top sides for build-up attacks and direct attacks.",
      "Given this, Carrick is likely to implement a 4-2-3-1 with an aggressive press, combining patient possession-based build-up with frequent switches to long passes and rapid transitions.",

      "Between the Lines takes a look at this season's increase in set-piece goals as Premier League clubs try to give themselves an edge; Arsenal are most effective side, Liverpool least, but what are they doing differently? And where does every team rank?",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright and David Fraser",
      "Thursday 15 January 2026 12:16, UK",
      "Set-pieces goals are on the rise in the Premier League.",
      "What's behind the growing emphasis on dead-ball situations? And why are some teams excelling and others struggling?",
      "This week's Between the Lines looks at one of this season's defining trends as clubs vie for set-piece supremacy.",
      "The increase in non-penalty set-piece goals can be seen in the numbers. This season, there has been an average of 0.8 per game, up from 0.6 last term and an increase of roughly 50 per cent from the 0.5 per game average in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "The inverse pattern can be seen for open-play goals. This season's average of 1.8 open-play goals per game is down from 2.2 last season and 2.4 in the campaign before that.",
      "It is part of a shift of emphasis towards set-piece efficiency. Spurs boss Thomas Frank recently used the term \"low-hanging fruit\" to describe set-pieces as a route to goal. It is clearly a view shared by a growing number of clubs up and down the division.",
      "Specialist set-piece coaches were unusual as recently as a few years ago. Now, 15 out of 20 Premier League clubs employ set-piece coaches. Brentford even promoted their set-piece coach to the role of head coach when Keith Andrews replaced Frank.",
      "Arsenal have had success with one of the Premier League's most recognisable set-piece coaches in Nicolas Jover. They recently hired former Liverpool throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark, underlining their commitment to maximising set-pieces.",
      "The specialist coaches are responsible for implementing techniques and devising routines which are honed through practice and repetition on the training ground. Teams are now spending more time on set-pieces during games as well as behind closed doors.",
      "According to Opta, the average number of seconds spent preparing for corners has increased steadily over the last 10 seasons in the Premier League, from 26 seconds in 2016/17 to 36 seconds this term, as players take time to communicate routines.",
      "There has been a similar pattern in time spent preparing for free-kicks, while the time spent preparing for throw-ins has increased even more dramatically this season following the resurgence of long throws up and down the division.",
      "Arsenal continue to be leaders in the set-piece field. The Gunners topped the rankings for set-piece goals, excluding penalties, in each of the last two seasons and occupy the same spot this term, their total of 14 putting them one clear of Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea and Leeds have the next-highest-totals, with 12, while Liverpool are at the opposite end of the scale having only scored three non-penalty set-piece goals, fewer than even the Premier League's bottom side Wolves, who have scored four.",
      "Liverpool's issues are not limited to attacking set-pieces. They are struggling just as badly defensively. Their total of 13 set-piece goals conceded this term is the joint-second highest in the Premier League behind Bournemouth, on 14.",
      "The result is that while Arsenal sit top for net set-piece goals on nine, having only conceded five to the 14 they have scored, putting them just ahead of Spurs, who have improved considerably in the area under Frank, Liverpool sit bottom on -10.",
      "So what do Arsenal and Liverpool do differently?",
      "On corners, there is a significant difference in delivery type.",
      "Inswinging corners are statistically more likely to lead to goals but Liverpool have taken the lowest percentage of inswingers in the Premier League this season at 48 per cent. Arsenal, by contrast, have one of the highest percentages, at 81 per cent.",
      "This season in the Premier League, there have been 77 goals from inswinging corners, according to Opta, compared to only 11 from outswinging corners.",
      "The difference is partly down to a higher volume of inswingers compared to outswingers. But inswingers have a higher success rate too, with 5.3 per cent of inswingers leading to goals this season compared to only 3.6 per cent of outswingers.",
      "Leeds appear an anomaly given they rank joint-third for set-piece goals despite having taken an even higher percentage of outswinging corners than Liverpool, but it is worth noting their last four corner goals have in fact come from inswinging deliveries.",
      "By using inswingingers, teams are able to target the six-yard box, putting opposition goalkeepers under direct pressure and generating close-range chances from flicks and headers.",
      "The trajectory of an inswinger also opens up the possibility of scoring directly from a corner, as done by Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes against Burnley in December.",
      "Targeting the six-yard box with inswingers continues to pay off for Arsenal, most recently in their 3-2 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg win at Chelsea, when Ben White headed the opener from an inswinging Declan Rice delivery.",
      "The most recent Premier League example came from the other side, when Bukayo Saka's centre was bundled over the line by Gabriel from a few yards out during the 4-1 win over Aston Villa.",
      "But there is a big contrast in Liverpool's corner delivery locations.",
      "While Arsenal have sent 58 per cent of their corners into the six-yard box, Liverpool have only hit the six-yard box with 36 per cent of theirs. A much higher proportion land further away from goal, and therefore in less dangerous areas, due to their use of outswingers",
      "It is a factor which helps to explain Arsenal's superior set-piece scoring record. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher has put Liverpool's issues defending set-pieces down to a zonal marking system which leaves too much space to opposition players.",
      "\"What Liverpool like to do on set-pieces is man-to-man mark, and also have three players in a zone. What that means is, there's an overload outside of the box.\"",
      "Fulham ended up capitalising on that overload in spectacular style but the issue has been apparent all season, with the vast majority of the set-piece goals Liverpool have conceded coming from second balls dispatched by opposition players in space.",
      "The extent of the issue can be seen in the fact that only one Premier League side, Crystal Palace, have conceded a higher percentage of goals from set-pieces than Liverpool this term.",
      "Long throws have been adopted by the majority of Premier League teams this season. The average has more than doubled to nearly four per game. But which clubs use them most effectively?",
      "Brentford have launched the most long throws this season, becoming the first side to reach 100 for the campaign during their 3-0 win over Sunderland last weekend.",
      "Their use of long throws is not new. The Bees were early adopters. This season, their throws have led to three goals, the joint-most in the Premier League along with Crystal Palace and Sunderland.",
      "Interestingly, though, it is Leeds, not Brentford, Palace or Sunderland, who rank top for shots and expected goals from long throws, suggesting they are the most dangerous.",
      "Daniel Farke's side have only scored twice from long throws this season but, from a total of 75 long throws, they have managed 28 shots worth 3.46 xG, compared to Brentford's 27 shots worth 2.73 xG from 100 long throws.",
      "It is just another area in which Premier League teams are scrambling to find an edge as the trend towards set-pieces continues.",
      "Before Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach, we looked at which managers best fit the fabled Man Utd 'DNA' using a stylistic profile of Sir Alex Ferguson's 2012/13 title-winners. Carrick ranked pretty highly but which former Chelsea boss came out top?",

      "By Rob Dorsett & Danyal Khan",
      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:27, UK",
      "Manchester United have gone with Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season, as Rob Dorsett and Danyal Khan break down why the club's hierarchy and Jason Wilcox landed on the appointment...",
      "When Ruben Amorim was sacked last week, people close to him told us the Portuguese coach had been surprised - and struggled - with the sheer volume of noise in and around Old Trafford. Amorim confided in his friends to say how impossible it was to fully prepare or predict what the unique challenges were of being the main man at Manchester United.",
      "United's bosses weren't about to make the same mistake twice.",
      "That is why United's shortlist of candidates for the interim head coach position was made up entirely of United old-boys. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Carrick were to the fore.",
      "The club hierarchy, led by director of football Jason Wilcox, wanted someone who knows the club, who has experienced the pressure and the expectation, who would feel comfortable in a difficult environment where the spotlight is blinding, and where the mood among the fanbase is still filled with frustration, remembering glories past.",
      "Michael Carrick was up front and central in that glorious past. As a player under Sir Alex Ferguson, he won five Premier League titles, one Champions League, one Europa League, one FA Cup, two League Cups and one Club World Cup. His first taste of coaching was at Old Trafford under Jose Mourinho, and he had short stints as caretaker boss, either side of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's spell in charge. United's bosses are as confident as they can be, that he will not be fazed by the environment he is stepping back into.",
      "It is clear the club's hierarchy didn't want to change head coach mid-season, but with poor results and a total breakdown in the relationship with Amorim, the club was forced to act. Many fans and commentators will ask why United couldn't appoint a new, high-profile manager straight away. But the reality is that Manchester United doesn't have the same pull for the world's elite coaches that it did a decade ago. There is no European football. Budgets are tight. There is still a major restructuring of the entire club taking place.",
      "And so it was sensible for the club to take a pragmatic approach, and save the big decision about the next big boss until the summer, when more big names will be available. Once that decision was made, it was a question of who would be best to run things for the remainder of the season, and give the team maximum chance to achieve European football for 2026/27.",
      "That man, it was decided, was Carrick. And even though he and no one else on the coaching staff has ever worked with Steve Holland before, there was a unanimous feeling that his experience and tactical nous could prove invaluable. Importantly, he was also available to start immediately, without the need to pay compensation.",
      "Other key factors in Carrick's appointment were his familiarity with the structure of power at United. Wilcox works closely with the head coach over strategy, philosophy and team selection. Ultimately, it was the significant differences of opinion and Amorim's reluctance to align tactically with Wilcox that saw him get the boot.",
      "Carrick has made it clear he is happy to work within United's existing systems, pointing out that he did so effectively at Middlesbrough, where he worked closely with head of football Kieran Scott. He also impressed in interview in terms of his ability to lead a team, and his strong knowledge of the players already at the club.",
      "Sometimes criticised for a lack of adaptability at the Riverside Stadium, Carrick stuck true to his footballing philosophy - one where dominating the football, and opposition, was the primary game plan. That idea, too, aligns with the type of football Wilcox wants to see this United squad play.",
      "But what about the other main candidate, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?",
      "The noise from Solskjaer's camp early on was that he was not just interested in the role, he was the favourite. That was noticed inside Carrington with bemusement considering they were clear that no decision would be made until they sat down with the two candidates.",
      "Multiple sources have told us after meeting Carrick face-to-face last Thursday, United's leadership were left impressed. More so than for Solskjaer.",
      "As mentioned, his philosophy and tactical approach undoubtedly made an impact on the likes of Wilcox and Berrada but his willingness to take on the role with no guarantee of a permanent role at the end of the season was also to his advantage during the process.",
      "Solskjaer, it is understood, wanted a permanent option if he performed well in the role - a desire which the United hierarchy were not willing to entertain - clear that role was until the end of the season.",
      "It also has to be considered that a potential return for Solskjaer, who was manager under the previous regime, could be interpreted as a backward step. After consistent messaging around INEOS being forward-thinking, questions would have been asked about returning to a previous manager who did not necessarily succeed during his first spell at the club. Popular with the fan base, yes, but it was a difficult sell and not a good look.",
      "And so Carrick begins his limited reign as United's main man. As things stand, it is unlikely he will be considered for the longer-term role in the summer, alongside the likes of Thomas Tuchel, Oliver Glasner, Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique, Marco Silva et al. But the hope is that his appointment will prove to be a positive one for both the coach, and the club which he now heads.",
      "He needs to hit the ground running, but he will be given a little leeway early on - Manchester City at home and Arsenal away - will prove a baptism of fire.",

      "Manchester United are out of the FA Cup meaning they will only play 40 games this season; with the club out of both domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle and a league title highly unlikely this term - where do the managerless club go this season?",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 07:50, UK",
      "No manager, no trophy hopes, no noise. The final whistle against Brighton was met with a few boos, then stunned silence. Just where do Manchester United go from here?",
      "One statistic flew around United's FA Cup defeat to Brighton. 40 games - that is how long United's season will be. Their shortest season since the 1914-15 campaign, where there were no cup games due to the First World War.",
      "Defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round, then a first ever defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup also made it the first time United have been knocked out the two domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle since the 1981-82 season.",
      "That was not the only déjà vu United experienced on Sunday night. Another was Danny Welbeck. The last time United had 45 games or fewer in the season was 11 years ago, when Welbeck scored an FA Cup winner in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford for Arsenal. Sounds familiar.",
      "And with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the two main contenders for the United interim job - having held those positions in the past - it's one nod to the past too many.",
      "So what does the future hold?",
      "United are now one of only three Premier League teams who just have top-flight football on their calendar between now and May, the others being Bournemouth and Everton. Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."

Benjamin Sesko headed home Fernandes' corner to bring some hope, but United's day got worse with 18-year-old Lacey receiving two quick yellows in succession, the second for dissent, as a late equaliser evaded them.",
