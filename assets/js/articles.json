      "Manchester United had made Jarrad Branthwaite one of their top summer targets but appear to have moved on from the defender after Everton rejected two bids for him",
      "Jarrad Branthwaite has insisted his full focus is on Everton having seen the Toffees reject two bids from Manchester United for him.",
      "The Red Devils made the defender one of their top targets for the summer transfer window after an impressive debut campaign at Goodison Park. The 22-year-old won Everton’s Players’ Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season after his starring performances.",
      "Those displays attracted the eye of United, who have prioritised signing defenders this summer. But the Premier League giants were twice rebuffed by Everton, who value Branthwaite at between £70million and £80million.",
      "United were only willing to go as high as £46m though and appear to have now turned to secondary target Leny Yoro. The 18-year-old has had a medical at Old Trafford, with Branthwaite now brushing off any suggestion he will leave Everton this summer.",
      "“I think for me it's just about taking what I learned from last season, and the season before, and putting it all together. I think last season, playing all the games I did helped me put performances in and get the experience I needed,\" he told Everton's club website.",
      "\"I'm going to take that into this season and keep learning. When you’ve got a good defensive record, it gives you confidence going into the new season. It’s not just the defenders who contribute to that, it’s the whole team.",
      "\"And it’s the way the manager has us set up to give us the best possible chance to win games, and to pick up as many points as we can. I think it’ll be the same again this season. Hopefully, we can pick up a few wins early on and get the momentum going in the new season.",
      "“I think for any young person, any young player, it's about playing as many games as you can and that gives you the experience you need. You can only get experience in games and taking that into each game that I've done last season. It helped me massively to put in the performances which I did.\"",
      "As well as the interest from United, Branthwaite's performances earned him his first England cap. And he is now looking to build on his appearance in the 3-0 win over Bosnia & Herzegovina under the Three Lions' next boss.",
      "\"I think you’ve got to be confident in your ability, but it's the best league in the world. It's got the best players and it's obviously the most difficult league in the world, so you know the expectations you're going to have,\" he added.",
      "“It’s a dream come true. I think for any young kids, growing up, to represent their country is the main objective. For me to able to do that – with my family there, as well – it was massive. Not just for me, but for all of my family and friends, as well. It was a great experience.",
      "“I want to play for England as many times as I can. It’s about putting in performances for club out there for whoever the next England manager is going to be, and to impress them. Hopefully, I get many more opportunities.”",

      "When Matthijs de Ligt was first linked with a move to Manchester United, Louis van Gaal's thinly-veiled reaction to those initial links spoke volumes",
      "Former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal once urged Matthijs de Ligt to snub a move to Old Trafford - five years before the Red Devils flirted with signing him again.",
      "United recently agreed personal terms with the central defender, which would have seen the 24-year-old ignore the advice from the manager he played under with the Netherlands. He appeared to be Erik ten Hag's preferred choice to fill the void left by the departing Raphael Varane.",
      "However, the Red Devils' interest in the 24-year-old has cooled after they completed a medical for 18-year-old defensive prospect Leny Yoro, ahead of a £58m move. This has seemingly left De Ligt, who was benched by Eric Dier at Bayern Munich last season, in an awkward position, as it's unlikely United will shell out on another defender unless they sell any more of their current players.",
      "Considering what has transpired the last few days, De Ligt may have been wishing that he followed Van Gaal's advice and steered completely clear of negotiating with United.",
      "When United were first interested in De Ligt in 2019, Van Gaal listed three teams he should join instead, including the Red Devils' fierce rivals Manchester City. In an interview with Ziggo Sport, Van Gaal said: \"De Ligt at Juventus? I think De Ligt can play in any competition.",
      "\"In Italy, they are the masters of defence, so he can best develop there. If I had the chance I would go to Barcelona. They have central defenders who are not too good, so he will play there. Or I would go to Manchester City. I don't think the central defenders are that great either, so he'll play there too.\"",
      "Yoro will join Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans in United's central defensive ranks. His arrival means they have now filled the hefty void departed by Varane, who left on a free transfer when his contract expired at the end of June.",
      "When it comes to their backline, United are unlikely to add to it unless there are more outgoings. This is still a possibility as Maguire and Lindelof have been linked with moves away from Old Trafford.",
      "The club are understood to be looking for a buyer for Linedlof, whose deal was extended by a year last season to stop him from leaving for nothing on June 30.",
      "West Ham United have also previously expressed an interest in Maguire and are believed to be in discussions with the Red Devils about signing right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka. United have been one of the busier clubs so far in the transfer window.",
      "They recently welcomed the £36.54m arrival of Bologna forward and young prospect Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman, who has two international caps for the Netherlands, both coming at Euro 2024, was recently announced by the club.",

      "Erik ten Hag is hoping Manchester United can enjoy a dream summer transfer window as he bids to revive his reign following a largely miserable second season in charge",
      "Manchester United are hoping for a perfect summer window if Erik ten Hag is to revive his faltering reign.",
      "Ten Hag endured a dreadful second season in charge last year and while he has been handed a new contract, the pressure is on for the Dutchman. United chiefs have already boosted their manager by signing Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The Netherlands international will battle it out with Rasmus Hojlund to lead the line in the Red Devils line-up. Ten Hag is also keen to add at least two more centre-backs to his squad and is still on the search for a replacement for Casemiro.",
      "United's pre-season got off to a bad start with a defeat to Norwegian team Rosenborg and Ten Hag will be hoping the transfer window brings some much-needed positive news. Here, Mirror Football looks at how a perfect summer for United could play out.",
      "15 July: Rosenborg 1-0 Man Utd",
      "20 July: Rangers v Man Utd, Murrayfield, Edinburgh (16:00)",
      "28 July : Man Utd v Arsenal, SoFi Stadium, Los Angeles (01:00)",
      "2 August: Man Utd v Real Betis, Snapdragon Stadium, San Diego (03:00)",
      "4 August: Man Utd v Liverpool, William-Brice Stadium, Columbia, South Carolina, (00:30)",
      "United have been quick out of the blocks this summer, having already completed a move for top target Joshua Zirkzee. The Netherlands star impressed for Bologna last season and has signed for United in a deal worth £36million.",
      "He will become the primary back-up for Rasmus Hojlund and will be looking to dislodge the Dane from the starting line-up. They are also set to announce the signing of Leny Yoro from Lille.",
      "The 18-year-old has emerged as one of the top prospects in France and he comes in to boost Ten Hag's defensive options. The other piece of business completed has been the patching up of relations between Ten Hag and Jadon Sancho, with the winger now rejoining the first-team squad.",
      "Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt is still a United target, with Ten Hag desperate to bring his compatriot to Old Trafford. De Ligt has endured a few tough years, but played his best football under the current United boss at Ajax.",
      "He would certainly be a major boost for United's defence and Bayern Munich appear ready to sell. But he'll only arrive if there are outgoings; however, don't bet against it.",
      "The top target now is Manuel Ugarte, Paris Saint-Germain's Uruguayan midfield destroyer. He only joined PSG from Porto last summer but is available again, and United are very keen. The money for Mason Greenwood can go towards a deal for him, with Ugarte a like-for-like replacement for Casemiro, who struggled badly during United's difficult season last term.",
      "The aforementioned Casemiro would likely head the list of those players departing Old Trafford. The Brazilian's career at the top level appears to be all but over, with Jamie Carragher just one pundit to urge him to move on.",
      "Elsewhere, United are ready to sell Aaron Wan-Bissaka, with the Red Devils willing to accept a fee of just £15m for the right-back. Greenwood meanwhile is on his way to Marseille, with the Red Devils set to bring in a record profit for the striker.",
      "Harry Maguire's time at United also appears to be over, with De Ligt and Yoro arriving and United ready to listen to bids for him. And they could also be tempted to allow Scott McTominay to depart, having already rejected at least one bid for him.",
      "Dream opening day XI: Andre Onana; Diogo Dalot, Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw; Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Bruno Fernandes; Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford",

      "Arsenal are among the top Premier League clubs who admire Marc Guehi, however, Crystal Palace's demands mean a deal for the coveted defender is unlikely to materialise",
      "Arsenal have shelved interest in Marc Guehi with Crystal Palace demanding more than £70million for the England defender.",
      "Guehi, 24, was one of the standout performers for England at Euro 2024 after being drafted into Gareth Southgate's starting XI and is admired by some of the Premier League's elite.",
      "Both Liverpool and Manchester United have been credited with an interest in the centre-back's services throughout the summer - and it's now emerged that Arsenal were also mulling over a move for the Eagles' star defender. However, The Times notes that Arsenal have moved on to other targets after being priced out of a move for Guehi, who is valued in excess of £70m.",
      "Palace are aware of interest in the defender and his stock is at an all-time high after his strong showing at the European Championship. But Chelsea are due 20 per cent of any future sale which has influenced the Eagles' demands.",
      "While it remains to be seen if anybody will attempt to prise Guehi away from Crystal Palace this summer, Arsenal have turned their attention to Riccardo Calafiori. The Italy defender, 22, is capable of playing as either a centre-back or a left-back and was one of his country's top performers at Euro 2024.",
      "Recent reports have indicated that Arsenal are in talks with Bologna over a deal for Calafiori. The Serie A outfit are also hampered, though, by a significant sell-on clause which would see the defender's former club, Basel, profit from any deal worth more than the £3.4m they banked when selling him last year.",
      "With no deal in place between Arsenal and Bologna, Calafiori returned to pre-season training this week following a break after his Euro 2024 exploits.",
      "Bologna have already sold one first-team star to a Premier League club this summer following Joshua Zirkzee's switch to Manchester United, but it's not thought that they would attempt to stand in Calafiori's way should Arsenal meet their demands - despite being able to offer Champions League football.",
      "Arsenal have made just the one senior signing this summer, bringing David Raya back to the club on a permanent basis. A number of fringe players, including Eddie Nketiah, Emile Smith-Rowe and Reiss Nelson, have all been linked with moves away.",

      "Graeme Souness has taken aim at Kobbie Mainoo as he highlighted flaws in his game whilst away with England - some of which he also criticised Paul Pogba for whilst at Manchester United",
      "Graeme Souness' gripes with Paul Pogba seemed to rumble on for years - and now he's delivered similar criticism to Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Manchester United 's teenage sensation made his debut less than a year ago but has enjoyed a rapid rise, featuring in England's Euro campaign and scoring in the final of the FA Cup as the Red Devils claimed the trophy at Wembley.",
      "Huge plaudits have come his way as he's defied his age and experience to influence games from the middle of the pitch. Mainoo started several games at this summer's Euros, including the final, but for the first time in his career has come in for criticism for his displays.",
      "The United youngster was unable to help the Three Lions wrestle back control in some of their games this summer, notably in the final when the Spanish midfield dominated the contest in Berlin.",
      "At such a tender age Mainoo has plenty still to learn but Souness has delivered him a reality check by admitting, off the ball, he seems to lack an awareness and portrays an element of naivety.",
      "He said on the Up Front podcast : \"I think he’s really good on the ball, he’s very talented on the ball, but he doesn’t fully understand the position. He wanders, he empties the middle of the field too readily. I watched him against Iceland [in England’s final Euro 2024 warm-up game] and he was getting thrown to the left and thrown to the right.",
      "\"He came on as a substitute when holding onto a 1-0 lead [in the Euro 2024 opener against Serbia] and the first thing he did was chase down the goalkeeper and try to put him under pressure. It’s naivety, he’s still learning the game.\"",
      "Few expect Mainoo to be the finished article and his exploits thus far, particularly in Manchester, have marked him out as a generational talent and those at Old Trafford are ready to sit down and offer the teenager a new deal to tie him down long-term.",
      "Another man those in Manchester thought was a future star was Pogba. They had the Frenchman as a teenager, before seeing him leave for Juventus. They believed so much in his talent though that they spent a club-record fee of £89million to bring him back in the summer of 2016.",
      "Pogba's time at Old Trafford, which spanned six seasons, was categorised by moments of brilliance in a spell that ultimately failed to deliver as inconsistencies hampered the Frenchman.",
      "Souness was among his most vocal of critics - with some of those now echoing what he's said about Mainoo. He previously commented on Pogba: \"He has super individual ability - there is much to admire about his technique when he is on the ball and his general athleticism.",
      "\"But if I am playing today I want to play against him because he is never where he should be when I am in possession. The criticism I have is that he doesn't understand the role when not in possession. I don't see any changes in his play from the day he arrived to now. With all his attributes he should be a bigger goal threat.\"",

      "France Under-21s boss Thierry Henry has given his thoughts on Leny Yoro's potential, with the 18-year-old on the verge of completing a big money move to Manchester United",
      "Manchester United are closing in on the signing of Leny Yoro in a deal worth up to £52million and Thierry Henry has delivered a glowing verdict of the 18-year-old's potential.",
      "United have beaten off Liverpool and Real Madrid for Yoro's signature, with the teenager set to become their second signing of the summer after striker Joshua Zirkzee joined from Bologna. The Red Devils have agreed an initial fee of £42m, plus an additional £10m in add-ons.",
      "And Arsenal legend Henry, who gave Yoro his debut for France's Under-21s when he was just 17, believes the defender has a huge future ahead of him. However, he did admit that a player as young as Yoro will \"make mistakes\" as he continues to learn his trade.",
      "\"We often talk about Leny,\" Henry told Le Petit Lillois earlier this year. \"He is having an exemplary start to his career. To establish himself in Lille as he is doing… He always has some young reactions, and that is completely normal.",
      "\"It comes slowly, you make mistakes and sometimes you get embarrassed. (But) he goes on to play one match after another, he starts quite often and quite often is good. It's really good for him.",
      "\"He is professional, he's a good guy, well-educated. I like him. He performs well. Afterwards, there are always things to refine, but that's completely normal. Frankly, it's really a more than positive progression.\"",
      "United academy graduate Angel Gomes, who is now one of Yoro's teammates at Lille, has also backed him to be a success at Old Trafford. \"As soon as he arrived in the group, I understood that he was going to reach the summits,\" Gomes told Eurosport.",
      "\"When I discovered the pros at the age of 16 at Manchester United, I understood that it was different. He already had the right temperament. That's not normal for a 16- or 17-year-old player arriving. It's like he's already an experienced player and it showed in the way he trained, the way he behaved. His progress was obvious.\"",
      "Former Lille boss Paulo Fonseca, who left the club to take over AC Milan this summer, also believes Yoro has a huge future. \"I believe Leny in the next year will be at one of the best clubs in Europe,\" Fonseca said earlier this year.",
      "\"He started here at 16 with us. He is very ambitious but very disciplined. \"He grew a lot but he is a kid with a big maturity, with big quality. He's very focused and very concentrated, he wants to learn every day. I have no doubt in modern football he will be one of the best central defenders in the world.\"",

While he was a regular starter for the Red Devils during his tenure, he failed to meet the expectations of the fanbase, which led to his departure last year upon the expiration of his contract.",

      "Among the several soundbites Keane's offered up during his punditry career, one of the more scathing pieces of analysis came in United's first league game of the 2022/23 campaign when they suffered a shock 2-1 loss to Brighton at Old Trafford.",
      "As expected, Fred and McTominay were in the firing line as a fiery Keane ranted: \"The [lack of] decision-making and football intelligence from midfield, particularly Fred. I've been going on about it for a long time – Fred and [Scott] McTominay are not good enough. They won't get Manchester United back to competing at the top. We see it week in, week out.

The Red Devils have the young centre-half on their shortlist and the French club were looking to sell with Yoro's contract winding down.",

      "NBA legend Kevin Durant has weighed in on the Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo debate by declaring the Portuguese star as the \"goat\".",
      "Durant, who now plays for Phoenix Suns after stints with Golden State Warriors and the Brooklyn Nets, was being interviewed by YouTuber Speed, and then later by Logan Paul & Mike Majlak on their podcast 'Impaulsive'. On both occasions when asked who he thought was better, the basketball icon took a slight pause before stating that Ronaldo was his preferred choice.",
      "Discourse over who is the better player out of the two has been raging for years with pundits and fans alike often unable to seperate them. There was no such issue with Durant though with the two-time NBA champion, double MVP, and triple Olympic gold medalist knowing a thing or two about what it takes to make it as a sporting great.",
      "The 30-year-old, who has also been selected for the All Star team 14 times in his storied career on the court, was approached by Speed, who pops the question about Ronaldo or Messi. Durant then takes a step back and ponders the query for a very brief moment before confidently stating it's Ronaldo he favours.",
      "Speed then laughs before declaring that \"KD is a Ronaldo fan\" and that the former Oklahoma Thunder player \"knows who the goat is\". If you want to contextualise the argument over just who is the best ever between Ronaldo and Messi it's worth looking at the trophy hauls, both for team and individually, throughout their careers.",
      "The Argentinian has won an astonishing eight Ballons d'Or compared to Ronaldo's five, eight of FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four, making him the most decorated player in the history of the game. Messi's unrivalled haul of 45 senior titles will seal the debate for most, and after he led Argentina to victory in the 2022 World Cup, a number of commentators and players have settled on Messi. But that's not the case according to Durant.",
      "While Messi currently plays for Inter Miami, he spent the bulk of his professional career with Barcelona where he won 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the Champions League four times. Ronaldo has played for several clubs throughout his career although trophies have often followed wherever he played his game.",
      "His trophy cabinet, despite being slightly smaller than Messi's, is still nothing to be sniffed at with the Real Madrid and Manchester United legend winning 33 trophies in his career. This includes seven league titles, five Champions Leagues, Euro 2016 with Portugal and the UEFA Nations League.",

      "Harry Maguire has been praised by Manchester United fans after a video emerged which showed him taking time to speak to all the academy players at the training ground",
      "Manchester United fans have called on Erik ten Hag to reinstate Harry Maguire as captain after being reminded of his leadership skills in a behind-the-scenes video.",
      "Maguire is one of few senior United players training at their Carrington complex after missing out on Euro 2024 due to injury. The 31-year-old defender was cut from Gareth Southgate’s squad after failing to shake off a calf injury and has been working hard to regain full fitness for the 2024/25 campaign with United.",
      "He was not a part of the United squad which travelled to Trondheim to play Rosenborg on Monday and instead stayed behind to train alongside some of the club’s youngsters. And in a clip from MUTV, Maguire was shown saying hello to and shaking the hands of every player in the gym on training bikes.",
      "Maguire goes along the line of academy players, who look delighted to get recognition from a senior player. The centre-back was stripped of the United captaincy by Erik ten Hag in July 2023, with the Dutchman opting to hand the armband to Bruno Fernandes, but he clearly still commands respect among the players.",
      "The video clip went viral on Twitter, with many United fans posting praise for Maguire – with some suggesting he should replace Fernandes as skipper. “Acting like a leader,” one fan wrote. Another wrote: “That's my captain there”. “A captain’s attitude,” a third added.",
      "Another wrote: “You always hear from many players in and around the squad how Maguire makes them feel welcoming and at home right away. This is a nice example of this in training this week greeting all the young lads. A class act and great leader.”",
      "Maguire joined United in a £80million transfer from Leicester in the summer of 2019 and was made captain by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January 2020. Solskjaer revealed earlier this year that he had doubts about Fernandes’ suitability for the role.",
      "“I knew Bruno Fernandes had captain qualities when I was manager at Manchester United,” he said on the Stick to Football podcast. “He’s got the personality and quality – but he knows and I’ve told him – that he’s too passionate at times and he loses a bit of control. I loved Harry Maguire as a captain, he was the leader in that group for me when I was at the club.”",
      "He added: “The way that Harry Maguire has handled himself with everything happening to him at Manchester United is top class and just shows the character he’s got, that I want in players.”",
      "Ten Hag is very unlikely to go back on his decision, especially given that Maguire is not guaranteed a place in the starting XI. United have spent £52m to bring in Leny Yoro, who could partner Lisandro Martinez in defence, while Matthijs de Ligt could also be arriving this summer.",

      "Scott McTominay managed to force himself back into Manchester United contention last season having looked set for an exit and the Red Devils have now shared their stance on a sale",
      "Manchester United have turned down a bid from Fulham for academy graduate Scott McTominay.",
      "The Red Devils midfielder has just a year remaining on his contract at Old Trafford - albeit United having an option to extend that deal by a further year. His precarious situation has left McTominay’s future far from certain.",
      "And Premier League rivals have attempted to take advantage of that with a move. Fulham have reportedly tabled their opening bid for the Scottish midfielder.",
      "But according to Mail Online, that offer has been rebuffed by the Red Devils. It is suggested that Fulham’s bid is lower than a £30m offer that Man United turned down from West Ham last summer.",
      "McTominay looked set for an Old Trafford exit 12 months ago but enjoyed a dramatic u-turn under current boss Erik ten Hag. The 27-year-old scored a career-best 10 goals last term despite a tricky season from the Red Devils’ perspective.",
      "Ten Hag regularly underlined how crucial McTominay had been. Speaking last season, the Dutchman said: “Every player has a price but he has a big value, sporting and also economic.",
      "“I want to have a player like Scott McTominay in the squad. He is Manchester United in every faith. Every minute he will fight for the match. He is Manchester United in everything in his heart. When you are coming on and giving this to the team it tells a lot.”",
      "\"He is Manchester United in everything and in his heart,” the Red Devils’ boss added. ”So he's playing for the badge. He gives his life. And when you're coming on and you give this to the team, it tells a lot.\"",
      "While Fulham are interested in a move for McTominay, foreign sides are also keeping a close eye on him. Galatasaray vice president Ibrahim Hatipoglu confirmed that his side had added the midfielder to their shortlist for the summer.",
      "\"McTominay's transfer fee is being discussed,\" he was quoted by Haber Sarı Kırmızı. \"Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg is a good player, he has many suitors, he wants to see all options.",
      "\"There is no talk of single-digit figures for right-back and midfield transfers. But we have allocated a budget of less than €10million for right-back. There is no negative situation regarding Guela Doue [Rennes right-back]. Negotiations are ongoing [for] McTominay and Doue. Wan-Bissaka is not our priority.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho has been welcomed back into the fold at Manchester United by Erik ten Hag, but the winger's former Borussia Dortmund manager foresees more problems",
      "Erik ten Hag is to blame for the difficulties between him and Jadon Sancho – and they are likely to continue at Manchester United, according to Sancho’s former manager.",
      "Sancho was exiled by Ten Hag after a public falling out and spent the second half of last season on loan at former club Borussia Dortmund. He enjoyed his time back in Germany, but has now returned to his parent club with Dortmund likely unable to afford to sign him permanently.",
      "The winger has been handed a second chance by Ten Hag, who has allowed him to return to first-team training ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. The Dutchman has said they have “drawn the line” under the falling out and want to move on.",
      "But Lucien Favre, who managed Sancho for two years during his first spell at Dortmund, has suggested that the ill-feeling between the two may linger – and that Ten Hag is to blame, given Sancho’s professionalism under his tutelage.",
      "“Sancho is undoubtedly a top player. I remember when he continued working on the pitch after finishing training sessions at Borussia Dortmund,” Favre told Tuttosport. “He wanted to improve in everything. Shooting, passing, crosses. It was a pleasure to see him during those extra 20 minutes on the pitch.",
      "“I’ve heard that there have been problems, big problems, between him and Ten Hag. When somebody like Sancho, with his strong commitment, arrives late for training sessions, it means that somebody is not working properly.”",
      "Ten Hag and Sancho fell out after the Dutchman publicly called him out for poor displays in training. The Englishman responded on social media, denying the allegations while effectively accusing his boss of lying.",
      "Sancho was banished from first-team training and hasn’t played a competitive match for his club since August 2023. He refused to back down and eventually found an exit route to Dortmund in January. But now back at United, he has attempted to mend his relationship with Ten Hag.",
      "“As we said, we've drawn the line,” said Ten Hag, when asked about Sancho. “Manchester United needs good players and Jadon is a good player. We have drawn that line and we move on.”",
      "Sancho was not a part of the United squad which lost 1-0 to Rosenberg on Monday, but will be involved in the upcoming friendlies against Rangers, Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool on their pre-season tour before the Community Shield against Manchester City next month. The 24-year-old is understood to have wanted to stay with Dortmund, but he still has two years left on his United contract, which pays around £290,000-a-week, making a transfer difficult.",

      "Manchester United saw two bids rejected by Everton for Jarrad Branthwaite earlier this summer and the £52m signing of Leny Yoro will complicate negotiations further",
      "Manchester United appear to have sacrificed their chances of landing Everton star Jarrad Branthwaite by splashing the cash to sign Leny Yoro.",
      "United have committed to signing Yoro from Lille for an initial fee of £52million, which could rise as high as £62m with add-ons. The 18-year-old Frenchman is poised to sign a five-year contract with United after flying in to finalise terms and complete a medical on Wednesday.",
      "The agreement comes as a surprise, with many in the industry, including Liverpool, believing that Real Madrid were in pole position to sign Yoro. He is set to become the second summer signing for United after striker Joshua Zirkzee, who cost £36.5m from Bologna.",
      "The need for central defenders was clear for United this summer after Raphael Varane was released at the end of his contract. The club have since sold Willy Kambwala to Villarreal and are open to offers for Victor Lindelof, increasing the need for reinforcements in the position.",
      "However, it seems United have burned their bridges with Everton over the potential addition of Branthwaite. Manchester Evening News reports that the Toffees have been emboldened in their stance on Branthwaite, having previously rejected two offers from United for the defender.",
      "United saw bids worth £43m and £50m rejected earlier this summer, with Everton insisting they value the 21-year-old at a minimum of £70m. Having seen United spend £52m on an 18-year-old who has no Premier League or international experience, they are convinced they have taken the right approach in negotiations over Branthwaite.",
      "Erik ten Hag’s side had tried to play hard ball in talks over the centre-back, insisting they only had a limited transfer budget due to profit and sustainability considerations. Yet United have since committed to spending a combined £88.5m to sign Zirkzee and Yoro to undermine their negotiating position.",
      "Everton are selling Amadou Onana to Aston Villa for £50m and are therefore under no financial pressure to also let go of Branthwaite, who impressed last season alongside James Tarkowski. United have previously annoyed Everton by submitting a joint £28m offer for Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini in 2013 and will likely have to look elsewhere if they want another centre-back this summer.",
      "United have been in talks with Bayern Munich over signing Matthijs de Ligt, but that deal has already potentially been complicated by Yoro’s arrival. Mirror Football understands that Ten Hag has told De Ligt that he wants him to play alongside Lisandro Martinez – a promise he might have to break now Yoro is on the scene.",
      "Ten Hag has been able to boost his transfer budget by allowing Varane and Anthony Martial to leave on free transfers, while selling Kambwala, Donny van de Beek and Alvaro Fernandez. The club are hoping to net a further £30m for Mason Greenwood, which can be reinvested in new players.",

It's understood Liverpool were under the impression that Madrid were favourites - and decided against stepping up their interest this summer.",
      "Yoro, 18, will have his medical on Tuesday before finalising personal terms - and he will become the second signing of the summer at United, following the acquisition of Netherlands forward Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna.",
      "He is expected to sign a five-year deal, while United remain interested in another Dutch player, Bayern Munich ’s Matthijs de Ligt, and have had two bids - the most recent of which was £45m - rejected by Everton for up-and-coming England international Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "Centre back has been earmarked as the area needing the greatest overhaul by head coach Erik ten Hag. Raphael Varane left the club at the end of last season, while they are open to offers for Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof.",

Erik ten Hag is known to be an admirer of Rabiot and United need midfield reinforcements this summer. He has become available on a free transfer, but there would no doubt be a hefty signing-on fee attached and is likely to demand a salary of around £120,000 per week. Rabiot is 29-years-old, he's an experienced French international and Ten Hag may want him, but he wouldn't solve the midfield problem that United are currently contending with.\"",

Richard was integral in our Emirates FA Cup and Carabao Cup successes in the past two years, and, in his prior spell from 2001 to 2010, he was head goalkeeping coach in our Academy and first-team goalkeeping coach in the 2007/08 season, when we won the Premier League and UEFA Champions League.

You can only get experience in games and taking that into each game that I've done last season. It helped me massively to put in the performances which I did. I think you've got to be confident in your ability, but it's the best league in the world. It's got the best players and it's obviously the most difficult league in the world, so you know the expectations you're going to have. \"",

Since February, Ineos have appointed Dan Ashworth as sporting director, Jason Wilcox as technical director and Christopher Vivell as interim director of recruitment. Three executives with vast experience in transfers and a reputation as shrewd operators. They are making a good start as well. The deal for Joshua Zirkzee was wrapped up quickly after his involvement in Euro 2024 came to an end, with a deal agreed with Bologna that helped United navigate their own financial concerns.

      "\"I think he's really good on the ball, he's very talented on the ball. But he doesn't fully understand the position. He wanders, he empties the middle of the field too readily. I watched him against Iceland (prior to Euro 2024) and he was getting thrown to the left and thrown to the right. He came on as a substitute when holding onto a 1-0 lead (during England's first Euro 2024 game against Serbia) and the first thing he did was chase down the goalkeeper and try to put him under pressure. It's naivety, he's still learning the game.\"",
      "According to a report by Spanish publication Marca, United chief executive Omar Berrada 'did not give up' on the possibility of luring Leny Yoro to Old Trafford.",
      "Yoro is in the frame to become United's second signing of the summer transfer window after undergoing a medical yesterday (Wednesday). United had a bid accepted for the Lille defender last week and had to wait patiently to find out if he was prepared to join the club.",
      "Yoro's preferred destination was Real Madrid, and Berrada was reportedly informed of that by agent Jorge Mendes 'months ago'.",
      "However, Berrada refused to throw the towel in on United's chances of signing the youngster, believing that signing Yoro would show the club's fans a new era was under way at Old Trafford.",
      "West Ham United are in 'advanced talks' to sign United right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, according to a report by talkSPORT.",
      "United are open to selling Wan-Bissaka this summer ahead of his contract expiring in just under a year's time. It is reported the Reds are looking for a fee of 'over £15million'.",
      "United need to raise funds through player sales and it would make sense to cash-in on Wan-Bissaka because of his contract situation. It was reported elsewhere earlier this week that he was 'keen' on a move to the London Stadium.",

      "United have already wrapped up the signing of Joshua Zirkzee and are closing in on the capture of Leny Yoro. United have plans to strengthen in other areas of the squad.",
      "\"Sir Jim Ratcliffe said earlier this year United would opt for a grassroots approach in the transfer market and Yoro is very green. Ratcliffe last month lamented the disadvantages of multi-club ownership in the transfer market as the Nice centre back Jean-Clair Todibo had been eyed by United but is now headed for West Ham. Leny Yoro, six years the 24-year-old Todibo's junior and without any international recognition, is a long-term addition at a club in need of significant short-term gains. Yoro's final fee could trump Lisandro Martinez's yet United lack longevity at centre half, where three of the defenders are in their 30s. Last season was, in all probability, Victor Lindelof's last with United and next season could be the curtain call for Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans. Yoro will be afforded a season of adaptation, as unforgiving as his position is.\"",
      "United midfielder Scott McTominay returned to Carrington for the pre-season training yesterday (Wednesday).",
      "The midfielder, who netted 10 goals for United last season, was entitled to three weeks off after appearing at the European Championship for Scotland. The Scots exited the competition on June 23 after losing their final group game 1-0 to Hungary.",
      "The Scot could be included in the squad for Saturday's friendly against Rangers at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.",

      "It is claimed that Palace, prior to the European Championship, valued Guehi at around £50m, but have now increased their value of the player to 'over £70m'.",
      "Mason Greenwood is now in Marseille after flying to France last night. One of the reasons why Roberto de Zerbi may be so staunchly defensive of that deal is De Zerbi's agency is believed to be finalising it.",
      "De Zerbi has already promised to defend Greenwood as if he was his own child amid rancour in Marseille over his imminent arrival. De Zerbi, of course, was among the managers that United considered to replace Erik ten Hag in the summer.",
      "De Zerbi was combustible behind the scenes at Brighton and, given his ardent support of Greenwood, it is just as well United did not take a punt on him.",
      "According to a report by Portuguese newspaper Record, as cited by The Peoples Person, a deal to take Joao Neves from Benfica to Paris Saint-Germain is 'drawing close'.",
      "The midfielder has been heavily linked with a move to United for months amid the club's plan to strengthen their midfield options this summer.",
      "United, in June, reportedly saw a bid just north of £50million bid knocked back for the Portuguese international. It has been regularly reported that Benfica have been holding out for the value of his €120million release clause.",
      "However, it is now reported that PSG could be set to land the 19-year-old for €70m. The report adds that Neves has said he wants to move to the French capital.",

      "Gourvennec, speaking to Sky Sports, said:",
      "\"When I knew him in his beginning when he was 16, he was a very complete player, but a little bit tender. As a young defender, it is normal. He has a good reading of the game, he is very good technically, can play short and long passes, is good in duels and he is more ready now than in the beginning. He is fast, has height, is in good in duels, both in the air and on the ground, he is good technically and is intelligent. He is always calm. He is a little bit like Jules Kounde. I had Jules Kounde at Bordeaux and I put him in the starting XI. He was the same; intelligent and very calm.\"",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Leny Yoro from Lille. United had an offer accepted last week and the 18-year-old has decided to join the club, despite interest from Real Madrid.",
      "The fee is expected to rise to around €70million (£58.7m) for the Frenchman, who was named in the Ligue 1 Team of the Year after impressing last season. Yoro is poised to become United's second signing of the summer after Joshua Zirkzee arrived from Bologna in a £36.5m move.",
      "It's expected to take their spending to £95.2m for the summer, with more incomings anticipated as they look to sell several squad members. Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire are among the players being linked with moves away as United look to raise some cash.",
      "But who else should United sign this summer? MEN writers have their say on who the Red Devils should target as their next and third arrival in the transfer window...",
      "A centre-back and a striker were the priority for United at the start of this window and if they secure both before heading off on tour it will have to be considered an excellent start. The reality is sales are now required to boost the budget and who goes might condition who is next to arrive.",
      "United will have to sell another central defender, probably Victor Lindelof, and there are midfielders who could depart, notably Casemiro, while there have been bids for Scott McTominay.",
      "Another, slightly more senior centre-back, would be a preference and Matthijs de Ligt could yet tick that box. The most interesting situation is Casemiro's, however. If United are to replace him it probably needs to happen sooner rather than later and that is why midfield should be the next area to look at.",
      "Before the transfer window opened, I said United's priority must be signing a quality defensive midfielder to replace Casemiro and my opinion hasn't changed. The Brazilian's regression was significant last season and persisting with him in the new campaign is inadvisable.",
      "Finding the right player to succeed Casemiro is the challenge. Joao Palhinha appealed, but he's joined Bayern Munich from Fulham and the market isn't bursting with options.",
      "Nonetheless, now a forward and a defender have been brought in - although Leny Yoro's move isn't official yet - United should focus their efforts on signing that player.",
      "Perhaps PSG's midfielder Ugrarte fits the billing and he'd add to the South American influence in the dressing room.",
      "It's clear as day that United need to strengthen their midfield this summer. They need someone to partner Kobbie Mainoo for the long-term as I am not convinced Casemiro can still cut it at the top level. The Brazilian looked way off his best last season, and at 32, should United look to the future? I think so.",
      "Crystal Palace starlet Adam Wharton is the man they should look at. He has impressed since moving to Palace from Blackburn in January and could immediately solve United's midfield problem. That is the area United should look at next, with Wharton the most ideal candidate available right now.",
      "Signing Yoro is a huge coup for United: it also means they don't need to get sucked into time-sensitive transfer sagas, overbidding for targets as they have done in previous summers. So, what do they need to do next? United could do with another centre-back along with Yoro: Matthijs De Ligt fits the bill at the right price. Jarrad Branthwaite would be a superb signing, but looks too expensive at this point - especially with Everton left baffled by the Yoro fee.",
      "A left-back would be welcome given Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia's injury records, while Ten Hag also desperately needs a defensive midfielder: PSG's Manuel Ugarte looks a good prospect for an affordable fee, but that deal likely rests on Casemiro being sold. In truth, the rest of United's transfer window hinges on who can be sold to raise more funds.",
      "If Ineos can get Casemiro, Mason Greenwood, Christian Eriksen and one of Victor Lindelof or Harry Maguire (or both of them) out the door, then De Ligt, Ugarte and a left-back would represent upgrades across the squad. Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho leaving now looks less likely, but if United could sell either then I would also pick up a winger and/or a striker: Ivan Toney and Federico Chiesa would offer goals, experience and depth at affordable prices.",
      "Capturing Matthijs de Ligt as well as Yoro is a mouth-watering prospect but one that could be scuppered by past transfer failings. United are thought to be operating on a net transfer budget of just £50m, having so far received an initial £10m for two sales and spent £36m on the arrival of Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The purchase of Yoro will take the net spend up to £85m with a midfielder still to buy. The probable exit of Mason Greenwood for around £27m will lower this back down to circa £58m but sales will still be needed.",
      "De Ligt would be a great addition but will cost £42m, money that ought to be first spent on a midfielder. United are expected to offload Casemiro and a replacement will be needed.",
      "£101m-rated Joao Neves is too expensive for a player with just 75 club appearances, while a return deal for Sofyan Amrabat seems risky, albeit much cheaper. If a deal under £40m can be secured for Manuel Ugarte, it might be worth the punt.",
      "It's been a promising transfer window for United so far this summer and it will be a welcome relief to fans that they haven't been dragged into the drawn-out transfer sagas of previous years.",
      "If and when Yoro joins then Ten Hag will have two of Europe's brightest young stars joining after the arrival of Zirkzee. It's a mouthwatering prospect to go alongside other young talent including Mainoo, Garnacho and Hojlund.",
      "But midfield remains a concern as United cannot afford to go a whole season with Casemiro trying to cover spaces which left United's defence exposed on countless occasions last term. The priority now has to be a defensive midfielder with PSG's Manuel Ugarte looking like a player who could fit into their new philosophy under Dan Ashworth and Ineos.",
      "Joao Neves would also be a great signing but the fee required to complete a deal is likely to be beyond United's financial means in this window.",
      "The signings of Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro add to both the front and back line options for Erik ten Hag in the upcoming season, so concentration should be now on completing the spine with a midfield addition.",
      "The uncertainty over the future of Casemiro means that United will be short in the area if he is sold. The team will need a long-term partner for Kobbie Mainoo at the base of midfield, Sofyan Amrabat played the role in the FA Cup final but has since turned to Fiorentina.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has been linked with a move to Old Trafford and could be the solution. At just 23-years old he is still young, meaning that the position could be sorted for years to come.",
      "He is said to be available for around £38 million which could prove to be a shrewd long-term investment in midfield.",

      "Manchester United's search for a statement signing in midfield in the 2022 summer transfer window was a saga that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.",
      "After pinning all of their hopes on signing Barcelona ace Frenkie de Jong, United, in the end, were forced to look elsewhere to finish constructing Erik ten Hag's new-look midfield. It was a saga that ran and ran but brought De Jong nowhere close to Old Trafford.",
      "Eventually, of course, United settled on Casemiro, drafting him in just over a week after the infamous 4-0 stuffing at Brentford. Some considered it as a knee-jerk reaction because of the contrasting differences in the profiles of the two players.",
      "However, United needed a world-class defensive-midfielder and Casemiro was exactly that, joining the club from Real Madrid for an initial fee of £60million. But in between calling time on their pursuit of De Jong and Casemiro being presented to the Old Trafford faithful just minutes before the 2-1 win over Liverpool, United attempted to bring Adrien Rabiot to M16.",
      "United agreed a deal in principle with Juventus to sign the French international in a package that could have been worth up to £20m. However, the Reds were forced to abandon their pursuit of the former Paris Saint-Germain ace because of his wage demands.",
      "Sources at the time said Rabiot wanted an 'obscene' salary. His mother, Veronique, is his agent and negotiated on his behalf.",
      "Almost two years on since United abandoned their pursuit of the 29-year-old, they are being linked with his signature once again. He is currently available as a free agent after his contract expired at Juventus last month.",
      "A report coming out of Italy on Thursday morning claimed Rabiot is now open to holding 'discussions' with clubs about the next chapter in his career, including United. The Old Trafford outfit are on the hunt for fresh blood in midfield this summer, specifically a defensive-minded operator.",
      "United have already wrapped up the signing of Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee and are closing in on Lille defender Leny Yoro, meaning further additions could rest on outgoings. They are continuing to be strongly linked with PSG's Manuel Ugarte as far as their pursuit of a new midfielder is concerned.",
      "However, the fact Rabiot is currently without a club and is available for free could tempt United to rekindle their interest in his services. Still south of 30, he would represent a solid addition for a lot of clubs on a free transfer.",
      "Amid suggestions he could enter talks with United, Rabiot has previously admitted he would like to experience playing in the Premier League. He made the admission while on international duty at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.",
      "\"It was very good experience,\" said Rabiot, answering a question about his time in England with Manchester City's academy in 2008. \"I didn't do a whole season, though.",
      "\"Everything went well while I was there. I really liked the atmosphere. It's really something that is only in England. It's different from France and Italy.",
      "\"I have always said that I'd like to play in England in my career. I still have that desire. I'd like to evolve in the Premier League.\"",
      "On the Premier League, he added: \"I haven't got a Premier League team in mind right now. I haven't chosen a team or anything. It's a general thing.",
      "\"It's the league, it's the level of play that's going on, that's what attracts me most. It corresponds to my qualities.\"",
      "At senior level, Rabiot has experienced playing in both France and Italy, meaning he may be tempted to test himself in England for the first time. He has certainly not closed the door on that possibility.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Man Utd started their pre-season campaign with a whimper in Norway but they will face a much more competitive outing in Scotland this weekend.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "After slamming Manchester United's performance against Rosenborg on Monday night, Erik ten Hag insisted he knew why things had gone wrong at Lerkendal stadium.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, of course, but it's so many whys,\" he said. \"I can give all the reasons that we have to do better. The fans and everyone around us is expecting us to win and definitely give a performance but we didn't succeed.\"",
      "'So many whys' isn't exactly a phrase that will put everyone at ease after United stumbled into a pre-season campaign that Ten Hag needs to get right. His criticism of the display in Norway has put some pressure on fixtures that usually come without that kind of burden.",
      "\"Not good enough,\" was Ten Hag's snap reaction to the late defeat. \"This is not the standard for top football. Top football, you have to achieve much higher standards.\"",
      "It was a brutal appraisal of a game where the result had felt secondary and the performance only a little more important. The first friendly of the summer, with such a callow squad, is about building up match fitness. It was always going to be a tough test against a team midway through their league season and United's players felt they were flagging and being overrun in the final 10 minutes of the first half.",
      "Nobody in attendance was reading too much into what had happened on the pitch until Ten Hag took aim at his squad and made his demands for standards to be met. It was his first game since the FA Cup final, since surviving a brush with the sack, and perhaps this was an attempt to send a message to Ineos as much as it was his players. Omar Berrada, Dan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox were all in attendance.",
      "What the comments have done is raise the stakes for pre-season. This was only a friendly but United again allowed 22 shots at their goal. Radek Vitek was their best player by a long distance. If United open the competitive season by continuing to allow teams so many shots it will spell trouble for Ten Hag.",
      "So rather than the next four games being about a gradual rise to match sharpness ahead of the Community Shield on August 10 and Fulham at Old Trafford on August 16, it is now also about delivering some performances, starting this weekend.",
      "On Saturday United face a 'Battle of Britain' fixture against Rangers at Murrayfield. The hosts won't be taking this contest lightly and, as their only friendly in Scotland, they could receive plenty of backing as well - even if the fixture is in Edinburgh rather than Glasgow.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Adult sizes from £80",
      "United return to Scotland's home of rugby for the second summer in a row with Ibrox out of action due to the redevelopment of the Copeland Road stand. A delay in that work means they are unlikely to be back at their home for another three months or so.",
      "That adds to the feeling of at least a mini-crisis around Rangers. Their season begins in two weeks and they have Champions League qualifiers to aim for as well, but Philippe Clement wants more quality in his squad. Rangers must sell to buy and a clear-out of players is proving difficult.",
      "As the Ibrox Noise website said ahead of this fixture: \"Rangers aren’t in a good place right now, we could be as bold and maybe fatalistic to say it’s the worst place our club has been since 2018 and the early fledgling Steven Gerrard days – it’s certainly by far the worst preseason we’ve had for many years.\"",
      "That hints at a team United can take advantage of. Their squad will surely be boosted by some of the senior players left behind at Carrington last week, such as Andre Onana, Victor Lindelof, Amad and Antony. Perhaps even Harry Maguire if he's ready to return.",
      "It feels like they need to deliver a performance. Last season ended gloriously but most of it was wretched. A trip to Murrayfield won't bring the intensity of that cup final, but Ten Hag has put some pressure on the game. His players have to respond.",

      "Leny Yoro caught the eye of those in the Old Trafford directors' box as a 16-year-old and he has the support network to succeed at Man United.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Leny Yoro's first and last appearances for Lille were against Nice. His debut, as a 16-year-old, came in the presence of Sir Dave Brailsford.",
      "Brailsford was at the Allianz Riviera Stadium in his role as the Ineos sporting director of Ineos-owned Nice. He was flanked by Josh Thompson, the group's sports project manager already dubbed Brailsford's \"bag man\" by some at Manchester United.",
      "Where Brailsford goes, Thompson usually follows. He wandered through the mixed zone with Brailsford and Sir Jim Ratcliffe after the FA Cup final and appeared to advise Ratcliffe on an exit strategy that avoided the press.",
      "Thompson closely assists Brailsford and fellow United football board member Jean-Claude Blanc to drive the performance levels. Yoro has gone up a few levels since Brailsford first clapped eyes on him.",
      "The teenager came on in the 78th minute with Lille 2-1 up in May 2022 and they clinched a 3-1 victory. Three of Yoro's 68 appearances for Lille came against Nice.",
      "United sporting director Dan Ashworth championed the development of a signing from Lille at Brighton six years ago. He joined two months before Ashworth's appointment but it was under the Ashworth-Graham Potter axis he emerged into one of the Premier League's most dominant midfielders. Yves Bissouma restored Tottenham's backbone last season.",
      "Ratcliffe said earlier this year United would opt for a grassroots approach in the transfer market and Yoro is very green. Ratcliffe last month lamented the disadvantages of multi-club ownership in the transfer market as the Nice centre back Jean-Clair Todibo had been eyed by United but is now headed for West Ham.",
      "Yoro, six years the 24-year-old Todibo's junior and without any international recognition, is a long-term addition at a club in need of significant short-term gains. Yoro's final fee could trump Lisandro Martinez's yet United lack longevity at centre half, where three of the defenders are in their 30s.",
      "Last season was, in all probability, Victor Lindelof's last with United and next season could be the curtain call for Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans. Yoro will be afforded a season of adaptation, as unforgiving as his position is.",
      "Eight league games in an untried Europa League format should help him find his feet. Maguire and Evans are sound professionals who have been around the block and will offer expert guidance. It is a pity for Yoro that Raphael Varane, another teenage centre half at a northern French club United coveted 13 years ago, came to the end of the road at the club.",
      "Following Zinedine Zidane's intervention in 2011, Sir Alex Ferguson turned to Phil Jones, also 19. Jones is proof a raw defender can make a fearless start at United, even eliciting a barely credulous comparison with Duncan Edwards from Sir Bobby Charlton.",
      "It helped that Jones was a homebird from Blackburn and accustomed to the Premier League. He was emboldened by United's gung-ho approach to the 2011-12 season as they plundered 21 goals in their first six games, which placed him mostly out of harm's way.",
      "Yoro's age will not protect him from scrutiny but he need only look to his left at Martinez, written off by Jamie Carragher (and others) after two appearances. Despite an injury-plagued year, Martinez has been the most successful signing of the Erik ten Hag era.",
      "Newly-signed centre backs at United used to endure baptisms of fire until Eric Bailly, usually the fire starter rather than firefighter, eased some of the heat. He was the man of the match in his first two appearances in 2016, Maguire had a steady start three years later and ditto Varane in 2021. Lindelof was unsteady in his first season and Martinez's mare lasted two games before he helped neutralise a daunting Liverpool attack at Old Trafford.",
      "Bailly was 22 when he was unveiled, Lindelof 23, Maguire 26 and Varane 28. Lindelof was culpable for both goals in newly-promoted Huddersfield's win over United in October 2017 and left the John Smith's Stadium with two hoodies pulled up, skulking out like a criminal leaving court.",
      "Yoro's compatriot, Patrice Evra, was 24 when his debut at Manchester City lasted 45 minutes with United 2-0 down, an experience he likened to being put in a washing machine. Sixteen and a half years later, Tyrell Malacia was hooked at the interval at the same venue with City 4-0 up.",
      "These tales should inspire rather than instil dread in Yoro. He has a good support network among the other centre halves and will be flanked by the bullish Diogo Dalot and backed by the popular Andre Onana.",
      "As well as those who spotted him on the French Riviera.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United youngster Will Fish is attracting interest from Championship clubs in this summer transfer window.",
      "Fish, 21, spent last season on loan with Hibernian in the Scottish Premiership and it's understood United insiders considered his temporary spell as one of the most successful loans they had arranged. The young centre-back made 45 appearances for Hibs and started almost every game during the campaign, gaining important senior experience at the heart of their defence.",
      "Fish started regularly in a challenging senior environment and there is now a decision to be made on his future. The Manchester Evening News understands there are Championship clubs interested in signing him on loan and on permanent deals this summer.",
      "However, it's understood no decision has been communicated on Fish's future and he could travel with the squad to the United States for this summer's pre-season friendlies. Fish was a late call-up to the pre-season travelling squad to Thailand and Australia in Ten Hag's first summer in charge and the Dutchman is set to decide on the defender's next step.",
      "Fish started alongside Jonny Evans at centre-back for United's opening pre-season friendly against Rosenborg and was replaced at half-time when every outfield player was substituted.",
      "There has been defensive upheaval at United and Fish, like each youngster at the club, is being looked at in pre-season. But it's thought he would prefer to play consistent first-team football than having a peripheral squad role at this stage of his career.",
      "Last season was Fish's second loan spell with Hibs while he also spent the first half of the 2021/22 season on loan with Stockport County. He made his United senior debut aged just 17 when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gave him a cameo against Wolves on the final day of the 2020/21 Premier League season.",
      "United academy manager Travis Binnion praised Fish in an interview with the MEN in May, saying: \"He's a great kid, he just wants to play football and have success. \"Hierbnian have been great for him, so he's in a really good place and there’s a lot of interest in him for future loans and coming back with us, the manager will have another look at him and see how he’s progressed.\"",
      "Fish is a local lad, born in Denton, and has been on United's books since he joined the academy at seven. His contract with United expires in 2025 but the club have the option of another year.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United will fly to the USA under Erik ten Hag for a second consecutive year as part of their preparations for the 2024/25 season. The Red Devils will take on Arsenal (July 28), Real Betis (August 1) and Liverpool (August 4) before returning to England for the Community Shield.",
      "Last summer saw a similar pattern of games with United playing four MATCHES in total. Ten Hag named a 31-man travelling squad to the USA with most of his regular stars available due to no summer international tournaments.",
      "After they face Rangers in Scotland on Saturday 20 July, United take on Arsenal eight days later. The Red Devils are expected to welcome back their international players as pre-season continues with Scott McTominay returning to Carrington this week.",
      "International commitments means Ten Hag is without most of his key players. Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, Alejandro Garnacho, Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot all made it to latter rounds of either Euro 2024 or Copa America with their nations meaning United are working with a handful of first-team players.",
      "In the first pre-season friendly of the summer, the 1-0 defeat to Norway side Rosenborg, Ten Hag was able to use just five senior players - Jonny Evans, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro, Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount - with the rest of the squad made up of academy hopefuls.",
      "The number of players who make the trip Stateside is not yet known. Here, MEN Sport attempts to identify the group of individuals who could be taken to the pre-season tour.",
      "United's goalkeepers will select themselves, like they did last year. Andre Onana will be hoping to find more consistency as Ten Hag's number one with Bayindir ready to step-in whenever called upon.",
      "Tom Heaton's new contract means he remains third-choice but 20-year-ol Radek Vitek could also be included after impressing in Monday's defeat to Rosenborg. The Czech goalkeeper was part of the travelling squad in 2023, prior to Onana's arrival.",
      "The potential signing of Leny Yoro from Lille significantly bolsters United's defence. Harry Maguire is now back in training after an injury kept him out of Euro 2024 but Ten Hag will be keen not to rush the England international back.",
      "Raphael Varane's exit means it is one-in-one-out so far and should Matthijs de Ligt complete his move from Bayern Munich, United could have six centre-backs to choose from. Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw will be hoping to return in time for the tour after reaching the final of Copa America and Euro 2024.",
      "Victor Lindelof and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are two players facing uncertain futures at Old Trafford, but no official move has come about as of yet. Right now, they remain part of United's squad.",
      "Academy duo Sam Murray and Will Fish were used in Norway on Monday and offer good options off the bench to manage the minutes of first-team players and impress Ten Hag in the process.",
      "Midfield is another position that United are well-stocked in. Before they fly to the USA, another midfielder could have been signed and that man could be Adrien Rabiot. The Frenchman is currently a free agent and it's reported he will hold talks over a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes, Eriksen and Mainoo are yet to come back from international duty and will be available in due course. The futures of McTominay and Casemiro continue to rumble on but, until a decision is made, they remain valuable options.",
      "Mount started against Rosenborg and will be desperate to finally kick-start his career in Manchester after an injury-hit season. Hannibal, who returned from his loan spell from Sevilla, could also play a part while his future continues to be unclear.",
      "James Scanlon and Daniel Gore will travel with the first-team after their standout performances in the academy, providing them with a great experience with the first-team.",
      "Despite their struggles in front of goal, United have a good crop of attackers to choose from. Joshua Zirkzee's arrival from Bologna means Ten Hag now has two quality options in centre-forward after struggling to fill the position last term when Rasmus Hojlund was unavailable.",
      "In the two wide positions, United have an abundance of options. Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are reunited after the latter spent last season on loan at Borussia Dortmund with Antony and Garnacho two quality individuals on the right.",
      "Youth-wise, Amad Diallo impressed Ten Hag last season when used and he will be keen to become a regular under the Dutchman. Facundo Pellestri is set to return to England in due course after his international representation though another loan move could be considered.",
      "Ethan Wheatley caught the eyes of many last season by scoring four goals in nine Premier League 2 games and an additional eight goals for the Under-18s.",
      "In total, that gives Ten Hag 34 players to choose from. Any exits that are completed between now and then could decrease that figure, but there could also be further arrivals. United have acted quickly in the summer transfer window but that's not to rule out further business later on.",
      "Dream Man United pre-season squad: Onana, Bayindir, Heaton, Vitek; Maguire, Yoro, Lindelof, Wan-Bissaka, Evans, Dalot, Shaw, Martinez, Malacia, Fish, Murray; Casemiro, Eriksen, Rabiot, Fernandes, Mainoo, McTominay, Mount, Hannibal, Gore, Scanlon; Hojlund, Zirkzee, Rashford, Antony, Sancho, Garnacho, Amad, Pellistri, Wheatley",

      "Ten Hag, whose wife returned to the Netherlands earlier this month, has dined with Vivell and new coaches Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake. The United manager reiterated in Trondheim on Monday he has to build a relationship with the inaugural sporting director Dan Ashworth, having said similarly about technical director Jason Wilcox towards the end of last season. New chief executive Omar Berrada was in Norway, too.",
      "This week is maybe the last that United's senior staff have time to break bread together in the transfer window. United fly to Los Angeles next Wednesday and return the week of the Community Shield against Manchester City.",
      "Ten Hag left the restaurant at 10pm. A celebratory glass of wine was perhaps in order, with Leny Yoro bound en route in a deal that could rise to €70million.",
      "Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee offset the loss of Raphael Varane and departure of Anthony Martial, the latter admittedly forgettable until United checked the money they were haemorrhaging on his salary. That's two voids filled.",
      "Others will have to be created. Willy Kambwala was a low-level sale but United banked a good fee for an injury-prone teenager who started only three times for the club. United are open to recruiting up to three centre backs and two have already gone. They hope Victor Lindelof will follow.",
      "Central midfield is the most vital area for United to address yet the majority of their resources have been dedicated further back. Bids have been rejected for Scott McTominay, Casemiro has his admirers in the Saudi Pro League and Christian Eriksen has entered the final year of his contract.",
      "Eriksen will almost certainly not be a United player this time next year. His polished performances at the European Championship will have appealed to potential buying clubs but few are going to be rushing to sign a seasoned 32-year-old they could get for a cut-price fee or on a pre-contract agreement in January.",
      "McTominay is a test of United's ambition. He was worth £40m last summer and then embarked on a career-best goalscoring season and scoring at the European Championship. McTominay is United-bred, started in the FA Cup final, a robust athlete and has progressed season on season (bar Ten Hag's first) over the past seven years.",
      "He is also technically limited and, but for Kobbie Mainoo's injury last summer, might have already moved on. The plus-one option in his contract safeguards his resale value but there is an obvious danger it will be lower next summer than this summer.",
      "McTominay was understood to be receptive to moving to London last year and that change of scenery may still appeal to be closer to his girlfriend and her family's base. Cameron Reading has been accused of running a Ponzi scheme with her father at Fortress Capital Partners by administrators.",
      "United are not seeking to proactively shift McTominay, as they are with Lindelof. Club sources have reiterated McTominay's vital squad role and high value.",
      "Casemiro and Eriksen are five years older than McTominay and their phasing out process has already begun. Mason Mount faces a defining season a year after his £60m move and Sofyan Amrabat's loan ended nearly three weeks ago.",
      "There has been no inkling that United are about to gut their midfield. The transfer window closes in six weeks on Friday and the chances of a recently-installed structure overseeing two or three incomings and outgoings in that area is remote.",
      "Harry Maguire is in the same boat as McTominay: for sale last year, impressive last season and with a maximum two years left on his deal. Realistically, this will be Maguire's last season at United as a new contract is improbable and if there is no transfer this year there has to be next year.",
      "Maguire, 31, felt he could have contributed to England's European Championship campaign had Gareth Spouthgate picked him. The 2026 World Cup, when he would be 33, offers one last hurrah for a defender no longer a certain starter for the national team.",
      "Ten Hag is not rushing Maguire back, having selected him while he was nursing an injury in April. With Lisandro Martinez on holiday, Maguire is poised to start the season against Manchester City at Wembley, where he was an injured spectator for the FA Cup final in May, and then possibly Fulham the following week.",

      "Man Utd wanted to sign Adrien Rabiot in 2022 and the player has become a free agent after leaving Juventus this summer.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Former football director John Murtough clocked up the air miles in the summer of 2022. Murtough flew to Barcelona and Turin to discuss Manchester United transfers, but those talks were in vain and neither Frenkie de Jong nor Adrien Rabiot were signed.",
      "After growing frustrated with a lack of progress in talks to sign De Jong, attention was turned to Rabiot and a £15million fee rising to £20m was agreed with Juventus, but the move collapsed and sources indicated that was due to the Frenchman's ‘obscene’ salary demands.",
      "Rabiot is represented by his mother, Veronique, who has a reputation for an uncompromising approach to negotiations over her son's future and weekly earnings.",
      "\"Once it was clear I would not go to United, I focused straight back on Juventus to give everything I had,\" Rabiot told ESPN in November 2022. \"I didn't want people to doubt my commitment or to think that because I could have left for United, I would not care anymore.",
      "\"I am out of contract in June, and I don't want people to think that I am not committed or invested at Juventus this season. I feel attracted by the football, by the Premier League itself and its super competitive nature. I loved my time there, even if I was young.",
      "\"I liked the culture and the life; my family liked it too. I am not indifferent to playing in England, but there will be many options to consider. I have not spoken with Juve about the future.\"",
      "Rabiot signed a one-year contract extension with Juventus last summer, but that deal expired at the end of last month and the player has turned down the Italian's fresh proposal. Although Juventus are said to have offered Rabiot a proposal worth €7million net per season, he's expected to sign for a new club and United rekindling their interest wouldn't be a shock.",
      "Erik ten Hag is known to be an admirer of Rabiot and United need midfield reinforcements this summer. He has become available on a free transfer, but there would no doubt be a hefty signing-on fee attached and is likely to demand a salary of around £120,000 per week.",
      "Rabiot is 29 years old, he's an experienced French international and Ten Hag may want him, but he wouldn't solve the midfield problem that United are currently contending with.",
      "When United were interested in Rabiot in the summer of 2022, he had worse statistics compared to Scott McTominay and Fred on all key metrics and he didn't appear to be an upgrade on either, yet he's played for some of Europe's best clubs and continues to feature for France.",
      "Perhaps Rabiot can be filed under the category of someone who does the 'dirty work' and is underappreciated, but United need a defensive midfielder and he's not that player. Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo are guaranteed starters next season and United must sign someone to protect the defensive line and give the latter licence to roam forward. Casemiro's decline was spectacular and it would be a huge gamble to persist with him.",
      "It would be excellent if Casemiro could prove all the doubters wrong - that would be the dream scenario - and return to his 2022/23 form, but there was evidence available last season to suggest that player is behind him indefinitely.",
      "Casemiro struggled to do the basics. His passing was sloppy, his positioning was poor and his tackling was rash, which was exacerbated when he moved to centre-back.",
      "United's priority in this summer window should have been signing a replacement for Casemiro. Instead, they have started by signing a forward and a defender, so focusing their attention on the midfield must come next and finding a natural No.6 will be crucial for the team's success.",
      "Rabiot doesn't tick the boxes to replace Casemiro - he isn't a defensive midfielder and wouldn't provide enough defensive protection. He briefly spent a year in Manchester City's academy, giving him a taste of English football, but he wouldn't fill the Grand Canyon in United's midfield.",
      "United need someone with positional discipline to protect the back four. Rabiot is not that player and it would be within everyone's interest for a move not to materialise again.",
      "Maybe his obscene wage demands could prove to be a blessing in disguise.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have made their mark in the transfer window with two signings of the same cloth ahead of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has already been confirmed as United's first signing, and 18-year-old Leny Yoro is close to joining him. Both players arrive at Old Trafford as youngsters with little experience but, on the flip side of things, with plenty of potential to grow into.",
      "Before the start of the season, a new centre-back and striker were among the positions of priority at the club. Next is central midfield. Casemiro and Scott McTominay continue to be linked with exits away from United while Sofyan Amrabat has still not completed a permanent move to Manchester after his loan spell from Fiorentina ended in June.",
      "Benfica starlet Joao Neves has been viewed as a long-term target, but Paris Saint-Germain seems to be the likely destination. So where do United go from here?",
      "Manuel Ugarte has been a mainstay in the rumour mill over the last few weeks, as has Adrien Rabiot. The France international is currently a free agent after his Juventus contract expired on June 30 and the club announced his official departure on Thursday.",
      "\"Adrien Rabiot and Juventus’ paths have parted. The French midfielder’s time in Turin has come to an end after five seasons,\" it read. \"First joining in the summer of 2019, Adrien won a Scudetto, two Italian Cups and one Italian Super Cup.",
      "\"Beyond the trophies won together, though, he will be remembered as a player who always gave his all for the shirt, and one who carried himself with undeniable charisma. On the pitch, Adrien was a vital player to Juventus, particularly without the ball. His work rate could not be called into question, and he made huge improvements to his offensive game in recent seasons.",
      "\"Last season saw him reach 200 appearances in our shirt, becoming the fifth Frenchman in our history to do so. In all, Adrien made 212 appearances with us, leaving him third in the list of our all-time French appearance makers alongside Zinedine Zidane.",
      "\"In terms of Juventus appearances, the only Frenchmen with more are Michel Platini (224) and David Trezeguet (320). Thanks for everything, ‘Cavallo Pazzo’, and good luck for the future!\"",
      "Rabiot has been on United's radar for some time and finds himself linked with a move to the Premier League nearly every summer. His services are likely to be in high demand, and according to Football Italia, the Reds and Liverpool are set to hold talks with the 29-year-old in the coming days.",
      "AC Milan, Napoli and Newcastle will also look to persuade him to join them. It's said the midfielder is looking for a contract worth £7.5m a year, more than the base salary of £5.8m Juventus offered.",
      "United are understood to have a tight budget this summer, despite closing in on the €70million (£58.7m) signing of defender Leny Yoro. They are likely to be forced to sell before signing another player for a fee, making Rabiot the dream midfielder signing.",
      "Finding the perfect partner for Kobbie Mainoo for next season has proven to be a difficult task for Ten Hag. Casemiro, 32, struggled with his form in the latter end of the season, and there are doubts over his ability to perform at the highest level in the Premier League.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United are in the market to sign Matthijs de Ligt this summer as Erik ten Hag and key figures behind the scenes attempt to bolster their defensive options. United could recruit as many as three centre-backs during the transfer window with Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite and Leny Yoro also on radar.",
      "De Ligt needs no introduction for Ten Hag after the pair worked together at Ajax and - at one point in time - the former was regarded as the best young defender on the planet. While his career has, perhaps, stalled for club and country since then, the pedigree remains and Bayern Munich's loss could be United's gain.",
      "Speculation over the 24-year-old Netherlands international and his future at the Allianz Arena continues to swirl. Here are the latest headlines surrounding his proposed transfer;",
      "A report from The Mirror suggests United are ready to 'park' their interest in De Ligt - for the time being at least - with a deal for Leny Yoro edging closer. Yoro is all set to move to Old Trafford after United agreed a fee worth up £58.7million for his signature and the 18-year-old opted to leave Lille.",
      "Further additions to the defensive unit were always set to be governed by outgoings. The Mirror flag up that as a prime reason for United 'cooling' their push for De Ligt, but question marks over Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof means the switch could be revisited as and when United generate more funds.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands United have verbally agreed personal terms with De Ligt regarding a move to Old Trafford this summer. However, as things stand, nothing concrete has been submitted to Bayern over his would-be signature - despite confidence in-house from United that a deal will eventually be done.",
      "United have an existing relationship with De Ligt's agent, Rafaela Pimenta, while the defender is already known to Ten Hag from their days together at Ajax. In the market for up to three centre-backs this summer, Everton prospect Branthwaite and French youngster Yoro - from Lille - are the other primary targets.",
      "Although personal terms have been verbally agreed, United have yet to make a formal offer for the Bayern player as they continue to weigh up all the options available to them. Exactly how much the German heavyweights want for his signature remains up in the air with contrasting indications across the board.",
      "Reports from Sport BILD outline £42million as the asking price and indicate United would be willing to pay up. De Ligt - who progressed through the Ajax system and captained the Amsterdam giants as a teenager under no other than Ten Hag - has already amassed a staggering transfer fund throughout his career.",
      "Juventus paid €85.5million for him in 2019 and Bayern splashed out €67million coming up two years ago, but will it be third time lucky for United when it comes to a long-term target?",
      "Sky Germany flag up Bayer Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah as an alternative option for United if they fail to get De Ligt over the line. However, there is also a proposed scenario by which Tah heading to Bavaria instead would be the catalyst for De Ligt pitching up at Old Trafford as planned this summer.",
      "Whispers that United are keeping tabs on Tah feature in a social media post. A transfer triangle could emerge as to speed up the process, depending on which club decides to make the first move.",

      "Jarrad Branthwaite puts his rapid development that has attracted the interest of Manchester United down to the confidence shown in him by Sean Dyche at Everton last season.",
      "The 22-year-old has been the subject of two failed bids from Old Trafford this summer and United are refusing to meet Everton's £70m asking price. They are expected to complete the signing of 18-year-old centre-back Leny Yoro for an initial £52m this week, although could turn their attention back to Branthwaite if the Toffees show signs of compromise.",
      "Branthwaite played 35 of Everton's 38 Premier League games last season, returning to the club having benefitted from a loan spell at Ruud van Nistelrooy's PSV Eindhoven in 2022/23. The Cumbrian took his opportunity at Goodison and became a key member of the team last season, with Everton's defensive record crucial in their Premier League survival.",
      "“I think for any young person, any young player, it's about playing as many games as you can and that gives you the experience you need,\" he told the club's official website.",
      "“You can only get experience in games and taking that into each game that I've done last season. It helped me massively to put in the performances which I did.",
      "‘I think you’ve got to be confident in your ability, but it's the best league in the world. It's got the best players and it's obviously the most difficult league in the world, so you know the expectations you're going to have.",
      "“You're going to have bad days, and we had a couple of them last season, but it's about how you react to them, and I think that's something I've learned. The more games I've played, it's not to get too low and just to keep a positive mindset and going to the next game, knowing how good you can be.",
      "“As a young player to have experience around you, all the games [Seamus Coleman, Pickford and Tarkowski] have played collectively and alone, and to feed off their experience, it's only good for a young player. To have that last season definitely helped me massively and it's helped me progress.”",
      "Branthwaite now wants to build on last season's progress and kick-on this term, with the ambition of getting into the England squad, having earned a first cap in a friendly win against Bosnia before Euro 2024, although he was cut from Gareth Southgate's 26-man squad from Germany.",
      "“I think for me it's just about taking what I learned from last season, and the season before, and putting it all together,” he explained. “I think last season, playing all the games I did helped me put performances in and get the experience I needed. I'm going to take that into this season and keep learning.",
      "“When you’ve got a good defensive record, it gives you confidence going into the new season. It’s not just the defenders who contribute to that, it’s the whole team and it’s the way the manager has us set up to give us the best possible chance to win games, and to pick up as many points as we can.",
      "“I think it’ll be the same again this season. Hopefully, we can pick up a few wins early on and get the momentum going in the new season.”",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have played in Norway in five of their last six pre-season schedules and the organisers may want to reconsider that jaunt for next summer's schedule.",
      "Five members of the 25-man United squad were senior players and it showed in a sterile friendly that sounded about as atmospheric as a Sunday league game. United ambassador Ronny Johnsen went off-message during MUTV's coverage when he commented on how quiet the atmosphere was. Such is the enthusiasm of United's Nordic following, it was a 21,000 sell-out at the Lerkendal Stadium.",
      "The referee's refusal to put everyone out of their misery and add three minutes of stoppage time did at least yield a goal in the 93rd-minute winner from Rosenborg substitute Noah Emmanuel Jean Holm. That was the least the dominant hosts merited against a hotchpotch United. \"The performance was below standards,\" Erik ten Hag admitted.",
      "The Norwegian contingent of United's support did not expect European Championship or Copa America participants but would have anticipated the presence of Andre Onana, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Antony and Amad.",
      "That quintet was back at Carrington. Steve McClaren, not in Norway, is on crutches after a foot operation, so the training back at base will have been minimal. United could at least have fielded a five-a-side team in the local power league.",
      "Back in Norway, Ten Hag learnt little. He did not say that, of course. Jose Mourinho was not shy in dismissing friendly matches with shadow squads and this was a particularly pointless excursion.",
      "Not for everyone, though. Radek Vitek was exceptional in goal, Ethan Wheatley was one of the few bright starters and Toby Collyer captained United on his maiden senior appearance.",
      "Nine of the players who emerged for the second half had never played under Ten Hag. They will always be able to say they represented the United first team and cherish their match shirts.",
      "Couching this as a first team friendly was disingenuous. It was about as senior as the United academy's exhibition match with Wrexham in San Diego last year. That turned out to be their most eventful tour fixture, with Paul Mullin maimed by United's goalkeeping competition winner Nathan Bishop.",
      "Vitek replaced Bishop at the pause that evening and his performance in Norway would suggest he has a higher ceiling. The 20-year-old pulled off at least five saves and his glove onto the crossbar from Emil Frederikson was world-class. The United goal led a charmed life and Rosenborg hit the woodwork four times.",
      "United have stockpiled goalkeepers from Eastern Europe in recent years but they made a tidy profit on the impressive Matej Kovar when he joined Bayer Leverkusen for €9million next year. His compatriot Vitek, on loan at League Two Accrington Stanley earlier this year, will not be playing at that low a level next season.",
      "At the other end, Wheatley applied himself with a purpose that suggests he does not want to be remembered as United's 250th academy graduate. The 18-year-old's portrait now graces the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year plaque at Carrington and last year it was Kobbie Mainoo's face.",
      "“In my team talk, I said yesterday, Copa America final: involving Alejandro Garnacho,\" Ten Hag told MUTV before kick-off. \"Euros final: Kobbie Mainoo. Last season, same game (against Leeds United in Oslo): Kobbie Mainoo was part of that match.\"",
      "There was not a performance comparable with Mainoo's accomplished half against Leeds but Wheatley was responsible for United's only attempt on target in a humdrum first half.",
      "Mason Mount endeavoured to raise the tempo and played Wheatley in. Mount, starting in midfield with Casemiro, will struggle to stay there when Mainoo returns from his overdue holiday and Ten Hag may have to tinker with his role over the next few weeks against Rangers, Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool.",
      "Ten Hag opined to a confidant towards the end of last season the rookies he was forced to name on the bench were not ready. That was apparent against the 11th-placed Norwegian side (out of 16), though Rosenborg are 14 games into the Tippeligaen season.",
      "Collyer, Habeeb Ogunneye, Rhys Bennett, Harry Amass and Joe Hugill were all unused substitutes in first team games last season. Bennett's positioning was awry for the only goal yet he lacked support from those in front of him.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Listening to Erik ten Hag speak in Norway you were left with the impression that two things in particular will need to change for this season go better than the last one. Manchester United's fitness record must improve and Ineos' new football structure needs to deliver greater depth to the squad.",
      "Ten Hag didn't put a number on the quantity of signings required to be competitive again, instead pointing to the fact with most of his first-team stars available United ended last season by 'beating the best team in the world'. You can't argue with that.",
      "They didn't show that level consistently enough, however, which is why they finished eighth in the Premier League. Ten Hag constantly pointed to a disastrous injury record to mitigate that underperformance.",
      "He is expecting this summer to beef up his squad, although it remains possible that the numbers will shrink with several players likely to be sold. It will be about shoring up the quality just behind the starting XI, which is what the £35.7m deal for Joshua Zirkzee does, while spending £52m on an 18-year-old Leny Yoro is another example of adding real quality to the squad.",
      "After that, it will be about getting players fit and keeping them there. Ten Hag has made no secret of the running requirements to play his style of football and in Trondheim, there was a hint of unhappiness about the physical capacity of some of his players in the first week of pre-season.",
      "The demands are only going to rise this season. United will play eight Europa League group games rather than six, with the league structure now finishing in January. The players themselves might be relieved they haven't qualified for FIFA's dreadful Club World Cup next summer, a month-long tournament that finally turns the sport into a year-round jamboree where pockets are lined but players are exploited.",
      "For now, United's squad can at least comfort themselves with the idea of a break at the end of the season, but Ten Hag didn't exactly play down the most important aspect of the season ahead. \"You need squad depth,\" he said. \"Then it's about survival of the fittest.\"",
      "That sounds like a neat catchphrase for the start of the game's most demanding season yet. It will also set alarm bells ringing at Carrington given last season resembled more an episode of Casualty than Bear Grylls.",
      "End-of-season research by the Premier Injuries website revealed United suffered the most in 2023/24, with 45 separate cases affecting 21 players, with a total of 1,620 days lost to those on the sidelines. That doesn't include Tyrell Malacia, who was injured before the season started and never returned.",
      "Those injuries robbed Ten Hag of continuity, especially in defence, and the medical issues have to be rectified for this season. Many of those problems were muscle injuries picked up in training at Carrington.",
      "This season won't just be about a repeat of avoiding those setbacks, however. It's not solely about not getting injuries, but about being fit enough to outrun the opposition twice a week, week after week. That is partly what Ten Hag is getting at when he says this season will be the \"survival of the fittest.\"",
      "We know how important running stats are to Ten Hag. He made that perfectly clear when his team were trampled all over by Brentford in just his second game in charge. There were some grumbles in pre-season a year ago about the demanding nature of some of the double sessions.",
      "This summer United are cutting down on travelling and will spend a significant chunk of their US tour in Los Angeles. It will make for a better work environment and was a key demand for Ten Hag when planning the trip.",
      "On those training pitches, he will hope to lay the foundations for a season when the ability of teams to keep going will be tested more than ever before. It will be survival of the fittest and Ten Hag will be desperate to make sure his players are ready for the challenge.",

      "Manchester United appear to be closing in on their second signing of the summer transfer window, with defender Leny Yoro agreeing to join.",
      "United had a bid accepted by Lille for the 18-year-old last week, but the teenager was said to have his heart set on a move to Real Madrid. It now seems that he has changed his mind and has decided to push on with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "A deal for Yoro could rise to as much as €70 million (£58.7m) with add-ons. If a deal goes through then he is expected to be available for the club’s pre-season tour in America next week.",
      "Yoro’s arrival could however have a big impact on another transfer the club has been working on. United have been in talks over a move for Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt for the last few weeks and have reached a verbal agreement with the Dutchman over personal terms.",
      "However, reports this week suggested that the transfer had been delayed due to the move for Yoro. De Ligt is valued at £42 million by Bayern, and it is said that United didn’t have an expectation of signing both the 24-year-old and Yoro this summer, suggesting that interest in the Ajax man could now be dropped.",
      "It leaves United with a decision to make. If they push ahead with a move for De Ligt it would take their spending up to £137.2 million on three transfers. United confirmed the £36.5 million capture of Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee over the weekend.",
      "Erik ten Hag has been keen to add to his defensive options this summer, with the departure of Raphael Varane. There has also been uncertainty over the future of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof who are both out of contract next year, the club will need replacements if one, or even both move on this summer.",
      "One thing that could point towards the club continuing their pursuit of De Ligt was their stance on Jarrad Branthwaite. It was reported that United were keen to do deals for both the Everton man and De Ligt this summer, when news of interest in the Ajax centre-back emerged.",
      "Branthwaite will have cost United more in terms of transfer fee than Yoro has. If the club have therefore moved on from the Everton defender, then the plan to sign De Ligt could potentially remain in place.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was charmed by Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund posing together on the Old Trafford advertising hoardings after a goal last season.",
      "Those players are the future of Manchester United and Leny Yoro can be added to that bracket when he completes his transfer from Lille in a deal that could rise to €70million.",
      "That fee equates to £58.7m which represents value for a player who is regarded as one of the brightest prospects in European football. Real Madrid were interested in Yoro but United have made a breakthrough and his signing will be a statement of intent.",
      "Yoro is just 18 years old and his potential is vast. United could build their defence around the Frenchman for the next decade and he will complete a young core of the team, with Mainoo in midfield, Hojlund leading the attack and Garnacho on the left or right wing.",
      "Yoro is the type of signing Sir Alex Ferguson would target and he possesses similar raw attributes to Rio Ferdinand when the United great was on the cusp of signing from Leeds.",
      "It made sense for Lille to sell Yoro considering he'd entered the final year of his contract, but United have done well to steal a march on their rivals to make a breakthrough to sign him.",
      "Yoro is on his way to Manchester for a medical and he will become the club's second signing of the summer window after the arrival of Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna for £36.5m. United have made a strong start to the transfer window and there is still plenty more work to do.",
      "However, the signing of Yoro should be regarded as a coup and supporters have already shared their delight at the club landing one of the hottest prospects in football.",
      "Yoro made his senior debut for Lille aged 16 and it didn't take long for him to become a key first-team player. He made 44 appearances in all competitions last season - not starting in just one of those games - and demonstrated his quality against Aston Villa in the Conference League.",
      "Aston Villa progressed to the semi-finals of the Conference League with a victory over Lille on penalties, but Yoro announced himself to a wider British audience over those two legs.",
      "Although Yoro still has scope to physically mature, which is par for the course at his age, he oozed quality and composure against Villa and that bodes well for this season.",
      "The Premier League poses different challenges to Ligue 1, but Yoro is equipped with the attributes to succeed in England and will become an even better player with the benefit of time.",
      "United fans want to challenge for the Premier League title as soon as possible but they aren't daft. The club hasn't come close to winning the league since 2013 - United were 19 points behind Manchester City in 2017/18 - and a title challenge is at least a few years away, realistically.",
      "Ratcliffe has shared that sentiment in his interviews since acquiring a minority stake and the early signs of his co-ownership show United are taking a longer-term view for success.",
      "United are hopeful Yoro will develop into one of the world's best defenders and he's the final piece of a talented, youthful core that could play together for many years.",
      "Mainoo confirmed himself as an exceptional prospect last season and was superb at Euro 2024 for England. Hojlund enjoyed a solid first season, scoring 16 goals, and Garnacho has been likened to a young Cristiano Ronaldo, who was full of confidence yet raw at United.",
      "When you add Yoro to that list of players, United have four talented youngsters who will eventually form the core of the team, which is a genuinely exciting prospect to savour.",
      "It might take five years to challenge for the Premier League, but Ratcliffe is building for long-term success and United undoubtedly have an exciting crop of youngsters.",

      "It is thought Sir Jim Ratcliffe is only permitting an overall net expenditure of around £50m, with just over £10m received for the sales of Donny van de Beek and Willy Kambwala. United have meanwhile agreed a £26.7m fee from Marseille for Mason Greenwood.",
      "A sum of £36m was paid out to Bologna for the acquisition of Joshua Zirkzee, who is currently on a short break after his inclusion in the Netherlands squad for Euro 2024. He missed Monday’s friendly in Norway against Rosenborg and might also be exempt from Saturday’s fixture with Rangers at Murrayfield.",
      "The game also probably comes too soon for Yoro, who joins on a deal worth £52m rising up to just under £59m. United begin their pre-season tour of the US on July 28 when they face Arsenal in California.",
      "Zirkzee will have joined up with the squad by then as will Yoro thanks to a decision made early this summer.",
      "The defender was ultimately not selected to take part in France’s campaign at this summer’s Olympics, with the men’s football event running from July 24. The gold medal match takes place on August 9, just eight days before the start of the Premier League season.",
      "Clubs are not obliged to release their players for the tournament given it is not a Fifa-sanctioned event, and so Lille prevented Yoro from being called up. This meant the club could seal a fee for his transfer more easily, with inclusion in the Olympics almost certain to have stagnated negotiations.",
      "The further positive consequence for United sees Yoro available for pre-season, having had the opportunity to secure the transfer of the 18-year-old in good time.",
      "It affords Erik ten Hag more breathing space to sort out his team blueprint ahead of the new season, with Yoro set to be available for at least three pre-season friendlies ahead of the Community Shield clash against Manchester City on August 10, once his move is finalised.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already made his first signing at Manchester United, but Paul Ince believes the squad needs a new striker with Premier League experience if they're to improve",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been advised to target English stars Ivan Toney and Ollie Watkins this summer.",
      "Ratcliffe recently began his first summer as a United investor by signing Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee for £36.5million, while Lille's teenage centre-half Leny Yoro is on his way to Old Trafford too for around £50m. But the British billionaire has a significant amount of work on his hands if he hopes to improve the club's fortunes in the coming campaign.",
      "A surprising 1-0 pre-season defeat to Norwegian team Rosenborg highlighted the challenges that lie ahead, and it's clear United's transfer dealings are far from over. Former Old Trafford star Paul Ince has urged his old club to prioritise securing an experienced Premier League striker - specifically Toney and Watkins - to alleviate the scoring pressure on young Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Aston Villa ace Watkins and Brentford frontman Toney made waves with their performances for England at Euro 2024. Toney confidently converted his penalty in the shootout win against Switzerland, while Watkins scored a memorable goal against the Netherlands to propel England into the final.",
      "Both players have attracted considerable attention this summer, with Toney of particular interest to clubs as his contract expires in 2025. The Bees will be reluctant to let their top scorer leave for free next year, however, making a sale during this transfer window likely.",
      "Ince, 56, firmly believes United desperately need a major revamp, with a particular focus on recruiting a striker who can consistently find the back of the net at the highest level. In an interview with Ladbrokes 1-2-Free (via The Mirror), he said: \"They've got to strengthen a lot this summer.",
      "\"When you look at a team before pre-season starts, and you start identifying where you might want to strengthen, you don't want to make wholesale changes. You know, you want to keep the core of the team. But when you look at Manchester United, they need at least seven players, arguably in the starting XI.\"",
      "United have to be careful about spending outside their means despite winning the FA Cup to qualify for next season's Europa League. And Ince went on to identify other specific areas in which reinforcements are required, with striker top of the wish-list.",
      "He continued: \"Raphael Varane is gone now, Lisandro Martinez has been injured pretty much all season, so there's an issue there; can he compete for 40 or more games per season? We've got Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who we're trying to sell. Luke Shaw has spent a lot of time out.",
      "\"Casemiro is going to move on, and we still haven't found that holding number six. Antony hasn't been performing, so do you get someone in to replace him? Marcus Rashford hasn't been at his best, and Rasmus Hojlund is still a young striker. That's so many areas of the pitch you would say need improving.",
      "\"I think that's what we need to get; a top, top striker, like an Ollie Watkins, like an Ivan Toney. Someone like that, who knows the league, to play up front and let Hojlund take his time and settle in. Listen, I'm sure the new people behind the scenes know what they're doing.\"",
      "A proven striker in England's top-flight is sure to command a hefty fee. Brentford have reportedly put a £60m price tag on Toney despite his contract expiring next summer, and Villa would demand more for Watkins.",
      "The player's current market value is understood to be around £85m, but that could increase as Villa look to offload other assets to balance their books. Douglas Luiz's £42m sale to Juventus has already helped ease their woes in that sector, but other departures may be on the cards.",
      "Winger Moussa Diaby is believed to be attracting interest from Saudi Arabian clubs, while back-up forward Jhon Duran is on West Ham's radar.",
      "With several potential departures at United, the funds raised could pave the way for them to make a move for either of the England stars.",

      "United have agreed a £58.7million deal with the French club for the 18-year-old, who is set to fly to Manchester to finalise personal terms. Yoro had been on Real Madrid's radar, but the Spanish giants were unwilling to meet Lille's asking price.",
      "United academy graduate Gomes, who left Old Trafford in June 2020 after just 10 senior appearances, has been impressed by Yoro's maturity and ability to fit into the first-team environment at Lille despite his young age. Previously speaking to Eurosport, he said: \"As soon as he arrived in the group, I understood that he was going to reach the summits.",
      "\"When I discovered the pros at the age of 16 at Manchester United, I understood that it was different. He already had the right temperament. That's not normal for a 16- or 17-year-old player arriving. It's like he's already an experienced player and it showed in the way he trained, the way he behaved. His progress was obvious.\"",

Erik ten Hag has identified Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Jarrad Branthwaite as potential targets, with the aim of securing at least two of these players. However, the acquisition of a second player may hinge on the future of Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire.",

      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",
      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Man Utd are set to sign an 18-year-old centre-back who was wanted by Real Madrid and the deal is a major milestone for Ineos.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe didn't shy away from the biggest issue that has held Manchester United back when he completed his £1.25bn deal to invest in the club in February.",
      "\"I think recruitment in the modern game is critical. Manchester United have clearly spent a lot of money but they haven't done as well as some other clubs,\" Ratcliffe said in his first sit-down interview as the club's minority owner.",
      "\"So when I was talking about being best-in-class in all aspects of football, recruitment is probably top of the list.\"",
      "The 71-year-old has never really hid his feelings about the transfer operation at Old Trafford. A few years ago he called United the \"dumb money\" in football and a look at the rewards for the £1.6bn spend since 2013 would make that a fair assessment.",
      "In recent months he has touched again on recruitment. He told the Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast that \"the solution isn’t spending a lot of money on a couple of great players\", and then said he wanted to sign the next Kylian Mbappe rather than the man himself.",
      "The extent to which Ratcliffe has placed recruitment at the top of the list in areas to improve can be seen in the overhaul of roles at Old Trafford. Since February, Ineos have appointed Dan Ashworth as sporting director, Jason Wilcox as technical director and Christopher Vivell as interim director of recruitment. Three executives with vast experience in transfers and a reputation as shrewd operators.",
      "They are making a good start as well. The deal for Joshua Zirkzee was wrapped up quickly after his involvement in Euro 2024 came to an end, with a deal agreed with Bologna that helped United navigate their own financial concerns. But it is the second transfer of the summer that looks set to cause a storm.",
      "When United had a bid accepted by Lille for 18-year-old Leny Yoro recently there still wasn't a feeling it was going to happen. The teenager is out of contract next summer so held the ace cards and it had long been expected that he wanted to move to Real Madrid.",
      "But United's aggressive approach in making an offer Lille clearly couldn't refuse tilted the balance and they have convinced him his future can be at Old Trafford. At an initial £52m it is a large fee, rising to £58.7m with add-ons, but that remains well below what Everton want for Jarrad Branthwaite. Yoro has far more high-level exposure at this stage of his career than Branthwaite had at 18, when he spent time on loan at Blackburn and played 10 games in the Championship.",
      "Yoro has already racked up 46 appearances in Ligue 1 and is probably the most highly-rated young centre-back in Europe. The fact he made the Ligue 1 team of the year speaks of his talent and he doesn't turn 19 until November. He could be a United centre-back for years to come.",
      "The deal would certainly be a feather in the cap for Ineos and particularly for Ashworth, Wilcox and Vivell. Convincing Yoro to put aside his ambitions to play for Real Madrid is a significant achievement and he has clearly been sold on the idea of progressing his career at Old Trafford.",
      "They have also acted decisively. Yoro's move to Real had looked like a formality, but while the European champions waited to play hardball over a fee, United stepped in. It is an example of the quick-thinking and nimbleness that Ratcliffe would want the club to show.",
      "There is more work to be in this window, but in a significant couple of months for Ineos they are laying down a marker already.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is relaxed about which Manchester United shirt number he is given for the 2024/25 season and expects striker Rasmus Hojlund to take the No.9.",
      "Zirkzee's move to Manchester from Italy was confirmed for €42.5million last weekend and the striker is expected to join up with the squad in early August after a summer break.",
      "The 23-year-old earned a late call-up to the Netherlands squad for Euro 2024 and his nation reached the semi-finals of the tournament, hence why he'll link up at a later date.",
      "United prioritised strengthening their attacking options in this summer transfer window and Zirkzee, who finished last season as Bolgona's top goalscorer with league 11 goals, was identified as someone who could add quality to the attack and compete with Hojlund to start.",
      "Zirkzee's first interview with club media was released on Wednesday afternoon and the player has also spoken to Dutch YouTube show Matchday since signing.",
      "When discussing his transfer to United, Zirkzee said conversations intensified while he was in Germany for Euro 2024: \"I had a conversation in Wolfsburg. My father was there too because he is there for everything. After that conversation, I immediately had a good feeling.",
      "\"Then the choice was actually already made. The European Championship was number one anyway, United also thought that was important. That was where the focus had to be. So that was doable.\"",
      "Zirkzee's shirt number hasn't been confirmed by United, but he is an incredibly laidback character and admitted he is relaxed about which number he's given in the new season.",
      "Anthony Martial departed United on a free transfer this summer and vacated the No.9 shirt, which Zirkzee expects Hojlund to take. \"That depends a bit on Rasmus Hojlund. He's already there and he's also a striker,\" he said when asked whether he knew his shirt number.",
      "\"No.9 is free, but yeah... He has 11, so I can imagine that he wants No.9 now. In that case I'll take 11. At Bologna I also had 11, so that doesn't really matter to me.\"",
      "Bologna defied the odds to finish in the Italian top four last term. They enjoyed their best season since 1967/1968 and Zirkzee started 32 out of a possible 38 league games.",
      "Zirkzee was only given two appearances from the bench at Euro 2024 and former United loanee Wout Weghorst was preferred ahead of him by Ronald Koeman. It's thought Zirkzee could play in the different positions across the attacking front line for United.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Louis van Gaal previously made his thoughts perfectly clear on Matthijs de Ligt and Manchester United.",
      "When United were first interested in the central defender in 2019, Van Gaal listed three other clubs he should consider instead of the Red Devils. Five years later, the 24-year-old ignored his advice by agreeing personal terms with Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "Despite being Ten Hag's captain at Ajax, interest in the Bayern Munich defender has now cooled, with United on the cusp of signing £52million defender Leny Yoro, who completed a medical at the club yesterday. With the chances of De Ligt joining the club now depending on any future sales, Van Gaal may be happy the player he coached with the Netherlands is no longer heading to the club he left in 2016.",
      "When Van Gaal was asked who De Ligt should join by Ziggo Sport in 2019, Van Gaal said: \"De Ligt at Juventus? I think De Ligt can play in any competition.",
      "\"In Italy, they are the masters of defence, so he can best develop there. If I had the chance I would go to Barcelona. They have central defenders who are not too good, so he will play there.",
      "\"Or I would go to Manchester City. I don't think the central defenders are that great either, so he'll play there too.\"",
      "Sign up to our United newsletter so you never miss an update from Old Trafford this season.",
      "Yoro's arrival came as a surprise to many fans, as it initially appeared the Lille defender was holding out for a move to Real Madrid, reports the Mirror. Instead, he will fill the huge void left by Raphael Varane, whose contract expired at the end of June.",
      "Ten Hag will have Yoro, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Victor Lindelof, and Jonny Evans to call upon in central defence this season. With their defensive line-up now bolstered, a move for another central defender appears unlikely, unless there are sales.",
      "Nevertheless, there is still speculation surrounding possible exits for Maguire and Lindelof. United opted to extend the latter's contract by a year last season, to keep him from leaving on a free transfer at the same time as Varane.",
      "Meanwhile, West Ham have shown interest in Maguire and are reportedly in talks over signing right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka. So far, United have been active in the transfer market, recently heralding the £36.54m signing of Bologna's forward and young talent, Joshua Zirkzee.",

      "Yoro arrives with a glowing reputation and full stamp of approval from Premier League icon Thierry Henry among others. He is set to undergo a medical at Carrington before the formalities of putting pen-to-paper.",
      "Spanish giants Real Madrid were also thought to be interested. However, despite his initial preference reportedly being a switch to the Santiago Bernabeu this summer, the Frenchman has opted to join United instead - with Lille cashing in on a player who only had 12 months left to run on his contract with the French Ligue 1 outfit.",
      "Yoro played 60 senior games for Lille, scoring three goals. He will not turn 19 until November.",
      "As and when the ink dries on his United contract, the 6ft 3in centre-back will have to select his shirt number and there are some favourable options available. Yoro wore No.15 at Lille and that remains up for grabs at Old Trafford on the proviso there are no in-house changes before the 2024/2025 season begins.",
      "Although No.15 has sentimental value for him, Yoro might well also have his eyes on the No.4 shirt, which he has worn at age-group level for Lille and the France national side.

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United fans will admit Pep Guardiola has been at the forefront of evolving tactics.",
      "Guardiola made playing false nines fashionable, he introduced playing out from the back to England and, more recently, began to play central defenders in full-back roles. Other managers have followed Guardiola's tactical innovations and his former assistant manager Mikel Arteta picked up the central defender idea and ran with it at the Emirates.",
      "Arteta has played Ben White out of position and Guardiola has changed the roles of Nathan Ake and Josko Gvardiol, with all three of those regularly playing as full-backs last season, providing extra defensive solidity on the wings and an advantage in build-up play.",
      "Centre backs tend to be significantly better one-on-one defenders than traditional full-backs and that's an obvious positive, but playing a natural centre half as a full-back also allows teams to have a back-three in build-up, which helps to press high and defend counter-attacks.",
      "Playing central defenders out of position became a popular trend last season and Liverpool and Aston Villa played Joe Gomez and Ezri Konsa as their full-backs respectively. The four teams who finished at the top Premier League all used the innovation, which suggests there's an advantage in doing so if implemented correctly.",
      "Now enter United and Erik ten Hag, who has often instructed his full-backs to play an inverted role, which is why Diogo Dalot comes into midfield from the right. Perhaps Ten Hag is happy with his current system and believes it doesn't need to be tweaked, but an elite manager adapts to the players at his disposal and the United squad is changing this summer, with Leny Yoro coming in and Aaron Wan-Bissaka expected to leave.",
      "Wan-Bissaka has entered the final year of his contract and selling him this summer is the last opportunity to recoup a decent fee for someone who was signed for £50m in the summer of 2019, with West Ham said to be interested.",
      "Although moving on Wan-Bissaka would leave Dalot as the only senior right-back in the squad, Yoro is flying to Manchester for a medical and is an option in that role. Yoro is a natural centre-back and made 44 appearances at the heart of Lille's defence last season, but starting in central defence at just 18 years old in the Premier League is bound to be a tough challenge and he could be eased into the team at right-back.",
      "Like every player at his age, Yoro needs time to physically develop and playing him at right-back would allow him to improve and gain experience without coming under the cosh in central defence. As the last line of defence, centre-backs are exposed and tested by the opposition more than any other outfield players and Yoro might not be ready for that challenge.",
      "He is a defender for the future - United hope he'll become one of the world's best - but immediately chucking him into the deep end is inadvisable. Yoro has the qualities to excel at right-back for United.",
      "It might not be a position Yoro has played before, but he's comfortable with the ball at his feet, he intelligently reads the game and his natural athleticism will help him adapt. His long-term future is in the middle but it wouldn't be a surprise to see him at right-back this season.",

Leny Yoro is set to be first through the door at Old Trafford after a deal worth £52million - potentially rising to £58.7million with add-ons - was agreed.",
      "The highly-rated French teenager is for the present and future - depending on what other business United do - as Erik ten Hag also contemplates how to tackle a familiar problem. Matthijs de Ligt and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite are the other two fixed targets on radar for Ten Hag and INEOS behind the scenes.",
      "Further additions will be dependent on outgoings. However, in the scenario by which De Ligt and Branthwaite do join as well, there will be growing concern for Lisandro Martinez.",
      "There are countless attributes that Martinez brings to the table - too many to mention - but the fan favourite has not been available for selection anywhere near as much as United would have wanted since he pitched up at Old Trafford from Ajax two years ago. He has totted-up 38 games in the Premier League across those two seasons and the drop-off in quality when he has been missing has been stark.",
      "United were hit as hard as anyone when it came to injuries last season and that hoodoo particularly affected the defensive options available to them. England regular Luke Shaw was sorely missed at left-back - returning only in time for that Euro 2024 showpiece - while Martinez also proved to be irreplaceable.",
      "A huge tick for Ten Hag in the market before the keys to recruitment were snatched away from the Dutchman by INEOS this summer, there is no doubt Martinez has the quality to shine on the Premier League stage, even though the 25-year-old had to silence the outside noise, mainly regarding his size.",
      "As things stand, Martinez, who has yet to report back to Carrington for pre-season after Copa America glory with Argentina, will start for United when fit, even with Yoro through the door. However, with De Ligt and Branthwaite on board - however fanciful that might seem - game-time would have to be taken away from someone.",
      "Of course, competition and cover is fundamental for any successful squad, but Martinez would be at risk through previous concerns, while how much United expose Yoro, 18, in the early days will be dependent on who else they sign. Still, that will be infinitely more welcome the fitness woes United had to deal with last season.",

      "Two of their starters were Champions League winners, three had World Cup experience and five have started in FA Cup finals. United's only attempt on target in the first half was from the 18-year-old Ethan Wheatley, a rare bright spark.",
      "Ten Hag could have dismissed the result and the performance yet this is a team that plummeted to eighth in the Premier League last season and collected the wooden spoon in their Champions League group. Even MUTV has to host some home truths.",
      "United will field a stronger side against Rangers in Edinburgh on Saturday and possibly a more senior XI a week later against Arsenal in Los Angeles.",

      "Man Utd need a defensive midfielder to come through the ranks and they could have one in the making after a bright debut in Trondheim for Toby Collyer.",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "When Casemiro took off the captain's armband in the away dressing room at Lerkendal and strapped it onto Toby Collyer's bicep, the symbolism would have hung heavy in the air. This wasn't a changing of the guard just yet, but Manchester United's two captains on the night hinted at careers going in different directions.",
      "For Casemiro, this was the kind of start to pre-season he didn't want. It's perhaps a little surprising the 32-year-old is still around, but interest from Saudi Arabia hasn't emerged and as it stands he looks likely to see through a third campaign in Manchester. He needs the snap to return to his game.",
      "His last competitive involvement was pulling out of the FA Cup final squad between the teamsheets being submitted and then confirmed. He was due to be a substitute at Wembley but felt tightness and withdrew. It summed up a season in which he looked and played like a veteran entering the twilight of his career.",
      "The Brazilian doesn't turn 33 until February but has had a demanding career in Europe and has a build that suggests fitness doesn't always come easily to him. He was a weak link in United's midfield for much of last season, although the open nature of that department didn't exactly offer him much protection.",
      "Maybe he will be better in a smarter system this term and against Rosenborg there were a couple of nice passes, but he fell over scuffing a clearance in his box and was pounced on and lost possession just outside the area. It was an inauspicious start for a player who will want to prove the career obituaries are being penned too early.",
      "It was certainly a contrast to Collyer, who strode onto the pitch with his socks rolled low, looking more of a throwback than the man he had replaced. But he played like a modern No.6.",
      "His former Brighton Under-18s coach Mark Beard once labelled him the best defensive midfielder in the country for his age. He is a month older than Adam Wharton, who has excelled for first-team exposure and was part of England's Euro 2024 squad, although he didn't kick a ball.",
      "Until Monday night, the closest Collyer had come to playing on a big stage was in the academy friendly against Wrexham in San Diego a year ago. This was a bigger night than that and he looked the part in a callow second-half side.",
      "He was combative and strong in the tackle, took up intelligent positions to block attacks and used the ball well, happy to receive it from the defence or goalkeeper Radek Vitek and try and keep it moving forward. One flick on the left touchline to the advancing Harry Amass was a stylish contribution.",
      "Collyer recently signed a new four-year contract at Old Trafford and although he hasn't yet played for the first team, Erik ten Hag insisted on being present for the signing of the paperwork. This is a player he rates highly, as seen by the decision to give him the captaincy for the second half on Monday night.",
      "He will get further chances this summer as well. Collyer is expected to go on the pre-season tour to the United States, with Scott McTominay and Christian Eriksen returning from their summer breaks to boost options in midfield. Ten Hag has urged the youngsters involved in pre-season to take their opportunity, just as Kobbie Mainoo did a year ago. Collyer could be the biggest beneficiary of more first-team exposure.",
      "He plays in a position that United have struggled to fill for a long time now. Casemiro looked to be the answer in his first season but the £70m signing now has questions to answer. There is still a chance United sell and look to sign a younger player in that position during this window.",
      "Sofyan Amrabat contributed last season and United still haven't decided whether to try and sign the 27-year-old on a permanent deal, though the player is keen to return to Old Trafford. Amrabat isn't good enough in possession and it would be a retrograde step, while Ten Hag has decided McTominay is best utilised further forward and there is interest again in the Scot this summer.",
      "It's expecting too much for Collyer to force his way into the starting XI for the opening day of the league campaign, but he could emerge as a rotation option this season. If Casemiro does go a replacement will be signed, but with a little more experience under his belt, Collyer could become a first-team option in a position where United really need a succession plan.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have released training footage of Tyrell Malacia completing light individual training on the grass at Carrington.",
      "Malacia last played a competitive fixture for the Netherlands in the UEFA Nations League on June 14 but went under the knife a month later shortly after pre-season began. The defender sustained a knee injury at the end of the 2022/23 campaign and surgery was eventually required, despite United initially looking to manage it with pain injections.",
      "After that initial operation, Malacia required another round of surgery and his prolonged absence has been a source of frustration for Erik ten Hag, but he's now closing in on a return to full fitness and is currently undergoing an individual programme to complete his rehabilitation.",
      "United released fresh footage of Malacia training individually under the guidance of a member of medical staff and he is wearing a device around his left knee. For the first time since his injury, Malacia was seen with the ball at his feet during the session, which suggests he could be available for selection in August.",
      "It's understood the club are carefully handling Malacia's return to prevent any further setbacks, as the player has already missed more than a year during his time on the sidelines. United went the majority of the season without their senior left-backs, Luke Shaw and Malacia, due to injury and Sergio Reguilon was signed on loan as a stopgap signing.",
      "Ten Hag went on record to express his frustration at injuries in that area and many fans believe United should sign a new left-back in the summer transfer window. Malacia was on crutches after his initial injury and spent some time in the Netherlands to recover, and a source indicated he was expected to return before 2024.",
      "However, Malacia's setback delayed his return and Shaw sustaining different muscle injuries throughout the season compounded the problem at left-back. Malacia has made a total of 39 appearances for United.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has sent his best wishes to Willy Kambwala following confirmation of the young defender's transfer to Villarreal.",
      "Kambwala, who made his first-team debut for Manchester United against West Ham in the Premier League last season, racked up eight league appearances and featured twice in the FA Cup. He now heads to Spain in a deal that could reach £9.6 million.",
      "The departure of the ex-Sochaux talent marks the second paid exit from United this summer, with Donny van de Beek earlier moving to Girona for an initial fee of £500,000 plus add-ons. This figure is notably less than the £35 million United spent to bring him from Ajax in 2020.",
      "Mainoo, who played alongside Kambwala in the UEFA Youth League before establishing himself in the senior squad, expressed his support on social media, commenting \"Big love bro, all the best,\" on Kambwala's Instagram post announcing his move.",
      "Kambwala shared his gratitude and reflections on his time at United: \"Dear @manchesterunited, I arrived at the club as a boy with a dream and today I'm leaving like a young man who has fulfilled his dream,\" he posted. \"From the academy to the first team, it's time for me to start a new adventure after 4 wonderful seasons at the club\".",
      "He continued, acknowledging those who supported him during his journey: \"Thank you to all the people I have met during these 4 years. Coaches, my teammates, staff members, workers in Carrington and members of my host family.\"",
      "\"I'll never forget what you all did for me. A special thank you to you fans who have always supported me, you are the soul of this club. I wish you the best for this season and for the future.\"",
      "United have inserted a buy-back option into Kambwala's deal, as well as a significant sell-on clause. The 19 year old joins former Old Trafford star Eric Bailly at his new club, as well as several other former Premier League men including Alexander Sorloth and Juan Foyth.",
      "Mainoo wasn't the other United academy talent to wish the defender well. Joe Hugill, Dan Gore and Maxi Oyedele all shared messages of support, as did Toby Collyer, who recently signed a new contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Ethan Wheatley also shared a message for Kambwala, and the young striker was among those to get minutes for United in their first pre-season match against Rosenborg on Monday. The Norwegian side won 1-0 thanks to a late goal from Noah Holm, and manager Erik ten Hag demanded better from his players after senior stars including Marcus Rashford and Casemiro joined a squad primarily made up of youngsters.",
      "\"The result is not secondary,\" Ten Hag said. \"Our performance as a team is by far not good enough. This is not the standard of top football. We are Man Utd, we should perform better\".",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have made moves for defenders Jarrad Branthwaite, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro this summer, but what could happen if all three signed?",
      "It's no secret that United are in the market for new centre-backs this summer. With Raphael Varane having departed the club and Victor Lindelof expected to be sold, defence is a priority in the transfer window with Erik ten Hag's side closing in on a few new arrivals.",
      "Personal terms have been agreed with De Ligt while Yoro has agreed to join the club despite interest from Real Madrid. A deal could still be done for Branthwaite after United's first two bids were rejected.",
      "But if United were to have the perfect summer transfer window and all three defenders signed, how could they fare next season? Let's take a look...",
      "To set up this simulation, we used Football Manager 2024 to move the defensive trio to United in the summer transfer window for a combined fee of £150million. We then simulated the 2024/25 season, and this is how the defenders got on.",
      "Ten Hag was keen to play his new additions as much as possible, with the Dutchman eventually deciding to move Lisandro Martinez into midfield to accommodate his signings. This worked a treat, with all three defenders playing regularly in their first season at the club.",
      "De Ligt and Branthwaite was the partnership that saw the most game time in the simulation, with the latter making 41 appearances, one more than De Ligt. As the least experienced, Yoro was eased into the squad, but in his 28 appearances the Frenchman averaged a rating of 7.03 per game along with five assists - the same rating as De Ligt, and higher than Branthwaite (6.98).",
      "At the end of the 2024/25 season, Football Manager 2024 put together an overall best United XI, based on performances, statistics, and other metrics. This is what it looked like:",
      "Full United best XI: (4-3-3):  Onana; Dalot, De Ligt, Branthwaite, Shaw; Martinez, Fernandes, Mainoo; Garnacho, Hojlund, Rashford.",
      "De Ligt and Branthwaite were the centre-back partnership in the best XI, with Yoro missing out. Martinez made the best XI as a holding midfielder, with Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo completing the midfield three.",
      "New signing Joshua Zirkzee failed to make the best XI with Rasmus Hojlund scoring more goals than the Dutchman. Both Maguire and Lindelof were sold in the simulation, leaving little competition for the new signings.",
      "With De Ligt, Branthwaite and Yoro all settling in nicely at Old Trafford, their impact was felt in the Premier League, with Ten Hag's side improving massively in the 2024/25 season. At the end of the campaign, United finished fifth, but it was their defensive record that impressed the most.",
      "20 wins, 13 draws, and five losses saw United end the season on 73 points, 13 more than the previous season, and only seven points off the top four. Ten Hag's side conceded just 31 goals in the league, giving them the joint-best defensive record in the league along with Tottenham.",
      "United earned a spot in the Champions League for the following season in the simulation, but it wasn't to do with finishing fifth. A fantastic European campaign saw Ten Hag's side win the Europa League, with Marcus Rashford scoring twice as United beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the final.",
      "Overall, FM24 predicts that if United can sign Branthwaite, De Ligt and Yoro, their defence could improve drastically, with Ten Hag's side winning a European trophy in the simulation. The triple signing also saw Martinez move into midfield, a switch that definitely worked.",

Now, Bayer Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah has emerged as a potential alternative. As such, Manchester Evening News have rounded up everything you need to know about United's pursuit of the German international.",
      "Tah is the club's vice-captain and made 48 appearances in all competitions last term as Leverkusen won an historic first Bundesliga title while going the entire season unbeaten, won the DFB Pokal and reached the final of the Europa League. The 28-year-old is a regular for the German national team, too, and is one of Bayer's core players they want to build their team around as they look to defend their title this term.",

      "The 32-year-old is weighing up his next move and he could be tempted by a return to Germany, with Alonso 'very interested' in securing his services, according to Sky Sports in Germany. Matip previously spent seven years at Schalke 04, helping the club win the DFB Pokal and the DFL-Supercup, as well as reaching the Champions League semi-finals in 2011.",

      "Elsewhere, United are continuing to be linked with a move for Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte. According to Give Me Sport, United are considering a change of strategy when it comes to signing Ugarte.",
      "It has been claimed that United are now weighing up whether or not to try and sign Ugarte on loan rather than on a permanent deal. United have already signed Zirkzee and are looking to add further new signings to their squad this summer. The signing of Ugarte on loan would provide more financial room for the Reds to work with when it comes to adding new players to the squad.",

      "Luke Shaw joined Manchester United 10 years ago as a 19-year-old with the world at his feet after over 65 senior appearances for Southampton.",
      "A fee in the region of £30m made him the most expensive teenager in world football at the time. He has played 275 games for United since, but his career at Old Trafford has been plagued with injuries.",
      "He failed to make more than 25 appearances in his first four seasons after a combination of muscle injuries and a freak double fracture of his right leg in 2015. The England international made 40 appearances in 2018/19, 33 in 2019/20, 48 in 2020/21, and 47 in 2022/23 in somewhat of a turn of fortunes.",
      "Since moving to Manchester, he has missed a jaw-dropping 1,328 days of football, totaling over 3.5 years and 273 games (according to Transfermarkt). After hardly playing for Erik ten Hag's side last term, Shaw returned to action at Euro 2024 with three appearances for England.",
      "There will be hope that the 29-year-old can once again become a mainstay in United's defence for the new season, despite the fear of another setback. Talk of a new left-back being signed by Dan Ashworth this summer has been a popular debate among supporters.",
      "At times last season, Diogo Dalot filled in, and the Portugal international did superbly on the other side of his natural position, and that method could prove vital once again. Aaron Wan-Bissaka has attracted interest this summer, and should the English defender leave the club, a new right-back will become the priority, and the Reds already have their dream profile.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka has attracted interest this summer, and should the English defender leave the club, a new right-back will become the priority, and the Red Devils already have their dream profile.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen star Jeremie Frimpong has been linked with a move to Old Trafford for some time, and his sensational season in Germany has only added more valuation. It's been reported that United would make a move for Frimpong if Wan-Bissaka departed.",
      "Frimpong scored 14 goals and assisted 12 times for Xabi Alonso's team to help them win their first-ever Bundesliga title. According to BILD, the Netherlands international has a release clause worth between £33.6m and £37.8m, but that is set to expire this week.",
      "The Reds have pushed ahead with their move for Leny Yoro from Lille in recent days, having already completed the signing of Joshua Zirkzee. Despite this, the problematic area at full-back and approaching deadline to sign Frimpong at a bargain fee means their next signing may be forced on them.",

      "West Ham United could be about to hand Manchester United a major transfer boost, despite the Hammers reaching an agreement to sign former target Jean-Clair Todibo.",
      "Todibo had been linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer but UEFA's multi-ownership rules blocked them making a move for the Nice defender, as the French club are also owned by INEOS. Interest in the France international is high, though, and despite it looking like he was going to join Juventus, West Ham have agreed a deal with Nice to sign the 24-year-old.",
      "The Hammers have struck an initial loan deal with an option to sign Todibo for £27million next summer and it is now up to the player to decide whether he wants to move to East London. West Ham are looking to reshape their defence under new manager Julen Lopetegui and have already signed Max Kilman from Wolverhampton Wanderers for £40million.",
      "And as part of that reshuffle, The Telegraph report they are keen to sign Manchester United right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka this summer. The 26-year-old is out of contract next summer and this transfer window represents the last chance United have to recoup a significant fee for a player they paid £40million to sign from Crystal Palace five years ago.",
      "Reports suggest West Ham want to strike a £15million deal for Wan-Bissaka, and while that would represent a significant loss on the fee they paid to sign him, any player sales will go towards United's own rebuild this summer. Erik ten Hag's side have already secured the £36million signing of Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna, while they are expected to seal a £58.7million deal for Lille defender Leny Yoro.",
      "As such, they will need to trade players in order to bring in some more signings this summer, with the likes of Matthijs De Ligt, Jarrad Branthwaite and Manuel Ugarte linked with moves to Old Trafford.",
      "Any money they receive for the likes of Wan-Bissaka, Mason Greenwood, Victor Lindelof and possibly even Scott McTominay would fund moves for Ten Hag to give his side a major refresh in the summer transfer window.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United have made no secret about their plan to strengthen at centre-back this summer and the main question to answer is which signatures will they eventually secure? Jarrad Branthwaite, Matthijs de Ligt and highly-rated Lille youngster Leny Yoro are on the shopping list for Erik ten Hag and key figures behind the scenes.",
      "However, another man - Bundesliga-winning Bayer Leverkusen colossus Jonathan Tah - has emerged as a possible alternative with the wheels in motion for a defensive rebuild. Reports from Sky Germany underline the 28-year-old as a viable and attainable option on the proviso Branthwaite, De Ligt or Yoro slip away.",
      "Netherlands international De Ligt - well known to manager Ten Hag from their days together at Ajax - has verbally agreed personal terms as he aims to kick-start a promising career that has stalled for club and country. But while he might not break the bank as such, Everton are playing hard ball with Branthwaite's valuation.",
      "It's said the Merseyside outfit are holding out for between £70million and £80million and signing over that cheque, regardless of his talent, might not be the smartest move. Yoro, meanwhile, is claimed to have Real Madrid no other on red alert - as the Branthwaite conundrum flags up an all-too-familiar mistake.",
      "United have been among the worst spenders in world football for at least a decade and, with INEOS on board and controlling transfers, the intention is to pay smart money and make better footballing and business decisions. They were stung in that regard 12 months ago when snapping-up Mason Mount from Chelsea.",
      "That is not to say Mount was not worth signing, nor would Branthwaite be. However, amid lingering FFP caution - which could yet be eased with further sales - spending a huge chunk of the budget on one marquee signing might restrict what else United can do in the market.",
      "INEOS will not want to spread themselves too thinly either by bringing in too many cheap options, but Tah fits the bill for a happy middle ground. He is coming off the back of a hugely impressive and successful season as part of an all-conquering Leverkusen side that earned rave reviews under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Tah was also a regular for Germany at Euro 2024 on home soil - partnering Antonio Rudiger in a back four - while a loophole with his contract has emerged to thrust his name on to the radar. With 12 months to run on his deal -just like Mount had - there are clubs taking note including United and the mighty Bayern Munich.",
      "Even taking 'the English tax' into consideration, United overpaid for Mount at a similar juncture. INEOS, though, will not let that happen with Tah representing an opportunity that should not be missed.",

      "Jeremie Frimpong has sent a message to Joshua Zirkzee after the forward completed his move to Manchester United over the weekend.",
      "The Red Devils unveiled the signing of Zirkzee from Bologna for a fee in the region of £35.8million, which will be paid over the course of three years. The 23-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford with the option of a further season. He scored 12 goals and provided seven assists in 37 matches last season.",
      "After his move was announced, Zirkzee posted a photo of himself on Instagram in the dressing room wearing a United jumper in front of a new shirt with the caption: \"An honor. Happy and proud to be part of this club. Can't wait to get started!\" followed with three red circle emojis.",
      "And Netherlands teammate Frimpong, who has himself been linked with a move to United this summer, decided to leave his well wishes in the comments section. He wrote: \"Joshyyyyyy,\" accompanied with two red love heart emojis. Zirkzee replied with a love heart emoji and a smiley face emoji.",
      "Frimpong enjoyed a fine season at Bayer Leverkusen, scoring 14 goals and assisting 12 times from right wing back. He helped Xabi Alonso's side win the Bundesliga title. Having impressed, Frimpong's future has come under question with a number of clubs across Europe tracking his progress ahead of a potential transfer.",

It's been reported that United could move for the Dutchman if Aaron Wan-Bissaka leaves.",
      "Frimpong could follow another Netherlands international, including Zirkzee, to Old Trafford with Matthijs de Ligt heavily linked with a switch across to Manchester. It's emerged that the 24-year-old has made it clear that he would be open to a move to United, having struggled for regular game time at Bayern Munich.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season schedule by losing 1-0 against Rosenborg.",
      "United have a huge and loyal following in Scandinavia and the Reds played in front of a sold-out Lerkendal Stadium, although the fans in attendance weren't treated to a goal-fest.",
      "That was largely down to Radek Vitek, who delivered a man-of-the-match performance in between the sticks for United to deny Rosenborg a more dominant win on home soil.",
      "The travelling squad at Erik ten Hag's disposal in Trondheim was youthful and just five senior players, Jonny Evans, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro, Mason Mount and Marcus Rashford, made the trip.",
      "Those five first-team players were substituted at half-time as wholesale changes were made, which saw Vitek keep his place and 10 youngsters come on.",
      "Vitek made a string of excellent saves throughout the match and will be hopeful of playing against Rangers this weekend. Here are the moments you might have missed...",
      "You could argue Marcus Rashford is currently like Marmite among United supporters: he splits opinion. The forward enjoyed the best campaign of his career in 2022/23 but spectacularly regressed last term and his off-field behaviour damaged his relationship with fans.",
      "Rashford, at least, ended the season with a positive showing in the FA Cup final and many believed missing out on the England squad would allow him to refocus this summer.",
      "There is a lot for Rashford to prove in the new campaign. He must deliver consistently strong displays again and perform to the level he's capable of, otherwise, the 2024/25 season could be his last representing his hometown club and the team he supported as a boy.",
      "There were times when Old Trafford's frustration with Rashford was audible last term, but that didn't stop the crowd in Norway giving his name the biggest cheer when it was announced. Rashford was the biggest 'star' on the pitch in Trondheim and must deliver performances worthy of star status going forward, or his future at the club will be in bigger doubt.",
      "When Hull City played Manchester City at the Etihad in December 2008, they embarrassingly trailed 4-0 after just 36 minutes and their furious manager, Phil Brown, famously made the unusual decision of giving his team talk on the pitch - not in the dressing room - at half-time.",
      "It's a moment in Premier League history that won't be forgotten, mostly because a Hull player subsequently reenacted the team talk in a goal celebration a year later.",
      "Ten Hag did his best impression of Phil Brown at the Lerkendal Stadium on Monday night, as he also decided to conduct his half-time team talk on the pitch during the break.",
      "The Dutchman was seen in deep communication with his players, although with it being a pre-season friendly, he wasn't feeling the emotions Brown once felt at the Etihad.",
      "Nonetheless, Ten Hag was strong in his analysis after the game and said: \"The result is not secondary. We play pre-season, but it's the standard at Manchester United to win games - definitely don't lose them. The performance is more important but it was below our standards.\"",
      "Maybe we'll see Ten Hag's team talk reenacted as a celebration at some stage this season after all.",
      "There was a bizarre quirk before the game when goalkeeper coach Jelle ten Rouwelaar emerged to take the warm-up without his official appointment having been announced. Ten Rouwelaar put the goalkeepers through their paces before kick-off and at 4:17pm, United officially communicated his appointment across their social media channels.",
      "The Dutchman has joined United as first-team goalkeeper coach and succeeds Richard Hartis, who departed this summer. Ten Rouwelaar has been Vincent Kompany's goalkeeping coach for the previous four years, first at Anderlecht and then at Burnley.",
      "He left Turf Moor at the end of his contract and signed a deal with Ajax before United showed an interest, which meant it took €100,000 in compensation to appoint him.",
      "Ten Rouwelaar will work with Andre Onana, Tom Heaton and Altay Bayindir at first-team level this season, but he'll coach Vitek during pre-season and the youngster can be immensely proud of the performance he delivered against Rosenborg on Monday evening.",
      "Vitek is an imposing goalkeeper and will be hopeful of receiving more opportunities in United's friendlies this summer before another departure on loan again.",
      "Interestingly, another Czech goalkeeper, Matej Kovar, impressed for United in pre-season last summer but he was sold to Bayer Leverkusen on a permanent deal. United banked £7.7million for Kovar, who was 23 years old when he left, but Vitek might have a better chance of breaking into the first-team squad in the future.",

      "The sale of Mason Greenwood this summer looks set to beat a post-Sir Alex Ferguson record for Manchester United with the forward on the verge of leaving Old Trafford.",
      "After being sent on loan to Getafe last season, Greenwood’s performances caught the eye, after he scored eight times and provided six assists in 33 La Liga performances. The Spanish side were keen to sign him on a permanent deal but were unwilling to match United’s asking price.",
      "That prompted interest from several other clubs, including Lazio and Marseille. And it seems like the latter are now closing in on a move for Greenwood with the Athletic reporting that an agreement has been reached with both United and the player over a transfer.",
      "The move was put into doubt following criticism from supporters and the mayor of Marseille. Greenwood was suspended in January 2022 after being arrested for attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviours and assault, but the case was dropped and all charged were withdrawn.",
      "If the transfer to Marseille is completed, then it will see United earn an initial €27.6 million (£23.3m) with the fee potentially rising to €31.6 million (£26.7m) with add-ons. The profit made, seeing as Greenwood is an academy graduate, will be the most made since the retirement of Ferguson in 2013.",
      "The sale will come as a boost to United in terms of the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs). Due to him being an academy player, money made will go down as pure profit in the books for the 2024/25 season.",
      "It comes just days after United confirmed the signing of striker Joshua Zirkzee, who completed a move from Bologna for €42.5 million (£35.8m) over the weekend. The Dutchman has signed a five-year deal at Old Trafford with the option of a sixth.",

      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Manchester United and Everton are seemingly worlds apart when it comes to striking up a transfer for defender Jarrad Branthwaite with two offers already being rejected for the England international. United are still weighing-up moves for up to three centre-backs this summer as part of a defensive overhaul.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro are the club's two other main targets after rubber-stamping a swoop for Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee which has accounted for £36.5million in their budget. Getting all three defenders over the line will, meanwhile, be dependant on moving parts including the need for player sales.",
      "Branthwaite, 22, is viewed as an ideal fit for the United rebuild and also worked with returning assistant manager Ruud van Nistelrooy during his successful loan spell with PSV Eindhoven in the 2022/2023 season. Here, we take a closer look at the latest headlines surrounding Branthwaite's future;",
      "Leny Yoro has agreed to sign for Manchester United this summer in a deal that is set to rise to €70million (£58.7m) after Lille accepted a bid of €62million (£52m) earlier this week. The 18-year-old is set to be United's second signing of the summer after Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee's arrival, and will likely be available to travel with United to Los Angeles for their pre-season tour next week.",
      "Yoro is set to be part of a majorly-revamped defensive line which will see United attempt to patch up the evident holes from last season with three new signings, of which Yoro is one. Everton have already rejected two bids for their centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite while United are on the precipice of signing Bayern Munich star Matthijs De Ligt.",
      "United have had two offers rejected for Branthwaite already this summer. But will it be third time lucky?",
      "The second bid was worth £45million to Everton plus £5million in add-ons. It came after United saw a £43million attempt turned down last month, while Manchester Evening News reported in May that Branthwaite is valued at between £70million and £80million by the Toffeers - which United argue is unrealistic.",
      "Previous deals for Harry Maguire to United (£80million), Wesley Fofana to Chelsea (£75million) and Josko Gvardiol to Manchester City (£77.6million) are viewed as justification for the price tag in Everton's eyes.",
      "Everton have played hard ball from the outset when it comes to Branthwaite and business elsewhere means they do not necessarily have to cash-in on the England international this summer. Amadou Onana is seemingly ready to leave for Aston Villa in an agreement that will generate around £50million for the Toffees.",
      "As such, they can continue to wait for a third, improved bid from United or ultimately hold firm.",
      "Ongoing reports from The Liverpool ECHO and national publications indicate that Everton do not want or need to sell Branthwaite this summer. The 22-year-old remains under contract until 2027 having put pen-to-paper on a new deal at Goodison Park midway through last season.",
      "The party line from Everton hints at business as usual. Branthwaite, who was overlooked for the England squad at Euro 2024 by now-departed national team manager Gareth Southgate this summer, is sharpening up his fitness as Everton head to Ireland to continue their pre-season preparations.",
      "Branthwaite boarded the short flight from John Lennon Airport on Monday morning. As such, no immediate move appears to be on the cards for him - despite United's ongoing interest.",

The Portuguese star joined Wolves in 2019 from Braga, following a loan spell at Lazio. However, before his move to Italy, United were believed to be closely monitoring the promising attacker.",
      "According to The Athletic, United identified Neto in early 2017 and even invited the then-teenager to Carrington. Despite impressing coaches and scouts during an academy game, it took too long for a contract to be sanctioned, it is claimed, leading Neto to sign a new deal with Braga before joining Lazio on a long-term loan.",
      "He later moved to Wolves in 2019 and made his senior international debut a year later. The hesitation is consistent with claims from former club scouts, who say they discovered talents, only for the club to not act quickly enough to tie them down.",
      "The Red Devils were also said to have identified current Bayern Munich and Germany star Jamal Musial and Moises Caicedo, now of Chelsea, early in their development.

      "\"In terms of the scouting, the structure and system we had - look at [Alejandro] Garnacho - was good. The reports were there, the process was there. We were just being let down at the end of it.",

      "It's been a turbulent week for Manchester United Women but the arrival of Dan Ashworth could be exactly what they need to get back on track",
      "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info",
      "Though Mary Earps' Manchester United goodbye message totaled 370 words, perhaps the biggest factor behind her decision to leave the club can be gleaned from just one: 'Transition'.",
      "Those 10 measly characters, deployed by Earps to describe the current state of play at Leigh Sports Village, rather concisely explain why one of the game's biggest stars feels the best thing for her career is to seek pastures new this summer. The 31-year-old's departure did not, admittedly, come as much of a surprise.",
      "Hers is an exit almost 12 months in the making, the portent of which can be traced back to Arsenal's failed world-record bid for her services last September. Still, though, in conjunction with a number of other happenings at United over the past few weeks, confirmation of Earps' leaving has been viewed in some quarters as an ominous indicator of the Reds' direction of travel.",
      "\"It's a decision l've gone backwards and forwards on for some time, and is not one I've made lightly,\" the England No. 1 wrote on social media on Saturday. \"The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don't feel it aligns with the timing of where I'm at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.\"",
      "That new challenge is set to take Earps to the French capital, where she will become the highest-paid women's goalkeeper in the world for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). It is understood, however, United's offer of a new deal matched Earps' expectations and therefore her decision to leave the club is rooted not in finances but in a desire to be successful on the pitch.",
      "Clearly, the shot-stopper remains unconvinced about the Reds' ability to yield such success in the near future. Despite winning the Women's FA Cup - the club's first major piece of women's silverware - last term, it's hard to argue with the fact that United's performances in 2023/24 left much to be desired.",
      "Marc Skinner's side finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL), winning just 10 of their 22 league games and registering a points tally 21 points lower than the one recorded in the previous campaign. A 6-0 defeat to champions Chelsea at Old Trafford on the final day was a crushing nadir for a team who had taken the title race to the final day only 12 months earlier, and the travelling support took great pleasure in making Earps the chief subject of their derision, regularly taunting her with chants of 'Mary, what's the score?'",
      "There is an argument, though, that United's malaise on the field is a symptom of the pervasive uncertainty off it. It has been a turbulent year for the Reds, who came under fire last summer for letting star duo Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo depart on free transfers, with the latter joining WSL rivals Arsenal.",
      "Then there was the Mason Greenwood debacle, which opened a number of female players up to online abuse on the eve of decisive Women's World Cup games. Couple this with the departure of numerous backroom staff, including highly-rated assistant manager Martin Ho and head of women's football Polly Bancroft, and it is easy to see why some players may feel United is, at present, a club in flux.",
      "Those feelings have only intensified since the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe in February. The INEOS chief caused a stir when he opted not to attend the Women's FA Cup final in May, instead making an appearance at Old Trafford for what was, for the hosts, something of a dead-rubber Premier League clash with Arsenal.",
      "Days later came confirmation of a new contract for manager Skinner - a decision that was not particularly well-received by the United fanbase, in spite of the FA Cup triumph. And then there was last week, when it seemed as if every day brought with it a new PR fire for the Reds to put out.",
      "First, there was Ratcliffe's tone-deaf interview with Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\". Next came the revelation that Skinner's side are set to be ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp - and that's before you consider the exodus of first-team stars, including Earps and club captain Katie Zelem.",
      "Cue the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United; a dangerous cocktail of bad news that does not inspire much hope of positive change at the club.",
      "Still, amidst all the negativity, there are green shoots of optimism. According to BBC Sport, United are closing in on deals to sign Brighton & Hove Albion forward Elisabeth Terland and former Arsenal defender Dominique Janssen.",
      "The duo are at opposite ends of the experience spectrum but could both have a hugely positive impact at Leigh Sports Village. Terland scored 13 goals in the WSL last term, with only Manchester City's Khadija Shaw finding the back of the net more frequently than the 23-year-old.",
      "Janssen, meanwhile, has won two league titles and starred in two Champions League finals for German side Wolfsburg, having previously won the WSL with the Gunners. United are also expected to trigger the option-to-buy clause in the loan agreement of highly-rated Lyon forward, Melvine Malard.",
      "With midfielder Grace Clinton set to return to Manchester following a hugely successful loan spell at Tottenham Hotspur and the likes of Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa expected to play a bigger role following their respective returns to full fitness, the Reds look to have have the makings of a strong squad.",
      "Perhaps one of the most heartening developments for the women's team, though, came on Monday morning, when it emerged sporting director Dan Ashworth is free to begin work at United after breakthrough talks with former club Newcastle. The two clubs have come to an agreement over compensation after an acrimonious four months of talks, avoiding the need for an arbitration hearing to settle the matter.",
      "While Ashworth's priority will almost certainly be changing the fortunes of Erik Ten Hag's side, the 53-year-old has long been an advocate for investing in women's football and could be the spark United require to reignite their commitment to Skinner and his players. Speaking to the Guardian in 2022, Ashworth outlined the club's vision for Newcastle Women, who were, at the time, plying their trade in the fourth tier.",
      "\"(The women's team) is absolutely a priority for the owners,” he said. “Already, they’ve gone from a team where the players had to pay to play last year to being professionalised. We will do everything we can to give them the support to get to the WSL as quickly as possible.”",
      "His comments were reminiscent of a similar statement he made during his time as technical director of Brighton & Hove Albion. “The aim now is to get a foothold in the top division, being a new club and new women’s programme compared to some of the teams in that division,\" Ashworth told club media back in 2019.",
      "“We aim to do that by maximising our resources, trying to recruit cleverly, coach well and get the results to keep us in the division. It comes back to the club’s long-term vision, which is to make us a top four women’s team. It will take time, effort and investment to do that, but we’re on the right lines to do it.”",
      "By joining United, Ashworth is joining a club with significantly more resources than Brighton and with a bigger global brand than Newcastle. If he is able to lend some of his expertise to Skinner's side, there is a chance the Reds could soon find themselves back on the right path and their period of transition might just lead them into a brighter new era.",

      "Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the signing of England goalkeeper Mary Earps on a free transfer.",
      "The 31-year-old joins the French giants following the expiry of her Manchester United contract, having turned down the chance to sign a new deal at Leigh Sports Village. She is set to become the highest-paid women's goalkeeper in the world at PSG and has signed a two-year contract that will keep her at the club until the summer of 2026.",
      "\"I'm very honoured to become a Parisian and I can't wait to play alongside my new team-mates,\" Earps said. \"Together, we're going to give our all to help the club shine and make our fans proud.",
      "\"I'm determined to contribute to our future success so that Paris St-Germain continues to rank among Europe's top clubs.\"",
      "PSG finished second in Division 1 Féminine last term and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League while United finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL) and won the Women's FA Cup.",
      "Earps, who has twice been named the FIFA Best Goalkeeper, joins a number of high-profile players leaving United on free transfers in this summer. Last week, the club confirmed captain Katie Zelem and forward Lucia Garcia were also set to leave Manchester following the expiration of their contracts.",
      "Reflecting on her decision to leave United in a social media post on Saturday, Earps said: \"It's a decision I've gone backwards and forwards on for some time, and is not one I've made lightly. The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don't feel it aligns with the timing of where I'm at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.",
      "\"There aren't the right words, or enough words, to express my heartfelt gratitude to you all, but I hope the below comes somewhere close.\"",
