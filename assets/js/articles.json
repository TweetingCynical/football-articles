      "Several Manchester United players reportedly advised Alejandro Garnacho to change his attitude at the club before his move to Chelsea. The 21-year-old, who completed his £40million transfer to Stamford Bridge in the summer, is set to return to Old Trafford when United face Chelsea in the Premier League.",
      "His three-year spell in Manchester was filled with controversy - outlined by disputes with both Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim. His most public disagreement with Amorim came after he reacted angrily to being named on the bench during the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Amorim was displeased with his reaction, leading to Garnacho spending pre-season training away from United's first-team. He subsequently signed a lucrative seven-year contract at Chelsea, with the Reds securing a 10 per cent sell-on clause. While his talent is rarely questioned, doubts remain about his mentality.",
      "The Sun reports that during his fallout with Amorim, several senior players, including Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, and Harry Maguire, tried to persuade him to focus more on the team rather than just himself, reports The Express. However, Garnacho seemed to ignore his team-mates' advice, leading Amorim to conclude that he was creating a negative atmosphere in the dressing room.",
      "The former Sporting Clube de Portugal head coach was reportedly irritated by his frequent social media posts and comments in the mainstream media. Like the rest of the United team, Amorim was, initially, eager to work with the winger when he took over at the helm in November.",
      "However, after observing Garnacho's behaviour in Plzen in December, his attitude shifted. The Portuguese manager also grew weary of Garnacho's attitude when things didn't go his way. In the end, a separation was inevitable while sources close to Amorim have disclosed he has never regretted his decision.",

      "Manchester United legend Bryan Robson believes the club should give Ruben Amorim three years to impart his vision on the Red Devils. Amorim, 40, arrived at the club in November but already appears to be under pressure.",
      "The Portuguese manager had a reputation for being one of the brightest young managers in Europe when he replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag. However, his time at the club has only bought eight Premier League victories in 31 matches, in which three were against relegated Leicester City, Southampton and Ipswich Town.",
      "United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe recently flew into Manchester to inform Amorim he needs to qualify for European football if he wants to hold onto his job. Despite the poor results under his reign, Robson, who won two Premier League titles while playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, believes Amorim needs three years to succeed at the club.",
      "Speaking to the Telegraph, Robson said: \"We have changed managers that many times (since 2013), I feel you have to stick and say, 'No, we are not sacking the manager. We are not blaming.’",
      "\"When you have a little bit of money and the club are going to allow you to change your squad, you need three years to get the team right. For me three years at Manchester United should be enough.",
      "\"Look at the money we spend. It's up to you to go around the world and get top players who are going to improve you.”",
      "Since Ferguson left the club, the manager who enjoyed the longest reign was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who oversaw the Red Devils from December 2018 to November 2021. Amorim has only overseen 31 Premier League matches but has already lost 16 matches.",
      "Their 3-0 away defeat to Manchester City was also damning, as Pep Guardiola's side were far from their best. United spent big money this season bringing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens to the club for more than £200m.",
      "Only Mbeumo has found the net for the new United attackers, who are yet to find their feet on the red side of Manchester. While many issues have been dumped at the manager's door, Robson also believes too many of their signings have not been ready to compete in the Premier League.",
      "The former midfielder added: \"The other thing I think we went away from is getting good experienced Premier League players. So when they get to 28, you bring them on board if you can.",
      "\"There have been loads of players who have left clubs. I think five years ago, some of the players we bought were just not good enough to be Manchester United players.",
      "\"It's an accumulation of that. When I was in management, I believed that if you bought average players you got an average team.\"",
      "United play host to Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday, September 21, in a game which could leave the Reds' hopes of European football in danger.",

      "Wayne Rooney has been taunted by his wife Coleen after he admitted to locking her out of their old home for putting up a Liverpool flag. Coleen is a firm supporter of the reigning Premier League champions, and Rooney grew up an Everton fan before becoming a Manchester United legend.",
      "The Rooney household is divided when the Merseyside derby rolls around, with both the Blue and Red halves of Liverpool represented. England icon Wayne played in the fierce occasion over two spells with the Toffees, and often clashed with Liverpool during his record-breaking years with United.",
      "On the other hand, Coleen has allegiances that lie with Arne Slot's side, and the two lightheartedly butted heads when Liverpool won the title five years ago.",
      "After Rooney revealed that he locked Coleen out of their home after she put up a flag celebrating the Reds and Jurgen Klopp's 2019/20 title success, she took to social media to continue taunting her other half.",
      "Speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show in the build-up to the Merseyside derby, Rooney shed some light on an incident that occurred in 2020.",
      "\"When they won the Premier League a few years ago, I actually came home, I was playing for Derby at the time, I've come home and Coleen has got Liverpool flags put up outside the house,\" he said.",
      "\"It was our old house, so outside the front door, there was a little balcony thing, and the flag was outside the window there. So I told her to go and get it down!",
      "\"So we went up, and you actually had to climb out the window to get it down. She went up, so I locked her out. Not too long, but she was stuck on the balcony!\"",
      "A clip of Rooney's story was uploaded to social media platform X, and Coleen showed her humorous character as she took the opportunity to rub salt into her husband's wounds by reposting the video with a picture of the flag in question.",
      "With masking tape in hand, Coleen can be seen securing a flag to the house's front balcony that read \"League champions 2019/20\" with pictures of manager Klopp and the Liverpool cohort. The 39-year-old captioned the post with a host of laughing emojis.",
      "Rooney added that playing against Liverpool was always a heated affair, and he reiterated that he would often want to \"smash\" Reds legend Steven Gerrard any time they did battle.",
      "\"We were good mates off the pitch and whenever I got a chance I'm thinking, 'I'm going to absolutely smash you,' and I did. He did the same to me,\" Rooney added.",
      "\"You wouldn't talk to him before the game and then after the game you shake each other's hand. If there was ever a chance he knew [I'd challenge him].",
      "\"I knew if he got a chance he was going to do me, so that's what football is. You're playing for your club and there's moments and big players as well, especially a Gerrard or a [Patrick] Vieira. If you get an opportunity, you can't let that slip, you've got to take it.\"",

      "United brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day for £18.2million, including add-ons, but the 23 year old was named among the substitutes for the Manchester derby.",
      "United permitted Onana to move to Trabzonspor on a season-long loan deal earlier this month, leaving them without an established first-choice goalkeeper.",
      "\"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",

      "Summer acquisition Benjamin Sesko remains without a goal for United following five appearances.",
      "Sesko was handed his first league start in the 3-0 defeat at City after drawing a blank in two outings for Slovenia during their World Cup qualifiers this month. The 22 year old was the 10th outfield player to step up for a penalty in the 12-11 shootout loss to Grimsby Town in the League Cup second round, despite battling cramp at the end of 90 minutes.",
      "Sesko revealed during the international break that he required time at United. The former RB Leipzig forward is three months younger than his predecessor, Rasmus Hojlund, who netted three goals in his final 35 outings for United before joining Napoli on loan.",
      "United have registered the most shots at goal in the Premier League this season, have struck the woodwork more frequently than any other side and Bruno Fernandes has crafted more opportunities than any other player.",
      "Amorim admitted that Sesko was too cut off in the derby. \"I think, if you remember Arsenal, I think we missed a lot. Burnley, I think we missed a lot. Fulham in the beginning, I think we missed a lot. We have four games and I said three.",
      "\"And then there is the thing that you say is not a big opportunity. The first play (against City), Amad has the ball between the lines. It's four against three and we put the ball out. It's not a big opportunity. It should be. So all these things.",
      "\"But if you ask me, against City, Sesko looks like he's alone in the box, I agree. He was always alone. So the guys were around, near the box. But in the final third, we get there many times.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"But I also said that, I think, in the end of the game. When I look at the box, Ben was alone. We cannot score in that way. So I think it's not the same team in that department compared to last year.",
      "\"He's at a different club. He's taking it all in and he's a professional. So you can feel that. He wants everything for tomorrow and we have to balance that.",
      "\"But he's doing the job. And again, guys, we can talk about all the things here. The system: if one ball goes inside the box, we win one game and two, this will change.",
      "\"The important thing is that last year, I said to you, I think I was really clear: we cannot play well. We cannot create chances. This year is completely different. We can avoid all the goals that we are suffering. Yes, it's our fault. So let's work on that and try next week and next week and next week.\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has confessed there are moments when he longs to be back in the Manchester United dugout. The iconic boss stepped down 12 years ago, yet his desire to help steer the club remains.",
      "Ferguson secured 13 Premier League crowns, five FA Cups and celebrated two Champions League victories, among other trophies, throughout his remarkable 26-year reign at Old Trafford. In 2013, he guided United to their 20th league title before drawing the curtain on his illustrious career.",
      "It's likely that Ferguson would have always experienced moments when he yearned to stay involved at United. However, the club's issues under Ruben Amorim and his predecessors in the post-Ferguson years can only have fuelled the Scotsman's occasional longing to be in charge of the Red Devils.",
      "\"People don't seem to realise, I've been retired 12 years, you know,\" Ferguson told the BBC when questioned whether he was ever enticed to return to football management.",
      "\"I picked the right time - I thought, at the time. Sometimes you watch the games and you think, 'I wish I was back in there for five minutes.' You know what I mean, but it is what it is.\"",
      "He continued: \"I had a great career. I was a manager for 39 years. From 32 years of age to 71.\"",
      "Ferguson claimed an extraordinary 28 major honours, excluding the Community Shield, during his spell at United. The club has found it challenging to replicate the success achieved under Ferguson, with Amorim being the sixth permanent manager since the legendary Scot's retirement.",
      "Amorim nearly clinched the Europa League title in his early days at the helm, only to be defeated by Tottenham Hotspur in the final. The Red Devils had previously lifted the trophy under Jose Mourinho in 2017 and were runners-up four years later under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, losing to Villarreal in a penalty shootout.",
      "However, even if Amorim had won the Europa League and secured a Champions League spot, it wouldn't have disguised United's poor league performance. The team ended up 15th in the table, their worst position since returning to the top-flight in 1975.",
      "Despite splashing out over £200million in the summer transfer window to bolster the squad, United have failed to live up to expectations this season. They've managed to scrape together just four points from four league matches and suffered an embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "While Sir Alex might wish he could still influence United's fortunes from the dugout, the 83-year-old now has a new focus. He serves as an ambassador for the Playlist for Life charity, promoting the benefits of familiar music for people living with dementia—a cause close to his heart.",
      "\"I have a situation myself, with my brother [Martin],\" he explained to BBC Sport. \"It's not easy. I have to be in touch with him a lot. He recognises me [but] the memory's not great.",

      "The young Belgian is also being gradually introduced to the team, with Altay Bayindir remaining the first choice despite his shaky form this season. With United lagging behind their rivals, Maguire conceded it might take some time before fans see the best of Sesko, Lammens and the rest of United's new signings.",

      "\"I've been really impressed with him in training. His finishing is excellent. I believe he is going to score goals for this club for many years.\"",
      "He then turned his attention to Lammens, who has similarly caught his eye during training sessions. Yet he swiftly began discussing the keeper's tender years, saying: \"I've been so impressed with him in training.",

      "Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs is plotting a return to management after stepping down as director of football at Salford City. The 51-year-old had been part of the backroom staff at the EFL side.",
      "He often got himself back into a tracksuit and stood alongside Ammie's boss, Karl Robinson. From a management point of view, Giggs has not been on a touchline since October 14, 2020, when his Wales side overcame Bulgaria 1-0 in the Nations League.",
      "Giggs successfully guided Wales to Euro 2020 but could not manage his country in the competition. He stepped aside in November, after being arrested on suspicion of assault, before officially resigning from the role in the summer of 2022.",
      "With Euro 2020 being delayed by a year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Giggs was not able to manage his side in the tournament.",
      "Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on the assault charges and charges of coercive and controlling behaviour. A retrial was subsequently abandoned when his former partner, Kate Greville, the alleged victim, refused to testify.",
      "Giggs was succeeded by Robert Page, who led Wales to the knockout stages of Euro 2020, only to be defeated 4-0 by Denmark in the round of 16. Page also took Wales to the World Cup, where they failed to progress from a group featuring England, the USA and Iran.",
      "A matter of years after he had to walk away from Wales, the Sun reports Giggs will no longer be involved with Salford, a club he once held a stake in until a consortium led by David Beckham and Gary Neville bought him out in May. The report goes on to claim that the former winger is keen to get back into management.",
      "In January, Giggs confessed to BBC Radio Manchester he was relishing his role at Salford but was also eyeing a return to the dugout.",

      "\"But eventually I would like to get back into management. On matchday I still get as excited as ever, probably more so than ever.\"",
      "Giggs donned the Welsh jersey 64 times during his career, netting 12 goals. His only other managerial experience was a brief spell at United, stepping in for four matches when David Moyes was dismissed.",
      "He led the team to victories over Hull City and Norwich City but suffered defeat against Sunderland and managed a 1-1 draw with Southampton. He then served two seasons as Louis van Gaal's right-hand man at Old Trafford before leaving the club in 2016 when the Dutchman was dismissed.",
      "As a player, he clinched 13 Premier League titles under Sir Alex Ferguson, as well as two Champions League titles, four FA Cups and four League Cups.",

      "Manchester United legend Edwin van der Sar has revealed details about the brain haemorrhage he suffered in 2023. The Dutchman admits he is now embracing a more tranquil life, and insists he wasn't afraid he would die.",
      "Van der Sar joined Old Trafford during the summer of 2005, following an impressive stint with newly-promoted Fulham. A reported £2million fee secured his signature.",
      "The Dutch shot-stopper instantly became Sir Alex Ferguson's number one and delivered exceptional performances. He guarded the goal for the Red Devils until 2011, racking up more than 250 appearances. He claimed four Premier League crowns and one Champions League trophy with United.",
      "Following his retirement 14 years ago, Van der Sar made a fleeting one-game comeback for his childhood team, VV Noordwijk, in 2016 and remained involved in football, latterly serving as an executive at Ajax. However, in July 2023, he was rushed to intensive care in Croatia following a brain haemorrhage and remained hospitalised for a fortnight.",

      "It was in the Netherlands with Ajax that Van der Sar embarked upon his footballing journey, after being recruited to their reserve side by former United head coach Louis van Gaal. He claimed Dutch Football Goalkeeper of the Year in his debut full season in Amsterdam, and following years of loyalty, found himself linked with a transfer abroad.",
      "However, circumstances could have unfolded quite differently for Van der Sar. He acknowledges that Liverpool were amongst the possibilities he had when he departed Ajax in 1999, but he instead opted for Juventus.",
      "\"I had two options: Liverpool or Juventus. I spoke to both clubs, but my heart led me to Italy,\" continued Van der Sar, who featured 88 times for the Old Lady before transferring to Fulham and then United.",
      "\"Serie A was the best league in those years. I was intrigued by the idea of playing for a team where a legendary goalkeeper like [Dino] Zoff had made his mark. Do I regret it? No. I didn't play my best football, but criticism is part of the game. It was still a wonderful experience to live and play in Italy.",
      "\"The summer I arrived, my team-mates would always take me out for dinner. The food in Turin's restaurants was fantastic: at the end of the evening, I'd get my credit card ready, but I never paid.\"",

      "Under-pressure Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has a chance to relieve some pressure this weekend as he leads his team out against Chelsea in the Premier League. United sit just outside the relegation places with just four points from four games, while their opponents remain unbeaten in the league.",
      "Amorim's side will take some heart from the fact that Enzo Maresca's men lost in Europe during the week. The Blues couldn't get the measure of Bayern Munich, who won 3-1 at the Allianz Arena after a Harry Kane brace.",
      "Last season, the Old Trafford meeting between the team was played after Amorim's appointment but before he took charge. Ruud van Nistelrooy was in the dugout, with Bruno Fernandes putting United in front before Moises Caicedo equalised.",
      "There were no first-half goals in that fixture, and the same applied to the reverse game. On that occasion, Marc Cucurella scored the only goal of the game just five days before Amorim's United lost the Europa League final in Bilbao.",
      "If United are able to win, it would be their first victory over Chelsea since Scott McTominay scored both goals in a 2023 win. Here's how you can take in all the action from Old Trafford.",
      "Mancheser United and Chelsea will kick off on Saturday at 5.30pm UK time. United won their last home game, though they needed a last-gasp penalty from Bruno Fernandes to see off Burnley, while Chelsea's last away game ended all square at Brentford.",

      "The departure of Marcus Rashford from Manchester United has been felt deeply, especially after the Barcelona president disclosed that the winger had hoped to retire at Old Trafford. Rashford, an England international and product of United's youth system, left his childhood club this summer for a second consecutive transfer window, joining Barcelona on loan until the end of the season.",
      "The 27-year-old last donned the Red Devils' shirt in December 2024 before being dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby later that month, leading to his exclusion from the first team.",
      "A brief stint at Aston Villa followed, where he showed glimpses of his old form. However, despite returning to Manchester in the summer, manager Amorim remained firm in his decision not to include him in future plans.",
      "In July, the chance to join Barcelona presented itself, with president Joan Laporta expressing his delight at securing Rashford's signature. \"We are very happy because a player of great quality is coming, at a great age to come to Barca with extraordinary motivation,\" Laporta said, as reported by Goal.com.",
      "While praising Rashford's talent, Laporta revealed that the new recruit had dreamt of spending his entire career at United. He added: \"Personally, I've seen how excited he is to come to Barca. One of his virtues is that he is sincere.",
      "\"His dream was to play for Manchester United for the rest of his life. He arrived at the age of seven and was born there. He wanted to be a 'one-club man'. It's nice for a player to say this with all sincerity.\"",
      "Rashford's choice to depart United was undoubtedly devastating for him, but he recognised it was absolutely crucial to revive his career at the highest level.",
      "Whilst he went on to feature in 426 matches for the Red Devils, netting 138 times and providing 60 assists, it remained uncertain whether he'd ever turn out for the club again under Amorim's leadership.",
      "The Portuguese manager may have been resolute in his view that Rashford wasn't a player who would propel his team forward, but it could prove a choice he comes to rue, particularly following his European exploits. Rashford found the net twice in Barcelona's 2-1 triumph over Newcastle on Thursday.",
      "His opening strike, which got him off the mark for the La Liga giants, came via a header in the 58th minute before he unleashed a thunderous effort from distance beyond Nick Pope to extend his team's advantage at St James' Park.",
      "Anthony Gordon netted late on, but it proved merely a consolation with Rashford's double representing his first goals in Europe's elite tournament since October 2021. It was back in 2020 when the England international confessed his desire to only ever play for Man United. \"For me, I never look beyond Manchester United,\" the then-23 year-old Rashford said.",
      "\"As a kid, I've never looked beyond Manchester United. In my mind, it wouldn't sit right for me to be pulling on another shirt. I just want to do the best I can for the club whilst I'm here, so hopefully I'm here for the long-term.\"",
      "Following the triumph against Newcastle, Rashford appeared to rule out any prospect of a United return, declaring: \"I want to stay as long as possible at Barcelona.",
      "\"I have to focus on doing my job, helping the team in any way I can. I can feel the confidence that Flick has given me. I knew he was great before I signed, but working with him is a real pleasure.\"",

      "Juan Sebastian Veron admits his serious regrets over switching from Manchester United to Chelsea, blaming injuries as his main problem at Stamford Bridge. Numerous footballers have moved from one club to another within the same league, but few have managed such transfers in the Premier League, given the enormous backlash they would encounter.",
      "A recent case would be Alejandro Garnacho, who abandoned his declining role at United to join the Blues this summer. Whilst it appears the Argentinian winger is content with his controversial switch thus far, Veron serves as a prime example of the age-old quote that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.",
      "The midfielder moved to Stamford Bridge in 2003 following merely two seasons at Old Trafford - where the teams will clash later today (September 20). The now-50-year-old arrived at the Premier League powerhouse for a British transfer record fee of £28.1million in 2001, scoring 11 goals across 82 matches and claiming one league title.",
      "Discussing the signing of Veron at the time, Sir Alex Ferguson said: \"I never thought I'd spend this much money on a footballer. I think he's coming into great years of his career and he will peak and we'll get the benefit of that. He is a world-class, fantastic footballer with a vision of a game we can use.\"",
      "However, Veron departed Manchester after a mere 24 months and became one of Roman Abramovich's initial signings as Chelsea's owner. The Blues signed him for £15m, resulting in Ferguson suffering a loss of roughly £13m from their original transfer.",
      "Despite the seemingly sunny prospects in west London, Veron confesses that the move was one of his greatest regrets. Speaking in 2019, the Argentine said: \"At Chelsea, the reality is that I had very little time. I had a major back injury and I was out for practically six months.",
      "\"I was already thinking more about going back to Italy than staying there in England.\"",
      "With only 14 appearances and a single goal to his name, Veron was loaned out to Inter Milan and Club Estudiantes de La Plata before taking a year-long career break. He remained at La Plata following this brief hiatus until his retirement in 2017.",
      "Reflecting on his regret over leaving United, Veron added: \"With United, the truth is that there are few things, very few, that I regret. But one is to have left Manchester.",
      "\"They never pushed me or told me 'you have to go', but they gave me the chance, the possibility.",
      "\"I had talks with my former colleagues at that time telling me that I had to stay. And at one moment I decided to leave because I wanted to play, because I didn't know... I should have stayed.\"",
      "Now, another Argentinian has followed in Veron's footsteps in swapping red for blue, but Garnacho will be hoping that he will have more luck as a Chelsea player than the ex-midfielder.",
      "The former Red Devil is set to face his old club on Saturday evening in the Premier League, with a 5:45pm kick-off at Old Trafford.",

      "Amorim maintained after that defeat that he had no intention of abandoning his principles. He has averaged just one point per game across this season and last, though, and questions are being asked of the Portuguese.",
      "This weekend will also provide an opportunity for one of United's former stars to haunt his old employers. Alejandro Garnacho has shown promise in a couple of substitute appearances for Chelsea following a summer move, and manager Enzo Maresca confirmed the winger is in contention to start.",
      "Saturday's game is one of three between now and the October international break which could help shape United's season. They travel to Brentford on September 27, and will welcome Sunderland to Old Trafford seven days after that.",

      "Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are both in contention to take to the field against Chelsea on Saturday after missing the Manchester derby. Both picked up injuries in the victory over Burnley, but the setbacks aren't as serious as some feared - though others are still missing.",
      "\"[Diogo] Dalot is out, Mount and Cunha are in the squad,\" Amorim told reporters at his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"[Lisandro] Martinez is still out. I think that is it.",
      "The only other absentee is Tyrell Malacia, who remains on United's books after failing to secure a summer move away. \"Tyrell Malacia is returning to contact with team-mates and the ball in the U21s then we'll see,\" the manager added.",
      "You have to go back to the 1992-93 Premier League season to find the last time Manchester United had as few points as they do now. The slow start has left pundits speculating about Ruben Amorim's future, and former England striker Alan Shearer has suggested defeat this weekend could be the final straw.",
      "\"I don't think they can afford to be beaten [like they were against Manchester City] again this weekend,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"If they were then you'd have to fear for what's going to happen going forward for the manager. Something must improve rapidly. Man United can't be lingering in 14th/15th/16th in the Premier League.",

      "“So I'm trying just to balance the team and trying to imagine the game, and we'll try to put the best starting line-up there.",
      "“But I see Bruno well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further forward, but he has a job to do.",
      "“And the important thing is not Bruno playing well. It's the team playing well and winning football games - and he can play in different positions.”",
      "United, who finished 15th last season, have just four points from as many games this season to stand 14th in the table, and have already been dumped out of the EFL Cup by League Two Grimsby.",
      "Asked why United have continued to struggle this season, despite a summer spend of £236million and a full pre-season under him, Amorim said: ”I think it's everything. It's belief. It's confidence. It's aggression. It's everything. “And sometimes, what we call luck is the way you can play the game with more belief. Liverpool are winning all the games. It's something about the teams that are winning that something is going to happen, to have that feeling.",
      "“Sometimes, with us, I feel the opposite. We're playing well, but something is going to go wrong in some moments.",
      "“So we need to change that, but it's just with wins. But, if you look at the goals against City, Fulham, all these moments, we scored against Burnley.",
      "“We are good in the game and then we take a draw [or lose]. All these moments, I think we can do better. It's our fault. So we work on that during the week to improve for the next game.”",
      "Altay Bayindir started in goal for United's 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City last weekend, ahead of new signing Senne Lammens. But Amorim has warned both goalkeepers they will have to fight it out for the No.1 spot this season.",
      "“Nobody has a place that is his place,” said Amorim. “Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what the best option is to win the next game.",
      "“At the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We're just trying to win games, trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.",
      "“The opponents don't have the same amount of opportunities as last season. But in the end, if you don't win, it doesn't matter. So I think it's something mental and we need to change.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United, who finished 15th last season, their lowest place for 51 years, have just four points from as many games this term and have already been dumped out of the EFL Cup by League Two Grimsby.",

      "“No, no, no,” said Amorim. “No-one, not even the Pope will change [me]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that, but I will change the system [at some point].",
      "“There will be an evolution, but we need to make all the good steps. If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure, it doesn't matter if he's all around the world, is saying, you need to change the system, and I change, at this moment, they will look at me in a different way.",
      "“So, everything, when you think about the impact that any decision is going to have on the team, everything is important. So, I will say the same thing. This will have an evolution.",

      "While Ruben Amorim is under increasing pressure at Manchester United, two potential replacements for the head coach have been denied as being considered. Suggestions have been made that club legend Michael Carrick was being sounded out as a possible short-term replacement for Amorim in case of a mid-season shake-up.",
      "There were also whispers of Jose Mourinho making a potential return to the north west prior to his appointment at Benfica this week. Amorim has failed to make much of a mark since arriving at Old Trafford last November.",
      "While a 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season may have been a major cause for concern, the 40-year-old was excused as a result of working with a squad he largely inherited from Erik ten Hag.",
      "But new acquisitions seemingly haven't provided a remedy for poor form, given that Amorim has managed just one win from his opening four fixtures, as well as an embarrassing exit from the Carabao Cup at the hands of Grimsby Town, who play in League Two.",
      "While many fans of the Red Devils will be growing tired of their side's struggles, given just how prolific they were during Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary trophy-laden tenure, the board hasn't given up on their head coach just yet. That's despite rumours that the club have been showing an interest in other managers as of late.",
      "It was suggested that Carrick had been contacted about the possibility of having to replace Amorim in the event of a mid-season sacking, while other rumours claimed that Mourinho was also considered for a return to Old Trafford. However, according to talkSPORT, insiders at the club have firmly denied these two suggestions.",
      "Carrick, who briefly took over as caretaker manager following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's departure in 2021, later spent three years with Middlesbrough in the Championship. He has been without a job since June, after being let go by Boro following a disappointing 10th-place finish in the league.",
      "Mourinho, on the other hand, was in charge of United from May 2016 to December 2018, during which time he won a League Cup, a Community Shield and a Europa League title. Since leaving Old Trafford, he has had stints with Spurs, Roma and Fenerbahce, and was appointed as Benfica's new head coach this week after Bruno Lage was sacked.",
      "Despite the United dressing room largely supporting Amorim, talkSPORT add that senior players like Harry Maguire have reportedly voiced their concerns about the team's underperformance in league and cup competitions this season.",
      "This level of self-criticism within the United camp might be a breath of fresh air for many fans.",
      "United are gearing up to return to Premier League action on Saturday, when they welcome an undefeated Chelsea to Old Trafford. With challenging matches against Liverpool and Brighton also on the horizon in their next five games, it could be a particularly gruelling Autumn for Amorim.",

The Portuguese coach hasn't had the smoothest start at Old Trafford, leading United to a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season after taking over from Erik ten Hag.",
      "Adding salt to the wound, United also failed to clinch the Europa League trophy, which would have guaranteed their spot in this season's Champions League, making their narrow 1-0 loss to Tottenham in May's final even more bitter.",
      "Despite receiving the board's support and a full pre-season tour to ready his squad for the new season, Amorim's poor form has continued into 2025/26.",
      "The 40-year-old has only managed one victory in the first four matches, coupled with an embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town last month.",
      "While the board have assured that they're not considering sacking Amorim just yet, it is reported that he has been given a clear directive by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "According to talkSPORT, the United co-owner visited Carrington on Thursday and told Amorim that performances on the pitch need to improve.",
      "Ratcliffe reportedly believes that Amorim's current squad has the potential to secure a top-five finish this season, even though Champions League football isn't an explicit goal for 2025/26.",
      "However, it's understood that Amorim has been tasked with securing some form of European competition by the end of the season.",
      "During Friday's pre-match press conference, he quipped: \"He offered me a new contract. No, it was normal things just to show the support, explain it's a long season.",
      "\"This is a club with more pressure maybe than any in the world. Last year I was very critical of the way we played. Now I think we are playing well until the [penalty] boxes. We need to be more clinical. We are in a better place compared to last year but we need to win.\"",
      "United are heading into Saturday's showdown with Chelsea at Old Trafford on an inconsistent run of form. The club suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on the Premier League's opening weekend, before managing a 1-1 draw with Fulham the following week.",
      "Amorim seemed to have hit his stride with a 3-2 win over Burnley before the international break, only to suffer a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium at the weekend, where Phil Foden and Erling Haaland shone. The task ahead is daunting as United prepare to host Chelsea, who have been in impressive form under Enzo Maresca this season, remaining unbeaten in the league with two victories and two draws.",
      "However, morale may be low in the Chelsea squad after their 3-1 Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich on Wednesday, while United have had the benefit of a full week to address any issues from their previous match.",

      "Chelsea were in European action on Wednesday night as they took on Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena. An own goal from Trevoh Chalobah and a Harry Kane brace saw Bayern come out as 3-1 winners with Cole Palmer on the scoresheet for Chelsea.",
      "While Maresca’s men were in midweek action, a lack of European football at Old Trafford this season means that Ruben Amorim’s team have had extra time to both prepare for the game against Chelsea and recover from any knocks in their squad. It could potentially be seen as an advantage going into the weekend’s game.",
      "When asked about the situation during his pre-match press conference, Maresca appeared to aim a dig at United. “If you ask me, I prefer to play the Champions League game, no doubt,\" he said.",
      "“But at the same time, the reality is that they have one entire week to prepare the game. And we played a game two days ago, 48 hours ago. But again, I prefer to play the Champions League games.\"",
      "One person who would seemingly be in full agreement with the Chelsea boss over wanting to see his team in Champions League action is United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. TalkSPORT claim that during a meeting with Amorim this week, Ratcliffe stressed that on-field results need to be improved.",
      "It is added that the co-owner believes that the current squad is now good enough to challenge for a top-five finish this season. Bringing European football back to United next season is seen as essential by United chiefs, although the Champions League is not said to be the essential aim by the end of the season – as much as Ratcliffe will want to see United back among Europe's elite.",
      "Qualification for any form of European football is viewed as the bare minimum for Amorim to get, or he could face serious repercussions.",
      "The lack of European football this season will be a big financial blow to United. Given a big transfer spend in the summer, a return to the European stage this time next season is something that is likely to be expected.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Amorim outlined what was said in the meeting with Ratcliffe this week. \"New contract, he was offering me a new contract,\" he said with a smile.",

      "Manchester United will be looking to get back to winning ways today when they face Chelsea in the Premier League.",
      "A 3-2 win over Burnley before the international break slightly eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim, but the United boss' position is back under the microscope after the defeat to Manchester City last time out.",
      "Today United face Chelsea knowing they need to secure a positive result after their worst start to a season in 33 years. After the clash with Chelsea comes games against Brentford and Sunderland before the second international break of the season.",
      "In terms of the team news, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are available, but Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez are still sidelined.",
      "It's set to be a huge game for United and Amorim, and we'll have all the build-up, updates and reaction you need throughout the day.",
      "Follow the blog below for live updates from Old Trafford.",
      "The starting teams will be confirmed at 4.15pm.",
      "United have won two of their past 11 games with Chelsea but Chelsea are winless at Old Trafford since May 2013. That was Sir Alex Ferguson’s last match in charge before his retirement was announced. So the league’s most-drawn fixture has the makings of a draw today.",
      "It is a day to get inside as quickly as possible. Plenty of supporters were sheltering from the rain in the Munich Tunnel and under the Stretford End. A queue had formed for the directors’ box two-and-a-half hours before kick-off. If United are seeking an omen, it was raining when they beat Burnley.",
      "United’s results against their Premier League opponents this season are worse than last season (apart from Burnley, who were obviously in the Championship in 2024-25). Chelsea drew here last season when Ruud van Nistelrooy was in charge and United-Chelsea is the most-drawn fixture in the Premier League era. A point would be incremental progress for United but would not exactly lift the mood here.",
      "Shaw could have done better for each of City's goals and it might be best to move him to the bench. Maguire was good last season and can play on that side. Amorim has spoken glowingly about the benefits of having a left-footed defender on the left of the back-three, but Maguire has played in that role for England.",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford is still named among the United directors in the programme. That needs to change. As far as I can tell, his only contribution was to ensure there was ample natural light in the new building at Carrington. What a legacy.",
      "United pay tribute to Ricky Hatton in the ninth page of the programme: “Stockport-born Ricky was a staunch Blue but loved by all in Manchester.”",
      "Amorim discussed Fernandes playing in the deeper midfield role and essentially defended his appearances in that position. Fernandes has shown he can perform in every position down the years, but he's made a poor start to the season and seems to be struggling with the defensive aspects of the role.",
      "Fernandes lost Foden's run into the box for City's opening goal last weekend and failed to track Smith-Row when he scored Fulham's equaliser last month.",
      "That suggests he should be pushed up the pitch, albeit he would have to rotate with Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "Amorim’s notes are slightly longer today but still succinct. He’s stressed United have prepared well for today’s game but it is difficult to recall a manager saying how poor the preparation has been pre-match.",
      "You can see his point when he stressed there is progression on the performance side. Until last week, United’s league displays ranged from decent to good. But results matter the most and United is not a club where you can ever get time.",
      "Maresca was asked about Garnacho's return to Old Trafford at his press conference.",
      "“Probably it is something that we have to think about,” said Maresca when asked about the narrative surrounding Garnacho’s return to Old Trafford.",
      "\"First of all, because he is young, so you don’t know how he can react. But also in case we decide to start with him, I will have a chat with him to ask also how he feels about that.”",
      "Maresca was unsure whether returning to a former club shortly after leaving could fuel a positive performance.",
      "He said: “It can be in both ways. It can be in both ways, but I think we have also another similar case, like Jadon [Sancho] last year, that for different reasons struggled.",
      "\"Then he joined us for one season, it was good, he helped us to achieve our target. Overall, I think Jadon had a good season with us and hopefully Ale' Garnacho can have the same.”",
      "Juan Mata was responsible for Chelsea's last victory at Old Trafford in May 2013. The former United midfielder scored in the 87th minute to wrap up a late win for Chelsea when Rafael Benitez was in charge.",
      "The London club drew 1-1 with United when they last visited Old Trafford in November.",
      "Chelsea have only won six games at Old Trafford from 33 visits in the Premier League, which is their lowest win rate at any ground they've visited at least 10 times in the competition.",
      "That bodes well for Amorim as he looks to guide his side to a much-needed victory.",
      "Amorim could make changes today after last week's defeat in the derby.",
      "Mount and Cunha are both available again, and the United boss may be tempted to throw the former in against his old team. Cunha has enjoyed a bright start to life at United and he too could be thrown straigh back into the team.",
      "Read how our writers think United should line up here >>>",
      "Amorim has confirmed United do not have an outright number one goalkeeper.",
      "United signed Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day for £18.2million, including add-ons, and the 23-year-old was on the bench for the Manchester derby.",
      "Altay Bayindir has started in all four of United's Premier League matches this term, having arrived for £4.3m from Fenerbahce as back-up to Andre Onana on deadline day in September 2023.",
      "Read what Amorim said here >>>",
      "The pre-match analysis will kick off on both channels from 5pm, and subscribers can also tune in via the Sky Go app.",

      "Amorim's men have just four points from four league outings this season and have already been dumped out of the Carabao Cup.",
      "A fast start was needed after a heavy summer of spending, but the positives in the opening day defeat to Arsenal already feel like a distant memory.",

      "Garnacho and his on-off girlfriend, Eva Garcia, made several trips to London throughout last season. One of Garnacho's agents, Enrique de Lucas, played for Chelsea and De Lucas and Carlos Cambeiro were at Stamford Bridge in January.",
      "Some have speculated that Miss Garcia could return to England now that Garnacho has relocated to the capital. It is a transfer he was warming up for as far back as the winter window.",
      "Come his final participation as a United player in Hong Kong, Garnacho was sullen and contemptuous of the post-season tour. He fulfilled the post-match meet-and-greet commitment at Hong Kong Stadium but Garnacho never broke into a smile for the selfies.",
      "He looked happier to be away from the club, revelling in the attention from a paparazzo in Hale in July. At Carrington, Garnacho was persona non grata, albeit not the only one as a member of the five-man bomb squad.",
      "Although Garnacho was in the United academy from the age of 16, he never seemed likely to be a one-club man, having arrived from Madrid. His association with the club ultimately lasted less than five eventful years, beginning with a period of quarantine due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Garnacho was isolated again in his final months at the club.",
      "Garnacho vacated his Cheshire mansion earlier in the year but was still forking out for the rent while he resided in downsized accommodation. United were keen to stress at the time that Garnacho's change of residence was unrelated to a future transfer and that his parents and brother had returned to Spain.",
      "Another move was inevitable when Garnacho was omitted from the Europa League final starting XI. He should have seen it coming. Ruben Amorim used the Friday night fixture away to Chelsea as a dress rehearsal, with Mason Mount starting and Garnacho on the bench.",
      "Garnacho naively thought nothing of it. He had his hair bleached for the showpiece in Bilbao. At San Mames stadium, a disconsolate Garnacho was the only United player on the pitch when the teams were announced. He distracted himself by catching up with former teammate Sergio Reguilon.",
      "In less than a year, Garnacho's status was downgraded from untouchable to undependable. During a press conference on the post-season tour, Amorim started chuckling when Amad was asked if he hoped that Garnacho could somehow end up staying. The dye had been cast for the bleached blond.",
      "\"Garnacho is not our player,\" Amorim said on Friday. \"I’m really happy with Mason and (Matheus) Cunha returning. The rest you have to talk with the Chelsea manager.\"",
      "When pressed on Garnacho in the second section, Amorim started laughing again. \"Guys, I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who plays for the opponent, what people are going to say in the end, if the other player is going to play well. They are good players and they will play well if things happen.",
      "\"I'm just focused on winning the game. That is my only concern.\"",
      "The 2022 FA Youth Cup final was one of Garnacho's most celebrated evenings at Old Trafford. A record crowd of 67,492 for the competition was present for United's first triumph in the competition in 11 years.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo recorded a motivational message for the squad that was played in the dressing room before kick-off. Garnacho, who idolised Ronaldo and mimicked his celebrations, scored twice in the 3-1 victory.",
      "As United players took it in turns to pose with the trophy, Garnacho draped the Argentina flag around him and there was the first rendition of \"Viva Garnacho\" from the Stretford End. Garnacho offered some cursory applause and afforded himself a quick smirk amid the impromptu adoration.",
      "He was never fazed by the hype or the demands. Garnacho was immortalised on the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year plaque at Carrington and angled for the number seven shirt after his first season. It went to Mount, also cursed by the number. Garnacho got a seven in his new upgraded squad number of 17.",
      "Without him, United would still be on 12 FA Cups. Garnacho was worthy of the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award in 2023-24, a campaign that he indefatigably played through without succumbing to injury. He played 50 times and started in 38 in succession. Garnacho has been injury-free since March 2023, a remarkable stretch for a winger who is a magnet for hatchet men.",
      "His performance against Liverpool in that quarter-final for the ages was not one of Garnacho's best but he had a pivotal role in all four goals. Garnacho had been managing a hamstring injury in the days leading up to the tie and played more than two hours in the epic, collapsing deliriously when Amad steered the ball past Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "Unlike some other wingers, Garnacho never went into hiding. He always demanded the ball and had a work-rate reminiscent of David Beckham. Consider the added-time comeback against Brentford in October 2023, a game that possibly spared Erik ten Hag of the sack 12 months early. It is the game-changer Garnacho who twists and turns on the byline before diverting the ball in for Scott McTominay to eventually equalise.",
      "Garnacho's immediate reaction is to sprint back into his own half. There is time for a winner. It is that attitude and those memories that make his brief time in the United first team (his full debut was less than three years ago) so regrettable. He was a throwback to the United wingers of yore yet also a modern winger",
      "Maybe there was too much, too young. Garnacho's overhead kick at Everton and celebration against West Ham United were central to the script for the stirring Adidas Originals trailer fronted by Barry Keoghan to launch last year's white away shirt.",
      "Like Marcus Rashford before him, Garnacho did not appreciate having his nose put out of joint by a new manager. Ten Hag read Garnacho the riot act a couple of times over some tardy timekeeping on his first pre-season tour and a passive-aggressive reaction on social media. But the dynamic changed irrevocably under Amorim.",
      "Player and manager tried to make it work after Garnacho and Rashford were dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby last year. Amorim felt Garnacho was inattentive when he issued him instructions at Viktoria Plzen three days earlier. Rashford never played for United again. Garnacho was back in the squad and back on the pitch four days later at Tottenham.",
      "Whereas teammates had tired of the Rashford drama, they were more invested in the younger Garnacho. Bruno Fernandes took Garnacho under his wing but was also prepared to clip Garnacho's wings. He unloaded at him over Chelsea's winning goal in May.",
      "Arsenal, Tottenham and Atletico Madrid backed off on possible moves for Garnacho after conducting due diligence. One of his most accomplished performances for United was at Chelsea, overshadowed by their extraordinary stoppage-time implosion from 3-2 up to 4-3 down in April 2024.",
      "At £40million, Chelsea got Garnacho on the cheap. United attempted to portray the transfer as a positive, that Garnacho was the club's fourth-highest sale. He left for £2.5m more than Omari Hutchinson, the former Ipswich Town winger who joined Nottingham Forest.",
      "United are going through a change of identity, most glaringly with the absence of pure wingers in their starting XI. Amorim has seen off Garnacho, Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho. Garnacho is the only one who could be missed, though his antagonistic attitude should ensure some boos back at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The United academy is quick to pat itself on the back when there is a first-team breakthrough yet they are conspicuous by their absence if problems surface with a graduate. Garnacho, Rashford and, most gravely, Mason Greenwood have all caused strife at United. Club sources admitted Garnacho's loudmouth brother, Roberto, was a problem.",
      "Garnacho's transgressions were the most frivolous yet United need to buck the trend of academy poster boys developing an inflated sense of entitlement before they have turned 21.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur in May, midnight was looming and the skyline pitch black. Garnacho emerged from the dressing room sporting some shades and walked through the mixed zone without breaking his stride.",
      "Amorim was sat at the front of the team coach. Garnacho removed the sunglasses before he boarded it. He would not have been concealing tears over his impending exit.",
      "He wanted it.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim suggested even the Pope could not change him to pick a different formation.",
      "Amorim has used the 3-4-2-1 system in all 47 matches he has taken charge of at United but the team have won only eight out of 31 in the Premier League.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited United's Carrington training complex on Thursday but there was no puff of white smoke. Ratcliffe reassured Amorim after a galling start to the season in which United have won one of their five matches and were humiliatingly eliminated from the League Cup by fourth-tier Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim will continue to use the 3-4-2-1 system he swears by in United's Premier League home fixture against Chelsea on Saturday night and clarified he does not intend to change United's shape now.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" Amorim replied when asked if the formation was mentioned with Ratcliffe. \"No one, not even the Pope will change… This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.",
      "\"But I will change the system, there will be an evolution, but we need to make all the good steps. If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure, it doesn't matter if he's all around the world, is saying, 'you need to change the system' and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way.",
      "\"So, everything, when you think about the impact that any decision is going to have on the team, everything is important. So, I will say the same thing: this will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way.",
      "\"But it will change. So, I hope to have the time to change! But it will change.\"",
      "Amorim expressed encouragement at United's performance progression, citing their second-place status for the expected goals metric. United are first for most attempts at goal and efforts that have hit the woodwork in the Premier League.",
      "However, United have scored one goal from open play in six hours in the league so far this term. Apart from Bryan Mbeumo's second-half strike against Burnley, United have scored two own goals and Bruno Fernandes converted an added-time penalty to beat Burnley.",
      "Champions Liverpool have won all five of their league and Champions League games with a goal scored in the last ten minutes or in added time. Amorim feels Liverpool have the belief United are lacking.",
      "\"I think it's everything,\" he opined. \"It's belief. It's confidence. It's aggression. It's everything. And sometimes, what we call luck is the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"So I think it's Liverpool. It's winning all the games. It's something about the teams that are winning that something is going to happen, to have that feeling. And sometimes, with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well, but something is going to go wrong in some moments.",
      "So, we need to change that, but it's just with wins. I can do whatever. They can do whatever. But, if you look at the goals against City, Fulham, all these moments, we scored against Burnley. We are good in the game and then we take the draw.",
      "\"All these moments, I think we can do better. It's our fault. So, we work on that during the week to improve for the next.\"",
      "Amorim was fleetingly linked with a return to Lisbon as Benfica manager early in the week. Reports in Portugal suggested Benfica presidential candidate João Noronha Lopes was keen on bringing Amorim in to replace Bruno Lage, who was sacked after the Champions League defeat to Qarabag in midweek.",
      "Instead, incumbent Benfica president Rui Costa appointed Amorim's mentor and former United manager, Jose Mourinho, as Lage's replacement. Former Sporting coach Amorim clarified that there was no contact with Benfica and that whenever he leaves United he will require a break.",
      "\"No guys, no contact,\" Amorim added. \"I'm Manchester United manager. Until something changes, and after that, for sure, if it's next month, tomorrow, in ten years, I will rest because I deserve it.",
      "\"So, no contact, not so ever. And then Mourinho is there. So guys, if you want, you will have fun!\"",

      "United suffered a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City in the Manchester derby last weekend, which means the Reds have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years.",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim increased after the loss to Grimsby Town and it has cranked up again. There are three games before the October international break and they will be crucial for Amorim.",
      "United must bounce back against Chelsea when they visit Old Trafford. The London club lost against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday, and United have the advantage of fresh legs.",
      "Regarding the team news, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are available, but Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez are still sidelined.",
      "This is how our writers think United should start the game:",
      "United are not going to get anywhere with Altay Bayindir and Luke Shaw in their team. Senne Lammens and Harry Maguire should come in, as unlikely as that is.",
      "Amorim has to persevere with Manuel Ugarte in midfield with Bruno Fernandes. Given the magnitude of the game and the opposition, Mount is worth recalling in the hope that he rises to the occasion against his former club. Cunha also has to come back in.",
      "It is worth playing Amad on the left as he is a far better player than Patrick Dorgu. Noussair Mazraoui would provide balance on the opposite flank.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "The next few games before the October international break could decide whether Amorim is given more time. Amorim must get his team selection right and it would be beneficial to decide on a settled XI.",
      "I would bring Lammens in for Bayindir, who was shaky again last weekend, and Shaw should also be moved to the bench. Maguire was good last season and should become a regular starter again.",
      "The midfield is not working and it's time to play Kobbie Mainoo. Ugarte banked some credit at the Etihad, but it makes sense to partner Mainoo with Casemiro, as they have previously excelled together.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Fernandes would be my front three, with the latter on the left side. It feels wrong to leave Cunha on the bench, but he's only just returning from a muscle injury.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Manchester United do not have an outright number one goalkeeper.",
      "United signed Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day for £18.2million, including add-ons, and the 23-year-old was on the bench for the Manchester derby.",
      "Altay Bayindir has started in all four of United's Premier League matches this term, having arrived for £4.3m from Fenerbahce as back-up to Andre Onana on deadline day in September 2023.",
      "United allowed Onana to join Trabzonspor on a season-long loan earlier this month, leaving them without a clear and obvious first-choice 'keeper.",
      "When asked whether Bayindir was the new United number one, Amorim replied: \"No, nobody has a place that is his place.",
      "\"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",
      "Summer signing Benjamin Sesko is yet to break his duck for United after five games. Sesko made his full league debut in the 3-0 loss at City after failing to score in two starts for Slovenia in their World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "The 22-year-old was the tenth outfield player to take a penalty in the 12-11 shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the League Cup second round, though he was suffering from cramp at the end of the 90 minutes.",
      "Sesko said during the international break he needed time at United. The former RB Leipzig striker is three months younger than his predecessor, Rasmus Hojlund, who managed three goals in his final 35 appearances for United before he joined Napoli on loan.",
      "United have had the most attempts at goal in the Premier League this season, have hit the woodwork more times than any other team and Bruno Fernandes has created more chances than any other player.",
      "Amorim acknowledged that Sesko was too isolated in the derby. \"I think, if you remember Arsenal, I think we missed a lot. Burnley, I think we missed a lot. Fulham in the beginning, I think we missed a lot. We have four games and I said three.",
      "\"And then there is the thing that you say is not a big opportunity. The first play (against City), Amad has the ball between the lines. It's four against three and we put the ball out. It's not a big opportunity. It should be. So all these things.",
      "\"But if you ask me, against City, Sesko looks like he's alone in the box, I agree. He was always alone. So the guys were around, near the box. But in the final third, we get there many times.",
      "\"But I also said that, I think, in the end of the game. When I look at the box, Ben was alone. We cannot score in that way. So I think it's not the same team in that department compared to last year.",
      "\"He's at a different club. He's taking it all in and he's a professional. So you can feel that. He wants everything for tomorrow and we have to balance that.",
      "\"But he's doing the job. And again, guys, we can talk about all the things here. The system: if one ball goes inside the box, we win one game and two, this will change.",
      "\"The important thing is that last year, I said to you, I think I was really clear: we cannot play well. We cannot create chances. This year is completely different. We can avoid all the goals that we are suffering. Yes, it's our fault. So let's work on that and try next week and next week and next week.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho could feature in Chelsea's starting XI against Manchester United, if the club's recent social media post is anything to work off.",
      "The Argentine winger completed a dramatic 11th-hour transfer from the Red Devils to Stamford Bridge this summer in a deal worth £40million, following a summer of unrest in the north west. And as a result, Garnacho may now get the chance to demonstrate to United the genuine talent they were unable to harness during his troubled spell.",
      "It comes after Chelsea unveiled a pre-match promotional image across their social media platforms showcasing Garnacho's face, with the caption: \"Old Trafford, here we come,\" alongside an emoji of a face expelling smoke from its nostrils.",
      "The 21-year-old appears to have adapted well to life in the English capital since his summer switch, despite encountering some initial adjustment issues. He made his debut in a 2-2 stalemate with Brentford last weekend, contributing to Chelsea's strike that put them 2-1 ahead before losing sight of Fabio Carvalho in the penalty area, allowing the Bees to secure a dramatic late leveller, reports Football London.",
      "He was also introduced as a substitute during Chelsea's 3-1 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday night, with a Trevoh Chalobah own-goal and a Harry Kane double nullifying Cole Palmer's brilliant and virtually single-handed effort.",
      "Nevertheless, Chelsea maintain their undefeated Premier League record this campaign with two victories and two stalemates to their credit, and will be eager to address their dismal form at Old Trafford, having not triumphed there since 2013.",
      "Garnacho, a product of the Carrington academy, will undoubtedly be keen to demonstrate to his former club and Ruben Amorim what they missed out on by not keeping faith in him. The young player was notably left out of United's Europa League final against Tottenham in May, a decision he didn't shy away from expressing his thoughts on after a 1-0 defeat to the Lilywhites.",
      "He said: \"Obviously it's hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn't beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don't score goals, you always need more.",
      "\"Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today... I don't know. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "During the summer break, Garnacho was reportedly informed that he was free to leave the club, leading to his move to Chelsea as the transfer window came to a close. While he'll be hoping to secure a spot in Enzo Maresca's starting XI when the Blues take on Manchester United, he'll face tough competition for his position.",
      "That's due to Chelsea's abundance of wingers available this season, with Pedro Neto, Estevao and Jamie Gittens also battling for a starting place. Manchester United will welcome Chelsea at Old Trafford at 5:30pm on Saturday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is pleased for Rasmus Hojlund that he scored on his debut for Napoli after the \"tough\" criticism he received.",
      "Hojlund was on target in Napoli's 3-1 win at Fiorentina last week and started in their 2-0 Champions League loss at Manchester City on Thursday night.",
      "United let Hojlund leave on a season-long loan at the start of this month and Napoli have an obligation to buy the 22-year-old for £38million next year. The Denmark international managed three goals in his final 35 appearances for United.",
      "Fellow loanee Marcus Rashford was also on target with a superb brace for Barcelona in their Champions League victory at Newcastle United. Rashford had failed to score in his first four games for the Spanish champions before his two second-half goals at St James' Park on Thursday evening.",
      "When Amorim was asked about Rashford's impact back on English soil, he replied: \"And Rasmus. Rasmus scoring the first goal for Napoli.",
      "\"So I'm really happy for Rasmus also. It's the same thing with Rasmus, guys. You were so tough on Rasmus and he scored also, so let's [take] notice of that.\"",
      "Amorim was reluctant to dwell on Alejandro Garnacho's time at United as he prepares to return to Old Trafford with Chelsea. Garnacho was a member of the five-man 'bomb squad' that was ordered to report for training at a separate time to United's core squad in pre-season.",
      "In July, Amorim said it was \"clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership\". On Friday, he added: \"Guys, I'm not concerned about [whether selling Garnacho could backfire]. I just want to win games.",
      "\"I don't care who plays for the opponent, what people are going to say in the end, if the other player is going to play well. They are good players and they will play well if things happen. I'm just focused on winning the game. That is my only concern.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes is likely to continue in central midfield for United despite a subdued start to the season. Fernandes scored United's winning penalty against Burnley three weeks ago and has created the most chances in the Premier League but his position is a topic of debate.",
      "Fernandes has played the majority of his United career as a playmaker but Amorim has settled on a deeper role for the club captain amid a paucity of central midfield options. Fernandes, 31, enjoyed a brief stint in midfield under Erik ten Hag and has started in a deeper role for the Portugal national team.",
      "\"Of course, Bruno wants all the freedom in the world,\" Amorim stated. \"But even when he plays a 10 role, he's getting the ball back. Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box, but he's getting there and he's near the box and he can do his shots.",
      "\"I think it's a position that I want Bruno more deep to have more possession, to try to control more the game. And we are doing that.",
      "\"Sometimes we miss a little bit Bruno in front. Maybe because (Matheus) Cunha is not there. But if Cunha is there, we have one extra player. So I'm trying just to balance the team and trying to imagine the game. And we'll try to put the best starting 11 there.",
      "\"But I see Bruno well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further, but he has a job to do. And the important thing is not Bruno playing well. It's the team playing well and winning football games. And he can play in different positions.\"",

      "Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella appeared to hint that Alejandro Garnacho will be in his side's squad for the game against Manchester United this evening.",
      "The 21-year-old winger is yet to start for the west Londoners, but he could be set to feature in the starting eleven for the first time since leaving United to move to the capital. Ruben Amorim's side play host to Enzo Maresca's men in what looked to be a dangerous game for the Reds.",
      "Garnacho made his Chelsea debut in the Blues' 2-2 away draw with Brentford and also came on as a substitute in their 3-1 defeat away to Bayern Munich. Despite two disappointing outcomes, Garnacho demonstrated considerable potential.",
      "After seeing Cucurella's recent Instagram story, Garnacho could be set to be involved to face United. The Spaniard uploaded a picture of himself and Garnacho facing each other in training with an eyes emoji overlaying.",
      "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca also suggested Garnacho has played his way into his plans. The Italian said: \"In the last two games, he was inside very good. He can be very good in the second half.",
      "\"I explained to him the other day against Bayern Munich. We are adapting our style, what we want from the winger. Now, if he's ready to start tomorrow, I think he's ready to start.\"",
      "When asked if Garnacho could cope with a hostile reception, Maresca responded: \"Yeah, it's always difficult. The other day, against Bayern Munich, Cucurella every time [he] touched the ball, [he got booed]. The noise was not the best one. But you have to learn also to handle these kind of things.\"",
      "Maresca also said he will speak to Garnacho to gauge as to whether he is ready to face his former side. He added: \"Probably it is something that we have to think about. First of all, because he is young, so you don't know how he can react.",
      "\"But also in case we decide to start with him, I will have a chat with him to ask also how he feels about that.\"",
      "Chelsea haven't managed to secure a victory against United at Old Trafford in the Premier League since May 2013. When asked if this was an opportune moment to rectify the record, Maresca replied: \"I think it's always difficult to play United away in their stadium, Old Trafford.",

      "Not even two years have passed since Alejandro Garnacho scored a sensational overhead kick to power Manchester United to a 3-0 victory over Everton.",
      "The strike was a goal of season winner as soon as it crashed into the net and at that stage it seemed the winger was destined to have a key role for years to come at Old Trafford.",
      "Six months later he scored in the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City and his future at United seemed as bright as his wonder goal.",
      "Yet this weekend he will trot out at Old Trafford in the blue of Chelsea having found himself ostracised by Ruben Amorim at United. He's gone from being talked about as having United parallels with Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, to being discarded having trained with a 'bomb squad'.",
      "Amorim did not even want to talk about him in his pre-match press conference and it is clear the head coach did not value the Argentina international, who criticised the manager's decision to omit him from the starting XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "That was the final straw in a tormented relationship between the pair and from that moment on it was a case of when the 21-year-old would leave, not if.",
      "Chelsea were long-term admirers and swooped in the closing days of the transfer window. The Blues considered the £40million fee a bargain price given Garnacho's ability, experience and high ceiling, and wanted additional competition for Jamie Gittens on the left flank.",
      "He's made only two substitute appearances since his move but could start against United. Blues boss Enzo Maresca has spoken positively of Garnacho and he played a part in Moises Caicedo's goal against Brentford last time out.",
      "The questions over his attitude while at United are not a concern at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea reporter for Football London, Bobby Vincent, pointed to the comparison between Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, who spent last season on loan at the club from United, as evidence of the Blues being able to get the best out of mercurial players.",
      "\"Like all things, it (his attitude) would have been considered when Chelsea were initially exploring a move for him,\" he said. \"Maresca worked with Jadon Sancho last season, who had similar complaints surrounding him, but from what I understand, Sancho worked really well during his time at Chelsea and the club were impressed with the winger's work ethic and professionalism.\"",
      "Yet Garnacho still has some work to do to win over the supporters, with Vincent adding: \"The fans are very much still split on his signing. It seems, though, most of them were encouraged by his cameo in Brentford. He has plenty to prove to the fans - let's put it that way.\"",
      "He will have plenty to prove to himself, too, particularly on his return to Manchester on Saturday evening.",
      "One man who knew him well coming through the ranks at Old Trafford was former United Under-21 boss Neil Wood.",
      "\"Garna' has got talent, some of the choices he has done off the pitch might have not helped him,\" said Wood, when speaking to the MEN earlier this year. \"A bit of immaturity maybe, but it is a shame to see it. A couple of those things can be easily stopped, whether it is a bit of education.",
      "\"He is not a bad lad or a bad guy but his choices have not helped him. He needs to get back to concentrating on his football and let that do the talking.\"",
      "We will see who has the last word come Saturday night.",

      "Sesko, 22, arrived from RB Leipzig in the summer in a huge deal worth £66.4million and £7.3m in add-ons. So far, the Slovenian forward has only been a bit part player, with Ruben Amorim preferring to use Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha ahead of him.",
      "The United boss is also slowly integrating 23-year-old goalkeeper Lammens, who arrived from Royal Antwerp for £18.2m including add-ons, into the side by sticking with Altay Bayindir. Many Reds fans have been itching to see Lammens enter the sticks, with Bayindir struggling this season.",

      "\"I’m sure he is probably finding a lot of pressure on his shoulders already, because that is what happens when you play for this club. I think everyone needs to realise he is a young player.",
      "\"He might take time to find his feet, but he’s got all the attributes, the physicality, the mentality to be a success at this club. I’ve been really impressed with him in training. His finishing is excellent. I believe he is going to score goals for this club for many years.”",
      "He then moved onto Lammens, who has equally impressed him in training. However, he quickly started talking about the shot-stoppers age, saying: \"I’ve been so impressed with him in training.",

      "Amorim was reassured by Ratcliffe that his position is still secure. Amorim is under contract at United until the summer of 2027.",
      "The United head coach also discussed the state of play at the club with chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox. Amorim opined that United \"are playing well until the boxes\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract!\" Amorim joked. \"No, it’s normal things just to show the support, explaining that it’s a long project.",

      "\"This is the club with the most pressure in the world. We want to win and, again, you can say whatever. I think last year I was very critical of the way we play. I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes, we need to be more clinical, the rest we are improving compared to last year, we are in a better place.",
      "\"We need to win. We lost against Arsenal and we lost against City. Here, losing especially in the beginning after last year, is a problem.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and to analyse the next game and to prepare different things. I think we are playing well until we reach the boxes. If you see the number of shots, the XG, all these things are good, but you don’t score it doesn’t mater. You don’t win games.",

      "Peter Schmeichel believes Ruben Amorim was wrong to suggest Manchester United need to sack him if they want change.",
      "Speaking after the Manchester derby defeat, Amorim was asked whether he would change his approach after United's worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/1993.",
      "Amorim responded: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "United's head coach has stuck by his system, but Schmeichel thought Amorim made a mistake in his post-match press conference because he 'put himself above the club'.",
      "In an interview with Sky Bet, Schmeichel reacted to the Manchester derby defeat, which increased the pressure on Amorim's shoulders at a time when he needs to secure positive results.",
      "Schmeichel explained: “You always have to look at what the manager’s job is; you’re employed to win football matches. At Manchester United, that also means winning trophies, and right now he’s not doing that.",
      "\"His win percentage is around 36%, which is the worst performer of any United manager since World War II. Sticking by his guns obviously isn’t working. Bruno Fernandes said after Sunday’s game that it’s very difficult to play in midfield when you’re always one man short, because you can’t cover the ground.",
      "\"The system might look good when it works, but it hasn’t worked yet. And I don’t think the system itself can be the most important thing. For me, the art of coaching is to get the maximum out of the players you have available. Right now, it’s clear not all of them are playing to their potential.",
      "\"They look confused, sometimes disorganised, especially at the back. That’s where the manager has to take a look and change something.",
      "“I say this because I was at United during a rebuilding phase, when we were moving towards winning trophies and the Premier League. Certain standards were always in place.",
      "\"The main one was simple - no one is ever bigger than the club. That applied from the manager down through the players and staff. If someone tried to go their own way and it didn’t work, it couldn’t continue.",
      "\"That was drilled into us every single day. Sir Alex Ferguson gave us a framework that was very simple and easy to understand. It started with not conceding goals, and then it was about recruiting players who could both defend under pressure and take risks going forward.",
      "\"Guys like Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, myself behind them, Paul Parker and Denis Irwin as attacking full-backs. It worked because it was simple, and because of the mentality and quality of the players.",
      "“Right now, I don’t think we’re getting the quality out of the players we have. They can do more. The manager has to change his ways. I didn’t like what he said the other day – 'If you want change, you have to change the coach'.",
      "\"I like him a lot, I like his leadership qualities, and he came in during a very difficult period with unwanted players and dealt with it well. But as a Manchester United person, I don’t like that sentence. That’s putting yourself above the club and I don’t like that.”",
      "Schmeichel continued: “You only have to look at Sunday’s game at Manchester City to see how unhappy Bruno Fernandes was. He can look frustrated at the best of times, but this was different – he was really unhappy.",
      "\"And understandably so, because Manchester United were outnumbered in midfield throughout the game. The thing about Bruno is simple - why do we have him? Because he’s a world-class player on the ball.",
      "\"He creates, he spreads play, he scores goals. But you don’t score goals from deep. I’d much prefer to see him higher up the pitch. He’s never been a number six, he hasn’t got the legs for it, and it’s unfair to ask him to do that job because it takes away from his real strengths.",
      "“Now, I know people sometimes complain about former players being critical, and I hold my hands up – I’m one of them. But I’ve been there. I know what it takes, how much you have to invest, how much you need to be at 100% in everything you do.",
      "\"Nobody likes criticism, but this isn’t personal. When we talk about these things, it’s about suggesting what could make it better. It comes from love for the club, not for the headlines.",
      "“Bruno is the captain, and he speaks for the players, so of course it’s uncomfortable when there’s this kind of debate – but it’s necessary. United have new people in charge – Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Christopher Vivell – all of them new, without deep Manchester United knowledge.",
      "\"That’s why voices like mine, Roy Keane’s, Gary Neville’s, Paul Scholes’s matter. We’ve been there, we understand what it takes, and when we see things going in the wrong direction, it’s important we speak up to help, and at least make the people in charge think about it.\"",

      "The England international, now 27, was frozen out by United head coach Ruben Amorim - who signed off on a loan spell to Aston Villa last January and the temporary move, with an option to buy, to Barcelona. It also demonstrated Rashford still considers Fernandes to be an ally at Old Trafford.",
      "The United captain has been a loyal servant to Amorim - who is the one that might have ended Rashford's career at Old Trafford for good. Meanwhile, Rashford's decision to also repost Sancho's Instagram story also demonstrated he is still showing solidarity with the winger.",
      "While it was Erik ten Hag who decided to send Sancho on loan to Chelsea last summer, Amorim did not try and reintegrate the ex-Borussia Dortmund forward into his plans upon his return. Sancho was also quickly confined to the 'bomb squad' with Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, before he secured a loan move to Aston Villa.",
      "After the match, Rashford admitted he couldn't be happier playing under Hansi Flick's exciting Barcelona team. He said: \"It's going good, learning a lot, it's a new way of football but I'm enjoying it all - and I think that it's making me a better player.",
      "\"So that's what I'm here to do, I'm here to help the team win but improve and be the best I can.",
      "\"I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona - people my age have watched them from when we was younger - amazing football, amazing players and we want to win as much as possible.\"",
      "When asked to explain his thrilling second goal, Rashford added: \"It was a split second, I seen [saw] the far post, I thought I'd get a shot off.",
      "\"When you're going away from goal it's difficult to generate the power to keep it low, I thought try to aim high and I knew when I caught it, it would take some doing for the 'keeper to stop it.\"",
      "Rashford's display against Newcastle followed his performance in Barcelona's recent 6-0 demolition of Valencia - where he whipped in a fine assist for Raphinha to score. He will now be eyeing up the Catalans' next clash against Getafe on Sunday, September 21 (8pm).",

      "United legend Robson spoke to OLBG and shared his verdict: \"I feel as a manager you have to have a few tactics up your sleeve. Otherwise people know how to set up against you.",
      "\"If you're playing the same way week in, week out, the opposition, and especially with all the technology and everything nowadays, you can go out on the training pitch and you set yourself up to do well against a team. That's why I feel he's got to be a bit more flexible.",
      "\"Most top teams in the Premier League now are nearly always playing with a back four and so for me, if you’re playing with four at the back instead of three, you can mix it up a little bit more as well.",
      "\"Some people think about the old fashioned 4-4-2 but then I quite like 4-3-3 when you’ve got good forwards. I think United are still capable of doing that, going with the back four.",
      "\"Whatever the manager wants to set up, if it's with the back five, you have to get off to a good start and score the first goal and then counter attack against teams. I think it's a good system then.",
      "\"If you're chasing the game, I always feel that you're lacking a midfield player or a forward so you're short in numbers because you've got the five at the back.",
      "\"I would like to see him be a bit more flexible but it looks like he's got his mind and he said it all last season that he's got his mind set on the back five so it's up to him and the players to show that they really can play in that system.",
      "\"They need to take on board what the manager's trying to achieve and pick it up as the season goes on because it is still early in the season and we have played against two very good teams who are going to be up there challenging for the title. So it has been quite a difficult start.\"",
      "Robson is one of the finest midfielders to have represented United and he also shared his thoughts on Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "\"Back in my days, Paul Ince was an underrated player and great to play with because Ince was quick, he could tackle, he was a really good passer of the ball and I think Ince was a very underrated player,\" said Robson.",
      "\"Why he was underrated is because the United fans were not pleased that he fell out with Sir Alex and then he went to Inter and he came back and played for Liverpool, so all the Man United fans didn’t like that, a Man United player who's done really well going to Liverpool.",
      "\"I definitely do (think Mainoo could be the next Ince). When I heard that Mainoo might be leaving the club, I was really against it. I think he's a real talent. Last year, he had quite a few injuries and couldn't get going but the year before that, he was outstanding and he looked as if he had great potential.",
      "\"As long as he keeps his feet on the ground and works really hard at it, he could be a really good player. I know he's more attacking but Mainoo can do the defending if you put it on him, and that's what he's got to do.",
      "\"He's got to get his overall game a little bit more established and then I think he would go really well with Bruno being the more advanced midfield player.\"",
      "Last season was stop-start for Mainoo due to a few small injuries and concerns about where he fits into Amorim's system. Amorim played the midfielder in different positions, even using him as a false nine.",
      "Mainoo relocated to the deeper midfield role in pre-season this summer, but Amorim raised eyebrows when he said Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes for a start.",
      "The youngster subsequently requested to leave on loan in the final days of the window, which was denied.",

      "Manchester United may seemingly already be putting plans in place for the January transfer window. One area of the squad has been the subject of plenty of speculation following the defeat to Manchester City in the Manchester derby.",
      "United may have signed three new forwards, a left-back and a goalkeeper during the summer transfer window, but a lot has been said about the need to sign a new midfielder. Brighton star Carlos Baleba was heavily linked with signing for United, but a move never materialised with the Seagulls reportedly demanding a fee in excess of £100million for the Cameroon international.",
      "With the summer transfer window now closed, a fresh report has now emerged claiming that United are interested in Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves. A report in the Daily Briefing has claimed that a €20million (£17million) deal could be on the cards with Neves apparently keen to return to Europe.",
      "This is not the first time that United have been linked with signing Neves. Reports first emerged back in 2018 claiming that United were interested in signing the Portugal international during his time at Wolves.",
      "Neves signed for Wolves in 2017 and helped the club secure promotion to the Premier League, before eventually playing a key role in helping the Molineux outfit also qualify for the Europa League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Neves made 253 appearances for Wolves, scoring 90 goals, and has since featured 60 times for Al-Hilal since making the switch to the Saudi Pro League back in 2023. A move for Neves now would come seven years after United were first linked with the midfielder.",
      "United would certainly benefit from a new option in midfield. What will be key is how determined United are to sign Baleba, and if they have a realistic chance of getting a deal over the line.",
      "If the answer to that is 'no', then the club will consider their options - and links to Neves may stick around. Neves has already outlined his desire to return to his former club Porto before he retires.",
      "\"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive: that's my big goal,\" he said last month.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28 years old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club, it's something I want to give them and experience [for myself].",
      "\"I used to go to the Aliados to celebrate Porto's titles but now I want to be on the other side and want to see my family celebrate.\"",

      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",

      "Fernandes has dropped back into midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who had occupied the two playmaker roles before Cunha suffered an injury against Burnley two weeks ago.",

      "United only have three out-and-out central midfielders in Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, with the latter yet to start in the league this term.",
      "\"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",

      "As usual, the pre-season optimism surrounding Man Utd has quickly evaporated following a few disappointing results, with their start to the 2025/26 campaign showing no sign of progress despite a £230m spend on signings and the offloading of deadwood.",
      "Amorim is still adopting a square pegs in round holes approach, with there being no real evidence of the head coach improving any of his squad in his failing 3-4-3 system.",
      "READ: Nothing will change at Manchester United unless they learn ‘phenomenal’ Arteta secret",
      "Despite having two transfer windows to build his squad, Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation remains ineffective in both defence and attack, with it obvious that a change to 4-3-2-1 is necessary to get the more out of a struggling side.",
      "So, it will be infuriating for Man Utd fans that Amorim once again insisted on Friday that he “will not change” as he fears a U-turn could make his players “look at him differently”.",
      "“No, no, no,” Amorim said when asked about changing his formation. “No one. Not even the Pope will change…",
      "“This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.”",
      "He added: “If I’m a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure and [people] all around the world, are saying ‘you need to change the system’, says ‘I’m going to change’, they will look at me in a different way.",
      "“Everything is important when you think about the impact that a decision is going to have on the team.",
      "“I’m doing things my way. I hope to have the time to change but it will be an evolution.”",
      "So, as Alan Shearer predicted, Amorim is prepared to “die on his sword” at Man Utd and this will prove to be his undoing at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim is a head coach with a specialised system, but his bullish refusal to adapt at all will ensure that he will not “have the time to change”, because he is judged on wins and he cannot get away with being 14th in the Premier League for much longer.",
      "The reason for Amorim’s clear stance is that he doesn’t want to lose face in the dressing room, but recent reports have indicated that the squad are giving up regardless, so this risk is necessary as a final Hail Mary to save his job. Without it, there is no road back for the head coach…",

      "Jimmy Rimmer is a fair shout here, but United had strong No.1s in Alex Stepney and Gary Bailey during that period. Brian Kidd is another option but his departure after the Red Devils’ relegation in 1974 was understandable.",
      "Like Kidd, Danny Welbeck left his native Manchester for North London in his mid-20s when he perhaps should’ve spent the next decade at Old Trafford. Welbeck’s ten league goals for Brighton last season was three more than Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee combined.",

Despite his dodgy knees, the Irish star spent seven years at Aston Villa and was part of the side that defeated the Red Devils in the 1994 League Cup Final.",
      "",
      "Given Bournemouth were starting their first ever season in the top flight just a decade ago, there haven’t been many notable transfers between the two. One of Ferguson’s early fledglings, Russell Beardsmore, enjoyed a five-year stay at Dean Court after leaving Old Trafford. A skilful midfielder, Beardsmore had a spell in the United first team in the late ’80s and featured in the club’s run to the 1991 European Cup Winners’ Cup Final.",
      "",
      "Tom Manley spent nine years with Man Utd in the ’30s, leaving for Brentford shortly before professional football was suspended due to the outbreak of the Second World War. Like many of that era, Manley was deprived of his prime years but resumed playing for the Bees in 1946. Had he stayed at Old Trafford his experience could’ve helped new manager Matt Busby lift the title in his first season, with the Red Devils finishing just one point behind champions Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Dave Sexton always seemed an odd choice as Man Utd manager given the ultra-cautious style of football he employed and his decision to offload a local lad who was banging in hat-tricks for the first team as a teenager certainly didn’t endear him to the Old Trafford faithful. Andy Ritchie departed for Brighton shortly before his 20th birthday when he could’ve played well into the Alex Ferguson era.",
      "",
      "Chris Eagles played 17 times for Man Utd before joining Burnley in search of regular first-team football. It wasn’t long before Eagles faced his former team-mates, helping the Clarets to a famous 1-0 win over the Red Devils at the start of the 2009/10 season. If Ferguson’s men had taken all three points that day, they would’ve retained the title and become the first English club to win four in a row, long before City did it.",
      "",
      "Ferguson wasn’t to know Mark Hughes would continue playing top-flight football well into his late 30s but the Welshman’s experience and grit may have come in handy during the 1997/98 campaign. Eric Cantona’s retirement, Teddy Sheringham’s initial struggles as his replacement and captain Roy Keane’s season-ending injury saw the Red Devils lose their Premier League crown to Arsenal.",

      "Letting go of Phil Neville when he remains an immutable fixture on the England ladder was foolish of Ferguson, but the legendary Scottish boss will perhaps have more regrets about letting so many of his other unwanted stars rock up at Goodison Park. Neville, Tim Howard and Darron Gibson all featured for Everton in the bonkers 4-4 draw that cost United top spot in the 2011/12 season. If he kept Chris Eagles as well, it definitely would’ve been seven titles in a row.",

Giles was still in his early 20s at the time and went on to become one of the finest midfielders in Europe under Don Revie.",

      "Denis Law’s back-heel didn’t actually relegate Man Utd, so it’s got to be Carlos Tevez. The Argentine forward helped the Red Devils to two Premier League titles, an EFL Cup and a Champions League triumph in his short stay at Old Trafford. However, Tevez then ended up on the blue side of Manchester and despite going on strike in the 2011/12 season, he returned to help deliver a first top-flight title to City since 1968.",
      "",
      "Playing for the red and blue sides of both Manchester and Merseyside is unusual but what’s even more bizarre is Ron Atkinson’s decision to let a young Peter Beardsley go so soon after signing him. One of England’s finest players in the late ’80s and early ’90s, Beardsley was behind the likes of Whiteside, Stapleton and Macari in the pecking order at Old Trafford, but given his ability to be far more than an out-and-out marksman it remains a mystery that he only featured in one match for the Red Devils.",

      "",
      "After winning the lot with Man Utd Teddy Sheringham returned from whence he came and enjoyed two more seasons at White Hart Lane before joining Portsmouth for their 2003/04 campaign. That season was of course famous for Arsenal’s Invincibles, with the Gunners taking the Premier League crown away from Old Trafford in style. The only two clubs they failed to beat in their historic run: Man Utd and Portsmouth, with Sheringham finding the net in a 1-1 draw at Highbury and almost inflicting defeat on Arsene Wenger’s men but for a very questionable penalty.",

Every single opportunity, we call a “chance” and (certainly in my lifetime that I can remember) we always have – because we never assume someone will score, least of all a 35 yard beauty dead-ball, because we know that Johnny GreatFootballer isn’t perfect. However, I am also aware that luck – is defined as being completely without one’s actions so willing to concede luck is really not the right word to convey my point without disparaging anyone’s ego or sense of self.",

Every team has a right to play the kind of football they want, but it is unfortunate the first 5 Liverpool games are of this ilk and of course, it is not as fluid and beautiful as a normal football game can be.

      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "In this summer’s transfer window, the Red Devils proved that, despite their prolonged on-field woes, they retain immense pulling power purely on name value.",
      "Man Utd were a thorn in the side of Newcastle United as they beat Eddie Howe’s side to Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while Senne Lammens opted for Old Trafford over Galatasaray.",
      "Still, limited finances prevented Man Utd from getting everyone they wanted, as they did not have the necessary funds to sign top midfield target Carlos Baleba from Brighton.",
      "United were reportedly quoted around £100m for Baleba, who could have made a transformational impact and turned Ruben Amorim’s side into a credible European contender.",
      "It was even reported that Baleba was keen on the move, thus proving that their pull remains, but this deal was too good to be true as Man Utd could not finance a deal after investing around £200m on overhauling their attack.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Arsenal v Man City, Liverpool, Ollie Watkins, Ruben Amorim",
      "Man Utd’s ‘dream’ move for Baleba was certainly ambitious, but it has a far greater chance of happening next year, once he and a No.6 is their overwhelming transfer priority, and it has already been reported that they ‘will return’ for him in 2026.",
      "However, Man Utd’s failure to land Baleba at the earliest opportunity opens them up to future heartache, and with Liverpool lurking in the background, this saga is likely to end in tears for INEOS.",
      "Liverpool have just put together an all-timer transfer window, investing £414.5m as this summer’s biggest spending club to sign Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.",
      "This further cemented the Reds as a leading global superpower and it gives head coach Arne Slot a near-perfect squad, which has only a couple of weak spots.",
      "One such area is at centre-back, which will be fixed once they land long-term target Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, while the absence of quality competition for Ryan Gravenberch in the No.6 role is another issue.",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n👉 Arsenal’s elite finishing, Man Utd just shoot, Spurs’ unsustainable start: one xG nugget per Premier League club\n👉 Arsenal second XI would finish in top six as Premier League back-ups ranked\n👉 Premier League prize money table revealed with Chelsea taking top spot after November picks",
      "This is why their reported interest in Baleba makes a lot of sense, with a report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claiming Man Utd are ‘shellshocked’ at the very real possibility of missing out on the Brighton standout to Liverpool.",
      "Jones explained to TEAMtalk: “Manchester United were the first club to make a move for Baleba in the summer and they still see him as a key target for their long-term rebuild under Amorim. There was intent behind that approach, wanting to show the player and club how serious they are.",
      "“But the concern is that Liverpool’s admiration could turn into something more concrete.",
      "“They’ve already shown this year they’re not afraid to splash out big money on the right player, and if they decided to push for Baleba, United would suddenly find themselves in an unwanted situation. No one wants to go head-to-head with Liverpool – on or off the pitch.”",
      "As Jones says, “no one wants to go head-to-head with Liverpool” on the pitch or at the negotiating table.",
      "Given the state of each club, it would be a no-brainer for Baleba to choose the current Premier League holders over Man Utd, who face the nightmare of seeing a perfect signing head to their biggest rivals and to be left chasing their tails for a far less suitable alternative.",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Liverpool are making ‘serious moves’ to land a star Manchester United midfield target in the January transfer window, according to insider Indy Kaila.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’.",
      "Man Utd will look to make a new signing in the January transfer window with INEOS ‘desperate’ to bring in a defensive midfielder, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘preparing’ a record ‘offer’ for Brighton star Carlos Baleba as they look to make an ‘historic signing’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already been dealt a ‘huge’ blow as they consider whether to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton in January."

      "When a manager enters ‘X number of games to save his job’ territory, he rarely emerges from it on firm ground. Ruben Amorim has reportedly been given the next three matches, but the first of that pre-Anfield run on Saturday feels more decisive than the two that may or may not follow.",
      "United welcome Chelsea to Old Trafford on Saturday evening. Despite the sh*tshow that has unfolded since Sir Alex Ferguson left, the Red Devils have never lost to the Blues at home in the Premier League under all the managers that followed. Should Amorim become the first, the writing won’t be on the wall so much as highlighted in illuminous marker and ringed in red.",
      "He could not claim to have not had the time to prepare for what’s coming. The slither of positivity, should you squint to see it, from their European absence was said to be all the time Amorim would have with his players on the training pitch.",
      "United will have had Monday to Friday to work on the flaws ruthlessly exposed by Manchester City in the derby. As Amorim suggested, the Red Devils enjoyed more control at the Etihad than they have on most of their visits in recent years. The manager’s problem, though, is control means little without the moments. And the flaws they demonstrated at key times cannot really be fixed in a single working week.",
      "That isn’t enough time to impart upon Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro or Kobbie Mainoo the freakish mobility necessary to cover all the ground required of midfielders in Amorim’s system. It is definitely not long enough to turn Bruno Fernandes into a No.6, not that any coach in their right mind should ever want to.",
      "Nor is five days enough to give his players the confidence and technique necessary to make the moments matter. City, in both boxes, definitely did. Which leaves United’s belief in themselves, but more worryingly their manager’s methods, shredded before Chelsea turn up.",
      "Fernandes was candid when after the derby, as ever, he faced the inquest interviews. The skipper admitted United were too easy to outnumber in midfield, especially when the centre-backs are not feeling ‘brave’ enough to jump out and help.",
      "That would have been music to Enzo Maresca’s ears had the Chelsea boss not already spotted the bleedin’ obvious.",
      "Maresca’s whole schtick is creating overloads in the exact areas the Red Devils are vulnerable. Without some tweaking to Amorim’s precious system, even subtly, it is hard to envisage how Cole Palmer won’t find the space to make United dance to his tune.",
      "But Amorim will not change. We know that because he has freely told us so on a twice-weekly basis. And so defiant he has been over sticking to his principles, he would be harshly judged for changing them now by the exact people who have lobbied him to do so.",
      "Chelsea, though, have yet to show the consistency that might have Amorim pre-emptively packing his bags before the weekend. They play in fits and starts, and while Maresca comes to terms with juggling his many, many players around a heavy workload – in stark contrast to United – there remains too great a difference between what they are capable of and what they often produce.",
      "Their set up, while posing opponents many problems in possession, does offer up opportunities, especially on the counter. If United can muster up just a hint of the ruthlessness they have lacked so far this season, they ought to get the chances to showcase it.",
      "Without that, and a midfield solution that no-one outside Carrington can foresee, Amorim might not make it to Brentford, let alone Liverpool.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is gunning to join a few current Premier League players an plenty of historic stars in making Man Utd regret they ever sold them.",

      "“Whether it’s somebody who’s already in the Premier League or somebody managing elsewhere, they will look at the market and see who is available.",

      "“If they did decide to go for somebody in the Premier League, there are a few options for them who would be able to come in and hit the ground running.",
      "“Glasner’s an interesting one as he is into the final year of his contract at Crystal Palace and still seems there’s no progress on talks there and what his situation is going to become next summer.",
      "“But look for United right now, they’re still remaining fully behind Ruben Amorim and they hope that he can turn things around.”",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘set’ their ‘price’ for academy product Kobbie Mainoo amid interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with a potential exit from Man Utd over recent months as he has fallen in the pecking order following the appointment of Ruben Amorim.",
      "United’s head coach is clearly not a huge fan of Mainoo, who has struggled to find a home in his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "This has contributed to Mainoo’s loss of form over the past year, and he looked to leave Man Utd after being an unused substitute in his side’s first couple of Premier League games this season.",
      "At the time, Serie A giants Napoli looked to sign Mainoo on loan, but this move was blocked by INEOS and Amorim, who felt they could not let him leave as his exit would have left them short on midfield options.",
      "READ: Kobbie Mainoo is crushing Ruben Amorim in fight for Manchester United future",
      "Subsequently, Amorim has eased Mainoo into the fold, and he was a bright spark in an otherwise dour afternoon as Man Utd lost 3-0 to Man City last weekend.",
      "However, it still remains to be seen whether Mainoo’s long-term future is at Man Utd, as he has also attracted interest from Real Madrid.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Real Madrid have ‘set their sights on finding successors to Luka Modric and Toni Kroos’ and Mainoo is their ‘main target’.",
      "Though it is also noted that a ‘deal will not be easy’ as Man Utd’s ‘clear stance’ on Mainoo’s future is a ‘bombshell’, because ‘if anyone wants to sign their star player, they’ll have to pay €90 million’ (around £78m).",
      "Man Utd can demand a sizable fee for Mainoo as he is under contract until 2027, though this reported price is higher than the £40m they requested in the summer.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘The most surprising thing is that the player himself is not going through the best of times at United. This situation has caused discontent in the player, who, according to various reports, has already expressed to those close to him his desire to change teams in the upcoming transfer window.",
      "‘Even so, Manchester United doesn’t seem willing to facilitate his departure. The English club’s strategy is to leverage the midfielder’s contract, which runs until 2027, to secure a multi-million-dollar transfer. Real Madrid, aware that it needs new blood for its midfield in the medium term, has made it clear that it will consider the deal, but always within financial parameters they consider reasonable.’",
      "Man Utd have made a bid of €50m plus Kobbie Mainoo in an attempt to convince Real Madrid to part with Federico Valverde, according to reports.",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United have been told to sell Bruno Fernandes and build around Kobbie Mainoo, but they face the ‘most excruciating’ outcome.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim will reportedly be sacked on one condition as Kobbie Mainoo’s situation at the club has baffled his Red Devils team-mates.",
      "Man Utd face ‘decision time’ on the futures of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Harry Maguire, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Former England striker Gary Lineker is “really worried” about the future of Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo after being “dismissed” by Ruben Amorim."

      "Their situation is not helped by Amorim still refusing to budge from his favoured 3-4-3 formation, despite it being clear for all to see that it is not working and doesn’t suit this group of players.",
      "All indications are that Amorim is bullishly insisting that his tactics are not the problem, even though he suggested on Friday that his side is “playing well until the boxes”, which indicates a pretty major flaw regarding system and/or personnel.",

      "READ: Rashford U-turn confirmed after Amorim somehow receives ‘pointed message’ from ‘toxic’ star",

      "‘However, returning to some form of European football is seen as essential by the United hierarchy.’",
      "First of all, it is pretty bold of talkSPORT to label this as an ‘exclusive’, because everyone knows that Man Utd’s minimum aim in any season is to qualify for some European competition, with this especially the case following another summer of huge spending.",
      "This is just common sense, but it does mean that Amorim is doomed, as a seismic change brought about by a change of formation and/or a couple of marquee signings in January is required to give Man Utd any hope of anything more than back-to-back bottom-half finishes in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim and Man Utd would have a greater chance of achieving an upturn in results and performances if there is a transition to a far more suited 4-2-3-1 formation, as the head coach is yet to come close to getting the maximum out of this squad.",
      "However, Ratcliffe’s assertion that this Man Utd side is ‘capable of a top-five finish’ is naive beyond belief and exposes his lack of know-how.",
      "The squads of Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea are far superior to Man Utd’s, while they can also make a strong case that Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United are better.",
      "So Man Utd may have earned ‘record revenue’ despite themselves, but the frailties of Amorim and Ratcliffe leave them miles behind their main rivals on the pitch, and there is more pain to come before INEOS gets the club back on an upward trajectory on the pitch.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",

      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "There have been some rumours that the Red Devils could consider a change if he doesn’t perform over the next three fixtures against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland, while other reports claim he retains the full support of the Man Utd board.",

      "It is difficult to view Marcus Rashford scoring two excellent and decisive Champions League goals in a narrow win for Barcelona against Newcastle as anything other than yet another reason to laugh and shake one’s head at Manchester United.",
      "Mediawatch hasn’t actually tried to see it from a different angle, so important and fun it is to marvel at how players immediately become good again once they leave Old Trafford.",
      "But it is inevitable that some would push that agenda too far, with this the top story from the MailOnline on Friday morning:",
      "‘The start of Marcus Rashford’s redemption? Barcelona star reveals why he is ‘better’ in subtle Man United dig as he is challenged to take the next step after stunning double in Newcastle win’",
      "A passing knowledge of Rashford and how he has generally publicly discussed Manchester United with respect and reverence despite that not always being reciprocated is all that’s required to know this ‘subtle Man United dig’ is almost definitely complete bumwater. But we are obliged to check out of interest to see just how daft it is.",
      "‘Rashford of course was delighted with his haul, saying: “It’s going good [in Spain], I am learning a lot as it is a new way of football, but I am enjoying it all and I think it is making me a better player.”‘",
      "The lads Amorim and Ratcliffe should know by now where to apply the ointment for that sick burn. It’s a dig so subtle you would be forgiven for not realising it existed.",
      "",

      "",
      "It is interesting to see Ian Herbert write in the Daily Mail about how Rashford bore ‘the look of a man who felt he owned the place and this stage,’ that ‘he has found something in Catalonia and the intensive Spanish lessons he is undertaking several times a week are more than mere diplomacy’.",
      "And there we all were thinking he had built a Duolingo streak just to keep up appearances.",
      "‘While Ruben Amorim treated him with thinly veiled contempt, Flick has given him professional respect,’ the deputy chief sports writer adds.",
      "Herbert goes on to say that while at times ‘it was hard to locate much evidence’ of Rashford ‘rediscovering the talent and belief he had put down somewhere and struggled to pick up,’ he ultimately provided, well, this:",
      "‘Evidence, before our very eyes, that the players we write off so soon are perhaps not the lost souls we believe them to be.’",
      "And that is interesting precisely because Herbert himself also wrote in January about how Rashford needed to be ‘talked out of his current sense of victimhood’ and was ‘apparently incapable of saving himself’.",
      "Which seems a little stronger than simply writing someone off or calling them a ‘lost soul’.",
      "It was obviously framed through the experience of Mark Hughes and how he ‘actually viewed wearing the No 10 jersey at Manchester United as a privilege and something to cherish,’ before taking the brave and bold decision to join Barcelona.",
      "And how Rashford, who has ‘a far higher opinion of himself’, ‘had rather imagined that he, too, would be heading to Barcelona’ but ‘as anyone could have predicted, Barca aren’t remotely interested in him, and neither is any other big club’.",
      "Oh, Ian. At least in the intervening eight months he has belatedly learned that the players we write off so soon – or refer to as ‘victims’ with high opinions of themselves who are ‘apparently incapable’ of turning things around – are perhaps not the lost souls we believe them to be.",
      "Although he did call Rashford a ‘boy, masquerading as a 27-year-old’ who ‘even makes Grealish seem like the soul of sobriety’ and is ‘viewed by some managers as too much of a risk, too toxic’ in July. So that lesson must have been recent. Thursday evening, maybe?",
      "This line from that January article is also pretty good:",
      "‘Goodness knows how Rashford – who says he feels ‘misunderstood’ and ‘disheartened’, despite years of coddling by United – would have dealt with what came Hughes’ way in Spain.’",
      "Fairly well so far. Three more goals this season and he’ll match what Hughes scored across 37 appearances in Spain. Not bad to say ‘Barca aren’t remotely interested’.",
      "",
      "The biggest bowl of piping hot nonsense is served up dutifully by Patrick Austen-Hardy of the Reach website stable, who predictably lap it up.",
      "For the Daily Mirror website, Rashford’s goal celebration obviously ‘speaks volumes’ despite him using said goal celebration since late 2022.",
      "Sticking his finger to his temple is, in all fairness, entirely specifically a ‘pointed message’. But to Amorim? When Rashford has been doing that for almost three years now?",
      "‘Considering the manner of his celebration, it may have even been a message to Amorim…’",
      "True. It may also have been a message to Donald Trump, or AI, or that weird Liverpool fan. Or maybe it was just something he has done for absolutely ages, and well before Amorim even came into his orbit.",
      "",
      "And of course, Rashford reminding the world he can be quite good at football has to prompt the return of just the dirt worst headline trope.",
      "‘Man Utd Marcus Rashford transfer recall rules explained and if winger can return’ – Daily Express website.",
      "The short version is that a) they have no idea if Rashford can be recalled, b) they acknowledge he probably can’t, going by how loan deals of this profile are generally structured, and c) even if he can, he absolutely won’t be because none of the parties involved will want to.",
      "But there was obviously mileage in pretending Rashford might have been recalled from his Aston Villa loan so why not bring that energy into a full season of speculating if and whether Amorim might bring him back to exile him and decimate his market value further?",

      "Here’s one stat-based nugget for each Premier League club after the first four games of the season, with numbers from the very excellent fbref.com.",
      "",
      "Arsenal have nine goals from 14 shots on target. To put that in some perspective, doom-spiralling crisis club West Ham have had 19 shots on target this season. Liverpool and Chelsea, joint top-scorers at this stage with Arsenal on nine, each have 21 shots on target.",

      "READ: ‘No more than four’ Emery signings a ‘resounding success’ as Aston Villa narrative flips",
      "",
      "And indeed more than everyone apart from Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool. But they rank only tenth for shooting accuracy, and have the sixth bottom for non-penalty xG per shot at 0.09.",
      "So lots of shooting, but not necessarily from the most optimum position. It’s the xG equivalent of lobbing enough balls at enough coconuts until you win a goldfish. Although we will need a different shorthand for expected goldfish, because xG is taken and it will get confusing.",
      "",
      "They still prioritise quality over quantity when it comes to shooting. Only Burnley have attempted fewer shots on goal, but only Fulham make their attempts from a closer average distance than Brentford’s 14.1 yards. Brentford’s non-penalty xG/shot of 0.13 is the third highest in the division.",
      "",
      "Only Manchester United have a lower goals-per-shot number, apart from poor old Leeds (still waiting for a first non-penalty goal, and thus on 0.00 in this penalty-excluding stat) and Aston Villa (still waiting for any kind of goal of any sort)",
      "",
      "We don’t claim to be boffin-like stats experts, clearly, but having the fewest shots of any team in the division (30) while allowing the most shots of any team in the division (76, which is already 21 more than anyone else) doesn’t seem a sustainable gameplan.",

      "The Cottagers’ average distance for attempts on goal is 13.8 yards, with Brentford and Tottenham – and there’s an obvious common factor there – the only other teams below 15 yards on average. Newcastle’s average shooting distance is a distinctly pot-shot 19.5 yards.",

      "City’s npxG/shot figure of 0.17 is also the highest in the division, ahead of Crystal Palace on 0.14.",
      "That’s why Erling Haaland will probably win the Golden Boot.",
      "",
      "Bearing in mind that the total shots count doesn’t include penalties, we’re struggling to remember a single one of these, but apparently United have had 68 attempts on goal – nine more than Chelsea and Liverpool and well over twice as many as Burnley, who have managed the same number of total goals as United.",

      "West Ham are 5.5 goals worse off, having conceded 11 goals from 5.5 npxG. Nobody else allows teams closer to their goal to shoot (average distance 13.3 yards) they concede 0.23 goals per shot allowed; the next worst figure in the league here is Manchester United’s 0.17.",

      "Amorim is under serious pressure with Man Utd currently 14th in the Premier League with one win from their opening four games. They were also knocked out in the second round of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Their only victory came via a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty against newly-promoted Burnley, while they have been beaten by Manchester City and Arsenal and drawn at Fulham.",
      "After finishing 15th last season, Man Utd backed Amorim with a £230million transfer kitty as Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were among those to join the club in an overhaul of the Portuguese’s attack.",
      "The Red Devils’ hierarchy are reportedly aiming to remain patient with the 40-year-old head coach despite no signs of improvement on the pitch, even with three supposedly elite attacking additions.",
      "READ: Every Premier League transfer confirmed in the summer of 2025",
      "Amorim might be safe for now, but the club’s co-owner Ratcliffe flew in for talks with the head coach on Thursday evening, according to The Athletic.",
      "It’s stated that the talks were ‘pre-planned’ as Ratcliffe arrived at the club’s Carrington training ground ‘for a series of meetings’.",
      "While Ratcliffe’s visit has been on the agenda for a while, discussing the club’s poor form with Amorim was a top priority.",
      "The report states:",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe flew into the club’s Carrington training ground in a helicopter on Thursday for a series of meetings, including with the team’s head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "United sources, speaking anonymously as they are not authorised to speak publicly on the matter, insisted Ratcliffe’s visit to Carrington was long planned and included time with Amorim. However, the team’s form was on the agenda and Ratcliffe was seeking to work through issues facing Amorim at the club.",

      "This Big Weekend is one that could quite conceivably end with either Arsenal or Man City or indeed both an uncomfortable distance adrift of Liverpool even at this early stage, while all eyes will once again be on Ruben Amorim and his weirdly admirable ongoing insistence on denying objective reality. It’s a tactic we might all like to consider in these troubled times. Much easier than the alternative.",
      "And another Premier League weekend arrives with the really big question: will this finally be the game where Aston Villa score a goal?",

      "We don’t know.",

      "Neither would probably be choosing to play the other at the end of a weekend when the scoreboard pressure could be absolutely huge.",
      "If Liverpool have beaten Everton, then the scenarios in play involve either both these teams being six points adrift already, or City slipping nine points off the early pace, or Arsenal being five off the running and City eight away.",
      "It does very much feel like a game that might be most easily enjoyed by Liverpool fans basking in post-derby glow than either of the teams actually involved.",
      "But even without the whole ‘bollocksing up the title race in mid-September’ hoopla, there is still much to commend this fixture.",
      "That’s been true for a good few years now, since Arsenal managed to shake the habit of getting slapped silly every time City turned up.",
      "And last year Mikel Arteta even managed to shake off his usual big-game timidity to hand out a fearful thrashing of their own, with all the wonderful ‘stay humble’ saltiness that followed.",
      "Worth remembering also that that particular Arsenal statement of intent in the title race was followed by managing only one win from their next four games against Leicester, West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United.",
      "There’s a draining emotional heft to this fixture that both teams could probably do without just as the real two-games-a-week business kicks in, and every chance that no matter what happens at the Emirates the real winners are to be found at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Liverpool have played five proper competitive games of football this season. In three of those games they have eased themselves into a 2-0 lead, promptly p*ssed said 2-0 lead all up the wall, and then just gone and scored a ridiculous late winner anyway.",
      "It’s a fantastic bit, and long may it continue. It’s so rare for the best team in the country to also be the most fun to watch, and we should all try to cherish it while it remains the case here.",
      "The reason, most obviously, the best team is rarely the most fun is because the best team in the country is, almost by definition, unlikely to be one prone to repeated acts of nonsense. Liverpool certainly weren’t like this last season, and we much prefer this season’s approach as a neutral.",
      "The best team in the country might be the most electric going forward, or the most reliably secure at the back, or even both. But rare indeed is the season where the best team look simultaneously so vulnerable yet so inevitable.",
      "And with this newly impish, Jack Grealish-inspired Everton side looking far more capable than most Toffees of recent vintage of exploiting those Liverpool vulnerabilities we really could be in for a classic Merseyside derby.",

      "",
      "It’s now one goal in his last 11 Aston Villa appearances for a striker Villa desperately need to start firing and soon.",

The Black Cats have two wins from two at home, and Villa need to find something soon to avoid this season spiralling into something truly unpleasant.",
      "They are still, preposterously, yet to score a single league goal a month into the campaign, crashed out of the Carabao at the first attempt – although there was at least a goal in that one, so progress, we guess? – and from next week have the added workload of European engagement to consider.",
      "It’s not that uncommon for a player to be in some need of the cliched one-to-go-in-off-his-backside at this stage of the season, and Watkins is very much there. But it’s something a bit different when a whole team is waiting for some buttock-based goalscoring good fortune to kick start an entire season.",
      "We mustn’t be too dramatic. We’re not yet in a Fear For Them situation with Villa, we really aren’t. But if this weekend goes wrong then it’s going to get harder and harder to ignore the warning signs.",

      "What’s really fun is that right now our money is firmly on c).",
      "Last season, we’d have said that Chelsea at home wasn’t a bad fixture for an under-pressure United and their Beleaguered Manager. One of the quirks of last season was that United – before and after Amorim’s arrival – were very good at sorting out the dreadful relegated teams and perfectly capable of summoning up some kind of dormant muscle memory of their glorious past when faced with any of their former rivals.",
      "They could be relied on to put up a decent show against your Liverpools, your Arsenals, your Man Citys and the Chelseas of this world as well as beating the very worst teams; it was the vast array of teams in the middle that United had problems with seemingly every single time.",
      "But this season they have already celebrated a played-quite-well-actually cup when losing 1-0 to Arsenal and been thoroughly outplayed in the end by Manchester City in the derby.",
      "We’re not yet quite sure about Chelsea this season, either, with an inconsistent start after their Club World Cup antics suggesting they might not quite be the title contenders we thought they could be.",
      "They really should be able to sort out United, though, possessing as they do exactly the kind of game-controlling midfielders Amorim so conspicuously lacks and all manner of tricky, clever forwards capable of exploiting the ongoing confusion that reigns within a defensive structure where, if anything for me, Clive, United sometimes have too many players back with the result that nobody’s quite sure who’s supposed to be doing what.",
      "We know by now that Amorim isn’t going to change. He will live by his back three and die by his back three, with the only question really just how overtly he will attempt to goad United into handing him that lovely £12m pay-off if/when it does all go wrong again against another team United used to consider a major rival really not that long ago.",
      "",
      "Fourth meets sixth at the King Power in what already feels like a pretty significant early clash between two key promotion contenders, with Leicester yet to truly convince or stamp their obvious class on the division since dropping back into it.",
      "Coventry, meanwhile, remain unbeaten yet have foolishly concentrated far too many of their division-leading 15 goals into two big daft wins when they could have been far more usefully spread around. Silly.",
      "",
      "You can’t say fairer than a lovely slice of Sunday lunchtime-ish Rome derby action to set you up for the big afternoon of Barclays to follow. Especially with both teams smarting ahead of this one after disappointing defeats last time out against Sassuolo and Torino.",
      "In a just and right world it would be on Channel 4, of course, rather than so-called ‘DAZN’, but one can’t have everything.",
      "",
      "Having pretty adroitly in the end avoided Champions League humiliation at the hands of Brann, Elisabeth Terland’s hat-trick helping them overcome a 1-0 first-leg deficit with a bit to spare, attention turns back to the WSL for United and the visit of Arsenal.",
      "It’s a battle between two of the four teams still boasting 100 per cent records after two games of the new season, and one that might give us a few clues about which if either of these teams might have the best chance of ending Chelsea’s seemingly unstoppable reign of terror.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he hopes to get the time to show how his system will evolve, but insists not even the Pope will make him change it right now for fear of what the players will think of him.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" he said. \"Not once [have I thought about changing]. Not even the Pope [can make me], it will not change.\"",
      "Amorim has maintained he will stick with his 3-4-2-1 formation despite having the worst win percentage of any United boss since the Second World War and overseeing their worst start in the Premier League for 33 years.",
      "United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference - since Amorim was appointed last November.",
      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",
      "However, he is concerned about what his squad would think if he changed now and hopes he will be in charge long enough for it to happen.",
      "\"If I'm a player and I have a coach with a lot of pressure to change the system and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"When you think about the impact of any decision on the team, everything is important.",
      "\"This will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way. It will change, I hope to have the time to change.\"",
      "One of the issues with Amorim's system has been in midfield where Bruno Fernandes has played in a deeper role. Amorim believes he is still having an impact higher up the pitch and is integral in making them dominate games.",
      "\"Bruno wants all the freedom in the world but even when he played a No 10 role, it's getting the ball back,\" he said. \"Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box but he's getting there and is near the box and can have shots.",
      "\"I want Bruno to be more deep to have more possession to try and control more of the game. We are doing that. Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit in front, maybe because (Matheus) Cunha is not there. I'm trying to balance the team and imagine the game.",
      "\"I see Bruno [doing] well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further but he has a job to do. The important thing is not Bruno playing well, it's the team playing well and winning football games.\"",
      "Amorim believes the data is showing improvement although believes they lack belief compared to Liverpool, who have been winning games late on.",
      "He said: \"It's belief, confidence, aggression. It's everything. Sometimes what we call luck. It's the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"Liverpool are winning all the games in the 90th minute, it's something about the teams that are winning to have that feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well but something is going to go wrong.",
      "\"We need to change that but just with wins. If you look at the goals against Man City, Fulham, we scored against Burnley, we are good in the game but then we draw. All these moments I think we can do better. It's our fault.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho returns to Old Trafford for the first time since his £40m move to Chelsea after being told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.",
      "Asked if the transfer could backfire on Man Utd, Amorim said: \"I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing for the opponent, [or] what people are going to say in the end if the player plays well. They are good players and they play well if things happen. My only focus is winning the game.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Saturday 20 September 2025 12:26, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight on the Premier League card, predicting more misery for West Ham and Graham Potter.",
      "David Moyes is one of the best pound-for-pound managers in English football. Of that there is no doubt.",
      "But his away record against the big boys - notably Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City - it's dreadful. And this weekend, that's the big red elephant in the room for Everton. Since taking the West Ham job, Moyes has managed a team 19 times away at those three big clubs and has been beaten 18 times.",
      "There's lots of talk about renewed hope, a more attack-minded game plan and potentially a charge towards the European places, but it's really difficult to see how Moyes' approach at Anfield is going to lead to any points being banked.",
      "Everton will give it their all on derby day, of course, and will be tough to break down, but Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals at 11/8 with Sky Bet is a fantastic price to attack.",
      "Thomas Frank has worked wonders at Spurs in a remarkably short time, tightening up what was once a leaky defence into a disciplined, well-organised unit. They have transformed from conceding goals regularly to frustrating even the most deadly attackers. Erling Haaland has scored once in eight of his last nine starts - the anomaly was Spurs.",
      "Just one goal conceded from four games with three clean sheets is an impressive return.",
      "Their defensive shape is sharper and the backline communicates with newfound cohesion with a focus on defending central areas of their box so astutely - a similar trait to the defensive unit Frank had at Brentford.",
      "This improvement in the Spurs process means Brighton, known for attacking flair and chance creation, but a historical underperformance in front of goal, will struggle to break down Frank's resilient Spurs side. Expect a cagey, tactical battle where chances are hard to come by. The under 2.5 goals line at 6/5 with Sky Bet makes plenty of appeal.",
      "The abrupt managerial change at Nottingham Forest remains a difficult scenario to assess with serious questions about stability and style of play, and with Ange Postecoglou still settling in, Forest's performance levels and results could dip.",
      "The players need time to adapt to new tactics and expectations, and that uncertainty is never a good look in the Premier League's unforgiving environment.",
      "Meanwhile, Burnley showed just how difficult it is to break them down in their recent defeat to Liverpool, where for 93 minutes they delivered a masterclass in defensive resilience. Scott Parker's side remain rock-solid, disciplined and incredibly tough to beat based on the early signs.",
      "Backing a tight game with under 2.5 goals looks a smart move here at 4/5 with Sky Bet with no surprises from this end if Burnley were to nick it.",
      "Graham Potter arrived at West Ham bringing fresh ideas and a calm, measured approach. But that calmness has started to look more like cold silence and in a place like West Ham, that just doesn't cut it.",
      "This is a fanbase that are full of passion for their club, one that want a manager who can not only deliver results but also spark something special and embody the club. They want real connection. That's where Potter's lack of charisma is really hurting him.",
      "A manager like David Moyes before him had that grit, the personality and an emotional spark that could rally the team and fans alike when it mattered. Moyes was great in these pressurised home matches where his job was reportedly on the line. He won every time.",
      "I'm not sure Potter's quiet and measured style is going to help matters here for a team that are on their worst-ever home winless run at the London Stadium.",
      "Things could get ugly, so backing Crystal Palace with a -1 handicap at 7/2 with Sky Bet looks the way in.",
      "Anton Stach might be a player we're talking about more in the next few months - he has quietly but effectively stamped his mark on Leeds since arriving, bringing energy, intelligent positioning and a calming presence in midfield.",
      "His box-to-box runs and eye for a key pass have steadily increased Leeds' creativity and control, even if the goals haven't quite come yet. Stach is the only Premier League player to reach double figures for shots (10) and chances created (10) this season.",
      "It's only a matter of time before Stach notches a goal or an assist - the signs are there.",
      "Against Wolves, who've shown more defensive lapses this season than in the early stages of Vitor Pereira's tenure, Leeds will be pushing hard, and Stach looks perfectly placed to capitalise on any opportunities. He is 11/4 with Sky to score or assist. It's a price that's going to land soon.",
      "For all their obvious struggles, Manchester United's attack have been creating chances this season. Just one goal scored from open play to a backdrop of 5.01 worth of expected goals is a significant underperformance and suggests big moments are being created, just not taken.",
      "As is the case in football, those metrics usually correct themselves over a bigger sample size, therefore investing in United to start getting on a goal-train could be a profitable and wise move.",
      "My eyes are drawn to Bryan Mbeumo to score at 5/2 with Sky Bet here. He's getting into the right areas and has hit the target six times from his 18 shots this season, scoring against Burnley. A big moment looks around the corner for a player who - for a change - seems to be thriving in the environment at Old Trafford.",
      "Away wins are on the rise in the Premier League - and it's shaking up the traditional 'home advantage' narrative we've all been used to for years and one that is still factored - perhaps too heavily - into the way markets are priced up.",
      "Managers are more willing to take the game to their opponents and possess much more data insight from analysts into the weaknesses of opponents.",
      "Gone are the days when away teams would just hunker down and hope for a draw - games are there to be won now.",
      "Last season, the away-win strike-rate rose to 35 per cent from 380 fixtures. That figure 15 years ago in the Premier League was just 24 per cent. And Brentford look a big price for the away win at 11/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Fulham have won only four of their last 14 Premier League games at Craven Cottage and were very lacklustre and fortunate to win 1-0 over Leeds in their last outing. There might be a bit of staleness creeping in under Marco Silva that hasn't been factored into their win probabilities yet.",
      "Andoni Iraola is creating a strong body of work when it comes to facing Eddie Howe.",
      "When these two meet, Iraola's tactical set-up tends to frustrate Newcastle's game which is centred on physicality. Iraola's teams are brilliant at shutting down space, disrupting patterns of play and hitting on the counter with sharp, clinical transitions.",
      "It's that balance of defensive rigidity and quickfire attacking that has consistently caught Howe's sides off guard. In four meetings, Iraola is unbeaten against Howe, winning twice, and the underlying data paints a very clear picture of how Bournemouth have dominated the Toon.",
      "In those four matches, Iraola's team have averaged an expected goals per 90 of 2.4 - a huge figure. The home win is likely to be very popular at 13/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The Aston Villa downward trajectory wasn't something I saw coming.",
      "And while they remain in this malaise it's hard to trust them to win football matches when priced up as the favourites at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The glaring issue is their lack of cutting edge in the final third. Chance creation? It's been painfully limited.",
      "Failing to score in four matches can happen in a low scoring sport like football but the underlying numbers are extremely worrying. To put up a 0.77 expected goals tally per 90 from a relatively soft set of fixtures is a horrendous return - only Wolves have posted a lower figure.",
      "To carry this goal drought weight with you to a place like the Stadium of Light, where the home crowd is a 12th man and the team is expertly drilled, doesn't inspire much confidence that this is where things will spark for Villa.",
      "The home side on the draw no bet at 6/4 with Sky Bet looks the way to play.",
      "Gabriel Magalhaes vs Erling Haaland is always a riveting and blockbuster sideshow when these two rivals meet.",
      "There's animosity and with it comes excellent betting angles surrounding Haaland's foul output. In eight meetings where he's come up against Gabriel, the bulldozing City forward has made 16 fouls, so working to a two-per-game average.",
      "That is a spike on his usual foul data and something which is not factored into the way Haaland's foul probabilities are priced up by the traders.",
      "That's an edge right there in our favour.",
      "To keep up this average of two fouls per game, Haaland is available at a whopping 11/4 with Sky Bet, implying a probability of just 26 per cent. I'd have the chances closer to 50 per cent in this type of fiery fixture where Arsenal should edge it.",

      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited the training ground to meet with Ruben Amorim this week following their poor start to the season; Amorim: \"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win\"",
      "Friday 19 September 2025 14:16, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has played down the significance of a meeting with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe at the club's training ground this week, insisting their talks were \"normal\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract,\" Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe's visit.",
      "\"No, it's normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it's a long project. He said many times, 'This is my third season.' For me, it's not. But normal things.",
      "\"I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.",
      "\"So, a normal meeting, and we had several, but in this moment, it's normal that people pay attention to that.\"",
      "Amorim is under scrutiny having only won one of Manchester United's first four games of the season and also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town.",
      "\"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win,\" he said.",
      "The 40-year-old insists he sees improvement in their performances but admits they need to improve at both ends of the pitch.",
      "\"Last year I was very critical of the way we played,\" Amorim added. \"I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "Amorim has had a free week with his players to prepare for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on the training pitch and says they have focused their efforts on being more effective in the boxes.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and the next game, and to prepare different things,\" he said. \"We are playing well until we reach the boxes.",
      "\"We need to be more clinical. The number of shots and the xG are good, but if you don't score, it doesn't matter.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games.",
      "\"We have to maintain the way we're playing and improving in our box and the opposition's box - that was the focus of the week. Especially against Chelsea, when they cross, they are the side with the most players in the box.\"",
      "The Manchester United boss confirmed he will be able to call on Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Chelsea but Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot are unavailable.",
      "Amorim bemoaned the absence of Martinez, who is edging towards a return to fitness having not featured since suffering a knee injury in February.",
      "\"When you recover from that injury, you have time where you recover a lot of things fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step,\" he said.",
      "\"We've missed him a lot. Especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does. But he's always there, in every meeting and when he finishes he stays to watch training.",
      "\"We need him in this team.\"",

      "Between the Lines returns with an in-depth look at Ruben Amorim's system and the reasons why Man Utd are struggling to make it work; Sunday's 3-0 loss to Man City leaves them with a worse record than any ever-present Premier League side since last year",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Tom Stitson",
      "Friday 19 September 2025 10:30, UK",
      "Manchester United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City in Sunday's derby increased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim and raised more questions about his favoured 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",

      "Man Utd accounts for 2024/25 show record revenues of £666.5m; total operating expenses down 4.5 per cent, and employee expenses by 14.1 per cent, or £51.5m; more than 250 staff members made redundant in first round of cuts; net losses of £33m down from £113m in 2024",
      "Wednesday 17 September 2025 23:10, UK",
      "Manchester United shares dropped sharply despite achieving record revenues for 2024/25 of £666.5m - after the club still made an overall loss of £33m.",
      "The club's annual accounts showed that they earned greater revenue than ever before despite not having Champions League football last season, in which they finished 15th in the Premier League - their lowest top-flight finish in 51 years.",
      "Manchester United shares dropped by eight per cent in trading in response on the New York Stock Exchange, but rebounded to finish 6.28 per cent down at $15.38 (£11.29).",
      "United still saw revenue marginally increase by 0.7 per cent to £666.5m, with the accounts for the year ending June 30, 2025 showing their operating loss fell from £69.3m to £18.4m compared to the previous 12 months.",
      "United bosses have hailed their five-year shirt sponsorship with Snapdragon as the most valuable of its kind in world sport, and that played a significant role in boosting revenues with four years remaining on that deal.",
      "United posted record commercial revenues of £333.3m while achieving record matchday revenues of £160.3m.",
      "Overall losses dropped from £113.2m to £33m after co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe oversaw a raft of cost-cutting measures.",
      "The accounts show total operating expenses were £733.6m, a decrease of £34.9m, or 4.5 per cent, and employee expenses by 14.1 per cent, or £51.5m, to £313.2m.",
      "This was achieved by several high-earning players, who were not part of the first-team plans, going out on loan or being sold, and wider club restructuring. More than 250 members of staff at Old Trafford were made redundant in the first round of cuts.",
      "The club said they spent £36.6m in terms of exceptional items, which included pay-offs to employees as part of their \"transformation plan\" along with former boss Erik ten Hag and his staff.",
      "The results released on Wednesday showed broadcasting revenue for the 12 months ending June 30, 2025 decreased by £48.9m to £172.9m after the men's team played in the Europa League rather than the Champions League.",
      "More cost-cutting and difficult decisions are expected as INEOS completes its restructuring of the football club.",
      "Ratcliffe warned United would have gone \"bust at Christmas\" if they had not taken \"really tough decisions\" - something chief executive Omar Berrada believes will help moving forwards.",
      "\"As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas,\" he said.",
      "\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men's and women's first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long term.",
      "\"Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",
      "\"To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United.",
      "\"Our commercial business remains strong as we continue to deliver appealing products and experiences for our fans, and best-in-class value to our partners.",
      "\"As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.\"",
      "United are expecting the next financial year to bring in revenue of £640m to £660m despite being without European football for the first time since 2014/15.",
      "\"The Manchester United bosses will be pleased with these figures, which they will feel show real progress towards cutting costs and growing revenues. But theirs is a long-term plan to rejuvenate and regenerate the club, and while record revenues show that the club still has a huge commercial pull as one of the biggest in world football, fans shouldn't think that will mean bumper spending in the January window, or next summer.",
      "\"Deloitte said in January that United was the fourth biggest club in the world, only behind Real Madrid, Manchester City and PSG in terms of revenue. These latest figures will show that they have maintained that strong position, despite their worst performance on the pitch since 1974, when the club was relegated. A lack of Champions League football and a 15th-placed finish in the league cost them tens of millions of pounds.",
      "\"But the chief executive's statement has made the strategy clear: make United more and more commercially successful, and in future, there will be more and more funds to invest in the football squad, which they hope and believe will then lead to better results on the pitch, and a return to the days when they won trophies.",
      "\"We should not forget the underlying financial problems that United have, however, been brought about by the Glazer family takeover in the early 2000s.",
      "\"That 'leveraged buy-out' effectively lumped £790m of debt onto the club, which the Glazers used to buy a controlling stake at Old Trafford.",
      "\"These latest figures show that debt has reduced somewhat (by around £39m to £471.9m), but that reduction is because of a change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, rather than any of the debt being specifically paid off.",
      "\"In addition, the \"revolving credit facility\" that the club has (in effect, like a personal credit card) now has £165.1m of additional debt on it - up from £35.6m last year.",
      "\"While the record revenues and reduced losses are no doubt a sign that United are making impressive commercial strides off the pitch, the Glazer debt and the continued under-performance of the team on the pitch are two nagging negatives.\"",
