      "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo has explained why he and his teammates need to rally around Bruno Fernandes during the club's current struggles. United were handed another defeat at the weekend as they lost 3-1 to Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "The game saw Mbeumo go to the home of his former club, with the forward leaving Brentford during the summer transfer window to complete a £71million switch to United. The loss was United's third in the Premier League this season and fourth across all competitions.",
      "Fernandes missed a penalty during the defeat to Brentford, having also missed from the spot against Fulham earlier in the season. With results going against United for much of the season, Mbeumo says that he and the rest of the United squad must support their club captain.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",
      "United's next match will see them take on Sunderland at Old Trafford in the Premier League at the weekend. Ruben Amorim and Co. will be determined to secure all three points in what will be United;s final match before the October international break.",
      "Part of the challenge that Mbeumo has faced has been playing alongside fellow new signings at United this season. Mbeumo has been joined by Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in completing moves to Old Trafford this summer, with the Cameroon international believing there will be an upturn in results over time.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" said Mbeumo.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United co-owners Ineos are said to be concerned that Ruben Amorim will choose to resign before being sacked in a bid to save his managerial reputation. The Portuguese head coach has struggled at Old Trafford since being appointed in November 2024 and scrutiny is growing on him.",
      "Amorim led United to the Europa League final last season but they lost to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao. They also finished in a woeful 16th to ensure they comfortably finished outside the European places, recording their worst-ever finish of the Premier League era in the process.",
      "The 2025-26 campaign has not started well, either. Despite beating Chelsea prior to Saturday's trip to Brentford, Amorim's men have slumped to three league defeats and were also dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "In total, Amorim has led United to just 19 victories out of 49 matches, leading to serious questions over his future. The i Paper though, say Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are willing to stick by their manager. It is claimed the British billionaire is eager to stick to his long-term outlook on United and they do not want to lunge into another sacking.",
      "However, there are fears around the club that Ineos will have no say in the matter, with the report adding that some insiders believe Amorim will almost definitely walk away from United before he is given the sack by Ratcliffe as he is becoming worn down by the constant criticism following defeats. The United chief is thought to consider these to be 'knee-jerk' reactions and he is shocked by the scrutiny that has grown on him during his reign.",
      "Despite all the speculation around the future of Amorim, there is believed to be no replacement being lined up yet for the Portuguese head coach. No managers are thought to have been contacted by United to replace Amorim although Ratcliffe remains an admirer of Gareth Southgate following his impressive stint with the England national team.",
      "United return to action this Saturday when they host high-flying Sunderland at Old Trafford.",

      "Michael Carrick could be an option to step in at Manchester United on an interim basis should the club decide to sack Ruben Amorim and seek a new manager in the coming weeks.",
      "The pressure and scrutiny on Amorim, 40, continues to grow after another disappointing result at the weekend with United falling to a 3-1 defeat away at Brentford. That result has only intensified talk of Amorim's torrid Premier League record since taking over at Old Trafford last November, which has seen him muster just 34 points from 33 games.",
      "Manchester United's top brass are understood to be standing by their man for now. But with Amorim's position looking more perilous by the week, noise over potential replacements continue to grow in the background, including the prospect of an Old Trafford return for Carrick.",
      "The Sun claim that Carrick is among the caretaker options open to United should they decide a change of manageris necessary. The former Middlesbrough manager, 44, took charge of two games for United in late 2021 when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked and spent time on the club's coaching staff following a 12-year stint as a Red Devils player.",
      "The report notes that Carrick is still close to the United set-up as his 16-year-old son, Jacy, is part of the club's academy. He recently worked as a pundit for Amazon Prime's coverage of the Champions League, interviewing Tottenham head coach, Thomas Frank.",
      "Intriguingly, Solskjaer tipped Carrick as a future Manchester United manager during an interview with The Athletic in 2023. “I am 100 per cent sure that Michael will be the manager of Manchester United if he wants to be,” he said. “I cannot see him not being the Manchester United manager.”",
      "Solskjaer added: “He’s a winner, a massive winner, yet he stays in control of his emotions. He knows what he wants and doesn’t lose his rag. He’ll never be emotional and fight with the players.”",
      "While Carrick could be turned to on a caretaker basis, Manchester United have other coaches in the Premier League who they admire and may consider as possible replacements for Amorim, including Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Fabian Hurzeler.",

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has already expressed his opinion on the newly reintroduced Tyrell Malacia after he returned to the first-team squad this week. The Dutch full-back was one of five players who created a 'Bomb Squad' at Carrington at the beginning of the summer transfer window.",
      "Malacia, along with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, all requested to leave the club before the window closed. Four of those members managed to solidify moves away but Malacia's switch to La Liga club Elche fell through.",
      "When most of the European windows closed on September 1, it was mooted that Malacia could be sold to Turkey however it was claimed that a switch to Eyupspor was blocked by the player. Now, after undertaking an individual training plan away from the club, Malacia is being reintroduced into the first-team fold with sessions among the U21s being used as a starting point.",
      "The return of Malacia into the first-team picture again will likely be received with a mixed reaction from United supporters. The defender spent the entirety of the 2023/24 season out injured and was signed by Erik ten Hag for a completely different system.",
      "However, there is no point having a player on the books who is not going to be involved with the first-team, so United will be attempting to get their money's worth out of him. Whether or not Keane will be happy to see him back as an option is a different matter.",
      "Back in January 2023, Keane was livid with Malacia for his lack of concentration in the FA Cup fourth round clash with then-Championship club, Reading. With the score goalless at the break, the Dutchman was put under the microscope by Keane after he failed to spot Junior Hoilett lurking at the back post.",
      "Unleashing his thoughts, Keane told ITV Sport at the time: \"Honestly, what are these defenders thinking? It drives me mad, it’s like he [Malacia] is surprised somebody is next to him.",
      "\"Just switch on, be aware of what’s around you on a football pitch. Drives me crazy.\"",
      "The last thing United will need is more indecision in the defensive line following the 3-1 defeat to Brentford. That loss and the mistakes made in it, has led to pressure mounting on Ruben Amorim and talk building around his future in Manchester.",
      "Gareth Southgate is one of the names supposedly being lined up to replace Amorim should Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos decide that enough is enough. For now though, it seems Amorim will be in charge for the visit of Sunderland this weekend.",

      "“I’ve tried my hand at management and it didn’t work out too well, so I get it,” said the former Derby County, DC United, Birmingham City and Plymouth Argyle manager. Didn’t work out too well?",
      "Wayne has got that spot-on. In his 178 matches as a manager, Rooney has recorded only 45 victories. That is a win percentage of 25.3. Even in his difficult 11 months at Old Trafford, Amorim’s win percentage is 36.73. Across his 308-game managerial career, it is 65.91.",
      "Of course, just because Rooney has proven to be an unsuccessful manager should not make his criticism of Amorim’s regime invalid. It might undermine his opinion but the suggestion from Rooney that Amorim’s tenure looks doomed is not an uncommon one.",
      "Rooney’s fellow scouser, Jamie Carragher, has waded in. He said: “You don’t want to see anyone lose their job but it is better for everybody if they shake hands and move on.”",
      "Well, for starters, there is no guarantee it will be better for everybody if Amorim leaves. And more significantly, we are only SIX games into the Premier League season.",
      "Manchester United have seven points from those six games - nothing to write home about but one more than Newcastle United and Aston Villa have accrued, one fewer than Chelsea’s total and three fewer than Manchester City have on the board.",
      "They have been inconsistent across those half a dozen matches, for sure, and their defending in the defeat at Brentford was abysmal. But while the only statistic that really matters is the number in the points column, there are figures that hint at a positive direction at the start of Amorim’s first full season in charge.",
      "United are top of the expected goals chart and have had more attempts on goal - they average just under 16 per fixture - than any other Premier League team. Sure, these figures would appear to confirm the veracity of the old line about lies, damned lies and statistics, but perhaps United have not been as bad as most pundits say.",
      "The many who believe Amorim should be sacked before he has reached the anniversary of his appointment point to his overall body of work rather than the first half-dozen Premier League games of this season. And, true, 34 points from 33 Premier League games is relegation form.",
      "But Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his football operation have seemingly decided that this season - the one for which he could prepare properly - would essentially be the real start of Amorim’s project. And they should not judge a real start after only six Premier League matches.",
      "The three marquee summer signings - Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - will take time to settle into a rhythm. That is normal.",
      "And it is going to take more than one transfer window - and the acquisition of at least one high-quality central midfielder - to sort out the deep-rooted squad problems at Old Trafford. No, this is not good enough from Manchester United and Amorim has an awful lot to prove.",
      "But while there are already a lot of things Ratcliffe and his chosen ones have got wrong since buying into United early last year, giving Amorim plenty of time to get things right is not one of them. They are right to keep the faith.",

      "Rashford scored his first two goals in their Champions League victory over Newcastle and has provided an assist in each of his last four La Liga matches. After losing his place in Ruben Amorim's squad, the forward spent the latter half of the campaign at Aston Villa.",

      "Either way, Barcelona are believed to be delighted with Rashford's performances and attitude since his arrival at the club. Rashford left United after racking up over 420 appearances and netting 138 goals, though his attitude had been questioned at time.",
      "Having made a name for himself in 2016, the England international enjoyed his best season to date under Erik ten Hag in 2022/23. He contributed 30 goals and 12 assists to help United secure a Champions League spot, before managing just eight goals the following year.",
      "Much has been said about the academy graduate's decline in England, but Deco has now offered his perspective on the matter. In an interview with Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, the former Barcelona midfielder was asked whether a decision on Rashford's long-term future had already been made.",

      "Former Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick has previously delivered a ringing endorsement of Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, who has been linked with the Old Trafford hot seat. Current United boss Ruben Amorim is facing mounting pressure after Saturday's crushing 3-1 loss at Brentford.",
      "It is understood that Amorim still has the support of United's hierarchy for now, but speculation over his future refuses to go away. The Portuguese head coach has managed to secure only 34 points from a potential 99 in the Premier League since taking the reins.",
      "United bosses were compelled to publicly back their manager following last month's embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town. Reports suggest United have drawn up a three-man shortlist of potential successors should Amorim fail to turn things around.",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate, Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola and Glasner are all reportedly being considered as the heat intensifies on Amorim to halt United's worrying slump.",
      "Rangnick, who struggled during his own temporary stint at Old Trafford in 2021/22, has previously sung Glasner's praises in glowing terms.",
      "\"For me, Oliver Glasner is currently one of the most exciting coaches - not only in Germany, but in all of Europe. An absolute top coach,\" Rangnick told LAOLA1 in March 2023.",
      "Glasner has been showered with accolades for his sterling work at Palace, who are currently enjoying an 18-match unbeaten run across all competitions.",
      "The South London squad clinched the FA Cup last season - stunning Manchester City - before also hoisting the Community Shield with a victory over Liverpool in August.",
      "Palace also notched another win over Arne Slot's team on Saturday - putting an end to their unbeaten start to the season.",
      "Rumours are now swirling about whether an approach will be made for Glasner before the season concludes, with the Austrian also utilising a back-three system akin to the one Amorim employs.",

      "The flashpoint saw the Republic of Ireland star punished in the box for bringing down Bryan Mbeumo, though it's now evident the centre-back prevented a clear scoring chance. Bruno Fernandes subsequently fluffed the spot-kick whilst the Bees sealed their success when Mathias Jensen netted a third during added time.",
      "Following the setback, Craig Pawson's choice not to leave the home side with 10 players has faced heavy scrutiny, with Premier League legend Alan Shearer reinforcing his disapproval.",
      "\"He should have been [sent off], but I think in the first instance the penalty wasn't given on field, there was a slight delay,\" Foy told talkSPORT.",
      "\"I think the assistant referee on that side, Lee Betts, has spoken to the referee, he's communicated that, Craig Pawson points to the spot and the next thing, the penalty is given, that's the decision we want.",
      "\"But there is more to it isn't there? Quite clearly, what we're talking about is, is it a goalscoring opportunity? And should Andy Madley recommend a review? Yes he should, that was a clear red card offence in my opinion.",
      "\"Take the defender away, look where Mbeumo is, look where the ball is, in my opinion, the VAR should've recommended a review and I'm sure if Craig Pawson would've looked at the monitor then a red card would've been shown.\"",

      "\"They get it right in terms of the referee's call: he gives the penalty for the pull back. But what they didn't get right was the yellow card check for Collins.",
      "\"They deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball, I mean honestly, it's just a terrible decision.",
      "\"He can't be in control of the ball because someone is pulling him back, he's a yard from the ball, clearly.",

      "Antony has opened up on his final days as a Manchester United player, claiming he felt “disrespected” by the club’s treatment of him. Antony was part of the so-called ‘bomb squad’ over the summer before sealing a permanent exit to Real Betis on transfer deadline day.",
      "United spent all summer trying to offload a group of five players not wanted by Ruben Amorim. Antony was joined by Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia in exile before leaving.",
      "Eventually, after a few dead-ends, Antony got his wish with a permanent €25million (£21.65m) transfer to Betis, where he had spent a happy loan spell last season. The Brazilian had been training separately from Amorim’s first team at United’s Carrington training ground up until the final days of August.",
      "The group had been told in no uncertain terms that they had no future under Amorim and to find a new club. They were forced to arrive at the training ground at 5pm, once the rest of the players had all left, to train alone. The policy caused some friction behind the scenes, with some staff members deeming it to be unnecessarily cruel.",
      "Ultimately, though, it had the desired effect, with Antony, Rashford, Garnacho and Sancho departing, leaving Malacia as the odd one out. Antony is delighted to have moved to Seville permanently, but still harbours some ill feeling about the way his former club handled things.",
      "“They were very tough months in England, more than 40 days in the hotel, training separately… I feel like they disrespected me, but that’s not the point,” he told Onda Cero.",
      "“I don’t want to create controversy, that’s life. I’m very grateful for the club. There were bad times, but also good times, with two titles. My family travelled to Seville four or five days before the deal was finalised. I had the house rented.”",
      "Antony joined United in a £86m move from Ajax in September 2022 on the behest of Erik ten Hag, who had managed him in Amsterdam. But the move did not work out, the Brazilian winger only contributing 12 goals and five assists in 96 appearances across all competitions.",
      "He was deemed an example of the waste of the previous regime by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos sanctioned his departure this summer at a huge loss.",
      "Antony impressed on loan with Betis last season and made a big impact in their first Europa League game of the campaign last week, scoring and assisting in the 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest. He is now targeting a place in Brazil’s squad for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "“It’s a dream,” he said. “I played in a World Cup, and of course I dream of playing in it a second time. It’s always great to represent your country. I’m going to do my job, like I’m doing, and I hope to be in the squad.”",

The former Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea striker, who is Belgium's all-time top scorer, confirmed the sad news on social media, prompting an outpour of support from friends, family, former teammates, and colleagues.",
      "Lukaku made the switch to Old Trafford in 2017 after United outbid Chelsea for his services from Everton, in a deal reportedly worth £75million. Since then, he has played for Inter Milan and AS Roma, including a return stint at Stamford Bridge, where he scored 15 goals in 44 appearances.",
      "Last season, he found a permanent home with Napoli, helping them beat Inter to the Scudetto. The 32-year-old received a wave of support from the broader football community after sharing a poignant tribute on Instagram.",
      "Captioning an old photo of his father, Lukaku wrote: \"Thank you for teaching me everything I know. I'm forever grateful and appreciate you.",
      "\"Life will never be the same. Protecting and guiding me like no one else could.",

      "Ian Wright, Rio Ferdinand, Juan Mata, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Joshua Zirkzee, Jeremy Doku, Clarence Seedorf and Thiago Silva, among others, all posted red heart emojis in the comment section. Lukaku also paid tribute to his father on his Instagram story.",
      "The Belgian uploaded a couple of videos: one of which was from his dad's playing days, and the other was of his dad celebrating a goal he scored for Anderlecht. Napoli expressed their condolences with an emotional statement.",
      "The Italian champions wrote: \"President Aurelio De Laurentiis, Vice President Edoardo De Laurentiis, coach Antonio Conte, sporting director Giovanni Manna, the executives, the technical staff, the team, and the entire SSC Napoli join Romelu Lukaku in this moment of profound grief for the passing of his dear father Roger.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Belgium Football Association extended their sympathies. A statement read: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the Lukaku family, following the passing of Roger Lukaku.\"",
      "Like Romelu, Roger was a centre-forward. He played for KV Mechelen and Oostende in Belgium, and he represented the Zaire national team, now recognised as DR Congo.",
      "Roger's other son, Jordan, is also a professional footballer. The 31-year-old left-back, who is currently without a club, enjoyed six years on Lazio's books between 2016 and 2022; he also featured eight times for the Belgian national team.",

      "Paul Scholes says that Ruben Amorim appears isolated on the Manchester United touchline because he lacks a recognisable presence alongside him - but it's not necessarily something he can address. Amorim brought several backroom staff from Sporting Clube de Portugal following his appointment at United.",
      "Among those figures, assistant head coach Carlos Fernandes and first-team coach Adelio Candido have remained with him throughout his managerial journey. Emanuel Ferro, another first-team coach, had previously worked at Benfica alongside Fernandes during Amorim's playing days. Ruud van Nistelrooy was keen to remain at United in whatever role was available, but the Portuguese boss chose to prioritise his own trusted team.",
      "However, Scholes thinks Amorim would gain from having a well-known assistant by his side - though it would also bring with it a downside.",
      "\"He looks lonely on the sideline,\" he remarked about Amorim on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast. \"You even look at the big managers, they've got a bit of presence next to them. What's Amorim got next to him? I couldn't tell you who his assistants are.",
      "\"The trouble he's got with that now, though, I think if he decides to bring someone in now, like, let's say it's a Ruud van Nistelrooy, or a Michael Carrick, with him, it makes everyone think he looks a little bit weak.",
      "\"Even with Arsenal, you've got Albert [Stuivenberg] who's got great experience, with Man United with [Louis] van Gaal [and] the Dutch squad. He's got Gabby Heinze, a face next to him, a little bit.",
      "\"I couldn't tell you who's behind him [Amorim]? I don't know who it is. Nobody knows. We know [Jason] Tindall's name, we know the ones with Pep [Guardiola], Kolo Toure and Pep Lijnders. Who's with him?\".",
      "Amorim had previously spoken about whether bringing in someone familiar with the club would prove advantageous back in February this year, ahead of United's clash with Leicester City, who were then managed by Van Nistelrooy.",
      "\"No. The most important thing to have as a coach is a staff that understands the way you want to play, the standards that you have,\" Amorim explained.",
      "\"I prefer to work with the team that brought me here. It's clear that that is important for me to understand my ideas, to explain the same thing to the players.",
      "\"So it was that decision. And I'm really comfortable and confident that I know how to win, no matter the club. Of course, we are losing.",

      "Ruben Amorim appears to be a man on the brink, according to a body language expert. After a dismal start to the season, things took a turn for the worse on Saturday as Manchester United suffered a 3-1 defeat at Brentford.",
      "The result has increased the pressure on the Portuguese coach, who has only managed to secure 34 points in 33 games since taking over last November. Throughout the match at the Gtech Community Stadium, Amorim appeared devastated, frustrated and lost as he continues to struggle with his expensive squad.",
      "Body language expert Darren Stanton analysed Amorim's behaviour during the game and provided his insights into what it reveals about his mental state as he fights to keep his job.",
      "\"Imagine if someone was about to get beaten up, that's the first stance they adopt. They go on the ground and put themselves in a fetal position.",
      "\"So basically, this is the worst that I've seen him. Being crouched down with his hands on his head is the personification of dejection, negativity and feeling really, really bad.",
      "\"Straight away, that image tells me that, emotionally, he's in the worst place he's been in since he started the role.\"",
      "Amorim was also spotted with his head down, with his hand on the back of his neck. Stanton said: \"That's the ultimate pacifying gesture as well. The fact that he's dipped his head down... the more space we occupy, when we want to show pride, our shoulders will be back, we'll be smiling and our head will be up.",
      "\"But with Ruben Amorim, to dip his head down with his hand on the back of his head, again it shows the ultimate dejection and shame.\"",
      "Amorim appeared equally downcast when seated in the technical area, with Stanton adding: \"With Ruben Amorim sat on his seat, it's like he's almost praying. He's making himself small and I do believe that, within three to five days, I think he'll be gone.",
      "\"If I was to give you some expressions that someone could demonstrate where they're at an ultimate low emotionally, this would be it.\"",
      "Following the final whistle, as he and his squad approached the away supporters to show appreciation, it was striking how few players positioned themselves alongside their boss. Stanton noted: \"None of the players are stood with Ruben Amorim and he's been isolated. I think that's why he's looking dejected as well.",
      "\"He knows in his heart now that he's been given ample opportunity and it's nearly game over for him. I've never seen any manager or coach look so dejected.\"",

Amorim has faced mounting criticism lately, with United securing only two victories in their initial six Premier League matches.",
      "Despite a 2-1 win over Chelsea sparking hopes of gaining momentum, United were left reeling after a 3-1 loss to Brentford. This latest setback saw United slump to 14th place and marked Amorim's 17th league defeat in just 33 games.",
      "In contrast, Crystal Palace is flying high in third position, having not lost a single top-flight match this season.",

      "After finishing 15th in the Premier League in 2024/25 and losing the Europa League final, things have continued in a disastrous fashion this season. United are 14th with two wins from six league games, having also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby.",
      "The 3-1 defeat at Brentford on Saturday means United still haven’t won back-to-back league games under Amorim, who has been in charge since November. The Portuguese boss’ tactical system is still not working and the attack continues to struggle, despite over £200million being spent on three forwards in the summer transfer window.",
      "The tide has turned on Amorim, who arrived with a stellar reputation from his time with Sporting Lisbon, but has not convinced. Ahead of a crucial must-win match against newly-promoted Sunderland on Saturday, Carragher called for Amorim to be put out of his misery.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim,” he said on Sky’s Monday Night Football. “What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager, but bringing in a manager like that in, in terms of the system that he played, I don't think really suited the traditions of Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker Manchester United make the decision on the manager, I think it's better for everybody because as I said, it's been a disaster for the club, but also the manager. We're only waiting for the inevitable. Unfortunately, as Duncan [Ferguson] said, you don't want to see people lose their jobs, but his has to end as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Carragher does not have any skin in the game, having spent his career at rivals Liverpool. But Rooney is a United legend and measures his words carefully, partly due to having two sons in the club’s academy. He made a similar point after the Brentford game.",
      "“I just don’t know what’s going on,” he said on The Wayne Rooney Show. “I have tried my hand in management and it didn’t work out too well, I get it. Ruben Amorim is my age, he is still a young manager and I’m sure he still has a massive future.",
      "“But what’s going on at Man United – this is not Man United. I honestly hope he can turn it around and he does. But if you’re saying to me: ‘Do you believe he will?’ then, after everything I’ve seen, honestly, I’ve got no faith in it.",
      "“I am not seeing anything which is giving me any confidence. There needs to be big changes in my opinion. Manager, players, whatever that is. Whatever it takes to get Manchester United back.”",
      "The Sunderland game will be crucial for Amorim, who knows there is a two-week international break looming afterwards. Anything other than victory over the Black Cats at Old Trafford could signal the end of his spell in charge, with the break giving Ineos time to line up a replacement.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jurgen Klopp has taken a cheeky dig at Manchester United following the Red Devils' wretched start to the new Premier League season. United sit 14th in the table having won just two of their opening six matches following Saturday's defeat by Brentford.",
      "Pressure has already ramped up on Ruben Amorim after a disastrous campaign last term which saw them finish 15th in the top flight and miss out on European football after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "It's a malaise which hasn't gone unnoticed by Klopp, who had many battles with Liverpool's fierce rivals during a hugely successful spell at Anfield which yielded a first league title for 30 years and a sixth European crown.",
      "Speaking to The Athletic about his new role within the Red Bull setup, Klopp acknowledged that some of the clubs under his remit are essentially stepping stones to other sides... but no longer United.",
      "“We are not the final destination,\" he admitted. \"We are not Liverpool… or in former times Man United! You can write that if you want.”",
      "Since leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2023-24 season, Klopp has been continually linked with a return to the dugout at various European giants.",
      "But the former Dortmund boss insists he missed nothing about the rigours of club management and is perfectly happy in his current role of Red Bull's Head of Global Football.",
      "When asked if he was sat by the television waiting for Liverpool games to start after his departure, he said: \"Not at all. I was super happy with the way Liverpool performed. I watched some games. But it is not like, ‘Oh, it’s Saturday!’",
      "“I didn’t know when games started. I was just out. I played sports. We enjoyed life, spent time with the grandkids, completely normal stuff, knowing I will work again. But knowing as well, that I don’t want to work as a coach anymore.\"",
      "When pressed on whether he was finished as a manager, he added: “That’s what I think. But you don’t know. I’m 58. If I started again at 65, everybody will say, ‘You said you’ll never do it again!’ Er, sorry, I thought 100 per cent (when I said it)! That is what I think now. I don’t miss anything.”",

      "Oliver Glasner could have been at the helm of a different Premier League team this season, with the Austrian coach now linked to Manchester United.",
      "Bookies have tipped Glasner as the favourite to take over from Ruben Amorim, as rumours swirl about Amorim's future at United following their 3-1 loss to Brentford last weekend. Despite the recent stumble at the Gtech Community Stadium, it's believed that the Portuguese head coach still has the board's support, with United insisting that they're not currently scouting for a replacement.",
      "Club insiders echoed similar sentiments after the embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town, and fans' patience is wearing thin with the team's failure to string together a series of positive results. The 2-1 victory over Chelsea gave Old Trafford a much-needed morale boost, but the performance against Brentford was a let down.",
      "Several managers have been linked as potential successors, and Glasner, who boasts an FA Cup and Community Shield in his trophy cabinet in recent months, could have stepped into Ange Postecoglou's shoes at Tottenham earlier this summer.",
      "Former Palace chairman Simon Jordan revealed on talkSPORT that he had recommended Glasner to ex-Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy during the summer. Spurs were on the hunt for a new manager to replace Postecoglou, but Levy ultimately decided to bring in Thomas Frank from Brentford.",
      "\"I like Glasner. With all due respect to the departed, I actually said to Daniel (Levy) about him during the summer, 'Why not Glasner?'\" Jordan revealed. \"He had his own views on it, but I think he's a top, top manager.",
      "\"Do I think he'll be Palace manager at the end of the season? I'll be amazed because he's got nothing left on his contract now. This is his last year. He hasn't been given the support yet. He's working the oracle. They're taking their best players out, repeatedly taking their best players out.",
      "\"Fortunately for Palace, which is the great thing they're not taking them out, these clubs are having to pay for them now. That's the good thing about it. [Eberechi] Eze's gone and for top money, Olise went for decent money and people are having to pay for it. And Guehi, he didn't walk out the door. But again, they're operating at their highest level.",
      "\"It's like Nottingham Forest last year. Their run of form, as a unit, as a team is fabulous. Look at the teams that they're beating, look at the results that they're getting and they've got a European competition. So, we'll see how that plays out with the strength of their squad.\"",
      "The Austrian boss has responded to speculation connecting him with the vacancy at Old Trafford. \"I follow all the rumours – and that's all there is – neutrally and completely relaxed,\" he told Kicker.",
      "\"Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Glasner has emerged as the bookies' favourite after a stellar run at Selhurst Park. Gareth Southgate, who was previously tipped for the United job last year, is still in the running.",
      "The Eagles have maintained an unbeaten streak in the Premier League this season. Their thrilling last-minute win over Liverpool on Saturday catapulted them to third place in the league, preserving their unbeaten record through their first six games.",

      "Tyrell Malacia has been reintegrated into the first-team squad by Ruben Amorim following a dramatic change of heart by the Manchester United manager. Malacia was a part of the so-called 'bomb squad' over the summer and was forced to train away from the group in an effort to push him out of the door.",
      "However, while the other members of the exiled group – Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho – all found new clubs, Malacia ended up staying. Proposed moves to Lille, Roma and Elche all fell through, while Malacia rejected the chance to leave for Saudi Arabia.",
      "His contract with United is due to expire at the end of June, leaving the 26-year-old full-back in limbo until the end of the season. After failing to secure an exit before the September 1 deadline, Malacia was sent to train with the under-21s, while he has also been uploading pictures on social media of him training solo.",
      "Malacia’s hard work and professionalism has reportedly not gone unnoticed behind the scenes at United. Amorim had taken a firm stance on unwanted players, but has changed his mind, with Dutch outlet Voetbal International reporting that Malacia has re-joined first-team training.",
      "The Portuguese boss will reportedly give the Dutchman a chance to fight his way back into the team. Malacia is a left-sided defender and finds himself behind Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu in the pecking order.",
      "He spent the second half of last season on loan with PSV Eindhoven, where he made 12 appearances across all competitions. But Malacia has not played for United since January 30, when he featured in the 2-0 win over Romanian side FCSB in the Europa League.",
      "Malacia is registered to play in the Premier League, so could return to the fold if he continues to impress Amorim. The fact the team are struggling could play into his hands. United are currently 14th in the Premier League, having won just two of their six matches.",
      "However, having failed to qualify for any European competition after finishing 15th last season and tasting defeat in the Europa League final, and being knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby, there are fewer fixtures for Malacia to target.",
      "Malacia joined United from Feyenoord for £13million in the summer of 2022. The transfer was driven by his compatriot Erik ten Hag, but things have not worked out in Manchester, largely due to injury.",
      "The defender needed two rounds of surgery on a knee injury which left him on the sidelines for 17 months. He has made just 47 appearances in over three years with the club and is certain to leave in 2026, be it in January or when his contract expires.",

      "Ruben Amorim is under growing pressure at Manchester United after a bad start to the season.",
      "United suffered a 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the weekend, which means Amorim is still yet to win back-to-back games in the Premier League since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Amorim is understood to retain the backing of the board, despite suffering a further setback at the Gtech Community Stadium, and United have insisted no replacement is being lined up.",
      "That hasn't stopped Amorim's future from dominating headlines. United were forced to clarify that Amorim would not be axed after defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup last month, and supporters are becoming increasingly impatient with United's failure to string together a run of positive results.",
      "They were all asked to react to the start of the campaign and give their honest thoughts.",
      "Tot Barling, a lifelong United fan and European away regular, said: \"I mean, inevitably you've got to be disappointed [with the start to the season]. I know it took Fergie five years and Klopp five years, but that doesn't happen these days. You have to give time to build, but in the modern game, he's been there long enough. With the summer signings, one was hoping for a good start.",
      "\"It looked ok against Arsenal, albeit the result wasn't good. I was talking to friends after Saturday and I was disappointed with the whole feeling. The players don't look like they're up for it.",
      "\"Amorim has lost his spark, that joyous spark that he had when he first came, and so there's not a lot at the moment to grab hold of in terms of when is it going to get better? How will it get better?",
      "\"I'm disappointed and worried to summarise. For a man who seems to be so tactically aware, he is intransigent. It's clearly not working for whatever reason. Maybe the Premier League does not suit his formation compared to Portugal's top-flight.",
      "\"I can't believe now with the turnover of players that it's because they are not all up to understanding what he wants. Maybe it just doesn't work. I'm not sure that giving him more time will help.",
      "\"I don't know whether getting rid of him is going to help either because I'm not sure what the deep-seated problem is at the club. We've gone through so many managers who haven't been able to turn it around. Although I have one controversial view that if we hadn't brought Ole back, I think he would have done a good job. But that scuppered him.",
      "\"Apart from that, it always ends up in these dressing room conflicts, reports of the manager losing the dressing room, and that's how it appears to be at the moment, because the players don't seem to be responding to what he wants.\"",
      "Barling continued: \"He's an intelligent man, he's principled and knows what he wants, but I was just looking it up. The phrase 'madness is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result' is what he seems to be doing at the moment.",
      "\"You would have thought common sense... The opposition is different each week, so you surely have to change your system, and given that the players at the moment aren't responding, that's another reason to tweak it. His refusal to do that either before or during a game is baffling for somebody with a good understanding of the game. That is what is confusing me.",
      "\"I don't know whether he is actually just not that good at understanding the game, or whether he only knows this way of doing it and he's got nothing else to try. But my view would be, he must know the writing is on the wall with the way things are going, so why not mix it up a bit?",
      "\"Bruno [Fernandes] is being played out of position, in a role he cannot fulfil. Why didn't he take the wrath of the fans, take the £100m and sell Bruno, and say well, he wasn't going to get in the No.10 role because I have Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There are too many inconsistencies. And likewise, I'm not saying he's better or worse, but why sell [Rasmus] Hojlund and bring in [Benjamin] Sesko. They are very similar players, Sesko is untried in the Premier League. Everybody agreed Hojlund wasn't working because he wasn't getting service from the wings or midfield.",
      "\"You go and replace with him with a guy who has scored a few goals in the German league, but who relies on service from the wings and midfield. And you're not giving him that service. All they've done is spend money on a young and unproven striker in the same mould.\"",
      "Matt Pickett, who has a season ticket in the Stretford End, said: \"It's the same s***. We're just getting worse. I was at the Arsenal game and I saw a completely different team. The chances we were creating, the way we were playing. We were unlucky with an individual error costing a goal, and then we should have had a penalty. Even though we lost, I was quite happy.",
      "\"However, if he can't adapt to different systems now, I wouldn't be sad if he were gone tomorrow. I liked him for getting rid of some of the deadwood, wanting to bring back standards and not pandering to some of the bigger names.",
      "\"But the stats don't lie now. At any other serious club he would be gone, regardless of what he's good at saying or doing in a press conference. I don't want him to go because I would like him to stay, but if he did go, then it wouldn't be an issue for me. If anything, it would be more exciting.",
      "\"You can't go that long without winning back-to-back games in the Premier League. It's inexcusable now. Sunderland are above us in the league. The players we have, that shouldn't be the case.",
      "\"I know we had a tough start with the fixtures, but we should have beat Fulham, we shouldn't be getting beat by Brentford, we scraped it against Burnley and only beat Chelsea probably because they had 10 men for a large part of the game.",
      "\"And I was looking at it, the games Amorim has won have been against bad teams. He keeps changing the starting team. He's stubborn and it will cost him the job, but I don't think he cares any more.",
      "\"Fergie was always making little tweaks to his system and evolving. It's obvious to everyone, you're going to have to be able to change how we play. Certainly if it's short-term to depend on who we are playing.",
      "\"The wing backs don't really do anything, Dalot has been poor and Amorim is just digging in more. We're getting into Ten Hag territory now. And why did Yoro not start on Saturday? It's just concerning.",
      "\"As a match-going fan, I'm getting bored, and getting bored of the excuses, bored of getting beaten. It's hard in the work group when I can't even stick out. We have bought decent players.\"",
      "Pickett added: \"If you look at Madrid, Barca, even some of the lower league teams, if it's not working, they make a change. You don't get time now. If you're losing because we're playing so well and someone makes a mistake, you can forgive it, but not when we're getting overrun by Brentford.",
      "\"We don't look like we have the capacity to score against some teams. I was firmly behind Amorim with Garnacho. It was disappointing, but I was behind him. The way he managed that one was good. Even with Rashford. He did nothing for two years and couldn't be a****. When Amorim got rid of him, I thought fair play because you're making hard decisions and putting the club first.",
      "\"Even with the Mainoo thing when he wanted to leave on loan. Just because he wants to play at the World Cup, what if someone got injured and we needed him? He's 20, you play for United.",
      "\"I like his man management, and the decisions he makes like that are refreshing and almost Fergie-esque. But then his ability to actually look at a game and change the system isn't there. He's stubborn.\"",
      "Salford-based Will Cooper said: \"They're incredibly inconsistent, which is annoying. There are moments we do look good, and then there are times when we look like we've never played football before.",
      "\"I thought we could have won 4-0 against Burnley, but we made a meal of it. City game was a disgrace. It looked like the players didn't want to be there against Grimsby, but the system is irrelevant for that game because our players are so much better than their players. It shouldn't have even been a close game.",
      "\"I don't think he should be sacked, though. I can see what he's building towards, but I think the entire system is built around having two great midfielders. You can't play with two in midfield against a three-man midfield without having the players for it. We need someone who can win the ball back, who can carry it.",
      "\"I think he should be given more time. The team selection is sometimes a bit odd, but I still think he's trying to figure out his best team.\"",

      "Manchester United fans look away: Jamie Carragher might be right about Ruben Amorim.",
      "United supporters may not pay attention to what Liverpool legend Carragher has to say, but he is one of the best pundits on television, and his theory about why Amorim has not been sacked could be true.",
      "There has been intense discussion about Amorim's future again since the defeat to Brentford last weekend.",
      "Amorim could not take the opportunity to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time, although United sources have insisted he still retains the backing of the board.",
      "Carragher said: \"I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager.",
      "\"But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.\"",
      "He continued: \"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system.",
      "\"It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is. This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "\"They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in. The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'",
      "\"The only positive for Manchester United is that they have not gone all in on his system. They have gone all in in terms of giving him money to spend but they have not bought lots of centre-backs and lots of wing-backs.",
      "\"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.\"",
      "Carragher's argument about United chiefs persevering with Amorim because he was their appointment has merit. It seems likely he would have already been sacked if he'd been hired by a previous regime.",
      "Berrada, the CEO, was responsible for appointing Amoirm. Wilcox, director of football, has been the driving force behind recruitment since Ratcliffe gained control of football operations last year.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox should be scrutinised if the decision is eventually taken to sack Amorim - they are paid handsomely to make the most important decisions and could face consequences.",
      "It would reflect badly on the pair if Amorim were to fail, and all the signs indicate that he must now overcome a mountain to turn the club around after a disappointing start to the season.",
      "You cannot keep a manager in a job to prevent embarrassment in the boardroom. Having said that, it's understandable that Berrada and Wilcox want to give Amorim as much time as possible. They are desperate for him to succeed, for the club and for themselves.",
      "It was fascinating to hear Wilcox speak at a recent event for ex-players at Old Trafford where he said: \"This club is a wonderful club. I just pray we get the opportunity to turn it around.\"",
      "Wilcox is a close Ratcliffe ally. He has been empowered at United since joining from Southampton, but that comment suggested even Wilcox knows his position could be under threat.",
      "Ratcliffe demonstrated his ruthlessness when Dan Ashworth was dismissed. Ashworth oversaw the decision to keep Erik ten Hag after the FA Cup final and paid the price for that decision.",
      "That suggests there could be a further boardroom shake-up if Amorim faces the axe this season.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Tuesday, September 30.",
      "Ruben Amorim finds himself under renewed scrutiny at Old Trafford following United's 3-1 loss to Brentford. Reports indicate that Sir Jim Ratcliffe, United's minority shareholder, continues to back the Portuguese manager.",
      "This follows claims that United have compiled a three-man shortlist to replace the head coach, with former England manager Gareth Southgate among the names. Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola, credited with impressive work at Crystal Palace and Bournemouth respectively, are also reported to be on the shortlist.",
      "Former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has also been tentatively linked, while sensational reports have suggested Sean Dyche and recently-sacked Graham Potter as possible successors to the Portuguese coach.",
      "Reports also suggest that former Barcelona manager Xavi is interested in making the switch to the Premier League and returning to management in the Old Trafford hotseat.",
      "In transfer news, United have once again been linked with a move for Nigerian star Victor Osimhen.",
      "The forward currently plies his trade in the Turkish Super League after leaving Napoli. He has long been linked with a move to the Premier League, including last summer but it didn't materialise.",
      "Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane remains in the headlines and spoke recently about a possible return to the Premier League.",
      "Meanwhile, there is talk that Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is on the radar for United too.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day....",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United blog.",
      "Our coverage this evening is now coming to an end but remember to come back tomorrow for more United news.",
      "Until then, good night!",
      "It is not all about Amorim's future of course, Rashford's potential move to Barcelona permanently is also being discussed.",
      "Speaking to Mundo Deportivo, Barca's sporting director Deco has insisted that the Catalan giants are happy with Rashford.",
      "He's on a simple loan, there's no penalty, and if we want him, we have an option to buy. It's too early to talk about decisions for next season, but what matters is that we're happy with him. What we thought he could bring to us, he's bringing. He's a very high-level player. He exploded very early, then he had great seasons at United, then he had years of more complicated management with changes of coaches, and perhaps he struggled too because they demanded a lot of things from him there. But we're happy with him - that's the most important thing.",
      "Amid pressure on Amorim following the defeat at Brentford, Bryan Mbeumo has called upon the players to take responsibility for the poor start to the Premier League season.",
      "Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the [Brentford] fans and I will never forget that. I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, United have already rejected the possibility of bringing in a manager on a short-term basis to replace Amorim.",
      "It is understood by journalist Dean Jones that Ineos see this as being directly opposed to the long-term strategy that they are undertaking to rebuild the club.",
      "Middlesbrough manager Michael Carrick has been linked with a return to United a temporary capacity should Amorim leave but were he to be hired, it seems that Ineos would prefer him to be a long-term option for the club.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT earlier today, Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler seemed to be focused solely on his team rather than giving too much attention towards joining United.",
      "When quizzed by Jim White on the possibility of moving to Old Trafford, Hurzeler replied:",
      "Of course it is always an honour to be part of the rumours but I really respect the coach, Ruben Amorim, there. I think it is not the right thing to talk about this. Overall, I can say it is a privilege to work with Brighton. I am very happy to be the coach here and we have a lot of work in front of us.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United blog this Tuesday evening.",

      "Jurgen Klopp has made a cheeky swipe at Manchester United when discussing his position within the Red Bull organisation with The Athletic.",
      "The German coach acknowledged that several clubs under his supervision essentially serve as stepping stones to other teams. Klopp indicated United are no longer the final destination 1for players.",
      "\"We are not the final destination,\" he said. \"We are not Liverpool... or in former times Man United! You can write that if you want.\"",
      "Antony believes he was disrespected by Manchester United as he spent more than a month living out of a hotel over the summer.",
      "The winger, who eventually returned to Real Betis was not in United's pre-season plans and trained away from the first team. Antony has told El Desmarque:",
      "“They were very tough months in England, more than 40 days in the hotel, training separately… I feel like they disrespected me, but that’s not the point. I don’t want to create controversy; that’s life. I’m very grateful for the club; there were bad times, but also good times, with two titles. My family travelled to Seville four or five days before the deal was finalised; I had the house rented.”",
      "Former Manchester United forward Teddy Sheringham has backed Leeds as a good destination for Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The young midfielder has had his work cut out to earn time on the pitch under Ruben Amorim but not sure that a move to Leeds is quite the next step for the England international...",
      "Speaking to the Yorkshire Post, Sheringham reckons Mainoo could thrive with such a move.",
      "\"Yes – without a doubt. Not even six months ago, he was in the England set-up and people were raving about him. He can’t be that bad a player.",
      "\"He just needs someone who loves the way he plays. This game is all opinions and just because Amorim doesn’t fancy him, it doesn’t mean to say [Daniel] Farke won’t get the best out of him.",
      "\"Put an arm around him and tell him how good he is, team him up with someone in midfield who accommodates him and all of a sudden, you’ve got a player back on your hands.\"",

      "The Serbian international is out of contract next summer.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee appears to have emerged as a potential target for Cesc Fabregas's Como ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Despite having only played 82 minutes across all competitions, Zirkzee has reportedly attracted interest from the Serie A. According to Italian outlet Corriere Como, Como are interested in signing the Dutchman as they push to qualify for the Champions League with claims of an 'agreement' already having been struck.",
      "Barcelona director of football Deco has suggested that Marcus Rashford's struggles at Manchester United over the past few years were due to the high demand placed on him.",
      "Rashford left United after over 420 games and 138 goals. He scored 30 goals and assisted a further 12 to help United qualify for the Champions League in 2023, before he managed just eight goals the following year.",

      "Rashford joined Barca in the summer on a season-long loan, and he has hit the ground running. The 27-year-old scored his first two goals in the Champions League win over Newcastle and has created a goal in each of his previous four La Liga games.",
      "In a recent interview with Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, Deco said: \"He's a very high-level player; he exploded very early, then he had great seasons at United, then he had years of more complicated management with changes of coaches, and perhaps he struggled too because they demanded a lot of things from him there. But we're happy with him; that's the most important thing.\"",
      "Carragher believes Amorim remains in charge at Man United only because the club's hierarchy is reluctant to admit they've made yet another mistake.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United, but also Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic, he looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing in a manager like that, in terms of the system that he plays, I don’t think every really suited the club and the traditions of Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker Manchester United make the decision on the manager, I think it’s better for everybody because it’s been a disaster for club but also the manager and we’re only waiting for the inevitable, I think. You don’t want to see people lose their jobs but this has to end as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Carragher added: \"I think every other Premier League manager would think 'I could to a better job.' Any competent football manager could get United to the European places or certainly fighting for them. It couldn’t have gone any worse.",
      "\"What he did at Sporting was really special, but it will be better for everyone to just shake hands and move on.\"",
      "Defender Tyrell Malacia has been reintegrated into the first-team group.",
      "Malacia expressed his desire to leave United in the summer and was widely categorised in the 'bomb squad' by the media, alongside Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony. Interest in Malacia was thin on the ground, and a proposed move to Elche collapsed on transfer deadline day.",
      "Malacia was included in United's registered squad with the Premier League, and Ruben Amorim said: \"He is returning with contact with the ball with the Under-21s, then we will see.\"",
      "Club sources have stressed it was always the plan to reintegrate Malacia into the first-team group. Malacia's time at United has been scuppered by a knee injury, which required two rounds of surgery.",
      "After 517 days on the sidelines, Malacia made his return for the U21s against Huddersfield last November.",
      "\"The only way you score a goal over the last 18 months was Bruno,\" he said on the The Good, The Bad, and The Football podcast.",
      "\"Now Bruno has come deeper, so you've lost that as well. I think you've got worse. The only bright light has been Bruno, and I was one of his critics because I think he doesn’t do what I like as a footballer.",
      "\"But he’s a top, top talent and scores goals. But now he’s not playing deep. So you’ve lost that as well. It’s shocking what’s happened.\"",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner could have been managing a different Premier League side this season as the Austrian is linked with Man United.",
      "Bookmakers have named Glasner as the frontrunner to replace Ruben Amorim, amid growing speculation about Amorim’s future at United following their 3-1 defeat to Brentford last weekend. The Portuguese head coach is believed to still have the backing of the board despite the latest setback at the Gtech Community Stadium, with United maintaining that no replacement is currently being lined up.",
      "Club sources said similar following the humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town and supporters have grown increasingly frustrated with the team's inability to put together a consistent run of positive results. The 2-1 win over Chelsea lifted spirits at Old Trafford, but the performance against Brentford was a setback.",
      "A number of managers have been rumoured as potential replacements, and Glasner, who has won the FA Cup and Community Shield, could have replaced Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham earlier this summer.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Under-pressure Man United boss Ruben Amorim held a team bonding day for players and their families – despite his increasingly precarious position.",
      "Amorim's future was plunged further into doubt following Saturday's dismal 3-1 defeat at Brentford, which means the Portuguese head coach has still to win back-to-back games in the Premier League since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "Reds legend Wayne Rooney has described the club as “broken” and said there are some players there who are “not deserving to wear the shirt”. Amorim has also come under fire from other United legends, including Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, but continues to have the backing of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Corriere Como claim Man United have reached an agreement with Como over Zirkzee.",
      "The report claims that the club has identified Cesc Fàbregas as \"the symbol of the project,\" emphasizing his influence in introducing \"modern football, tactical organisation, and a focus on talent development\" at Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia. As a result, Zirkzee has reportedly emerged as a potential target for the January transfer window.",
      "FourFourTwo understands that there was interest from Italian giants in bringing him back during the 2025 transfer window.",
      "Man United reportedly remain keen on Bournemouth star Semenyo, having apparently held talks in the summer.",
      "In addition to united, it's said that Tottenham, Manchester Cirty and Aston Villa have shown interest in him and have scouted him this season.",
      "But other clubs in Europe are also thought to be monitoring the 25-year-old. Speaking to TBR Football, correspondent Graeme Bailey said: \"He had Man United and Tottenham showing interest in the summer and now some of Europe’s top clubs are looking.",
      "\"As it stands, Bournemouth are intent on making progress this summer and that means no sales. They have lost the likes of Huijsen, Kerkez and Zabarnyi in recent months and they are insistent Semenyo won’t be following them through the exit doors in January.\"",
      "According to FourFourTwo, Fabregas could be on Man United's shortlist of potential replacements if Amorim is relieved of his duties.",

      "The next opportunity for the Reds to reinforce their squad will come in the New Year.",
      "Grab yourself a brew, and let’s get started, shall we?",
      "Rio Ferdinand told his Rio Presents podcast: \"If they played 4-2-3-1, I think you've got all the players playing in positions that they're super comfortable in. You've got two central midfielders out of three probably in Casemiro, [Manuel] Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo to play in there.",
      "\"And then you've got three across the front, anyone from Amad [Diallo], [Bryan] Mbeumo, [Matheus] Cunha, Mason Mount - even Mainoo. All of them and Bruno [Fernandes] can all play in them positions anywhere across that front line.",
      "\"And they're all happy as Larry anywhere. And [Benjamin] Sesko up front, but you've got Bruno who actually can be in the ten role where he has produced astronomical numbers consistently since he's been at the football club.",
      "\"That I don't think is rocket science. I just think everyone's probably looking at it and thinking the same thing.\"",
      "Alan Shearer has agreed with Gary Neville over concerns around Ruben Amorim's management at Manchester United.",
      "The Red Devils suffered a 3-1 defeat at Brentford on Saturday afternoon, with Igor Thiago scoring twice and Mathias Jensen adding a late goal to seal all three points for the home side. Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for United in the opening 45 minutes, but it did little to change the final result.",

      "Rashford, 27, who has three years left on his contract at United, signed for Barcelona on a season-long loan deal in July, after Ruben Amorim made it clear he wasn't in his plans. The Catalan side hold the option to purchase Rashford in a permanent transfer worth £30million in 2026.",
      "After impressing since the turn of the September international break, Barcelona are keen to sign the England international but for a reduced fee in the region of £26m. And Borson believes that it's a problem for United because the Reds don't have control of the situation.",
      "He told Football Insider: \"The player is going to end up boxingManchester United in. I think it's clear that United obviously want to sell the player. I mean, you just loaned him out. Where are we going to get to next summer?",
      "\"Whatever he does, whether he plays well or whether he's mediocre, whether he's patchy, you get to next summer and there's one bidder on the table and the player says he only wants to go to Barcelona. Well, in that scenario, they may well get him for £25m.\"",

      "The open day for players and their families, attended by Amorim and his family and held at United's Carrington training ground on Sunday, is understood to have been arranged before the start of the season to allow the squad's wives, partners and children to see first-hand the £50million upgrade to the facilities at the complex.",
      "United's players took part in a training session, watched by their families, then food for everyone was served in the revamped canteen for the first-team squad, with activities for children laid on to keep them entertained.",
      "The fact the open day still went ahead, despite the crushing loss at Brentford, shows that, for Amorim at least, it remains business as usual, despite the pressure mounting on the United boss, who has won just nine of his 33 league games in charge, losing 17 of them.",
      "United legend Wayne Rooney has described the club as “broken” and said there are some players there who are “not deserving to wear the shirt”. Amorim has also come under fire from other United legends, including Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, but continues to have the backing of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "How long that remains the case, only time will tell. United's players were given Monday off and are back in training on Tuesday, to begin preparations for Saturday's visit of Sunderland – currently riding high in fifth place - which has become a must-win game for Amorim before the two-week international break.",
      "When United return to action, they have a daunting trip to champions, arch rivals and league leaders Liverpool. Whether Amorim is still in charge for that Anfield visit, only the United hierarchy know, but Saturday's result will undoubtedly go a long way to deciding the fate of the club's sixth permanent manager in the 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down.",
      "If United can beat Sunderland, Amorim will likely live to fight another day. Lose, and the hierarchy's proclaimed faith in him will be pushed to the limit, under pressure from fans to make a change, many of who have already had enough of a manager who has so far flattered to deceive.",

      "After proving to be the team's talisman during his time at the club, often offering the only positives in a torrid period at Old Trafford, Fernandes has struggled to thwart United's slow start to the season. The Reds are currently 14th in the Premier League with seven points from six matches and once again struggling to find the net.",
      "The Portugal international has been on the scoresheet for United's two wins this season, however. Fernandes scored a penalty against Burnley and in a dramatic victory over Chelsea.",
      "And Mbeumo, 26, believes United must find a way to success when Fernandes does not contribute, in order to repay their captain.",
      "\"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time,\" he said. \"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",

      "Since his appointment at Old Trafford in November 2024, Amorim has had a challenging time. Despite leading United to the Europa League final last season, where they were defeated by Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, they finished a disappointing 16th, comfortably outside the European places ensuring his tenure has been fraught with difficulties.",
      "The current season hasn't started well either. Despite a victory over Chelsea prior to their clash with Brentford, Amorim's side have suffered three Premier League defeats and were shockingly knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two's Grimsby Town.",
      "In total, under Amorim's leadership, United have managed just 19 wins from 49 matches, raising serious questions about his future. However, according to the i Newspaper, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are prepared to stand by their manager.",
      "It is believed that the British billionaire is committed to his long-term vision for United and is reluctant to rush into another dismissal. Nonetheless, there are concerns within the club that Ineos may not have a say in the matter.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "According to two sources cited by the national newspaper, it is almost certain that Amorim will choose to leave United before Ratcliffe has the chance to sack him. They suggest that the Portuguese manager is becoming increasingly frustrated by the constant criticism following losses.",
      "Amorim is believed to view these as 'knee-jerk' reactions and is reportedly taken aback by the intense scrutiny surrounding his managerial tenure. A source told the i that Amorim might soon have to contemplate stepping down to 'preserve his managerial career'.",
      "Despite the swirling rumours about Amorim's future, it's understood that no successor has been identified for the Portuguese head coach. No managers are believed to have been approached by United to replace Amorim, although Ratcliffe remains a fan of Gareth Southgate following his successful tenure with the England national team.",
      "United are back in action this Saturday when they welcome high-flying Sunderland to Old Trafford.",

      "Ruben Amorim is facing increased scrutiny at Manchester United following a fourth defeat from seven games to start the 2025/26 season. Pressure on his job lessened in the lead up to taking on Brentford this past weekend after a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford.",
      "Igor Thiago put a firm stop to any momentum building with two quick-fire goals at Gtech Community Stadium. Benjamin Sesko pulled one back before half-time, but United went on to lose 3-1 after Bruno Fernandes' missed penalty and a Mathias Jensen screamer in added time.",
      "A victory would have seen back-to-back wins secured for the first time under Amorim, but another loss means it is just 34 points from a possible 93 picked up since he arrived. That works out at just a little over one point-per-game with United sitting in fourteenth",
      "With that being said, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest updates on Amorim's future and the potential replacements that could join.",
      "In the wake of losing at Brentford, MEN Sport reported on Monday that Amorim retains the backing of United's board.",
      "Club sources have stated that decision-makers are currently continuing to support Amorim with no replacements currently being lined-up. Despite that, rumours of who could come in have been rife with Zinedine Zidane, Oliver Glanser, Andoni Iraola and Gareth Southgate as options.",
      "The biggest rumour in recent days has surrounded former England manager Southgate, but Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano has suggested that he will not be taking over any time soon.",
      "\"I had received many questions about the Man United hierarchy about a face-to-face meeting with Gareth Southgate,\" he admitted in a video to his YouTube channel.",
      "\"Manchester United sources are playing down all the reports saying that Sir Jim Ratcliffe or anyone at the club met officially with Gareth Southgate to discuss the possibility of the former England boss becoming the new Manchester United manager.",
      "\"I am not aware of any meeting, any direct contact or negotiations. The relationship between the people at INEOS and Gareth Southgate is very good and that is why we have links, but at the moment I am not aware of any proposal or that Man United are going around and telling any managers 'we want you to be the new boss'.\"",
      "Though United are not actively looking at new manager options, Amorim is far from safe and could be sacked if results do not improve over the coming weeks.",
      "\"Man United are still respecting their manager, Ruben Amorim,\" Romano said. \"They are still waiting to see an improvement and that will start from the next game, probably. The situation of Ruben Amorim remains one to watch.",
      "\"I am not saying that Amorim is absolutely safe, his job is not absolutely safe in this moment because Man United need to perform in a different way but it does not mean they met with Gareth Southgate or already started the process to appoint him. Let's wait and see what happens but for sure the next game will be important for Amorim.\"",
      "Oliver Glasner, 51, was installed at the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Amorim. Crystal Palace sit third in the standings and are yet to lose a game in the top-flight this campaign.",
      "Glasner was asked about speculation linking him with United in the Austrian media. He said to Kicker: “I follow all the rumours – and that’s all there is – neutrally and completely relaxed.",
      "“Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.”",

      "Former Manchester United winger Antony has slammed the way the club treated him before his summer move to Real Betis. The Brazilian returned to England following a successful loan spell in Spain, and was placed in the 'bomb squad' as he sought a permanent move away.",
      "Antony scored nine times in 26 appearances for Betis in the second half of last season, helping them reach the Conference League final. A return to the La Liga side had been mooted throughout the window, but it took until deadline day for an agreement to be reached.",
      "Betis paid £21.65million for the 25-year-old, with United having a 50% net sell-on clause. Since returning, he has picked up where he left off and has been a key part of Manuel Pellegrini's squad.",
      "In England, Antony was placed in the 'bomb squad' by Amorim alongside the likes of Marcus Rashford, who has also impressed in Spain, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho. It's understood that he was told to train away from the first team as his future was sealed.",
      "Now, the Brazil international has opened up about his issues and how United treated him. Speaking to Onda Cero (via El Desmarque), he said: \"They were very tough months in England, more than 40 days in the hotel, training separately - I feel like they disrespected me, but that's not the point.",
      "\"I don't want to create controversy; that's life. I'm very grateful for the club; there were bad times, but also good times, with two titles.",
      "\"My family travelled to Seville four or five days before the deal was finalised; I had the house rented.\"",

      "It comes amid claims that United have compiled a three-man shortlist to potentially replace the former Sporting boss if things don't improve. It is said that former England manager Gareth Southgate, Andoni Iraola and Glasner are of interest as pressure mounts on Amorim to arrest United's alarming decline.",
      "Rangnick, who endured a difficult interim spell at Old Trafford in 2021/22, has previously provided a hugely positive assessment of Glasner's coaching abilities.",
      "\"For me, Oliver Glasner is currently one of the most exciting coaches - not only in Germany, but in all of Europe. An absolute top coach,\" Rangnick said via LAOLA1 in March 2023.",
      "Glasner has been widely praised for his excellent work at Palace, who are currently on an 18-match unbeaten streak across all competitions. The South London side won the FA Cup last term - stunning Manchester City - before also lifting the Community Shield with victory over Liverpool in August.",
      "Palace also recorded another win over Arne Slot's team on Saturday - ending their unbeaten start to the season.",

      "Ruben Amorim is cutting the figure of a man who knows 'it’s nearly game over for him' at Manchester United, according to a body language expert.",
      "A torrid start to the season got even worse on Saturday as United were humbled 3-1 at Brentford. The result piled even more pressure on the Portuguese coach, who has taken just 34 points in 33 games since taking charge last November.",
      "Amorim looked devastated, annoyed and lost at various stages of the game at the Gtech Community Stadium as he continues to struggle to get a tune out of his expensively assembled squad. Body language expert Darren Stanton has assessed Amorim’s demeanour during the game and given his verdict about what it says about his state of mind as he battles to stay in the job.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "On Amorim’s crouched position, which he adopted at times, Stanton told the MEN via OLBG: “Space is very much related to someone’s internal emotion. You can see him crouched down in a fetal position, almost like what a baby does.",
      "“Imagine if someone was about to get beaten up, that’s the first stance they adopt. They go on the ground and put themselves in a fetal position.",
      "“So basically, this is the worst that I’ve seen him. Being crouched down with his hands on his head is the personification of dejection, negativity and feeling really, really bad. Straight away, that image tells me that, emotionally, he’s in the worst place he’s been in since he started the role.”",
      "Amorim was also spotted with his head down, with his hand on the back of his neck. Stanton said: “That’s the ultimate pacifying gesture as well. The fact that he’s dipped his head down… the more space we occupy, when we want to show pride, our shoulders will be back, we’ll be smiling and our head will be up.",
      "“But with Ruben Amorim, to dip his head down with his hand on the back of his head, again it shows the ultimate dejection and shame.”",
      "Amorim looked no more upbeat when sat in the dugout, with Stanton adding: “With Ruben Amorim sat on his seat, it’s like he’s almost praying. He’s making himself small and I do believe that, within three to five days, I think he’ll be gone.",
      "“If I was to give you some expressions that someone could demonstrate where they’re at an ultimate low emotionally, this would be it.”",
      "At the end of the game, as he and the players went to thank the travelling fans, it was noticeable that few players stood near their manager. Stanton observed: “None of the players are stood with Ruben Amorim and he’s been isolated. I think that’s why he’s looking dejected as well.",
      "“He knows in his heart now that he’s been given ample opportunity and it’s nearly game over for him. I’ve never seen any manager or coach look so dejected.”",
      "Provided he is still at the helm, Amorim will be targeting a much-needed victory when Sunderland visit Old Trafford on Saturday.",

Amorim’s defence found themselves on the back foot again, Bayindir palming away Schade’s cross and very nearly kept out the rebound, which was turned in by Thiago, for his second of the game. It’s a long way back for the Reds from here.",
      "This could be a repeat of the embarrassing defeat 4-0 in August 2022. Brentford lost to Fulham last weekend, and this was a huge chance to build momentum after Chelsea. United have made a shocking start and have given themselves a mountain to climb in London.",

      "Moments later, United are caught cold, a long ball from Jordan Henderson met by Igor Thiago, who lets it bounce before thrashing it past Bayindir. United’s defence were convinced Thiago was offside, but after a VAR check, the goal stands and Brentford lead 1-0.",
      "That's a horrible goal to concede. It was far too simple to launch that ball forward to Thiago. Maguire was left isolated. Amorim did not look pleased before the goal, and certainly won't be happy now."

      "The explanation for Nathan Collins' non-red card against Manchester United was given a potentially embarrassing update following their 3-1 defeat to Brentford. Ruben Amorim's side failed to make it back-to-back wins, giving themselves a mountain to climb in the capital as Bruno Fernandes missed a second-half penalty.",
      "It was the manner in which the Bees conceded the spot-kick which has sparked uproar. Matheus Cunha played it across to Bryan Mbeumo, with a clear sight of goal, before he was hauled down in the penalty area by Collins.",
      "The penalty was given and the Republic of Ireland international was shown a yellow card for the action of pulling the Cameroon forward but following an explanation from the Premier League Match Centre X account, a community note has emerged on the tweet.",
      "Initially, the account provided the reasoning why Collins avoided a sending off, it read: \"The referee’s call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to pulled Mbeumo back.",
      "\"VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.\"",

      "Premium users of the platform are able to add community notes where they can prove that the initial point is incorrect.",
      "Citing the International Football Association Board (IFAB) laws of the game, a rebuttal was put forward which read: \"Control of the ball is not required for a red card.",
      "\"For DOGSO (denial of a goalscoring opportunity), referees consider distance to goal, direction of play, likelihood of keeping/gaining the ball, and defenders' positions. It's about likelihood, not current control.\"",
      "In the IFAB laws, it states: \"Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.\"",
      "In the context of the game, Collins remained on the field when the red card would have given United a lift.",
      "While there is no guarantee that Fernandes would have dispatched the penalty anyway, it could well have aided their response to the 2-1 scoreline - which eventually became three when Mathias Jensen rounded off proceedings in the fifth minute of stoppage time.",
      "Amorim addressed the incident post-match but was keen not to be distracted from the result.",
      "\"The referee told me that Bryan was not in control of the ball,\" Amorim said via the BBC Sport.",
      "\"You [the media] can say what happened. I don't want to talk about the referee.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is coming under increased pressure after Manchester United lost again in the Premier League.",
      "Having beaten Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford last weekend, Amorim had the chance to earn back-to-back league wins for the first time since he joined United nearly a year ago.",
      "But once again, he failed, overseeing a poor 3-1 defeat away to Brentford. United were battered in the opening stages before a goal from Benjamin Sesko, his first for the club, gave them hope of a comeback.",
      "But when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty after a bizzare decision not to show Brentford's Nathan Collins a red card, it became clear that it wouldn't be United's day. The Bees added a third in stoppage time, condemning Amorim to his 17th league defeat in just 33 games.",
      "Now speculation over his position is intensifying, as MEN Sport takes a look at a new development.",
      "Gareth Southgate is reportedly on Manchester United's three-man shortlist to potentially replace Amorim - and he's already been in direct contact with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. That's according to talkSPORT, who report that United are likely to wait until November to pull the trigger.",
      "This would be to reduce the level of compensation, as Amorim will've been in charge for 12 months. Ratcliffe has reportedly been in contact with Southgate in recent weeks to gauge the possibility of him taking over, having been out of work since resigning as England manager in July 2024.",
      "The two other options that United reportedly have shortlisted are Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola. Southgate, 55, was heavily linked to the role prior to his England exit, and his name was also mentioned during the process of appointing Amorim, who could have four games to save his job.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Gareth Southgate has made it increasingly clear that he's decided to move away from football management. In December 2024, the former England boss told the BBC: \"I've been 37 years a player and coach, and I'm not against the next period of my life being totally different. When you've had one of the biggest jobs, how do you follow that up?\"",
      "\"Southgate's comments suggest that he's looking for leadership roles outside of football, as he's hinted at during other media appearances since leaving the Wembley hot seat. Perhaps Sir Jim Ratcliffe is trying to convince Southgate to change his mind, but without ex-FA chief Dan Ashworth on board at United, it seems far-fetched that Southgate would get the job at this point - if he even wants it.",
      "\"Some would argue, though, that United is an even bigger job than managing England, so maybe it is a worthy next role. But the stars don't feel aligned, and given Glasner and Iraola's current careers in the Premier League, they look more suitable candidates for what United are trying to build.\"",
      "The Manchester United hierarchy, including Sir Jim Ratcliffe, remain in full support of Ruben Amorim, according to BBC Sport. Their report dismisses speculation that a shortlist has been drawn up, insisting that Old Trafford chiefs are fully backing the Portguese to turn things around.",
      "Ratcliffe feels that it's only fair to judge Amorim over the course of a full season with what the United co-owner views as the right squad to make progress. Sources add that no one is currently being lined up.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Sir Jim Ratcliffe is once again showing patience with a Manchester United manager. He allowed Erik ten Hag to continue despite a dreadful 2023-24 season, backing him with a summer of spending before ultimately pulling the plug, trusting fellow bigwigs Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada's judgement.",
      "\"But he's playing a dangerous game as ire builds up within the fan base. Constant false dawns are filling United supporters with apathy and if results don't improve, it'll only be a matter of time before things turn toxic at matches.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United failed to make it back-to-back wins as they failed to build on last weekend's triumph over Chelsea, with Brentford running out 3-1 winners on Saturday. Two first-half strikes from Igor Thiago gave the visitors a mountain to climb following a slow start in the capital.",
      "Benjamin Sesko reduced the arrears, netting his first for the club, before Bruno Fernandes squandered a golden opportunity from the spot to level proceedings 15 minutes from time.",
      "Mathias Jensen rounded off the scoring deep into stoppage to compound a miserable afternoon for the travelling United contingent.",
      "It leaves United in 14th on seven points as Keith Andrews' side leapfrogged them with their triumph.",
      "Amorim continues to face speculation over an exit after failing to arrest their inconsistency and poor form. It has led to Zidane being linked with the post, but should a decision be taken, they will have to coax the former Real Madrid head coach in from the cold.",
      "Zidane has not been in the dugout since 2021 after leaving Los Blancos for a second time. In order to do so, Petit, one of his former teammates, says demands will have to be met.",
      "\"Honestly, I know a little bit, Zizou [Zidane], and he needs to get guarantees if he wants to sign over there in Manchester United,\" Petit said in 2024.",
      "\"At the moment, the environment at Manchester United for years has not been good. The stability of the bench, the level of the players as well, the expectation of the club is not the same that it used to be.",
      "\"United is still a huge club, but not on the pitch anymore. And Zizou is very conscious and very careful about that, the quality of the players.\"",
      "He added: \"Could he manage to overturn the situation over there? I think the only answer is yes. But at the moment, when you look at the team, I'm not convinced at all about the level of some players.",
      "\"So if I am Zizou, I think it will be very easy, actually, to answer this question [of joining United]. If I don't speak English on top of it, that will be more problems in terms of communication in the dressing room.",
      "\"If he takes the job at Manchester United, that means he's got solutions. At the moment, I'm not sure a lot of people have the solution to turn the situation at Manchester United.",
      "\"Does he want to leave the sunny days of Madrid? His life is in Madrid, he is dedicated to Madrid.",
      "\"I'm not sure that he speaks very good English as well. And communication is very important in the dressing room.\"",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "",
      "As part of the revamped formats for their three main competitions, UEFA have announced a revenue distribution system for how the total prize money of around £2.88billion would be allocated each season up to 2026/27.",
      "Just over £2.1bn (74.38%) will be distributed to clubs competing in the Champions League and Super Cup, £490.7m (17.02%) to teams participating in the Europa League, and £247.5m (8.6%) split between those in the Europa Conference League.",
      "In the Champions League, the pot is further broken down into:",
      "1) Equal shares (£581.7m/27.5%) – a set ‘starting fee’ of £16.2m for all 36 clubs which qualify for the league phase, who are guaranteed this money regardless of subsequent results in the competition.",
      "2) Performance-related fixed amounts (£793.6m/37.5%) – £1.8m per each league phase win, £608,000 per each league phase draw and £238,000 per each league phase position, going up in increments from the team in 36th receiving £238,000 and the team in 1st receiving £8.57m.",
      "Undistributed amounts from each league phase draw – £608,000 – are also allocated proportionately to these ranking payments at the end of the league phase, so the prize money for positions will be higher.",
      "There is also extra money on offer for finishing in the top eight and for coming between 9th and 16th. This is how Liverpool made a fortune despite being knocked out in the last 16.",

      "He joined Man Utd from Ajax for around £80million in the 2023 summer transfer window and started well, scoring his debut against Arsenal.",
      "But that was as good as it got for the Brazilian at Old Trafford.",
      "In total, Antony registered 12 goals and five assists in 96 appearances across all competitions for Man Utd, winning the Carabao Cup in 2022/23 and the FA Cup in 2023/24.",
      "What makes the signing of Antony even worse is that he was available for around half the price two months before joining, with Ajax significantly increasing their asking price after losing several star players in the 2023 summer window.",

      "In the end, Betis spent £20m to land the 25-year-old permanently and he’s played four times this season, scoring one and assisting one, with both goal involvements coming against Nottingham Forest in the Europa League last week.",
      "Antony is settling in nicely after returning to Spain, and has discussed the “tough” summer he endured in Manchester.",

      "Ruben Amorim ‘has been a disaster for Manchester United’. But there is a collective need to realise just how bad; this reign would be abysmal for any club.",
      "They have picked up a point more than the north Londoners, who changed managers in the summer after the shame of only beating this Manchester United side 1-0 in the Europa League final.",
      "The two clubs immediately above them in that table – West Ham and Wolves – have also sacked their coaches for underperformance, but on Manchester United plough with a manager who has spent three of his 323 days in charge in the top half.",
      "It is a ludicrous lowering of the bar at a club which before this season had never finished lower than 8th – and for most that alone would have been enough to part ways with Erik ten Hag earlier than they did.",
      "“You’re talking about Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world. Let’s be fair, he’s a lucky, lucky boy still to be in a job,” said Duncan Ferguson.",
      "“I think he’s got a bit of credit on what he did last year, coming to Man United when they were struggling, so he came last year and didn’t really want to come last season. I think they’ve given him a wee bit of credit in the bank there.",
      "“But for a team like Man United…you see the stats, the stats are there for all to see. So he’s very lucky to stay in his job. But hopefully he gets another few games, you always want managers to stay in their jobs and be successful. But that’s not good enough.”",
      "Carragher shifted the responsibility onto the silent executive team at Manchester United who chose Amorim and continue to back him in spite of all available evidence.",
      "“I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another,” he said.",
      "“This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don’t think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "“The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don’t want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.”",
      "And it has “been a disaster for Manchester United”. But perhaps the entire world is guilty of overlooking the degree to which this has gone wrong. This is not just Manchester United bad; this is historically Premier League bad.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has been ‘speaking volumes’ with his decision to go ahead with a party that wasn’t his party.",
      "He has also been making drastic and dramatic U-turns that are nothing of the sort.",
      "",
      "Mediawatch has written at length about the phrase ‘speaks volumes’ and how it has somehow been given a power beyond its actual meaning (‘If something speaks volumes, it makes an opinion, characteristic, or situation very clear without the use of words’).",
      "It has become ubiquitous in modern football reporting and examples from just the last 24 hours include:",
      "‘Declan Rice’s message to Gabriel Magalhaes after Newcastle United clash speaks volumes’ – Chronicle Live. Nothing to do with Newcastle United, it’s not a ‘message’ and it didn’t ‘speak volumes’. Other than that, all good.",
      "‘Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka decision speaks volumes as Mikel Arteta makes feelings clear’ – football.london. The story: footballer in line to get new contract commensurate with his standing in the Premier League. Does that ‘speak volumes’? At least it fulfills the ‘without the use of words’ criteria. A reluctant tick.",
      "‘Jarrod Bowen message about West Ham ‘buzz’ speaks volumes about Graham Potter’s demise’ – football.london. Nope.",
      "What Ruben Amorim did after Brentford speaks volumes about his current Manchester United mindset",
      "Did he sob? We would hardly blame him. He is apparently ‘lonely’. Did he throw something against a wall? Did he Google the next plane back to Lisbon?",
      "Under-pressure Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim held a team bonding day for players and their families – despite his increasingly precarious position.",
      "Did Ruben Amorim ‘hold a team bonding day for players and their families’? Or did Manchester United arrange – many weeks ago – a family day at Carrington to which players’ and staff families were invited, with lunch and activities provided for around 100 guests? We’re edging towards the latter.",
      "And McDonnell absolute agrees.",
      "The open day for players and their families, attended by Amorim and his family and held at United’s Carrington training ground on Sunday, is understood to have been arranged before the start of the season to allow the squad’s wives, partners and children to see first-hand the £50million upgrade to the facilities at the complex.",
      "So absolutely not ‘held’ by Amorim but instead ‘attended’ by him because – and we are making assumptions here – Amorim is not personally responsible for the £50million upgrade to the facilities at the complex. Though that might explain why he is still in a job.",
      "The fact the open day still went ahead, despite the crushing loss at Brentford, shows that, for Amorim at least, it remains business as usual, despite the pressure mounting on the United boss, who has won just nine of his 33 league games in charge, losing 17 of them.",
      "We cannot stress this enough: This was clearly not Amorim’s decision to make. It was not his party. The fact that it went ahead did not ‘speak volumes about his current Manchester United mindset’. What it does is show that when large companies arrange social events months in advance, they generally go ahead.",
      "",
      "Elsewhere, there’s some absolute nonsense being written about Tyrell Malacia being reintegrated into the Manchester United first-team squad.",
      "We are told by the Mirror that it’s a ‘dramatic U-turn’ and by the Express that it’s a ‘drastic U-turn’.",
      "Sometimes, just sometimes, there are no U-turns and nothing speaks volumes.",
      "",
      "‘NEW MANAGER Nuno Espirito Santo has already impressed West Ham fans by finally deploying a highly-rated young star who is the son of a club assistant,’ says The Sun.",
      "‘Many fans expected the youngster to have a significant role with the first team this season, but he struggled to find minutes under Graham Potter.",
      "‘Hammers supporters didn’t hold back in their praise for the midfielder, nor with their condemnation for Potter’s decision not to use him.’",
      "Pesky fact: Freddie Potts played 45 minutes for West Ham against Chelsea under Graham Potter; he played 31 minutes against Everton under Nuno Espirito Santo. Finally.",
      "Liverpool look exposed in defence, muddled in attack and just generally not quite like a team of champions injected with a record investment of over £400m.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Casemiro will be the ‘first victim’ of huge cuts at Old Trafford, according to football finance expert Stefan Borson.",
      "Man Utd could move for former Barcelona boss Xavi if they decide to part company with current head coach Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘has been a disaster for Manchester United’. But there is a collective need to realise just how bad; this reign would be abysmal for any club.",
      "We can’t spend our whole lives laughing at Manchester United; sometimes we have to doff caps to the clubs smashing this football lark.",

      "Oliver Glasner‘s side are riding the crest of a wave as one of the in-form teams in the Premier League, having extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 18 games against Liverpool at the weekend.",
      "Unlike Ruben Amorim, Glasner’s preferred 3-4-3 system is a well-oiled machine with a superb spine and players in all positions that are perfectly tailored to this specialised set-up.",

      "Palace and Man Utd are clear of their nearest rivals at the bottom, with 18th-placed Wolves at -1.57, Nottingham Forest at -1.47, Brighton at -1.43 and Newcastle United at -1.18.",

      "The latest example of this issue for Palace was against Liverpool, with Glasner’s team finding the net twice from an xG of 2.92 and seven shots on target.",
      "And Glasner is aware of this problem, with the head coach admitting ahead of the match against Liverpool that his side has not taken advantage of their chances in various matches this season.",
      "“I’m always positive,” Glasner said before the 2-1 win vs Liverpool.",
      "“I always think that we can score two goals – but against Sunderland we didn’t do it. Against Millwall we didn’t do it. We had the chances.",

      "Another defeat for Manchester United prompted the inevitable handwringing and hilarity over the position a once-great club continues to find itself.",
      "The next obvious move for United would be to change their manager. Again. Given the lack of tangible improvement since he was appointed almost a year ago and the lack of optimism over a swift and dramatic reversal of their current fortunes, Ruben Amorim could have few arguments if he was handed his cards.",
      "Actually, he might gladly receive them. On numerous occasions, Amorim has presented as a manager aching to be put out of his misery, despite the outward defiance while steadfastly, stubbornly refusing to even consider that there may be good reasons why few clubs employ his formation of choice.",
      "Certainly, only United use it while so woefully ill-equipped. Amorim knows, but persists regardless, and so too do his bosses, if the noises coming out of Old Trafford are to be believed.",
      "Apparently, United are not thinking of dispensing with Amorim because Sir Jim Ratcliffe feels it is only fair to judge him after a full season with, as the BBC’s Simon Stone reports, the ‘right team’.",
      "Amorim may get a full season. But not one with the right team.",
      "How can it be when the individuals don’t fit the system? That was a very fair and reasonable excuse for the sh*t that was served through the second half of last season. But even after a full summer transfer window, United have failed to furnish Amorim with the players necessary to make his system work.",
      "We can all spend hours picking apart the components of Amorim’s United team – it’s how many get their kicks – but the flaws that really stand out: the absence of a No.1 goalkeeper, wing-backs of the necessary standard, a midfielder to hold it all together, and the redeployment of their best player in a wholly unsuitable role.",
      "Even if we look beyond the fact that Amorim is putting his devout faith in his system above the immediate needs of the team he is paid handsomely to improve, there are plenty of reasons to target the manager. But Amorim is taking all the bullets, providing cover for those who set him up to fail.",
      "Perhaps the root of many of United’s problems can be found in the layers between the manager and minority owner who remain the faces of the club’s failures. At what point do we look at Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada and Christopher Vivell? And how would anyone ask: what the f*** are you doing, lads?",
      "Wilcox is United’s director of football. No one has really thought to question the power the solid-if-unspectacular ex-winger wields at one of the world’s biggest clubs. Except Dave Tickner, of course. Perhaps we ought to have scrutinised his ascent more rather than simply waving it through, just because it was said for so long that United needed a sporting director, it almost passed the point that it mattered who.",
      "MORE: Jason Wilcox is one of English football’s most powerful figures, in accordance with the prophecy",
      "Wilcox was initially technical director, working alongside Dan Ashworth before it was quickly realised that his face didn’t fit. So Wilcox stepped up – or across; given the lack of definition around these types of roles, it’s often hard to know for sure – to take overall responsibility for football operations at Old Trafford and Carrington.",
      "Wilcox was said to harbour concerns over Amorim’s suitability for the United job when the Red Devils first considered the Portuguese as a replacement for Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2024 prior to a U-turn on their decision to ditch the Dutchman. Before U-turning again less than three months into the season. Wilcox’s concerns: the level of recruitment required to make United 3-4-3 ready in a timely fashion; and the fact it is not a system that has regularly provided a foundation for success in the Premier League.",
      "When perhaps he ought to have trusted his instincts, Wilcox was swayed by Amorim, since it was him who led the process which identified the then-Sporting coach as the best man for the job.",
      "It is unclear how Amorim’s arrival impacted Wilcox’s quest to develop a ‘game model’, a clear and cohesive playing style that should permeate through the ranks at Carrington, but it seems that project has been shelved while United pin everything on a system their director of football never fancied anyway.",
      "If Wilcox did have doubts, then it explains why United were reluctant to fully equip Amorim with the players he needed in the summer. Perhaps Christopher Vivell could explain what happened there.",
      "He after all is United’s director of recruitment, a role he has held since summer 2024. No doubt United fans would relish the opportunity to ask the German why the club signed three forwards – two were needed, no question – but no midfielder in the summer; and why they opted against recruiting an experienced, proven goalkeeper. But the chances many supporters could pick Vivell out of a line-up are as slim as their title hopes.",
      "Few of these execs possess the kind of profile where they might be identified in the street. And there are reasons for that. The modern-day football club structure is still relatively new, evidenced by the fact that whenever a sporting director job comes up, it is always the same few names that are mentioned. With so few proven track records in the candidate pool, you can see the temptation in appointing your brother, son, agent, mate.",
      "New enough too that there is no provable link between visibility and competence. Especially when fighting with coaches, players and occasionally owners for the spotlight on a crowded stage only opens you up to greater scrutiny.",
      "Which highlights the contradiction with these roles: Wilcox, Vivell, Berrada and their peers at other clubs, all appear to wield more power than the managers and coaches – considerably so, in some cases – yet are too often unaccountable to anyone outside their boardroom.",
      "These are football’s cushiest gigs. Just as turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, why would any sporting director or recruitment guru volunteer to go on the record, even just to own their decisions if not to explain them?",
      "Managers must go before the media three times a game. In the Premier League, there is no obligation for those above them to put themselves out even once a season and, given the power they wield, that should change.",
      "Until it does, we are likely to hear scandalously little from Wilcox, Vivell and Berrada while they cower in the shadow of their shield, for now taking the form of a handsome-but-beleaguered Portuguese football coach.",
      "Liverpool look exposed in defence, muddled in attack and just generally not quite like a team of champions injected with a record investment of over £400m.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘has been a disaster for Manchester United’. But there is a collective need to realise just how bad; this reign would be abysmal for any club.",

      "The Newcastle medical department is working overtime to expedite the recovery of their problem solver; Manchester United might get desperate soon too.",
      "It is rare for a new signing not to have debuted this far into a season. Not every player immediately becomes a guaranteed starter upon joining but the increasing importance of squad rotation and advent of other competitions allows the minutes to be shared around.",
      "If you haven’t at least been given a Carabao cameo then something has gone dreadfully wrong.",
      "But some are still waiting for their first run-out in front of an adoring new support. A few of them are back-up keepers who will only play in the event of an actual disaster; others are being handled with care because of how crucial they could prove to be.",
      "Let us rank those summer signings awaiting their debut in terms of how desperate their new clubs will be for them to make that bow.",
      "",
      "He rather optimistically hoped to “contribute in training, the dressing room and on the pitch,” while Director of Football Hugo Viana stifled a laugh when explaining that Bettinelli would “complement our other senior goalkeepers” and make sure “he’s always ready to perform when called upon himself”.",
      "Chelsea called upon him once in four seasons for an FA Cup third-round tie in January 2022. Bettinelli has more Premier League yellow cards than appearances since November 2018 after once being booked from the bench for the Blues. He is making Scott Carson proud.",
      "",
      "The archetypal third-choice keeper, King spent two years at Wolves and made his debut on the final day of last season as a substitute in the final minute. He kept a clean sheet.",
      "Everton will not want to risk that record. Their last Premier League game without Jordan Pickford was so long ago that Neal Maupay scored for Frank Lampard’s side as David Moyes managed the opposition – although the Toffees beat West Ham 1-0 with Asmir Begovic in net so Pickford is clearly holding them back.",

      "Will never play and will still be sold to Brentford or Bournemouth for £20m.",
      "",
      "Will never play while honouring the proud legacy of world and Premier League champion Andy Lonergan.",
      "",
      "Last played in the Premier League more than three years ago for Norwich. Should be used in the Europa if Ange has the minerals.",
      "",
      "Mads Hermansen has already been dropped and Alphonse Areola has not inspired confidence in his place. At 40 there is every chance Fabianski has used his spare time to do his coaching badges, which would only increase his desirability to West Ham.",
      "",
      "While there was a miserable place for Leon on the bench in the Grimsby defeat, Manchester derby and Brentford loss, it is generally thought he will need time and patience to acclimatise after moving from Paraguay for the first time at 18.",
      "That was reinforced by his first game in England, 45 minutes for the U21s against Liverpool which journalist Nathan Salt described as ‘pretty tough’ and ‘very raw’.",
      "",
      "September brought an England U20 debut but Donovan is being integrated slowly after an exciting pre-season for the 18-year-old. One cannot master the art of the long throw in a matter of weeks.",

      "“We won’t be putting him under any pressure and we won’t be giving any guarantees to the supporters that he’s going to be seen right away,” said David Moyes upon the arrival of Aznou.",
      "That has bore out as expected. The 19-year-old has made the last two benches – but was understandably not called upon when Vitalii Mykolenko was substituted late in the Merseyside derby – while being given 81 minutes in the EFL Trophy. He is on the right path.",
      "",
      "Thigh surgery has sidelined the planned understudy to Moises Caicedo, promoting Andrey Santos in the midfield pecking order and giving Facundo Buonanotte a Champions League squad place.",
      "There remain high hopes for Essugo but Chelsea have enough players not to rush him back unless someone does something stupid. Probably Robert Sanchez. Or anyone else really.",
      "",
      "Frustration is brewing at Bayern Munich over an initial lack of playing time for 18-year-old forward Kusi-Asare, who might have benefited more from a loan in more forgiving climes.",
      "His entire senior career comprises 66 minutes so Fulham are not immediately inclined to further the development of a player they don’t own. But the Carabao could again be a natural starting point.",
      "",
      "Among the many hills Ruben Amorim appears willing to die on is that Altay Bayindir is his Manchester United keeper. The noise is that a significant signing in that position will be targeted soon, leaving 23-year-old Lammens with few avenues to properly introduce himself to a confused fanbase.",
      "",
      "Being neither Max Kilman nor Konstantinos Mavropanos should eventually work in his favour.",
      "",
      "It does feel like the defensively excellent side which is simultaneously the joint-lowest scorers so far this season would probably benefit from having their £55m striker who scored 19 times last campaign up and running.",
      "Liverpool look exposed in defence, muddled in attack and just generally not quite like a team of champions injected with a record investment of over £400m.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘has been a disaster for Manchester United’. But there is a collective need to realise just how bad; this reign would be abysmal for any club.",
      "We can’t spend our whole lives laughing at Manchester United; sometimes we have to doff caps to the clubs smashing this football lark.",
      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has been ‘speaking volumes’ with his decision to go ahead with a party that wasn’t his party.",
      "Arsenal want credit. But not too much credit. Are Liverpool and their new expensive attack still the favourites?",
      "While Man Utd are this bad, they can’t afford a goalkeeper to be letting in more than he should. Ruben Amorim needs a stopper like Sunderland’s…"

      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Arsenal) – £50.4m",

      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the November selections with four more games each:",

      "Man Utd‘s problems from last season have carried over into this campaign as they are still toothless in attack and easy to play through, with Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 not working.",
      "Despite this, Amorim is naively refusing to budge and is sticking to his guns over his formation, which will likely prove to be his downfall.",

      "Amorim is said to ‘retain the backing’ of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, while there is also a claim on reports suggesting Man Utd are already are already searching for his replacement.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘Despite reports to the contrary, sources are adamant the bosses are not lining up a list of replacements.",
      "‘The club, under its new INEOS stewardship, is determined to take a long-term view in all the decisions it takes – about player recruitment, facilities and the coaching staff – and so will not make any knee-jerk reaction to individual defeats.’",
      "However, a report from The Sun has indicated that Amorim is losing backing among the squad, with ‘dressing room sources’ insisting the  ‘players are astonished by how quickly they have spiralled this season’.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘The United squad was genuinely optimistic of having a successful season after a harmonious pre-season in Chicago but there is already uncertainty over the future of head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "‘United are monitoring potential replacements for Amorim, with Premier League-based coaches Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Fabian Hurzeler all under consideration. United denied whispers that Amorim had been called in for talks on Saturday night after the debacle at Brentford.’",
      "After the loss to Brentford, pundit Alan Shearer has raised a potential reason behind Man Utd’s decision to stick with Amorim.",
      "“Ruben Amorim is under massive pressure,” Shearer said.",

      "Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo admits the players \"need to take responsibility\" for their poor start to the season, which has put head coach Ruben Amorim under serious pressure.",
      "\"Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the fans and I will never forget that,\" he said.",
      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",

      "Magpies goalkeeper Pope eventually avoided conceding a penalty after he came out to challenge Gunners forward Gyokeres in the first half of Arsenal's 2-1 win at St James' Park. Running towards the ball in the Newcastle area, Pope rushed out to challenge Gyokeres, appearing to bring him down in the process.",
      "Referee Jarred Gillett initially gave a penalty for the challenge; however, VAR Darren England recommended an on-field review. After around three minutes, Gillett then announced the decision had been overturned.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Mikel Arteta were critical of the decision after the game. The pair questioned how it was deemed 'clear and obvious' to overturn the decision.",
      "REF: On-field decision is a penalty. Nick Pope, a trip by Nick Pope.",
      "VAR: OK, checking the on-field decision of penalty.",
      "VAR: Got a better angle?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, I've got a better angle from behind here.",
      "VAR: Does he get a touch on the ball, the goalkeeper? I think he gets a touch on the ball. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball here.",
      "Assistant VAR: Yes, he does, yeah.",
      "VAR: Does he? One more time. He actually gets a touch on the ball, doesn't he?",
      "AVAR: Yeah, there's a secondary touch.",
      "VAR: Give me another angle, please. Just make sure that Pope touches the ball, please.",
      "Replay Operator: I've got an SSM (Super Slow Motion), but it's from the other side.",
      "VAR:  He does touch the ball, doesn't he? Touches the ball first, then there's contact afterwards. Therefore, that's not a penalty kick. He touches the ball there.",
      "Replay Operator: This is the best angle.",
      "AVAR: Have you got the behind view?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, this is the best angle I've got.",
      "VAR: He does, doesn't he? He touches. OK, let's just check the APP (Attacking Possession Phase) as it goes over as well.",
      "AVAR: It's definitely played by a defender. But check it anyway.",
      "VAR: Jarred, I'm going to recommend an on-field review for possible no penalty. Let me know when you've got the monitor. I am going to check APP as well. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball.",
      "Replay Operator: I'll go slowly so you can check the APP.",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah. It's his defender, a clear defender, isn't it? It's always clear defender, that's fine. The APP has been checked, the APP is clear as well. I'm going to show you the tight angle first with the ball being touched by Nick Pope. Any contact that happens thereafter, after the contact has been made.",
      "VAR: Nick Pope gets a touch with his right foot, I'll give you another angle on the touch.",
      "REF: Show me a better angle to see that he touches the ball.",
      "VAR: I will do, I'll show you a better angle.",
      "Replay Operator: Do you want the SSM from the other side?",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, super slow. Super slow, coming in now. Gets a touch on the ball there. And then just plants his foot in a normal action.",
      "REF: The attacker plays the ball first. I don't know if the goalkeeper actually plays the ball.",
      "VAR: The attacker plays the ball. Yeah, the attacker plays the ball, and the goalkeeper plays the ball then with his right foot, there.",
      "REF: Just play it at full speed, please.",
      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",
      "VAR: Agree.",
      "REF: So after a view, the goalkeeper plays the ball, there's no foul. Final decision, we drop ball.",
      "VAR: Confirmed.",
      "\"At full speed, it looks a penalty, doesn't it? And you can absolutely understand why the referee gave it from what he saw on the field.",
      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",

      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system. It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is.",

      "Another defeat for Manchester United, more inevitable and raucous debate about whether Ruben Amorim is the right man for the job.",
      "The noise from outside the club is growing, but within the Old Trafford halls of power, the United bosses remain steadfastly patient with the Portuguese head coach. Albeit with mounting frustration on all sides at the team's inconsistency.",
      "Amorim himself has repeated his assertion that he is not concerned about the possibility of being sacked, but he knows results have to improve significantly - and quickly - if he is to stay in the job.",
      "Despite reports to the contrary, sources are adamant the bosses are not lining up a list of replacements. The club, under its new INEOS stewardship, is determined to take a long-term view in all the decisions it takes - about player recruitment, facilities and the coaching staff - and so will not make any knee-jerk reaction to individual defeats.",
      "The trouble for Amorim is that results have been persistently poor since he took over, and the optimism-inducing win over Chelsea has been followed up with a chastening 3-1 defeat against Brentford. United have taken 34 points from his 33 games in charge, and have yet to muster back-to-back wins in his 11 months at the helm.",
      "United are not actively looking for their next manager. Nevertheless, every football club has contingency plans in place should they lose the head coach, in whatever circumstances, and it would be naive to think United will not have specific targets in mind if, for example, Amorim chose to resign.",
      "He said in August following the Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town that \"sometimes I want to quit\". But he also said at the time \"sometimes I want to stay for 20 years\".",
      "At Old Trafford and Carrington, there are no murmurings for managerial change. But ultimately, it comes down to the decision of one man: Sir Jim. And his current levels of patience will not sustain indefinitely.",
      "Meanwhile, the club legends are lining up to voice their dismay - Wayne Rooney says he has \"no faith\" that Amorim can turn things around. Gary Neville says for the first time, he is worried the players are \"really doubting the system\".",
      "Crystal Palace are proving that Amorim's chosen formation can be successful. Oliver Glasner has used a consistent 3-4-2-1 shape, and has delivered the FA Cup and Community Shield already, with this team having just beaten the champions.",
      "Palace's achievements are an example of how it could work for United, but also a reminder of how poorly the team is doing by comparison. Palace are flying high in third spot in the Premier League. United are 14th.",
      "It is still very early in the season, we are only six league matches in. But Amorim desperately needs his system to start paying dividends. And there is growing doubt about some of his decision-making.",
      "Against Brentford when United were chasing the game, the head coach changed his back five, in either personnel or position, six times. Mason Mount only came on in the 81st minute, but he played two different positions in what was left of the match - No 10 and left wing-back - a move that Neville called \"unforgivable\".",
      "No timescale has been set for Amorim to get it right. There is no deadline in terms of games, or set target in terms of wins. And yet there is a growing sense that United's next game - Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday - has the feeling of being a must-win for the home side.",
      "With the international break straight afterwards and a two-week gap in club football, if that one were to end badly, then the clamour for Amorim's removal would only grow, and Ratcliffe's determination to stick with his man would be severely tested.",
      "\"The sad thing about it for Man Utd and the supporters right now is it's not really a shock result - you look at Man Utd going to Brentford and I don't think many people would predict Man Utd would go and win. Brentford were fourth from bottom. And that's the sad state of affairs they find themselves in.\"",
      "Amorim's commitment to his 3-4-2-1 system has been a big talking point throughout his tenure.",
      "Carragher doesn't blame the Portuguese for sticking to that formation but asked why Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United board chose Amorim to take on the job from Erik ten Hag when he didn't play a system typical of United's traditions.",
      "\"We keep talking about the system,\" said Carragher. \"It doesn't suit the players that are there, I totally understand that, but the powers that be that employed the manager knew what system he played and that's what gave him success.",
      "\"If you've had success as a manager, that's what you'll fall back on when things aren't going well. I can understand why he sticks with the system because that's his baby, that's his thing, that's what he does.",
      "\"The people in charge picked a manager who doesn't signify the traditions of that club going back 50, 60, 70 years. It's a big pitch [at Old Trafford], fast wingers... and the system he plays just doesn't employ them at all.",
      "\"It always felt a strange fit in terms of the system from the very start.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is incredibly honest but also accurate when he reflects on and analyses his Manchester United side before and after games.",
      "So with the lack of European and Carabao Cup football, it is truly puzzling why United aren't able to address those flaws and show consistency with a full week to prepare on the training ground.",
      "Even more so, after they showed such grit and determination to beat Chelsea the weekend before only for it to evaporate at Brentford.",
      "The struggle for momentum pre-dates Amorim. United have not won back-to-back Premier League games in the same season since May 2024.",
      "The mental block in the squad is a problem he has inherited and one he continues to try to address.",
      "He has spoken about how he hoped the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo would alleviate that burden. But, despite some positive moments, it seems those old scars remain.",
      "Amorim has not yet shown the body of work at United that shows the required consistency is on the way. He would be the first to acknowledge that.",
      "Since his appointment, Amorim has picked up only 34 points in 33 Premier League games, a truly staggering statistic that nobody can hide from.",
      "One wonders how long the United leadership will allow this form to continue when you consider Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, was only given nine games last season before he was sacked.",

      "Neville has admitted he is worried about United as he raised serious doubts about the club's direction under Amorim.",
      "United suffered a third defeat in six Premier League games this season when they were beaten 3-1 at Brentford on Saturday, with Amorim's side failing to build on the previous week's win over Chelsea. United have still not back-to-back Premier League games under the head coach.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" he said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"The performance that we saw and the result at Brentford means that you feel the Chelsea game was skewed by the sending off. You start to look at the Chelsea win less positively. That's just football.",
      "\"I think there are a lot of United fans coming out of that ground last Saturday, including me, thinking Brentford away, Sunderland at home next week has a real opportunity to get nine points on the board, on the bounce, and then you'll be well up in the top six or eight.",
      "\"But the Brentford game was a really poor performance and a real worry.",
      "\"I felt for the first time, just through instinct, watching it on the television, seeing players' faces and body language, that there might be an element of players really doubting the system and what's going on.",

      "\"But then when you're putting Mason Mount at left wing-back - and he's ended up at left wing-back again at Brentford in the last five minutes to the game - it starts to look awful.\"",

      "\"It becomes a pattern and the manager comes under huge pressure. We've seen what's happened with Graham Potter in the last few days. That's why I'm worried because this is not going to go away and it's going to build in this next week or so.",

      "Monday 29 September 2025 10:23, UK",
      "Brentford's Nathan Collins was lucky not to see red against Manchester United, said Dermot Gallagher on Ref Watch, as Jay Bothroyd described the decision not to send him off as \"baffling\".",
      "Read on for Gallagher and Bothroyd's thoughts on the weekend's action...",
      "INCIDENT: The decision was made not to send off Collins after he conceded a penalty. VAR checked the yellow card shown to Collins after a penalty was given, but they agreed with the referee's decision with Bryan Mbuemo deemed to be not in control of the ball.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Nathan got really, really lucky. The VAR would have looked at it and decided Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.",
      "\"Nathan panics. He pulls his shirt and if he doesn't do that, Mbeumo, who got a touch to the ball, would have got it. He's got a clear goalscoring opportunity eight yards out.",
      "\"They looked at it, looked at it and looked at it. I have a theory that your gut takes over. You look at a replay and you make up your mind. The more you look at it, the more you doubt yourself.\"",
      "Jay Bothroyd on Ref Watch: \"It baffles me. Mbeumo is not in control of the ball because he's not going to control it.",
      "\"He's going to hit that first time. The pace is on the cross and all he is going to do is redirect the ball towards the corner.",
      "\"He's not going to control that in a million years.\"",
      "INCIDENT: VAR Darren England intervenes after referee Jarred Gillett awarded a penalty to Arsenal after Nick Pope appeared to foul Viktor Gyokeres. The referee changed his mind after looking at the screen and overturned the decision.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It shows how difficult it was with Gary Neville going from being adamant it was a penalty to being torn when he sees it again.",
      "\"Pope does get a touch on the ball. My immediate instinct was penalty... but Pope does plant his foot so he doesn't follow through with the tackle so that's why it was overturned.",
      "\"This year, they've tried to stick with the on-field decision as much as possible, but once the VAR looks at it, he's decided that Pope has played the ball - that's the key factor.",
      "\"He's sent the referee to the screen but he can still hold his ground. He can still say it's a penalty. Referees take everything into consideration - where the ball is going, the direction of play, would the player have got it?\"",
      "On the similarities with the Robert Sanchez incident from the previous weekend: \"It was different. He touches the ball and follows through with the tackle... with the Pope one, he touches the ball but he plants his foot and does no more.",
      "\"Pope does not go into Gyokeres. He's stopping.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Newcastle's appeals for a penalty for handball against Gabriel were turned down by Gillett. VAR checked the incident but stuck with the on-field decision.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"This is a really interesting decision.",
      "\"The rule is that if the ball strikes your body and flies up onto your arm, it's not going to be given because it is not possible to get out of the way.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gabriel also escaped punishment after a clash with Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Gabriel is lucky he doesn't actually strike Woltemade properly.",
      "\"Where he is lucky is the referee hasn't seen it. It's gone to VAR and they don't think it's a red card. I don't think it's a red card.",
      "\"The referee has seen something has happened and what he does well is he calms them down and takes the sting out of the incident.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Trevoh Chalobah was sent off after a VAR review for the denying of a goalscoring opportunity with a foul on Diego Gomez.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I wonder whether Simon Hooper initially thought he caught him with his shoulder, but he's definitely tripped him.",
      "\"Gomez got across the defender and he's in the ascendancy. Once he's got there, the defender clips him and it's a red card.\"",
      "INCIDENT: VAR said no penalty as Malo Gusto's boot looks to have made contact with Yankuba Minteh's head.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I think penalty. Once you raise a foot that high, you run a massive risk. He catches him.",
      "\"VAR looked and said there's no conclusive evidence that he's caught him.\"",
      "INCIDENT: There was a long check on Liverpool's equaliser. Federico Chiesa was the scorer, but VAR looked at whether Mo Salah had handballed it in the process and eventually ruled the goal out.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I honestly don't know about this one. I usually have a gut reaction when I look at a replay and then I make up my mind.",
      "\"I've looked at this again this morning, I looked yesterday and on Saturday, and I still can't tell if he's handled the ball.",
      "\"In that case, unless you are convinced he's handled the ball, play on.\"",
      "Bothroyd on Ref Watch: \"I think it's handball. I've seen different angles, I've seen it slowed down, and it looks like it has hit his hand.",
      "\"It even looks like it has put off the defender. He's not able to get a full head on the ball and that's how you can tell it has hit his hand. Liverpool got away with one.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Crystal Palace's first goal came from a corner awarded in error - it should have been a goal kick. Why can't VAR intervene?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"The referee doesn't see it because he's behind the play and he doesn't see it strike (Tyrick) Mitchell, with the assistant on the other side and that's why it's unlucky.",
      "\"This probably happens once a game that something goes the wrong way but it becomes vocal because it leads to a goal.",

      "Sunday 28 September 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went to Brentford in search of their first back-to-back league wins under him, which tells you all you need to know about the progress made in the 33 games since he took charge.",
      "Amorim described the game as the club's \"most important in a long time\" but his players failed to translate that urgency onto the pitch as they suffered a deflating 3-1 defeat.",
      "Victory over 10-man Chelsea last week was unable to inspire the consistency that will ultimately be required to keep Amorim in a job and they have sunk back into the bottom half of the table. So where does Amorim go from here?",
      "It was once again so obvious that United's set-up was a massive issue at Brentford.",
      "Forget criticism of playing three at the back, others have shown it is no impediment to success. It is Amorim's insistence on leaving his two-man midfield pivot exposed that comes back to bite him time and again.",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three-at-the-back system, while keeping a midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were overrun by Brentford, who richly deserved the three points.",
      "Amorim did not seem to want to acknowledge those issues after the game. \"It's always the same, when we win it's not the system, when we lose it's the system,\" he said.",
      "So far, we've yet to see Amorim's United dominate a top team in the Premier League that has a full accompaniment of players. After Casemiro's red card last week, Chelsea made United sweat for the win.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews, who was in charge of set pieces in the club's set-up under Thomas Frank last season, explained after the game how his side overloaded United's midfield.",
      "\"It's the natural way you prepare for games,\" said Andrews, when asked if he targeted United's midfield. \"You try and create overloads,\" he added.",
      "\"One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in, then they have a four'. But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through [them], at times, would be on.\"",
      "Andrews, in his first season as a senior head coach, demonstrated the value in adaptability on Saturday, while Amorim finished the game with Mbeumo and Mason Mount as his wing-backs.",
      "Defeat at Brentford means that is exactly where United will start the month after finishing last season 15th in the table despite a spend of more than £200m over the summer on a new strikeforce, who failed to impress on their first outing together at Brentford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did manage to score his first United goal, though there was little spark between himself, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players,\" Neville, the former United captain, said at the time.",
      "United's decision-makers are behind Amorim, but another defeat when Sunderland go to Old Trafford next week would ramp up the pressure on the head coach over the international break.",
      "However, Amorim, who has reportedly offered his job up on more than one occasion, says fears about potentially being sacked do not enter his mind.",
      "\"I'm always comfortable with the job,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "Amorim got a message of backing after the Manchester derby defeat. You wonder how many more set-backs he can survive before patience runs thin.",
      "Results are the only thing that can save Amorim and he knows that. His record in the league stands at nine victories in 33 games. That is a win percentage of 27.3 per cent, lower than any other to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson by some distance.",
      "United have made a habit of starting games at a fast pace this season, certainly against Arsenal, Fulham, Burnley and Chelsea. Amorim wants his team to get off to a good start because he knows what happens when they don't.",
      "Each league game this season in which United have conceded the first goal, they have lost.",
      "The pressure cooker of Old Trafford has been too much for most players to sign for the club over the last decade and Amorim is trying to find a way to build confidence in the way his team plays.",
      "He has enjoyed some success with this, at least in United's home games, but at Brentford, there was no sign of the electric start that overcame Chelsea. Without the crowd, the players struggle to cope.",
      "This is reflected by their current eight-game winless run away from home in the league. The last one came in March at Leicester, who were relegated a month later.",
      "Before that, it was at Fulham at the end of January. United were hardly convincing in that game either. Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike just got them over the line.",
      "The mental fragility - and inability to cope without the support of Old Trafford - is a huge hindrance to Amorim's bid to bring consistency back to United.",
      "\"It's like ups and downs,\" said Amorim, when asked about this latest setback.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything and that the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"I cannot tell you more than I say every time I lose the game. Sometimes you see one team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you have some games that you don't see the improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.",

      "United only have themselves to blame for the result, their third defeat in a four-game winless run at Brentford, that was sealed when Mathias Jensen struck a superb third goal in stoppage-time. All the momentum of the win over Chelsea had vanished.",
      "Brentford were two goals up after 20 minutes thanks to Igor Thaigo's first-half double and, although Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit six minutes later, United were never convincing in their fight-back.",

      "\"They told me Bryan was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled,\" Amorim said in his post-match press conference.",
      "He added: \"Sometimes the decisions are not in your favour. We have the capacity to calm down the game. We didn't do that today.\"",
      "Former Premier League official Mike Dean, speaking on Soccer Saturday, was in agreement: \"For me, it is a red card.\"",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three at the back system, but head coach Keith Andrews kept his midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were outnumbered and overrun by Brentford.",

      "\"But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through, at times, would be on. And I felt, going back to it, the players did that with real courage and conviction.\"",
      "On goalscorer Thiago, Andrews added: \"He's getting real rhythm in his game now and confidence in his game. He's shown exactly why the football club brought him here. He's such a powerful player. Very positive individual and very selfless.\"",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Old Trafford. They came to Brentford in search of the club's first back-to-back league wins under Amorim, but Thiago scored twice in the first 20 minutes before the United players had woken up.",
      "Harry Maguire was culpable for the opener as Jordan Henderson's long ball over the top caught him napping. Thiago was all alone when he hammered in the opener. The whole stadium thought he was offside, only for replays to show Maguire was slow off the mark.",
      "United, losers in every league game in which they have trailed this season, were unable to cope with Brentford, who terrorised their visitors from set-pieces. Altay Bayindir made two fine saves from Henderson and then Collins but was at fault for Thiago's second.",
      "The Brentford striker just had to fire in from close-range after Kevin Schade's cross was spilled by Bayindir in the six-yard box. Thiago needed just six touches to score his two goals, which takes him to five in seven games this season.",
      "This was the first time Amorim had started United's £207m front three of Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha but the first impression was not a positive one. Their lack of desire to help in midfield left the pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte exposed.",
      "Sesko did manage to break his United duck in his fourth start for the club as Patrick Dorgu's hopeful, looping cross eventually found him. It took three goes to beat Kelleher from close-range, the former Liverpool keeper pulling off a couple of fine saves.",
      "Brentford taking their foot off the gas gave United encouragement, though they lacked punch. When the spot-kick was awarded it felt like the piece of luck that Amorim needed to turn his troubled tenure around, but Fernandes let him down.",
      "There was no response from United as Brentford took further encouragement before adding a deserved third in stoppage-time through substitute Jensen. His swerving shot finished centrally to make Bayindir look foolish. He was not the only one.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",
