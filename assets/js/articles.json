      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick is reportedly a huge admirer of one of his former players. (Image: Copa/Getty Images)",
      "It’s been a successful weekend for Manchester United with new interim manager Michael Carrick looking to build on the win over Manchester City. The new boss’s first game in charge couldn’t have gone much better with a 2-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "Goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu gave United a comfortable win. Eyes now turn to their next Premier League fixture, when they take on Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "As well as preparing the team for that game, Carrick may also have an eye on the current transfer window. Clubs have just a couple more weeks to do their mid-season business.",
      "United are yet to have any new faces arrive at the club, but continue to be linked with potential incomings and outgoings. With that in mind, here is a look at the latest rumours doing the rounds at Old Trafford.",
      "United are watching Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes as their search for midfielders continues, according to reports. CaughtOffside claims that the club have tracked the player since the summer with scouting reports positive.",
      "It is, however, said that cost will be a decisive factor in any move, making a January exit from Wolves difficult. United are not alone in their interest with Napoli, Atletico Madrid, Crystal Palace all considering the midfielder, while Liverpool are said to have decided against pressing ahead with a move.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "It’s suggested that a loan with an obligation to buy would be the most realistic option during the current window, with a permanent deal more likely if he moves in the summer.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly been watching Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes since the summer. (Image: Brett Patzke - WWFC/Wolves via Getty Images)",
      "United have been linked with an interest in Middlesbrough midfielder Hayden Hackney, a move which would see the player reunited with his former manager Carrick. TEAMtalk report that Carrick is a huge admirer of the player, with United keen to add to their midfield options.",
      "If they do make a move, then they are likely to come up against strong resistance from the Championship club. The team currently sit in second place in the table and won’t want to derail a promotion bid with the sale of one of their main players.",
      "It is said that Boro have placed a club record £30 million valuation on the midfielder. It is added that the club are desperate not to sell and are not expecting anyone to meet their valuation. Tottenham and Everton have also been credited with an interest.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has impressed at Napoli(Image: Giuseppe Maffia/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Napoli boss Antoino Conte has slammed Ruben Amorim for his 'arrogant' decision to cast Rasmus Hojlund aside at Manchester United. Hojlund, 22, was loaned out to Napoli in September after United signed three new forwards in the summer transfer window.",
      "The striker had spent two difficult years at Old Trafford following his £72million move from Italian side Atalanta. Hojlund managed 26 goals in 95 appearances for the Red Devils, but he's been more prolific since he returned to Serie A.",
      "Under Conte, the Denmark international has bagged nine goals in 25 games, as Napoli bid to defend the Scudetto and go far in the Champions League. Speaking before his team's 1-0 win at home to Sassuolo on Saturday, Conte was asked about Hojlund, and he took aim at Amorim, who United sacked earlier this month.",
      "\"Some young coaches nowadays are arrogant and don't want to adapt,\" the ex-Chelsea and Tottenham manager claimed. \"They see a young striker struggling and instead of training him, they blame him. They always complain and blame everyone but themselves, because everything is handed to them on a silver platter.\"",
      "Last month, Conte fired a dig at United regarding both Hojlund and Scott McTominay, who was sold to Napoli by the Red Devils in August 2024. \"Everyone used to say Rasmus didn't play in Manchester, neither did McTominay, so why?\" Conte asked. \"Ask yourselves some questions there. The staff and I had work to do, there is a reason we are here, after all.\"",
      "Napoli paid United a €6million (£5.1m) loan fee for Hojlund and if the Scudetto holders qualify for next season's Champions League, they'll be obliged to cough up €44m (£38.1m) to sign him permanently. Napoli's sporting director, Giovanni Manna, recently described the deal as a 'formality'.",
      "Napoli are expected to make Rasmus Hojlund's move permanent(Image: Matteo Ciambelli/DeFodi Images/DeFodi via Getty Images)",
      "\"There's an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League,\" Manna added. \"The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.\"",
      "Hojlund hasn't been on the scoresheet in 2026 but he'll be hoping to get off the mark when Napoli travel to his native Denmark on Tuesday. Conte's men resume their Champions League campaign against Copenhagen at Parken.",
      "The Danish giants occupy the final play-off spot with just two games of the league phase remaining. Napoli are one place above them but only via goal difference, making it a crucial match for both teams.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Toby Collyer is set to leave Manchester United on his second loan of the season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The Michael Carrick era is off to a bright start after a 2-0 win over rivals City in his first game as Manchester United interim manager. Although this is in fact Carrick's third stint at the helm of his old club, this deployment carries more significance than his previous spells as caretaker.",
      "It's also the first time Carrick will have overseen a real transfer window in charge at Old Trafford. And that means the former England international has genuine scope to make some improvements to the squad over the next fortnight or so.",
      "After a heavy summer of spending and title prospects looking thin, investment was always bound to be difficult this month. However, United can still improve the first-team squad significantly through player sales, with new business being completed this weekend.",
      "One name bound for the Old Trafford exit is Toby Collyer, though only on temporary terms as Hull City look to sign the midfielder. Collyer spent the first half of this season on loan with West Brom but has since returned to United following some injury setbacks.",
      "The 22-year-old came back to his parent club on New Year's Day, with United announcing at the time he did so to focus on recovering from his latest injury. A little more than a fortnight later, he's back on the move to a different Championship after Hull manager Sergej Jakirovic confirmed a medical is set to take place before the weekend is over.",
      "\"With Toby Collyer we are waiting but I think we have a green light from Man United and I think he will join us on Monday,\" said Jakirovic this weekend. \"This is what I know but we have agreed everything with Man United. He will have a medical this weekend. He is now ready for training.\"",
      "The midfielder made 12 appearances for West Brom during his loan spell but was largely restricted to playing off the bench. He'll hope to play a more prominent role at the MKM Stadium, with Hull currently in fifth place and gunning for Premier League promotion.",
      "It may not be long before he runs into his old team, too, with Hull set to visit West Brom on March 14. Collyer came through United's academy as a revered youth talent and has 13 senior appearances for the Red Devils to date.",
      "Another United youth product on the move this winter is Sam Mather, who has left the club after 14 years. He's completed a move to Turkish club Kayserispor after struggling to open a pathway into the first-team ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "Kayserispor announced the deal on Saturday, bringing an end to his time in United's system. It's reported United have allowed the player to leave on a free transfer and will not receive a fee for his signature.",
      "\"After 14 years my time at Man Utd has come to an end,\" he said in his farewell statement. \"I would like to thank all the staff and players who have helped me become the person and player I am today.",
      "\"I will always be grateful for my time here and wish the club all the best. On a personal note it’s time for me to move forward and I can’t wait to get started!\"",
      "Mather, 21, won the FA Youth Cup at United in 2022 and was previously farmed out to Rochdale and Tranmere on loan. The winger scored 29 goals and recorded 23 assists with United's under-18 and under-21 teams but will leave United without a senior appearance for the club.",

      "Hansi Flick has put the spotlight on Marcus Rashford's attitude(Image: Javier Borrego/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "Hansi Flick has lauded Marcus Rashford's commitment to Barcelona after want-away star Dro Fernandez shocked the club by handing in a transfer request. Fernandez, 18, has reportedly activated his own release clause worth €6million (£5.1m) in order to seal an exit this month.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are the favourites to sign him, with Manchester City, Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund also linked. The midfielder has made five appearances under Flick, who gave him his first-team debut earlier this season.",
      "But Fernandez wants to quit Barcelona, who've been left stunned by his decision. Flick was visibly unhappy when discussing the situation in his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday's clash with Real Sociedad.",
      "The German made it clear that he only wants players who truly want to be at Barca - like Rashford. Indicating that he wants to sign the forward when his season-long loan from Manchester United ends, Flick used Rashford's attitude as a shining example.",
      "\"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's [sporting director] Deco's job do things for next season,\" Flick explained. \"We have to wait.",
      "\"We have months to go. For me, of course with Marcus we have a player on the top level, but also with our situation, and what I appreciate a lot from him [is his desire to be here].",
      "\"This is what I want to say to young players from La Masia: We are Barca and we are one of the best teams in the world. We give them the opportunity to train with us, to grow, to train with the best players in the world, the support and the confidence.",
      "\"If you want to play with Barca, then it has to be 100 per cent with your whole heart. This is what I want to say to everyone: 100 per cent. These colours, you have to live for them. All the others, I don't want.\"",
      "Dro Fernandez has decided to leave Barcelona(Image: Bagu Blanco/PRESSIN)",
      "The ex-Bayern Munich manager was so agitated that he had to bite his tongue when discussing Fernandez's imminent departure. \"I said before with Dro, if it's not done I will not answer this question, but it's football,\" Flick bemoaned.",
      "\"Sometimes it's like that, that, yes, you do not agree with what they are doing, but they are 18, they are old enough to make decisions, they have people around them. Of course, when I see like ... no, no, I don't want to talk anymore, it's enough.\"",
      "Fernandez joined Barcelona as a 14-year-old in 2022, drawing comparisons to team-mate Pedri and former star Thiago Alcantara. He made his Champions League debut in October, providing an assist as Barca thrashed Olympiacos 6-1.",

      "Harry Maguire was outstanding in United's win in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford(Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "If Harry Maguire does not win another cap, he can still look proudly back at a fine international career. He was almost talismanic in England’s run to the semi-finals of World Cup 2018 and was a key figure in the progression to the final of the Euros in 2021, scoring in the quarter-final win over Ukraine.",
      "He started every match at World Cup 2022 and has made 64 England appearances, scoring seven times - not a bad ratio for a defender. But his last match in an England jersey was under caretaker boss Lee Carsley way back in early September, 2024.",
      "Injuries have not helped his cause but it is clear he is not high in Thomas Tuchel’s defensive pecking order. But while the England manager is unlikely to make decisions based on one performance, Maguire’s outstanding display in the Manchester derby should put the 32-year-old defender back on the international radar.",
      "And it could well alter United’s stance on Maguire’s future. His contract expires at the end of the season and it had been strongly suggested he would be allowed to leave on a free transfer.",
      "But Michael Carrick is a massive admirer of Maguire’s and his decision to start him against City proved to be inspiring. Maguire made the headed clearance that started the breakaway move that was finished by Bryan Mbeumo and - along with Lisandro Martinez - kept Erling Haaland so quiet that Pep Guardiola substituted the Norwegian striker.",
      "Thomas Tuchel has yet to include Harry Maguire in one of his England squads(Image: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)",
      "Carrick was full of praise for Maguire, saying: “I felt it was a game for experience and knowing what it feels like. It was a big ask for H (Maguire) and credit to him. I think we can take for granted sometimes what players do but for him to play today and come through it …",
      "“I’m not going to lie, it was a bit of a calculated gamble on how long he could play and on whether he could get through it because he’s literally trained for two or three days for probably eight or nine weeks. So that just shows you what it really means to him. I thought he was fantastic.”",
      "Manchester United manager Michael Carrick is a big fan of Harry Maguire(Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "He was indeed, complementing a flawless defensive display with a couple of trademark attacking surges. He also came close to scoring early in proceedings with a header that crashed off the crossbar.",
      "In his last squad, Tuchel named five defenders who can operate centrally. Amongst those was John Stones but the Manchester City man has only started four Premier League games this season and has not been seen since coming on as a substitute in the 5-4 win at Fulham on December 2.",
      "John Stones has started only four Premier League games for Manchester City this season(Image: (Photo by Rene Nijhuis/MB Media/Getty Images))",
      "At the moment, it would seem Marc Guehi and Ezra Konsa are probably in the prime positions to start at World Cup 2026 but there are surely back-up slots up for grabs in the central defensive area. The likes of Jarell Quansah and Dan Burn - named in Tuchel's last squad - have not had trouble-free seasons.",
      "And if Maguire stays fit, he will almost certainly be a permanent fixture in the United line-up for the rest of the season. That should give Tuchel AND the Old Trafford hierarchy a very welcome dilemma.",

      "Paul Scholes has accepted the offer to visit Lisandro Martinez's house and voice his criticism in person after a heightening in tensions between ex-stars and current Manchester United players.",
      "Martinez was one of the stand-out players as United deservedly beat Manchester City 2-0 in the derby in Michael Carrick's first game as interim manager on Saturday. The Argentina defender got the better of Erling Haaland in his duel, despite the obvious mismatch in their heights.",
      "That came after the 5ft 9in centre-back copped some stick from ex-United midfielders Scholes and Nicky Butt. Butt joked Haaland “would pick Martinez up and run with him” like a “dad after school running down the road with a little toddler”, while Scholes added “he’d score then throw him in the net”.",
      "Martinez was asked about the comments post-match and said: “Honestly, he (Scholes) can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care. Everyone can talk on the television but when you sit here face to face, no one says anything in your face.",

      "Ruben Amorim's potential successor at Old Trafford received a glowing endorsement from Ralf Rangnick(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United may count on Ralf Rangnick's glowing endorsement of Oliver Glasner should they attempt to appoint the Austrian as their new permanent boss. Following the sacking of Ruben Amorim earlier this month, the Red Devils promoted Darren Fletcher from his role as the club's U18 head coach to caretaker manager.",
      "Fletcher has since been relieved of the role with former team-mate Michael Carrick accepting the job on an interim basis until the end of the season. Several managers have been linked with the United job, with the Crystal Palace manager among the potential contenders.",
      "Glasner, 51, has enjoyed an impressive run at Selhurst Park since joining the club in February 2024, as he led the Eagles to their first-ever major trophy in the FA Cup last year. The honour meant they clinched European football while also winning the Community Shield in August by beating Liverpool on penalties.",
      "A move to Old Trafford this summer could be on the cards given Glasner confirmed his intention to depart the south London club at the end of the season, meaning United could get him for free. However, his time at Palace was said to be in danger of being cut short before even then with the club considering sacking him after his shocking comments after their 2-1 defeat to Sunderland on Saturday.",
      "While the manager's time with Palace may end on a bad note, either now or in the summer, his managerial ability was lavished upon by Rangnick, who served as United's interim boss from 2021 to 2022.",
      "\"For me, Oliver Glasner is currently one of the most exciting coaches - not only in Germany, but in all of Europe. An absolute top coach,\" the Austria national team boss told LAOLA1 in March 2023.",
      "Ralf Rangnick is a huge admirer of Oliver Glasner(Image: Getty Images)",
      "During Rangnick's reign as Red Bull Salzburg’s director of football, he was responsible for Glasner's coaching ascent when appointing him as Roger Schmidt’s assistant. Explaining his protege's rise in football, Rangnick explained: \"He developed step by step to where he is now, also because he made the right decisions.",
      "\"From his perspective, it was right to go to Ried, from Ried to Linz, from Linz to Wolfsburg. When you see what's happening with him and Markus Krosche at Eintracht Frankfurt, you can only take your hat off to him. This is a prime example of how a coach's career should develop. It couldn't have been written down better beforehand.\"",
      "For United fans who are wary that Glasner, like Amorim, prefers a back-three system, the Austrian previously compared his team to Amorim’s side and explained how such a system can be successful in the Premier League.",
      "The Crystal Palace sensationally lashed out at his club after their 2-1 defeat at Sunderland(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" he said earlier this season. \"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a good defensive structure with it. It's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are.\"",
      "A historic figure already in Palace's history, Glasner's frustrations reached breaking point after the loss at the Stadium of Light as he targeted club executives for their decisions to sell Eberechi Eze and Guehi.",
      "Speaking to BBC Sport, Glasner raged: \"I feel we are being abandoned completely. Because I can't play many players. They did everything they could and this has been going on for weeks and months now. And we have 12, 13 players from the squad available and we feel no support.",
      "Crystal Palace have lost Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi in consecutive windows(Image: The FA via Getty Images)",
      "\"The worst thing is selling our captain one day before playing a Premier League game. We are preparing, it's the first week we are training since September, and then we are selling our captain one day before a game. So I have no understanding of this.",
      "\"I have always kept my mouth [closed], but I can't because I have to defend these players, because it was the 35th game today. Yes we get under pressure here and we are unlucky. But again, you can't react, we can't help them, it makes it really tough tonight.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "After being asked who he feels \"abandoned\" him, Glasner answered: \"It's pretty clear, yeah? It's pretty clear. Again, I didn't sell anyone. If you get your heart torn out twice this season, one day before a game, it was with [Eberechi] Eze in summer, it was with Guehi now, you know?\"",

      "Lisandro Martinez got the better of Erling Haaland in Manchester United's derby win(Image: Getty Images)",
      "When Paul Scholes was previewing the Manchester derby with his old mate Nicky Butt, he raised the prospect of Lisandro Martinez having to deal with Erling Haaland. And Scholes simply puffed out his cheeks in mock exasperation, implying the contest would be a one-sided affair - and not in the Manchester United man’s favour.",
      "Butt joined in the fun, saying: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him.” Scholes laughed: “He’d score then throw him in the net.”",
      "Alas, it did not quite work out that way. And after Martinez - with the help of central defensive partner Harry Maguire - had dominated Haaland to such an extent that the Manchester City striker was substituted by Pep Guardiola, the Argentinian defender made his feelings clear on the criticism that so often comes from ex-United players.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Martinez said: “Honestly, he (Scholes) can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants.",
      "\"To my house, wherever. I don't care. Everyone can talk on the television but when you sit here face to face, no one says anything in your face.",
      "“So for me, I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez says Michael Carrick has transformed the atmosphere at Manchester United(Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "Within the United squad, there is clearly a growing feeling that negativity from former players is now excessive and, on occasions, unjustified. And before goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu had given United a memorable win, Roy Keane had again questioned the appointment of Michael Carrick and his staff.",
      "Carrick responded in the best possible way, picking a team that never looked in any trouble against City and threatened to score almost every time a counter-attack was launched. And, tellingly, Martinez explained how Carrick has already transformed the atmosphere at the training ground after 14 months of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Martinez said: “So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy. He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored the first of Manchester United's two goals in their derby win(Image: DARREN STAPLES, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"He's a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.",
      "“The team today was different. It was different. When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.”",
      "But when the euphoria inside a bouncing Old Trafford had died down a little, Martinez was at pains to remind everyone that this sort of performance should be the norm for a team of United’s standing. It should not just be a one-off.",
      "Erling Haaland was substituted late in the game after making little impression against Lisandro Martinez(Image: Getty Images)",
      "He said: “Today is the standard for this club. It's about the connection. It's about how we represent them (the fans) on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us.",
      "“I put focus on the performance, the connection with the people, the connection with the team. You see that today - and I think they don't have a shot on goal. One shot, well, just one.",

      "The former England skipper requested that a BBC crew member backstage at Match of the Day fit an earpiece in his right ear rather than his left.",
      "Gesturing to his right ear, he said: \"Can I do it in this ear? I used to close the talkback. The problem is I'm deaf in my left ear. So when it's too loud I struggle to hear what Kelly Cates [MOTD presenter] or whoever is saying.\"",
      "Rooney secured a lucrative deal with the BBC, reportedly worth £800,000 annually, to serve as a regular pundit on the show and started his own podcast after taking a break from management. However, he hasn't ruled out a return to the touchline in future.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho's recent exploits are quickly proving ex-Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim wrong(Image: Getty Images)",
      "As if Ruben Amorim's January couldn't get any worse, his ex-charges are hard at work disproving some of the things he stood for as Manchester United boss. Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho in particular have issued reminders of just how mistaken the Portuguese tactician might have been by not prioritising the two young talents more.",
      "Amorim, 40, sensationally fell out with Garnacho last year prior to the Argentina international completing a £40million move to Chelsea. And United almost came close to losing Mainoo in similar fashion after he was essentially discarded by his old boss.",
      "But the United academy graduate enjoyed a comeback to remember in Saturday's 2-0 derby triumph over Manchester City. Mainoo's first 90-minute outing of the Premier League campaign helped usher in the club's biggest result of the season so far, with him at the centre of things throughout.",
      "It was almost poetic that Michael Carrick was vindicated in such clear-cut fashion by starting the 20-year-old in his debut as interim chief. And Mainoo delivered in sweet fashion, justifying his decision as United moved back up to fifth in the table.",
      "Only several days earlier, Garnacho savoured a mesmeric display of his own during Chelsea's League Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Arsenal. The Blues couldn't win the opening salvo at home but are still in with a chance of advancing thanks to Garnacho's brace in a 37-minute cameo off the bench.",
      "That performance was the latest to remind United fans what they're missing after parting ways with the winger. However, the blow is somewhat softened given the success Patrick Dorgu has had in a more advanced wing role of late, scoring again in Saturday's derby triumph.",
      "Garnacho's case is also different to that of Mainoo in that the player kicked up a more visible stink in response to Amorim's tactics. The Spanish-born star was infamously vocal in his criticism of the former United chief when dropped for crucial fixtures towards the end of last season.",
      "He almost goaded United into selling him by wearing Marcus Rashford's Aston Villa shirt on social media. Garnacho's brother also seemingly proved problematic with his online scrutiny of Amorim and predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "Fans will be overjoyed the club appears to have escaped a similar scare with Mainoo. Fresh hope under Carrick may have just about salvaged his career at Old Trafford given the player was being linked with a January exit prior to Amorim's dismissal.",
      "There was a time in the not-too-distant past when Mainoo and Garnacho were being lauded as the future of United. But that changed all too suddenly under Amorim, who deserves a hefty chunk of the blame for one half of that duet taking their act elsewhere.",
      "United could not afford to lose a player like Mainoo, hailed as one of the greatest talents to emerge from the club's academy in his generation. And Saturday's product was proof he's far too valuable to sit on the bench as often as he did under Amorim.",
      "Taking to social media after the derby win, Mainoo uploaded a picture of himself topless as he walked down the Old Trafford tunnel, flanked by Mason Mount and an astonished Carrick with the caption reading simply: \"Believe that.\" After a period dotted with trials and tribulations, even Amorim may finally have received the message.",

      "Scott McTominay was up for criticism in the Italian media following his latest outing for Napoli(Image: Francesco Pecoraro, Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United will have been keeping a close eye on proceedings as Scott McTominay featured in his third Serie A fixture in the space of a week on Saturday. And the 29-year-old would likely admit he was some way short of his usual standards during Napoli's narrow 1-0 victory over Sassuolo.",
      "The result saw Antonio Conte's side stay third in Serie A, six points adrift of table-toppers Inter Milan despite bringing an end to a run of three consecutive draws. However, the Italian press highlighted McTominay wasn't alone as loanee Rasmus Hojlund also failed to leave his mark on proceedings.",
      "Il Messaggero awarded McTominay a modest 5.5 out of 10 for his display, during which he completed 88 per cent of his passes and 67 per cent of his tackle attempts. He also registered five clearances and one key pass, though this proved insufficient to prevent the Italian newspaper from handing out the second-lowest rating among Napoli players.",
      "\"He only showed himself at the end of the first half with a good free kick,\" the review read. \"He started the second half well, but suffered from fatigue and missed too many easy passes.\"",
      "Less than a week earlier, McTominay, who has been linked with a potential return to Old Trafford, produced a crucial brace to salvage a 2-2 draw against Inter Milan. That said, it proved somewhat fortunate given he bore significant responsibility for Inter's opening goal after surrendering possession far too cheaply in midfield.",
      "Corriere della Serra barely referenced McTominay in its match report, which told its own story about the display. The sole negative moment highlighted was an error that forced Man of the Match Juan Jesus into a crucial intervention and simple mentioned: \"McTominay, not having his game, loses a dangerous ball.\"",
      "Eurosport offered a far more generous evaluation of the Scot's display. Despite failing to register a goal or assist for the second consecutive match, he was still praised as one of Napoli's more influential figures and awarded a 6.5 rating out of 10.",
      "\"In the closing stages, he tried to capitalise on a Muric error with a low shot from outside the box that went just wide,\" it said. \"Overall, despite not scoring, he remains Napoli's key player in the crucial phase.\"",
      "McTominay has been a revelation in Serie A(Image: NurPhoto, NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Hojlund sits atop Napoli's Serie A scoring charts this campaign with six goals. Yet it speaks volumes about the side's attacking woes that he's now endured five consecutive matches without finding the net.",
      "The Denmark striker is proving popular in Naples and is broadly anticipated to secure a permanent transfer there at some stage this year. Nevertheless, the current barren spell in front of goal might just plant a seed of uncertainty among Napoli's decision-makers.",
      "Hojlund is suffering a goal drought(Image: Carlo Hermann / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Eurosport reserved its harshest assessment for Hojlund, whose own underwhelming afternoon was confirmed with a 5.5 out of 10. His finishing was labelled as \"wet,\" although he was at least partially redeemed by the observation that he demonstrated \"a lot of effort.\"",
      "Napoli's sporting director, Giovanni Manna, recently referred to Hojlund's permanent £43.6million transfer to Naples this year as \"a formality.\" However, they'll be hoping for an improvement in his performance given it's been nearly a month since he last scored.",

      "Alan Shearer gave his verdict on Dalot's red card escape(Image: Match of the Day)",
      "Alan Shearer slammed the ‘ridiculous’ failure to send Diogo Dalot off in Saturday’s Manchester derby after a ‘dangerous’ challenge on Jeremy Doku. The Portuguese defender was booked just 11 minutes in following a late challenge on the Manchester City man.",
      "Neither the referee nor VAR deemed the challenge to be worthy of a dismissal, with Dalot instead being booked. The Premier League then clarified that decision by suggesting that the contact was ‘glancing and not with excessive force’.",
      "But Shearer criticised that decision and claimed that a red card should have been the only result. Asked on Match of the Day if Dalot should have been sent off, he said: “There’s no doubt about it.",
      "“It’s as clear as a red card as you’re going to see. They came out with ‘deemed to be glancing’, that’s nonsense. That’s as straight and full on - it’s high and it’s dangerous - as you’re going to see.",
      "Mirror Man Utd - FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“He’s endangering the opponent. It’s a straight red card. That’s nonsense the glancing thing. I understand why the referee hasn’t given it but you’ve got two guys in VAR who don’t think that’s dangerous? That’s ridiculous.”",
      "Former United forward Wayne Rooney also gave his verdict and agreed that Dalot should have been dismissed. He replied: “Initially I thought it wasn’t but when you watch it back, it’s as clear as a red card as you’ve ever seen. What’s worrying is VAR haven’t seen that, that’s the big worry.”",
      "Asked if the Premier League’s explanation was satisfactory, Shearer added: “No chance. I don’t know how they’ve come up with that. It’s straight on, it’s a terrible tackle.”",
      "Anthony Taylor decided not to send Dalot off(Image: Getty Images)",
      "City boss Pep Guardiola also aired his complaints about the failure to dismiss Dalot but stopped short of suggesting that his presence was the reason his side lost the game. Speaking after the game, he said: \"You could say that, you could say that red card, different game. Many, many situations happen.",
      "\"It is easy for me to come here and say it should be a red card. It is not about that; we will not grow up if that is the argument to win or lose a game. You have to do better, and we didn't today.",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves. There are some teams that won 10v11. Maybe we wouldn't have won.\"",
      "United eventually secured a 2-0 success despite the controversy. Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu both scored in an eye-catching second-half to ensure Michael Carrick marked his return to Old Trafford in style.",

      "Kai Rooney is aiming to be the next big thing at Manchester United(Image: Anthony Devlin/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Wayne Rooney's son Kai is striving to follow in his father's footsteps at Manchester United. The 16-year-old is performing well in the academy and has already made two appearances for the U18s, scoring one goal.",
      "However, being the son of a football icon comes with its own set of challenges. Wayne, now retired, was a titan of English football, winning numerous major honours during his career and representing England in countless international tournaments.",
      "Living up to the Rooney name is no small feat for young Kai, but he's already showing promise, even if he's not yet playing on the same stage as his dad.",
      "Kai took the surprising step of banning his own dad from watching his matches due to the overwhelming attention he drew on the sidelines. This wasn't a club-imposed exile; instead, the teenager told his dad that he wouldn't be attending his games, as fans were more interested in taking selfies than watching the match.",
      "The ban was revealed by Kai's mum, Coleen, during her stint on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2024. The 39-year-old shed light on the difficulties the family has faced due to Wayne's fame, both on and off the pitch.",
      "She said: \"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out. Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "Coleen Rooney revealed her husband's ban on I'm a Celeb(Image: JMEnternational/Getty Images)",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different, you could speak to them, so he just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Despite being the son of a United legend, Kai receives no preferential treatment from the club - including when it comes to its long-standing academy regulations. The teenager signed a deal with Puma in 2022, aged just 12, to wear their footwear, but wasn't permitted to do so during U16S matches.",
      "Speaking about the club's stringent rules on The Smith Brothers: Not A Podcast, father Wayne said: \"He's obviously with Puma but when he plays for the Manchester United U16s, something which I really like is he can't wear his Puma boots.",
      "Rooney will follow the same rules as all the other academy stars(Image: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)",
      "\"All the academy have to wear the same boots. They do it because there's people from areas where they can't afford certain boots so I think it's really good. But he's played for the U18s a few times and he can then wear his Puma boots. He's doing well to be fair to him.\"",
      "Wayne is delighted that Kai receives equal treatment amongst his academy peers, believing it provides crucial grounding for the youngster before he steps into elite-level football.",
      "Although a recent setback has temporarily delayed the promising forward's breakthrough, he's now back in action and setting his sights firmly on the top.",
      "Speaking to The Talent Hunter on Instagram, Kai didn't hold back when outlining his ambitions. When asked where he sees himself in five years' time, he said: \"Playing on the biggest stage amongst the best players, winning trophies.\"",

      "Alex Scott of Bournemouth is reportedly being pursed by Manchester United(Image: 2025 Visionhaus)",
      "Pep Guardiola has already made his thoughts clear on Manchester United target Alex Scott by paying him the ultimate compliment. The Manchester City manager once described the central midfielder as “an unbelievable player.”",
      "That was after the then-19-year-old played for Bristol City against his side back in early 2023 in an FA Cup game. If that glowing endorsement from one of the greatest managers ever wasn’t enough, Jack Grealish also labelled the teenager a “top, top talent” at the time.",
      "Scott, now 22, has gone from strength to strength since then, becoming a key player at Bournemouth under Andoni Iraola. His impressive displays since his £25million move to the south coast have unsurprisingly seen him linked with several top Premier League sides.",
      "City have been amongst them, as have neighbours United. Speaking about Guardiola’s comments in 2024, the England U21s star revealed how his mother was left particularly delighted by the praise.",
      "“To hear that from who I regard as one of the best managers of all time, it’s a good feeling. It was amazing,” said Scott. “It was a great feeling and my mum enjoyed it probably even more than me!",
      "“He didn’t have to say that but to say it about an opposition player shows the respect he has and why he’s gone so far in the game. Guardiola was incredible at Barcelona with that great team with Lionel Messi.",
      "\"I grew up with Guardiola as a manager and that whole team was just incredible. Xavi and Andres Iniesta. Messi doing his magic, he had brilliant midfielders at Bayern Munich with Thiago and now he’s at Man City with Rodri who, for me, is one of the best players in the Premier League.”",
      "Yet, he could end up playing for Guardiola’s cross-city rivals, United, who have made signing a midfielder their priority for 2026. The Old Trafford club appear to be biding their time, however, with recently sacked manager Ruben Amorim suggesting there will be no new arrivals of note in January prior to his dismissal.",
      "Pep Guardiola sang the midfielder's praises three years ago(Image: Getty)",
      "Having appointed Michael Carrick as interim boss until the end of the season, United are expected to instead splash out in the summer on more than one midfield signing. Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson, Joao Gomes and Carlos Baleba are all being linked with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Scott must be doing something right if he is being considered amongst such company by United chiefs, having received his first England senior call-up by Thomas Tuchel in November 2025. Should the Red Devils successfully fend off rival clubs and secure his signature, they may well have a future Three Lions star on their hands.",

      "Michael Carrick will likely have to work with the current group of players available to him for the remainder of the season. There is merit in continuing with the same group and not risking upsetting the dressing room mid-season, but United might have missed out on a golden opportunity to sell one player.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee jumped at the chance to move to Old Trafford in 2024, and who could blame him? When the team needed an experienced goalscorer, the move did raise a few eyebrows. It soon became apparent Zirkzee was not the answer to United's goalscoring problems but, to his credit, the Dutchman continued to battle for his spot.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "After being unfairly jeered off the pitch against Newcastle little over a year ago, Zirkzee showed signs of improvement, particularly in the deeper No.10 role. However, the additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have seen him drop down the pecking order for that position.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's injury after the Tottenham draw gave him the chance to stake a claim for the striker role in the starting XI but it is clear United need an upgrade on Zirkzee. Now Ruben Amorim has gone and United are likely going to stick with a 4-2-3-1 formation for the remainder of the season, Zirkzee's opportunities are going to become even more limited.",
      "That is why it made sense for the Reds to sell Zirkzee in January, even if they were not going to sign an immediate replacement. AS Roma were keen on bringing the Dutchman in thanks to his experience in Serie A and the limited options available in the market.",
      "Instead, the Italian club have moved on to a new target and got that deal done. Aston Villa's Donyell Malen has joined them on loan with a fee of £21.6m agreed for the summer. Roma are now highly unlikely to re-enter the race for Zirkzee this window.",
      "Missing the chance to sell Zirkzee in January when there was a suitor keen on his services could come back to bite United. Another half season with the Dutchman rarely playing is only going to lower his price tag further.",

      "Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner is in the running to become the next permanent head coach of Manchester United(Image: Michael Driver/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "After winning the FA Cup last campaign and the Community Shield at the beginning of the 2025/26 season, few would have foreseen how sour things have turned for Crystal Palace in the months since. Since that victory over Liverpool, Eberechi Eze has left, Marc Guehi is on his way out and Oliver Glasner has confirmed he is leaving at the end of the season.",
      "It has been a bleak January for Palace and seeing Glasner leave for a Premier League rival would sum things up for them. If the Austrian was to have his way, that's exactly the scenario that would play out. It is understood the Palace boss is being considered by Ineos for Manchester United's permanent managerial position.",
      "Despite him playing a 3-4-2-1 system at Palace, which ultimately cost Ruben Amorim his job, Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada and the rest of the United decision-makers are not looking to hold that against him. Plus, for a club looking to find ways of saving cash, appointing an out-of-work manager makes sense.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "It is almost as if the stars are aligning for Glasner and United, but it is never that straightforward - especially when the Austrian behaves as he does in the press. After his side's 2-1 defeat to Sunderland, Glasner went on the offensive and issued a blistering post-match interview.",
      "\"We feel like we're being abandoned completely,\" Glasner said when reflecting on Guehi's impending exit to Manchester City. \"Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this.",
      "\"We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week? At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset.",
      "\"If your heart gets ripped out twice a year, with Eze one day before a game in the summer and your captain one day before a game - I've just got no understanding. I've been in football for 30 years and never experienced this, not once.\"",
      "Palace chairman Steve Parish was reportedly left seething by Glasner's outburst and his position was being considered on Sunday before ultimately the Eagles decided they wanted to stick with their head coach for the remainder of the season. If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co were watching all this unfold, they would have been seeing red flags galore.",
      "Even if Ineos feel Glasner has been hard done by at Palace, they would be concerned by the outbursts they have seen from him. When Amorim went against the board after the Leeds draw, he was gone before lunchtime the next day.",
      "Arguably, Amorim's comments were not as fiery as Glasner's, and yet they still cost him. Should United hire Glasner, they cannot rely on him to stay quiet and keep his feelings out of the media.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was in the crowd at Old Trafford on Saturday for Manchester United's 2-0 win over Manchester City(Image: )",
      "The 51-year-old has a history of making tough comments. This is not a one-off for him, just ask the fans of Wolfsburg. He clashed with their sporting director before leaving for Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Amorim gained a lot of respect from United fans for wearing his heart on his sleeve. He was honest, sometimes to a fault, about his feelings on players and the hierarchy.",
      "As such, the supporters warmed to him even when the results were not good enough. Glasner would likely have similar backing from the fans.",
      "But this is exactly what Ineos would hate and Glasner might be talking his way out of the running for the United job with each interview he attends.",
      "Ratcliffe supposedly welcomes a back-and-forth relationship with his manager - he doesn't want to be surrounded by 'yes men'. But he also expects it to be kept in-house and that's what cost Amorim.",

      "Martinez celebrates after the derby.(Image: )",
      "Lisandro Martinez said Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt can \"come to his house\" if they \"want to say something\" to him. Martinez was criticised by the former Manchester United pair in the build-up to the Manchester derby, but he delivered an exceptional performance to keep a clean sheet against Manchester City.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, Butt said that he wasn't looking forward to watching United's younger players play against Erling Haaland in the Manchester derby. Scholes intervened, adding \"Martinez against Haaland,\" before wincing. Butt responded: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?” Scholes added: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”",
      "City recorded only one shot on target at Old Trafford and Martinez delivered a superb display alongside Harry Maguire to keep Haaland, Antoine Semenyo and Jeremy Doku quiet.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Martinez spoke to reporters after the full-time whistle at Old Trafford and was asked about the comments from Butt and Scholes. \"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants,\" he said.",
      "\"To my house, wherever. I don't care. And I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you sit here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",
      "\"So, for me, I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.\"",
      "When asked whether such comments provide motivation, Martinez calmly responded: \"No, nothing. It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family. That's it.\"",
      "Martinez was superb in the derby.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick made the dream start to his interim manager spell following his appointment on Tuesday, and Martinez credited the former midfielder with reminding the players what it means to play for United.",
      "\"So different, so different,\" Martinez said of the training sessions since Carrick's return. \"Different mentality, different guy. He knows what it really means, this club.",
      "\"He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything. He's a big legend. He wants to help the club, and I think we were in a tough situation, and today was the best moment to change that.\"",
      "Martinez added: \"I think we deserve to win. We were better on the pitch and I think we gave everything today. And when you give everything and you see the result, it's an amazing feeling. I'm so happy today.\"",
      "Carrick praised Martinez and Maguire for providing a solid defensive foundation in his post-match press conference. \"I've known him for a long time and we speak a lot,\" Martinez said about Maguire. \"Today we had really good communication on the pitch - but not just only with H. The team today was different. It was different. When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.\"",
      "Martinez also believed the way the team fought helped the atmosphere. \"It's about the connection. It's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us,\" he said.",
      "\"But if sometimes our performance wasn't the best because they expect from us a good attitude, tackles, the DNA, the blood of Manchester United. And I can really understand because sometimes it's like, what are we doing here? And today is the standard for this club.",
      "\"I don't put focus on the result. I just put focus on the performance, the connection with the people, the connection with the team. You see today that, and I think they don't have a shot at the goal today. One shot, well, just one. And you can feel the mentality. You can feel something different. I'm happy with that.\"",

      "In the build-up to the Manchester derby there was of course a lot of focus on Michael Carrick and the style of play he would look to bring to Old Trafford. Having only managed Manchester United previously for three matches as an interim in 2021, looking to that period offered few clues.",
      "\"If you don't have more info of the opponent, you focus on yourself and the players,\" Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said in his pre-match press conference. \"You can have some ideas of what Middlesbrough has done or when Michael was in his part as a manager at Man United but tactics is about the players.",
      "\"The players tomorrow are different to the Middlesbrough ones.\" If Guardiola were to cast an eye over Carrick's time in the north east in search of clues, it would have been a red herring. While United set up in the same 4-2-3-1 system Carrick played at Boro, their style was entirely different.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "While the Middlesbrough team Carrick forged were looking to dominate possession, United were happy for City to have the ball, safe in the knowledge they would be able to defend when the Blues picked their moment. The Reds had just 32 per cent possession - unheard of for a Carrick team.",
      "But it was exactly what United needed to do. Bernardo Silva said it himself after the match, the Reds 'took the game to where they are good,' and doing that proved successful. But that does not mean it was expected.",
      "United are coming out of an era where adaptation from the manager was not on the agenda. Ruben Amorim was set in his ways and would have kept playing in the 3-4-2-1 system until it eventually clicked or he was fired.",
      "Under Carrick, United don't look set to be so predictable. Another example of his flexibility came with his use of Kobbie Mainoo. After his appointment on Tuesday, Carrick's comments about the midfielder were back into the spotlight.",
      "\"He's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder,\" Carrick told Rio Ferdinand on his podcast.",
      "\"He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom. He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing completely.",
      "\"I see him playing that little bit higher and creating. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",
      "Those comments seemed to point towards only one outcome. And yet, Mainoo played 90 minutes in central midfield alongside Casemiro and it worked perfectly.",
      "Having a head coach, even in the interim, willing to make slight alterations to their philosophy for the good of the team is a huge positive for the Reds. It should ensure opponents are left guessing when they come to face United.",

      "Michael Carrick's return to the dugout at United ended in victory against Manchester City and the players embraced a return to a 4-2-3-1 system, with Fernandes deployed in an attacking set-up designed to pull the visitors out of shape.",
      "It just did that and Fernandes was at the centre of most of United's best moments against Pep Guardiola's side, while Carrick also praised his defensive discipline in helping disrupt City's attempts to build through the middle of the pitch.",
      "Carrick had just three training sessions to prepare his team to face the Blues but he did speak to his captain during the week and was delighted with his display.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"I've spoken to Bruno, I've known him a long time now, and I thought he was fantastic today,\" he said. \"The way he played the position, he's so clever, and he takes up space.",
      "\"They had a big disciplined role, him and Bryan defensively as well, to protect the team from anything coming through the middle as much as possible, so it wasn't all kind of playing and positivity to that point.",
      "\"He's just got so much quality, Bruno can adapt and playing in that position he's a real threat and he made the difference.\"",
      "It was an emotional return to the dugout for Carrick, who has now beaten Guardiola, Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta while managing United, as well as drawing with Chelsea when Thomas Tuchel was in charge at Stamford Bridge.",
      "He got the call to replace Ruben Amorim last week but is still a regular at Old Trafford and admitted he always had an idea of how the team should operate, only bringing that into sharper focus when he got the job until the end of this season.",
      "\"I think it's obviously something that clicks into gear when you think it might be on my toes to do something about it,\" he said. \"I've watched a lot, we've got season tickets and my family comes, so I've been to a lot of games over recent times and you get to know the players and your own eye.",
      "\"Everyone has an opinion and your instincts, and then there was a few days to prepare, so the balance of how much information, what the lads could take on, being fair to them to not overdo it, but actually City probably ask you as many questions as anyone could possibly ask, so you've got to have the answers to that, so it was a real balance.\"",

      "Hansi Flick has praised Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford's dedication to Barcelona following the shock decision by young prospect Dro Fernandez to hand in a transfer request. The 18-year-old has reportedly triggered his own £5.1million release clause in an attempt to force through a departure this month.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are considered frontrunners for his signature, whilst Manchester City, Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund have also been mentioned as potential destinations. The midfielder has featured five times under Flick, who handed him his senior debut earlier this campaign.",
      "However, Fernandez is determined to leave Barcelona, catching the club completely off guard with his stance. Flick appeared clearly frustrated when addressing the matter during his pre-match media briefing ahead of Sunday's fixture against Real Sociedad.",
      "The German manager emphasised that he only wants players genuinely committed to representing Barca - citing Rashford as a prime example. Suggesting he wishes to secure the forward permanently when his season-long loan from United comes to an end, Flick highlighted Rashford's mentality as exemplary.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's [sporting director] Deco's job do things for next season,\" he said \"We have to wait.",
      "\"We have months to go. For me, of course with Marcus we have a player on the top level, but also with our situation, and what I appreciate a lot from him [is his desire to be here].",
      "Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has praised Marcus Rashford. (Image: Europa Press Sports, Europa Press via Getty Images)",

      "\"We give them the opportunity to train with us, to grow, to train with the best players in the world, the support and the confidence.",
      "\"If you want to play with Barca, then it has to be 100 per cent with your whole heart. This is what I want to say to everyone: 100 per cent. These colours, you have to live for them. All the others, I don't want.\"",
      "The former Bayern Munich boss was so agitated that he had to bite his tongue when discussing Fernandez's potential departure. \"I said before with Dro, if it's not done I will not answer this question, but it's football,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes it's like that, that, yes, you do not agree with what they are doing, but they are 18, they are old enough to make decisions, they have people around them. Of course, when I see like...no, no, I don't want to talk anymore, it's enough.\"",
      "Fernandez arrived at Barcelona aged 14, in 2022, with observers drawing parallels to team-mate Pedri and former star Thiago Alcantara. He made his Champions League bow in October, setting up a goal as Barca demolished Olympiacos 6-1.",

      "Michael Carrick salutes the Stretford End after Manchester United defeat Manchester City 2-0(Image: Joe Prior/Visionhaus via Getty Images)",
      "When Michael Carrick went to bed on Friday evening, he would have dreamt about the ideal start as Manchester United interim head coach. That dream became a reality on Saturday as the Reds banished the memory of a 3-0 defeat in September's reverse fixture in brilliant fashion at Old Trafford.",
      "The mood had once again been lifted at Old Trafford prior to kick off thanks mostly due to the opponents. No matter how bad the form or performances are for United, a game against Manchester City is always enough to rally the troops and so it proved with the home fans keen to make the stadium a cauldron before kick off.",
      "Once the match started, you could sense United were playing with an intensity which we have seen too rarely this season. While some may credit Carrick or the crowd for that, the truth is we know United can create an impressive tempo when they put their minds to it.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Away at Liverpool under Ruben Amorim, the Reds played with a belief which some teams can only hope for. This attitude resulted in a terrific result at Anfield and United have now picked up a tremendous three points off their nearest rivals City.",
      "But what Carrick managed to do and where Amorim failed with was to make the flanks dangerous for the full 90 minutes. Surprisingly, considering how much Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system relied upon wing-backs, there were many occasions when the Reds looked so poor when they tried to play with width under their previous boss.",
      "Amad was the standout wing-back for the Reds under Amorim, but if we analyse some of the most damning results this season, their approach on the flanks was the key issue. Take the Everton defeat as one example, how many times did United's attacks fizzle out because they were too slow, passive and predictable?",
      "The Wolves draw was more of the same from a United perspective. That is partly what put Amorim's tenure in trouble.",
      "Compare that to the City win. The difference was night and day. Diogo Dalot may have been lucky to be on the pitch in the second half following his challenge on Jeremy Doku in the first 45 minutes, but he made his presence count afterwards.",
      "His link-up play with Amad down the right was impressive as United searched for a goal and after a masterful breakaway for Bryan Mbeumo's first, it was the right side which brought about Patrick Dorgu's strike to make it 2-0, thanks to Matheus Cunha's cross.",
      "On the left, Luke Shaw and Dorgu enjoyed a good connection; with the crowd audibly 'ole-ing' at one slick move which saw Shaw flick the ball through for the Dane. This sort of wing play has been desperately lacking for the Reds this season and Amorim is likely scratching his head from home as to why this team has managed to do something he could not drill into them.",
      "However, such a monumental change down will give United fans confidence that they will be able to put a run of form together to finish in the top four this season. If they do that, Ineos may have to justify why they are not giving Carrick the job permanently this summer.",

      "Three questions, Michael: how long would you like on your contract, what would you like your salary to be, and where would you like your statue?",
      "Manchester United said they wouldn't get carried away this time, but when Old Trafford rocks as it did on Saturday, it can be hard not to. You can guarantee that Michael Carrick is a shorter price to get the job on a permanent basis now than he was when he woke up on Saturday morning.",
      "He couldn't have dreamt it would go this well. This was United's best performance of the season by a long, long way. It was probably their best performance since beating the same opponents in the 2024 FA Cup final. Carrick addressed a group of players on Wednesday morning who had looked beaten down at the end of another manager and after a dismal run of form in a forgiving run of fixtures.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "To bring about this improvement in three training sessions is an eye-opening achievement. United were clever, sharper and more intense than City. Rarely can they have dominated a derby to this extent in the Pep Guardiola era. When the Catalan went to the away end at full-time, he was greeted by empty seats. City fans had long since seen the writing on the wall.",
      "Guardiola had wrapped his hands around Carrick when the whistle went and whispered a few words in his ear. See you next season, perhaps? There's plenty more work to be done until that happens but this felt like a day when the 44-year-old put himself firmly in contention for the job.",
      "He added Guardiola to Mikel Arteta and Unai Emery in the list of managers he has bested while in the United dugout. There was a draw against Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea as well. That is already quite the CV and whatever happens, he will never forget this day.",
      "It had been more than three years since United had last been able to celebrate a derby goal at Old Trafford. That Marcus Rashford strike earned them a victory in January 2023 during a 20-game unbeaten run at home in Erik ten Hag's first season.",
      "For a while, it looked like the Dutchman had cracked the code, but it proved to be yet another false dawn. They've got used to those around here. Amorim has just overseen another wasted 14 months and how futile those dark days look now.",
      "Amorim forced United into a tactical straitjacket, his desire to match up the Premier League's worst team the final straw for a club desperate to see some enterprise and ambition on the pitch once again. Carrick delivered that. Four at the back. Fernandes freed up. Pace and invention on the wings. No wonder Sir Alex Ferguson was smiling.",
      "United played from the first minute as if they had been reinvigorated by Carrick's return. Harry Maguire headed an early corner against the bar and Gianluigi Donnarumma saved from Patrick Dorgu.",
      "There was an aggression to United's play that hinted at a desire to make an impression to a third head coach already in 2026, but that spilt over into early bookings for both full-backs. Diogo Dalot left a mark of the wrong kind when he caught Jeremy Doku high on the shin and although contact was only glancing, he was fortunate to not be put through the wringer of a VAR check at least.",
      "Luke Shaw clattered into Rodri to pick up his booking, but the spark in United's play was unsettling City. They hunted the ball in packs and looked to spring forward at speed. Mbeumo's movement pulled around the inexperienced Max Alleyne and Abdukodir Khusanov, while the wingers and Fernandes tried to break in behind.",
      "The method led to Amad and Fernandes both rounding Donnarumma to score in the first half, only for the linesman's flag to deny them. The calls were marginal, but correct; they gave United encouragement that they were on the right path.",
      "If they wanted further vindication, they got it from Guardiola's half-time subs, bringing Nico O'Reilly and Rayan Cherki on, but it did little to contain United. O'Reilly was booked for a foul on Amad within three minutes of his arrival, so he was powerless when the winger ran at him 10 minutes later. Donnarumma saved his shot and then stuck up a hand to keep out Casemiro's follow-up from close range.",
      "When the Italian goalkeeper saved again from Mbeumo a few minutes later, you started to fear United would pay for missing so many chances, but then they struck in a manner straight out of the playbook from derby successes under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "City had control with a free-kick midway in United territory, but when play was turned over, the speed and execution of the break was something to behold. Fernandes led the breakaway, and with three players in support, he picked the perfect pass to Mbeumo, who this time gave Donnarumma no chance.",
      "Ten minutes later, the game was done. City had shown little sign of mustering a response and when Dorgu was more alert than Rico Lewis to reach a Matheus Cunha cross, he sent the Stretford End into raptures. Amad hit the post late on after another thrilling break, and Mason Mount managed a third disallowed goal.",
      "After sharing an embrace with Guardiola, Carrick turned around, a beaming smile on his face, and offered a clenched fist towards his family sitting high in the stands. There was a more visceral show of emotion towards the Stretford End as he headed down the tunnel. He has made his mark.",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick embraces Bryan Mbeumo(Image: Darren Staples / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "No Manchester United players would have been confident enough to predict what changes Michael Carrick would make when he entered Carrington for his first training session on Wednesday morning. Not many members of the squad could even be confident enough to say they would definitely be picked to face Manchester City.",
      "There were a few improvements on show in Darren Fletcher's two games at the helm and perhaps the biggest improvement came from Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian has struggled to adapt to life in the Premier League since his £73m move.",
      "To his credit, Sesko has worked hard but without reward for much of the campaign until Fletcher's caretaker spell. He took his first goal since October well against Burnley and that raised his confidence as he bagged a second at Turf Moor. Despite being in defeat, Sesko also scored a good header the following game against Brighton to make it three goals in two games.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "With no other out-and-out striker options available to him and Sesko finding some form, it was expected Carrick would pick Sesko to lead the line in the derby. But he didn't. Instead, the returning Bryan Mbeumo played in the centre-forward role and Sesko was dropped to the bench.",
      "\"We’ve got a good squad of players, that’s something that we’ve got to decide on,\" Carrick told Gary Neville pre-match when asked about dropping Sesko and Matheus Cunha. \"There was always going to be players disappointed not to start.",
      "\"But finishing the game is even more important these days. They’ve got huge talent. It’s not personal at all. I’m a big fan of both boys and they’ll make a big difference for us.\" Nobody was arguing with Carrick's team selection at the full-time whistle.",
      "While Cunha came on and assisted Patrick Dorgu's goal, Sesko had to settle for his role as an unused substitute. He may not like that decision from Carrick, but it is perhaps what he needed.",
      "Michael Carrick speaks to Benjamin Sesko after Manchester United defeated Manchester City(Image: )",
      "Ever since Sesko made his United debut it has been obvious he has needed someone competing with him for that centre-forward role. Someone who could lead the line and take the pressure off him when needed. Joshua Zirkzee was never likely to do so given the Dutchman is better in the No.10 role.",
      "The Mbeumo and Sesko rotation could be a great option for the Reds. They offer a very different threat and having two players who can play the role will make it difficult for opposition teams to predict what they are set to face when they come up against United. Cunha has also led the line at times this season and has shown he can do a job there.",
      "This is perhaps not what Sesko would have hoped to happen upon Carrick's arrival. He might feel somewhat disappointed by his derby day snub but it proved to be the right choice for United.",
      "It could well be a good thing for Sesko in the long term as he looks to adapt to life in the Premier League.",

      "Carrick was emotional at full-time.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "Manchester United won 2-0 against Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon. United announced the appointment of Michael Carrick as head coach for the remainder of the season on Tuesday, and the former midfielder made the perfect start by securing a superb derby win.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo broke the deadlock in the second half and Patrick Dorgu extended the advantage. Mason Mount came close to putting the icing on the cake with another goal but the midfielder was ruled offside.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed and talking points...",
      "Carrick looked emotional",
      "\"It's Carrick, you know, you'll never believe he's not Scholes,\" belted around Old Trafford after the final whistle. Martinez embraced Kobbie Mainoo, while Mbeumo and Amad shared a few emotional words.",
      "Carrick took a moment to celebrate with his staff before making his way onto the pitch to soak it up. Pep Guardiola was isolated as he stood on his own to applaud the City away section.",
      "There was also a lap of appreciation. United have made their way around Old Trafford after each game this season, but more fans stayed behind to clap those in red shirts than ever before. Carrick looked like he had a tear in his eye as he eventually disappeared back down the tunnel.",
      "Passion from Carrick",
      "Dorgu was involved in a tangle with Abdukodir Khusanov just outside the City penalty area in the first half, but referee Anthony Taylor was not interested, so Luke Shaw took laying down the law into his own hands and made a crunching tackle in the next phase of play, which earned him a booking.",
      "Carrick began to furiously rant to the fourth official when Taylor decided not to award a foul for Khusanov's grappling, and he looked even angrier when Shaw was handed a yellow card.",
      "It's up for debate how much complaining to the fourth official can actually influence the outcome of game, but it was interesting to see another side of Carrick after a workmanlike first press conference.",
      "Ruben Amorim made headlines with his comments and eventually talked himself out of a job. Carrick did not provide any explosive copy to journalists during his press conference, however, when the players cross the white line, he comes alive and appears to be pretty fierce on the touchline.",
      "Carrick spoke about how much United means to him in the build-up to the Manchester derby, and that was evident as he celebrated both goals. Pundits have scoffed at the importance of having 'United DNA', but Carrick 'gets it' and oversaw a special victory in his first game in charge.",
      "Brilliant Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo received rapturous applause from each corner of the ground when he was replaced by Matheus Cunha with 20 minutes remaining, with fans showing appreciation for his deadlock-breaking goal.",
      "There was a feeling of inevitability when Fernandes slipped Mbeumo into the box following a swift counter-attack. The Cameroon international is deadly in those scenarios and buried his shot into the bottom corner.",
      "The extent of the applause for Mbeumo wasn't a surprise considering he'd just scored in the Manchester derby, but it was notable that almost every fan in the ground rose to their feet in a show of appreciation.",
      "The fact that Cunha was introduced for Mbeumo is also a sign of progress. United were in doldrums last season and could only dream of having such an excellent attacking option on the bench.",
      "Carrick's smart plan",
      "Travis Binnion was promoted from his position as Under-21 boss to work with Darren Fletcher during his caretaker stint, and Binnion retained his role in the backroom staff when Carrick's appointment was confirmed.",
      "Binnion was not in the dug-out alongside Carrick, Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans, though, as he watched the game from behind the press box to pass on information to the touchline.",
      "The theory is that a coach can offer a different perspective from a bird's-eye view. Binnion passed on in-game feedback down to the bench, and Woodgate was spotted wearing an earpiece to receive it. It may have played a small role in the victory.",
      "Maguire's contrast of emotions",
      "Harry Maguire was recalled to the team and came inches away from making a dream return to the side when he smacked the crossbar with a header just three minutes into the game.",
      "Maguire was two yards out and should have scored. Carrick reacted by jumping up and down on the touchline, while Maguire buried his head into his hands as he returned to his position.",
      "The reaction from the England international said it all, as a goal at the beginning of the game would have sent Old Trafford rocking. Maguire probably feared that United wouldn't create as many chances as good as the one he had just spurned, but they outclassed City in Carrick's first game, and the defender was fist-pumping at the final whistle.",
      "Leaked team? No problem",
      "The starting team was leaked before kick-off, which wouldn't have pleased Carrick ahead of his first game in charge as head coach. The same happened before the Manchester derby in December 2024 when Ruben Amorim was in charge - and the leaks were addressed following that match.",
      "The Premier League is incredibly competitive this term and matches are decided by fine margins, so Carrick would have been irritated by City being handed a small advantage ahead of kick-off.",
      "Carrick has enough on his plate after his return without needing to find out where team news leaks have come from, but he will have to investigate how the information leaked this week. Despite being informed of United's team, City were still played off the park, though.",

      "Michael Carrick had confidence Manchester United were going to deliver a performance on derby day at Old Trafford when he saw the emotional state of his squad as they lined up in the tunnel. United produced their best performance in a long time to beat Pep Guardiola's side 2-0 on a day when they also had three goals ruled out for marginal offside calls.",
      "Goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu handed Carrick a win on his return to the dugout at Old Trafford. A performance full of attacking intent was the perfect antidote to recent weeks and Carrick praised his coaching staff of Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion for getting the message across, and the players for taking it on board so quickly.",
      "\"The players left the changing room unbelievably desperate to do well,\" said Carrick. \"I was thinking, don't be too desperate where it can cloud your judgment and you make decisions that you make because you're emotionally so invested in it.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"I thought they got the balance so right and the supporters were incredible. I said yesterday this can be a magical place, and it does some funny things, and today to get that feeling is exactly what we want. Hopefully, just to start something we need to build on. We're not getting carried away massively, but you've got to enjoy the feeling certainly when you get it.\"",
      "United created an xG of 3.8 against City in what was a one-sided derby and Amad, Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount all saw goals ruled out.",
      "It was a remarkable coaching achievement on the back of three sessions at Carrington and Carrick was delighted to see the squad buy into those ideas.",
      "\"I just think the boys have shown me that they're really willing to listen and learn, as I said, [they're] almost desperate,\" he said.",
      "\"They want it so much and the willingness to take the information on and change things a little bit and be willing to adapt. We obviously put a game plan and a strategy together that tried to achieve certain things and everyone played their part in the end.",
      "\"Before the game, I spoke with the coaches, and we said the boys were in a good place. We were quite happy with the days we prepared for it. Emotionally, where the boys were, I was quite happy with that leading into the game, but then City are an unbelievable team with talent and they can rotate and change things, so there's a plan and then you've got to go plan B and C and work around it.",
      "\"So you never really know how the game is going to go, but for it to pan out like that, the boys were fantastic to the heart, I say, in so many ways. And to manage it emotionally with the information we've given them and pulling it together, yeah, it was pretty good.\"",

      "Good morning and welcome to our Manchester United transfer blog.",
      "It's been a busy week at Old Trafford with Michael Carrick appointed as their interim head coach on a deal until the end of the season and all eyes are now on the club's owners to see if they can bolster his squad before the January transfer window closes.",
      "United have not yet added to their squad this month, with Ruben Amorim's departure putting any transfer activity on the back burner.",
      "However, that hasn't stopped speculation from around the globe with United linked with a number of incoming and outgoing transfers.",
      "United are understood to be among a number of clubs that could sign Ruben Loftus-Cheek from AC Milan. According to TeamTalk, United have been 'offered' the ex-Chelsea midfielder by the Italian side.",
      "Milan are believed to be willing to sanction a loan deal with an obligation to purchase permanently in the summer. Additional clubs who are also interested reportedly include Newcastle, Sunderland, Fulham, Aston Villa, Everton and Brentford.",
      "The 29-year-old departed from the Blues in 2023 after an eight-year stint, making a permanent move to Italy following loan spells at Palace and Fulham. Throughout his career, the midfielder has scored 30 goals and provided 32 assists in 367 appearances.",
      "Marc Guehi and Oliver Glasner, who could join United in the summer, are already leaving the Eagles.",
      "Napoli boss Antonio Conte has digged at ex-Man United head coach Ruben Amorim after Rasmus Hojlund was shipped out of the club to join the Italian giants.",
      "\"Certain young arrogant head coaches these days don’t want to adapt , they see a young striker (Hojlund) struggling instead of coaching him they blame him , always moan and blame everyone but themselves because they are spoon fed.\"",
      "In case you missed it yesterday, Manchester United have decided to recall goalkeeper Elyh Harrison from his loan at Shrewsbury Town.",
      "Harrison started for the League Two outfit against Wolves in the FA Cup last Saturday, but his minutes in the league were limited after Will Brook took his place between the sticks.",
      "A club statement confirming the decision read: \"Manchester United have recalled young goalkeeper Elyh Harrison from his loan at League Two club Shrewsbury Town.",
      "\"The 19-year-old spent the first half of the season with the Shrews, managed by United Academy graduate Michael Appleton, after joining the club in July.",
      "\"He made his Football League debut against Colchester United and also gained senior minutes in the Carabao Cup, FA Cup and Vertu Trophy.\"",
      "Not sure I see any merit in this, to be honest. Dalot is 26, there is no point sending him on loan to develop and he is the first-choice right-back and a member of the leadership group.",
      "He's had a difficult season and the criticism of him from supporters has been noticeably louder this year. I'm not sure he's the long-term answer at right-back but there is no replacement ready to go either. Even if Noussair Mazraoui takes that place next week, Dalot would be needed as back-up.",
      "There is probably an argument to sign a right-back in the summer, although midfield has to be the priority. It feels inevitable that Dalot will face more competition at some point.",
      "Oliver Glasner's decision to leave Crystal Palace has led to a big move in the markets for him to become the Man United manager for the first game of the 2025/26 season. Glasner has been backed from 6/1 into 3/1 after he confirmed he will be leaving Palace at the end of the current season.",
      "William Hill's spokesperson Lee Phelps said: \"Following Oliver Glasner’s shock announcement that he will be leaving Crystal Palace at the end of the season, we make him one of the leading contenders to be the next permanent manager of Manchester United.",
      "“Glasner is now the 3/1 second-favourite to take over at Old Trafford on a permanent basis next season, only behind current interim boss Michael Carrick at 6/5.",
      "“The Austrian manager will see out the rest of the season at Selhurst Park, with his side 3/1 favourites to win the Europa Conference League and crown the most successful tenure in the club’s history.”",
      "18+ | Gamble responsibly |gambleaware.org| Odds subject to change | Odds supplied by William Hill",
      "Oliver Glasner has publicly confirmed his departure from Crystal Palace at the end of the season amid links to becoming Manchester United's new head coach.",
      "After confirming that Marc Guehi to Manchester City was in the final stages, he said: \"I already informed the club months ago that I wanted a new challenge.",
      "\"I had a meeting with Steve [Parish] in the October international break, a dinner, a very long talk and I told him I would not sign a new contract.",
      "\"We agreed at the time to keep it between us, I told the team today the same.\"",
      "Wayne Rooney has urged Michael Carrick and Manchester United to swoop in for any players they have on their radar should they become available this month, via the most-recent instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "The problem United have got at the minute is if players become available now, I think we have to go for them.",
      "Because when it comes to the summer and you're in competition again with the teams who are more successful at the minute, it becomes more difficult to sign the players they want. If the players become available now who you think, 'Yeah,' we can go for him now.",
      "And maybe you're paying over the odds to get him a little bit. I think they have to take it now.",
      "Manchester City could have signed a new player in the January transfer window ahead of the Premier League clash against Manchester United.",
      "According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, City have advanced in a deal for Marc Guehi during the last 12 hours with an important proposal presented to the England international. He has added that Palace are prepared to proceed as well which means the deal getting closer.",
      "With the registration deadline having passed, Guehi will not be able to feature for City even if he signs before their clash.",
      "While Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are set to stay, Toby Collyer looks set for a loan move out of Manchester United.",
      "According to Manchester World, Championship side Hull City are expected to complete a temporary deal for the midfielder by early next week.",
      "The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season on loan at West Brom but was recalled by United when the Janaury window opened.",
      "Manchester United look set to keep Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo at the club for the remainder of the season amid transfers links to AS Roma and Napoli, respectively.",
      "Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio has claimed that Roma remain in contact with Zirkzee's entourage and the decision is now down to Michael Carrick.",
      "As for Mainoo, transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has stated Napoli remain interested but no progress for a potential deal is being made with United not giving their approval.",
      "Manchester United are one of seven Premier League clubs offered the chance to sign Ruben Loftus-Cheek from AC Milan.",
      "TeamTalk have claimed that intermediaries exploring possible moves for Loftus-Cheek have suggested that Milan would be open to accepting a loan with buy-obligation for the former Chelsea midfielder.",
      "Their report adds that Newcastle United, Sunderland, Aston Villa, Fulham, Brentford and Everton have also been presented with this market opportunity.",
      "Harry Maguire has emerged as a transfer target for AS Roma and AC Milan.",
      "Maguire sees his United contract expire at the end of the season with it stated the club may even be open to negotiating a winter window exit.",
      "The January transfer window has already thrown up several curveballs, though Manchester United are biding their time.",
      "Prior to his dismissal, Ruben Amorim hinted there would be no incomings and following a managerial change, it seems likely the focus will be on the summer.",
      "Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson is one of several midfielders that has been linked and now his teammate Murillo is also believed to be of interest to those at Old Trafford.",
      "Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are the two other central midfielders that are firmly options with Alex Scott and Joao Gomes back in the headlines after key updates on the duo.",
      "Stay right here for the latest United transfer news and rumours!",
      "TransferFeed has reported that Manchester United have identified Kader Meite as a potential new signing for 2026 as the Reds look to strengthen their attack.",
      "The club is said to be keen on signing the 18-year-old as part of their ongoing pursuit of young talent. Meite has three goals and one assists in 15 appearances for Rennes this season.",
      "Manchester United have identified striker Kader Meite as a potential new signing for 2026 as they seek to strengthen their attacking options. The club is eager to sign him as part of their ongoing pursuit of young talent.",
      "Leicester City are interested in signing Manchester United full-back Harry Amass, it has been reported. The teenager has impressed on loan at Sheffield Wednesday this season but there is talk that he could be sent out to a higher Championship side for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "Stoke City and Millwall are among the others that have been linked with a move for Amass, 18, who made 21 appearances for Wednesday before his loan expired earlier this month, scoring once.",
      "According to the i newspaper, there is a general fear that Bruno Fernandes will look to leave Manchester United. It's added that Bayern Munich remain strong suitors for his signature.",

      "The Nigerian has less than 18 months left on his contract at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Gary Neville said Manchester United cannot consider keeping Michael Carrick as head coach beyond the end of the season.",
      "Speaking on the latest episode of the Stick to Football podcast, he said: “I hope he does really well. There cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond this season, for Michael and for the club.",
      "“If he wins every game, look, we could be sat here in the season where he’s done unbelievably well, and we’re always thinking the fans are up and they’re in the Champions League places, fifth or whatever. It could happen if there’s a good run and we could all be getting swayed with it.",
      "“I honestly feel like (you have to look at others) at the end of the season when you’ve got (Mauricio) Pochettino, (Thomas) Tuchel and (Carlo) Ancelotti.",
      "“I’ve said (Brazil boss) Ancelotti. I just feel purely because he’s 66 years of age, he’s got probably the best job in the world right now. He’s probably got one job left at club level.",
      "“If there’s one person who’s got the patience, the composure, the experience of the Premier League.”",
      "Murillo is among the players being considered by Manchester United as they seek a new central defender for next season.",

      "Hull Live is also reporting that the 22-year-old could seal his short-term move to the MKM Stadium early next week, and it's hoped he will be at Deepdale to meet his new teammates on Tuesday night when the Tigers take on promotion rivals Preston North End, though he's not expected to play a part.",
      "Jamie Carragher has had his say on Ruben Amorim after he was sacked last week after 14 months as Manchester United head coach.",
      "And while Carragher believes Amorim was sacked after an argument with director of football Jason Wilcox, he has claimed results should have been taken into consideration.",
      "He said: “It sounds like he wasn’t sacked because of the results. He was sacked because there were words – but he should have been sacked for the results.”",
      "Joshua Zirkzee continues to be linked with a move away from Manchester United - and now according to Corriere dello Sport, Roma are still keen on signing the forward.",
      "That comes despite the Serie A side having already signed Robinho Vaz and closing in on Donyell Malen.",

      "His appointment was a main talking point on the Stick to Football podcast and Keane seemed to reignite a previous feud with Carrick's wife, Lisa, when discussing the chances of success this season. When speaking about the impact of Carrick on the United squad, Keane said; \"His wife can always come in [if Carrick doesn't do well], cause she's got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She's probably doing the team talk.\"",
      "In 2014, Lisa responded to Keane's criticism of Carrick's performance and post-match interview following the 2-0 defeat to Greek side Olympiacos in the Champions League. Carrick's wife posted on Twitter, now X: \"Roy Keane what a ****, says anything to provoke a reaction.\"",
      "She then deleted the tweet and apologised for her words. \"Deleted my tweet... Emotions got the better of me,” she wrote.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and at least one member of the Glazer family visited Carrington on Thursday for the latest Manchester United executive committee meeting.",
      "The meeting was originally scheduled to take place in a different location, but it was relocated to Manchester so the club's leadership team could be on-site to support Michael Carrick following his appointment.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has lowered the asking price for French team OGC Nice, according to Bloomberg.",
      "Ineos have been seeking more than €200m for the French team, but potential buyers have been reluctant to pay that price. Now, it's claimed the price has come down",

      "Rio Ferdinand has come out in defence of Jonny Evans(Image: PA)",
      "Rio Ferdinand has defended Jonny Evans in response to Roy Keane's critique of Manchester United's decision to appoint the former defender as a first-team coach. Keane recently expressed doubts about Evans' qualifications for the role on Michael Carrick's coaching staff during a scathing tirade.",
      "\"Fletch goes and Carrick gives him the job. Great, isn't it?,\" Keane remarked on the Stick to Football podcast. \"We should all go to Barbados for a week... If you're on about getting coaching staff in, we're praising one of them and we just let the other two go - Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans.",
      "\"What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach at Man Utd's first team? He left a job four weeks ago as a loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That's a big step up, isn't it?\"",
      "Keane's outburst came after Gary Neville voiced his approval of Steve Holland's appointment as Carrick's assistant coach. \"I wish we were sitting here and you said he brought three staff in and you reeled them off and said they're all brilliant,\" Keane continued.",
      "\"You said you don't know anything about Jonny Evans coaching because he's never coached! That's my point! But he's gone into Man Utd and you're going, 'oh that's okay because we've got Stevie Holland,' A new guru!\".",
      "Manchester United - FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "In response to Keane's remarks, Ferdinand has defended Evans, asserting that the former defender deserves his chance, given his familiarity with the squad from playing alongside nearly every member - a factor that could aid Carrick in maximising the potential of players like Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"The stuff with the coaches and stuff like that, and calling out the coaches, like, Jonny Evans is a young coach. Why shouldn't he get a chance?,\" Ferdinand questioned on BBC 5 Live.",
      "\"Why shouldn't he get a chance to come into the club? He knows every single player in that club better than any coach on the planet right now, other than the ones that have been there recently, because he's played there. He knows them all. Why wouldn't you bring him on your staff? I don't understand.",
      "Jonny Evans has been appointed as Michael Carrick's first team coach(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "\"If you want to get to know what Kobbie Mainoo is like, because you want to reboot him and put him in a team, I wouldn't mind having somebody that knows him, who's been in the changing room, who knows how he works, closer to me.",
      "\"How do we get a bit more out of Bruno? Because you know him. That's the kind of conversation I'm sure that Michael Carrick's gonna want to be having.",
      "\"Sit down and tell me about every single one of these players, because you, Jonny, have lived with them and breathed with them for a couple of years now. I actually understand why someone like Steve Holland's there.",
      "\"He's experienced. Michael Carrick wants an experienced coach alongside him. He's gone for someone like him. Like, what, should he have gone for what? Who else has got experience that he should have gone for?",
      "\"I just, I don't know. It was a... I didn't agree with it, with that, and that's where it starts, and that's fine. You can have that conversation and have that opinion, but I don't know, I just thought it was probably a bit... The gun was pointing at the wrong people.\"",

      "Michael Carrick insists Manchester United hasn't lost its soul as a football club despite the spectre of more fan protests hanging over Old Trafford this weekend, and discontent growing at the ownership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family.",
      "Carrick is back in charge until the end of the season, just over four years since he stepped in for three games after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021. Although supporters are happy to see the former midfielder back, it only adds to the sense that the club is treading water and has lost direction.",
      "United have cycled through Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim as permanent managers since Carrick was last in the dugout, with just the FA Cup in 2024 to show for it, while they have no European football this season and face a battle to get back into continental competition next term.",
      "The arrival of Ineos as minority investors in December 2023 was supposed to herald a new dawn at United, but Ratcliffe has already lost the trust of supporters and key lieutenants Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are also facing scrutiny.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Protests are planned ahead of the game against Fulham on February 1, but Ratcliffe and Joel and Avram Glazer could be at the Old Trafford derby on Saturday, having been at Carrington on Thursday for meetings, and their presence at the game could spark another fan revolt. Yet Carrick insists the mystique around United still remains in place and that he has felt positivity since returning to the club earlier this week.",
      "\"I certainly don't think it's soulless, I think there's a magic around this place,\" he said. \"I feel at home straight away, coming into the building.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

That’s seven goal involvements in total, and he still has the final to play. Those numbers had Lookman as the highest-rated player on WhoScored at 8.08, with second-placed Salah on 7.73 before Nigeria beat Egypt on penalties in the third-place match.",
      "At 28 years old, Premier League clubs might be reluctant to spend big on Lookman, but the quality is clear to see. Another reservation clubs might have is how little impact he made during spells at Leicester and Fulham. If he doesn’t get another crack at the Premier League, he will forever be remembered for that awful Panenka penalty at the London Stadium.",

They were involved in all aspects and probably had the final say on all transfers. History will reveal all but I seriously doubt any of them were forced to take a player they didn’t want.

And…wait.\nThose of us with eyes and functioning respiratory systems, would clearly be able to detect that the turd does not move one iota as the match takes place around it, that it does not manage any shots on goal, that it cannot keep up with play (its static) and that the turd’s stat line at the end of every single match, is the expected “Zero” across the board.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Nuno and Frank clashed in El Sackico and the latter came off definitively worse.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 11 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are still absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in ten games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to…",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like five points away, that deficit cut down after the Hammers visited Dr. Tottenham.",
      "",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have opted ‘to sack’ head coach Thomas Frank as they are ‘accelerating plans’ to bring in a replacement.",
      "According to reports, a Tottenham Hotspur chief has ‘recommended’ Thomas Frank’s ‘dismissal’, while one ‘leading candidate’ is keen to replace him.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Tottenham Hotspur boss Thomas Frank is at ‘serious risk’ of losing his job after the 2-1 loss against West Ham United.",
      "Is losing at home to West Ham more damaging than being beaten while holding an Arsenal cup for Thomas Frank? Who might replace him at Spurs?",
      "Thomas Frank lost El Sackico to actual Nuno Espírito Santo and Arne Slot isn’t far behind in the sack race after extending Liverpool’s rank unbeaten run to 12 games.",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank is likely to have “two or three games” left to prove himself at Spurs ahead of their match against West Ham."

      "Michael Carrick, Manchester United and Arsene Wenger just made Ruben Amorim, Pep Guardiola and Nicky Butt among many others look really rather silly indeed.",
      "But there was justice at Old Trafford for one former Arsenal manager…",
      "",
      "1) It will presumably and obviously be after his post-game debrief with Sir Alex Ferguson, but Michael Carrick must be looking forward to a congratulatory phone call from the delirious Arsene Wenger on his 5-0 thrashing of Manchester City.",
      "",
      "2) The phrase that kept cropping up to explain how Manchester United landed on Carrick as their five-month safety blanket over closest contender Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was “more hands-on”.",
      "It would be foolish to draw conclusions on that assessment after Carrick’s first 90 minutes in charge, even before taking into account how Solskjaer inflicted this exact result and scoreline on Pep Guardiola at Old Trafford six years ago, down to the 11-7 shot count.",
      "These are not really the games on which Carrick ought to be judged. Ruben Amorim beat Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle this season but paid in part for mediocre displays, draws and defeats against teams in the bottom half. Those are the fixtures upon which this Champions League qualification charge must be built.",
      "But what a result and what a performance, indelibly engineered by a coach determined and talented enough to make this work. The game plan and patterns of play were clear, the tactics were exquisite, the team selection was exemplary and the substitutions were superb. Carrick does indeed appear to be at the wheel.",
      "",
      "3) The biggest yet most predictable call was the reinstatement of Kobbie Mainoo to the starting line-up for the first time this season in a game not against Grimsby.",
      "Carrick referred to the 20-year-old’s experience in games of such magnitude as part of the reason for his inclusion and Mainoo did “thrive” as the Manchester United manager predicted, excelling in a midfield two alongside the brilliant Casemiro in front of a back four.",
      "That was the template for the club’s best defensive display of the entire campaign. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox were right all along.",
      "Patrick Dorgu didn’t look particularly anxious either when scoring the nerve-settling second. The whole experience felt like a proper cleansing of the Amorim era, the latest in a long line of turned corners in this infernal Manchester United maze.",
      "",
      "4) With that said, it was funny to see something return alongside Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, Casemiro, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo to the Manchester United starting line-up: the team leaks.",
      "It did Manchester City no good, of course. But they’ll probably want to clamp down on that again soon.",
      "",
      "5) There is a flipside to that coin; Manchester City were atrocious.",
      "Three narrow offside calls and the excellence of Gianluigi Donnarumma spared them a more humiliating shot of the Old Trafford scoreboard as a makeshift defence eventually combusted, the midfield was bypassed and an imposing attack collapsed in on itself.",
      "Manchester City were the better team for 20, maybe 25 minutes either side of half time and even then were held at arm’s length by a vulnerable opponent who not only comfortably contained them, but posed a far greater and more consistent threat.",
      "A four-game winless run at the stage of the season when they generally reach their most imposing form would be damning even if they weren’t about to pluck a second of the league’s best players to make themselves the world’s biggest spenders in this January transfer window.",
      "Much like Antoine Semenyo can’t be a one-man solution to their problems going forward, Marc Guehi alone is no panacea to those defensive issues.",
      "",
      "6) There are injuries in that backline, but the Manchester United opener highlighted systemic and structural issues too.",
      "Within seconds of Rayan Cherki lofting in Manchester City’s latest imprecise, actively damaging set piece, the hosts had launched a three-on-two attack from which Mbeumo would score.",
      "It was his flick which created it after Maguire headed Cherki’s delivery back at him, isolating the Frenchman who was guarding a good 20 yards of space – and with it any prospect of the sort of quick counter Manchester United had leaned on all game.",
      "For Cherki to be deployed as that screen was amateurish and whether Manchester United’s jumble of coaches highlighted it as a potential point of interest before the game or the players sensed an impromptu opportunity to target it, that failure is on Guardiola and his staff.",
      "",
      "7) The visitors did not look much more stable in open play. Even beyond their two permissible United goals and three others that were disallowed, Manchester United had the game’s better chances.",
      "Maguire clattered the bar with a header from a corner. Casemiro should have scored from the rebound of Amad’s saved shot. Dorgu and Mbeumo tested Donnarumma from crosses, both of which were aimed at Manchester City’s right-hand side.",
      "Matheus Nunes cannot possibly be so important to this team that his absence reduces them to such a quivering wreck.",
      "The starkest sight was of Rodri drowning in midfield, passing the ball to opponents on the edge of his own area and being booked for pulling back Dorgu in the centre circle for his only foul of the entire game. Perhaps he needs a refresher course.",
      "",
      "8) It was probably a game too far for the encouraging Alleyne-Khusanov partnership, especially flanked with unfamiliar full-backs.",
      "Nico O’Reilly was booked within a couple of minutes of his half-time introduction for the former – which meant he was restricted against Matheus Cunha for the second goal – while Rico Lewis really struggled on the right and picked up a yellow himself soon after.",
      "Putting Rodri in front of that defence, with Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva as nominal runners tracking back, certainly felt like a choice. Nico Gonzalez might have usurped this current version of his midfield compatriot in terms of importance to Manchester City.",
      "",
      "9) The best part of a really quite uneventful and tiresome first half was Anthony Taylor shaking his head like an exasperated parent after watching Maguire shepherd the ball out for a goal kick before gently placing Bernardo into that dip between the pitch and the advertising hoardings.",
      "",
      "10) It is difficult to quantify but Maguire instinctively feels like the world’s best New Manager’s First Game player. The man oozes back-to-basics, keep-it-compact, fresh-start energy.",
      "He even treated the supporters to a trademark marauding run past the halfway line on the hour mark, just after Casemiro dispossessed Erling Haaland with a stunning wraparound sliding tackle. Imagine even contemplating that sentence under Amorim. It is mad what a little shot of confidence and clarity can do for a player.",
      "",
      "11) It was a particularly chastening experience for Haaland, who taken off in a triple substitution at 2-0 down with ten minutes remaining. Guardiola entrusted Divine Mukasa with closing that deficit in the second Premier League appearance of his career.",
      "Those 14 Haaland touches can be compartmentalised if they are accompanied by a goal but Manchester United stymied and stifled him exceptionally well. That absurd start to the season has now bled into one goal in seven games.",
      "That, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt might be interested to learn, is also four wins in five meetings against Haaland for Lisandro Martinez, and a second clean sheet. The speed with which he nipped ahead of the static Norwegian to intercept one pass suggested that even if Haaland could “pick Martinez up and run with him”, he’d never get close enough.",
      "",
      "12) Gary Neville calling Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes “problematic” on commentary felt a bit harsh.",
      "",
      "13) Mbeumo’s flicks were particularly potent. That combination of clever movement to pull a defender out of position, followed by a deft touch to a team-mate, wreaked havoc with Manchester City.",
      "It formed the basis of how the first offside goal and his own opener were constructed.",
      "And there is little point commending the range, weight and choice of Fernandes’ passing. For a player who bears almost the entire creative burden of the team at times, to so consistently make the right decision under pressure is ludicrous. Manchester United will not replace him easily.",
      "",
      "14) Carrick’s pre-match message to the omitted Cunha and Benjamin Sesko that “finishing the game is even more important these days” was realised in stunning fashion.",
      "Sesko never made it off the bench but Cunha’s impact was immediate and obvious. His first touch was a flying block on the edge of his own box from a Bernardo shot, then the Brazilian generated an assist out of nothing with his push to the byline and glorious delivery for Dorgu, who caught Lewis napping.",
      "As Carrick said, and as rarely seemed the case under Amorim, “we’ve got a good squad of players”. Manchester United might just have a manager capable of using it properly on a game-by-game basis.",
      "",
      "15) The contrast with Manchester City was evident. Cherki was a slight improvement on Foden in the minutes after his introduction but soon settled into the general rule of his team’s mediocrity, by which point the only attacking option Guardiola could call upon from his bench was either Mukasa or, at a push, Tijanji Reijnders.",
      "While Manchester United had a £74m unused substitute, Manchester City had basically no Plan B to an already flawed Plan A.",
      "That chequebook might not be closed even when Guehi shuffles through the door. Arsenal are firmly in their heads.",
      "",
      "16) Six offsides is the most Manchester United have had in a game since mid-February, and they scored from three of those attacks. It will be interesting to see if Carrick and his lambasted coaching team come up with something as effective against those low blocks.",
      "According to reports, Michael Carrick is ‘in the box seat’ to become Manchester United’s next permanent manager after the win against Manchester City.",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has shut down a fellow pundit’s claim about Michael Carrick following the win against Manchester City.",
      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney has heaped praise on Michael Carrick for bringing back the “United DNA” to Old Trafford in a 2-0 win over Man City on Saturday.",
      "Man Utd legend Roy Keane insists that it would “probably be no” if the Red Devils asked him to help before they appoint a new permanent manager.",
      "Man Utd are still keeping their options open over a potential midfield signing in January with Ruben Neves still a possibility, according to reports.",
      "Former Premier League striker Troy Deeney reckons Man Utd should stop “bowing” to Sir Alex Ferguson as the legendary manager “doesn’t work there”."

      "The Red Devils were brilliant against the Citizens as Carrick claimed a well-earned victory in his first game as Man Utd’s new interim manager.",
      "Carrick was given the job until the end of the season, when Man Utd are expected to announce a permanent successor to Ruben Amorim, and he aced his first test.",
      "Many former players have claimed that Man Utd are yet to play with ‘United DNA’ since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club as manager in 2013.",
      "But Rooney was impressed by Carrick reverting to that type of football in an impressive victory over Man City, in which Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu scored the goals in a result which could have been even more comfortable.",
      "Rooney told BBC Sport: “Obviously I’m absolutely delighted. I think the team spirit, the work rate, the energy, everything about that team was fantastic today. I’m absolutely buzzing for the players, for the fans – the fans have been starved of that over the last few years. I know it’s only one performance but I think everyone could see how exciting that team can be.",
      "READ: Guehi to Liverpool, Neves to Man Utd among six forced hijack transfers to save this January window",
      "“You hear everyone, especially us as ex-players, talk about the United DNA and that has just shown what it is. Work rate off the ball, wingers getting back filling in and helping out the full-backs.",
      "“And the goals; crosses in the box and desire to get on the end of it. The first goal, counter-attack, sitting in and breaking fast – that is the United DNA and that was what we’ve been missing. And hopefully this continues.",
      "“The work rate, the shape, the organisation of Manchester United today, the desire to get back and double up and help your teammates out and tackle and run without the ball, as quickly backwards and you do forwards. I think that was really evident today.”",
      "Goalscorer Mbeumo thought the atmosphere at Old Trafford was “unbelievable” against Man City and claims Man Utd “used the energy of the fans” to win.",
      "When asked if it was the most special day he’s had at Man Utd so far, Mbeumo replied: “I think it’s one of them. Scoring in front of this stand is unbelievable. Derby is even more and like Licha [Martinez] said, we used the energy of the fans today. This place was unbelievable today.”",

      "On there being a lot of change while at AFCON, Mbeumo added: “When I came back a lot of things changed. I think we have a very good group. We always stick together. We have a fantastic unit, so it is unbelievable.",
      "“It is a bit of everything. It is not easy because we only had three days. Because we are all together, we all want to win the same way with the same aim.”",
      "Mbeumo’s team-mate Lisandro Martinez, added: “Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Being here with the fans, with the team we really know how we suffer during the season. But the only way is putting the face here and showing here who we are. Today is the best moment to do it. Not just the players on the pitch, the staff, everyone was part of that.",

      "We are now past the halfway point of this window, and there has only been one transfer worth more than £50m, which is not good enough if you ask us.",
      "The race to sign Antoine Semenyo was fun while it lasted, while the Conor Gallagher saga has been one of the very few deals to provide some thrill this month.",
      "In Gallagher’s case, this is because Tottenham Hotspur pulled one off one of those incredibly fun transfer hijacks, having been forced into a £34m deal to beat Aston Villa to the signing. More of this goodness is required if this transfer window is to be saved.",
      "So, here are six more players who could follow Gallagher in being at the heart of a forced hijack transfer in the coming weeks, with Liverpool and Manchester United potentially dragged from their slumber to do some business…",
      "",
      "Teenager Diomande falls into the bracket of a player who is far more likely to secure a move in the summer than this month, with Fabrizio Romano confirming that Spurs have already tried and failed to sign the winger in this window.",
      "The teenager has eight goal involvements in 15 Bundesliga games this term, so it is no wonder that he is being earmarked by current club RB Leipzig and several Premier League sides for a big-money transfer in the near future.",
      "Leipzig are rightly opting to hold out until the summer, by which point there will be more competition and likely a higher valuation for Diomande. But plans could always be brought forward if a club makes a silly and irrefusable offer, which Spurs have already proven with Gallagher that they are willing to do.",
      "Diomande will likely have clubs higher up the food chain looking at him in the summer, with Liverpool among the sides who should bring their plans forward if their hands were forced with a sizable Spurs bid.",
      "Were this to happen, Diomande would obviously choose to join Liverpool over Spurs to bolster their winger department, which suddenly looks rather weak following the exit of Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah’s decline.",

      "One certainty in the transfer market this year is that Man Utd will revamp their midfield as part of a long-overdue overhaul.",
      "United’s focus on signing attackers and Bruno Fernandes’ failed transfer meant INEOS had to push back their midfield plans, with £100m-rated Carlos Baleba among those put on the back burner.",
      "All reports indicate Baleba remains an option for Man Utd, along with Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson, but they need more than only one of these Premier League standouts if they are to fix their midfield.",
      "Man Utd’s next marquee signing is likely to be one of those three, but this future deal could be supported by one or two affordable signings to cover the potential losses of Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and/or Fernandes.",
      "Gomes, who is reportedly valued at £43m, is certainly a more realistic target for Man Utd this month than those aforementioned midfielders, but Atletico Madrid are currently working on a deal as Wolves seemingly look to cut their losses before his value drops further following relegation.",
      "The 24-year-old will become much cheaper in the summer, but Atletico’s interest could complicate matters and force Man Utd to show their transfer muscle to win a transfer race, which they continue to do despite their woes on the pitch.",
      "",
      "Guehi’s proposed move to Man City is likely too far along for Liverpool to pull off a hijack at this stage, but this is what we want to happen, not what we think will happen…",
      "Liverpool’s collapsed deal for Guehi in the summer was all their doing as they wasted far too much time before striking a £35m agreement with Crystal Palace, who had no choice but to pull the plug on deadline day over their inability to source a suitable replacement.",
      "By all accounts, Guehi had one foot in Liverpool in the summer and they have remained a frontrunner for his services in recent months, but their failed deal in the summer opened the door for them to miss out completely if another club decided to make a serious move for his services, and this is what is currently playing out…",
      "Injuries to Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol gave Man City the impetus to step up their interest in Guehi and they have been rewarded for their proactiveness.",
      "The arrivals of Guehi and Semenyo provide a significant shot in the arm for Man City’s title challenge, while Liverpool have been punished for standing still, as they will miss out on their top centre-back target unless there is a rather dramatic hijack at the eleventh-hour…",

      "The former Wolves standout is among the considerable examples of players to head to the Saudi Pro League when he still had plenty to offer at the top level in Europe, and this remains the case as he is still only 28.",
      "Neves’ situation makes him a no-brainer signing for most Premier League clubs, including interested sides Man Utd and Newcastle United, and it feels increasingly likely that he will end up back in England at some point this year.",
      "A free transfer would be most beneficial to Neves personally, but a deal could always be brought forward if a club is the first out of the traps in this window.",

      "It is clear that the Hammers are doomed with or without Paqueta in the relegation fight, but it is a bad look for their owners to admit defeat by selling the Brazilian international, who remains one of their better players despite his attitude issues, before a defining run-in.",
      "Still, the player often wins in this scenario and West Ham will likely swerve the headache of keeping him if their valuation is matched, with this offer most likely to come from a Premier League club.",
      "Paqueta has his heart set on a move to Flamengo, but he may have to make adjustments if he’s to leave West Ham this month and a switch to Aston Villa, after Fabrizio Romano cost them in the summer, could still be an answer.",

      "We were all very wrong about Brentford this season and this is largely thanks to Thiago filling the void left by Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, scoring 16 goals in 21 games as the second-best striker in the Premier League this term.",
      "Unfortunately for Brentford, Thiago’s goalscoring exploits mean the London side will be expecting to lose their prolific striker this year.",
      "The most tempting offers for his services are likely to come in the summer, but Spurs could spoil Aston Villa’s plans with another hijack if each club goes for Thiago this month.",
      "Spurs have been toothless in attack in most matches this season, while Villa need to strengthen after offloading Donyell Malen to AS Roma. Therefore, a swoop for Thiago is not completely out of the question and Brentford could benefit from their respective desperation when negotiating a price.",
      "Again, the north London side would be the victors of this two-way battle because they are in the Champions League and the fact that players often prefer to live in London rather than Birmingham.",

      "",
      "As first impressions go, Andrews’ was a shocker. In his first game as a head coach, Brentford were 3-0 down at half-time on the opening weekend of the season after Forest ran all over them, prompting much smugness amongst those of us who pinned Andrews’ side as relegation fodder.",
      "There’s a chance we may have been wrong.",
      "",
      "Few could hold defeat in his opening game against Edwards, so poor were the team he took over. Second-half goals from Daniel Munoz and Yeremy Pino took Palace fourth and left Wolves bottom and winless in 12. It took eight more games for Edwards to taste victory when Wolves met the only side as f***ed as they are.",
      "",
      "No new returning manager bounce for Everton – not immediately – with Moyes seeing his side sunk by Ollie Watkins five days after he replaced Sean Dyche. After one win in 12, sat in 16th place, it was a sobering illustration of the task at hand.",
      "But Moyes then turned Everton around, winning four of their next five and avoiding defeat in their next nine.",
      "",
      "“I am not happy we have not won the game but happy overall. In terms of attitude, desire and commitment it was better than I expected,” said Arteta after his first match as a head coach in any capacity, when he could not give away shares of trust in his process.",
      "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised after Dan Gosling’s opener to give Arteta a point against Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth. That sentence makes no sense in big 2026. Thierry Henry was not impressed.",
      "",
      "On humble beginnings this Fulham revolution has been built. The Cottagers had been relegated but managed to improve on their managerial situation, with Scott Parker leaving by mutual consent en route to Bournemouth as Silva took up his first post since leaving Everton about 18 months before.",
      "It was an undoubted coup, just not one made immediately obvious by a draw with Neil Warnock’s Middlesbrough. Harry Wilson scored a delightful goal from outside the area because obviously.",
      "",
      "Farke’s first Leeds side on the opening day of the Championship season in 2023/24 featured only three players who played in the last Premier League game in May.",

      "",
      "After a summer of bleating about how harshly Gary O’Neil had been treated by nasty Bournemouth, the time had come for the Cherries to show their working out. A draw with West Ham was respectable enough without coming close to confounding the critics.",

      "It’s not going well.",
      "",
      "Taking charge of the Europa League winners, Frank’s first official game in charge was the UEFA Super Cup final against Champions League winners PSG.

      "But, Spurs. Nine minutes later, they had been pegged back before they fluffed a penalty shoot-out.",

After months of forewarning that Our League would not simply bend to his will and Guardiola would be found out against the sort of proper competition neither La Liga nor the Bundesliga could provide, this was a thoroughly underwhelming start.",
      "The hosts needed an 87th-minute Paddy McNair own goal after an early Sergio Aguero penalty to prevail against a Sunderland side which would be relegated come what May, with the unceremonious axing of Joe Hart from the starting line-up a major point of early contention.",
      "",
      "Le Bris was appointed in the summer of 2024 and whatever scepticism there may have been of the Frenchman on Wearside soon dissipated when an away win at Cardiff, thanks to goals from Luke O’Nien and Jack Clarke, formed the first of four successive wins to kick off the Championship season.",

      "",
      "A high-scoring draw in which Newcastle led but needed two equalisers to salvage a point despite having more than twice as many shots, leaving them bottom of the Premier League in late November, confirmed for many the suspicion that this would be a rehash of his exciting but defensively-flawed Bournemouth reign.",
      "Joelinton scored in a neat indicator of his prosperous future under Howe, who was actually confined to a hotel room with the ‘rona and so happily handed over the reins to a bashful and reluctant Jason Tindall. If Newcastle’s manager would prefer we can instead assess his first game in the dugout: a 2-0 loss to Arsenal the following week.",
      "",
      "Ipswich provided a first taste of English football for Slot, who would have known that while anything but a win against their promoted hosts would have been a disaster, no standard of victory could possibly have dispelled those festering post-Klopp concerns.",

      "“I am so happy… it was a special day today,” said the new Villa boss after taking charge for the first time, when they made United look very much second-best. Villa fans almost universally welcomed Emery’s appointment after a year of Steven Gerrard and the players buzzed off it too, racing into a two-goal lead inside 11 minutes.

      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of Saturday's game, which United went on to win 2-0, Scholes and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt made fun of Martinez's 5ft 7in size.",
      "Butt joked Man City striker Erling Haaland, who stands at 6ft 4in, \"would pick Martinez up and run with him\" like a \"dad after school running down the road with a little toddler\" before Scholes laughed and said that \"he'd score then throw him in the net\".",
      "After shutting out Haaland as United kept a clean sheet against their rivals, Martinez was asked about Scholes' comments and said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",
      "\"I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you see [them] here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",

      "Scholes, having seen the interview from Martinez, posted on Instagram on Sunday: \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you. Tea, no sugar please…@lisandromartinezzz.\"",
      "Martinez said things at United were \"so different\" in the build-up to the win against City, with Michael Carrick taking charge of the team until the end of the season, following Darren Fletcher's brief interim spell in the hotseat after Ruben Amorim's exit.",
      "Asked if much had changed since Carrick took over on Wednesday, Martinez said: \"So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy.",
      "\"He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything.",
      "\"He's a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.\"",
      "Martinez said \"the team today was different\", pointedly adding: \"When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.\"",
      "The 28-year-old highlighted the new head coach's quiet confidence and the relentless backing from supporters.",
      "\"I feel amazing,\" Martinez said. \"I think we deserve to win this game.",
      "\"We were better on the pitch and I think we gave everything today. And when you give everything and you see the result, it's an amazing feeling and I'm so happy today.",
      "\"It's about the connection [with the fans], it's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us.",
      "\"But if sometimes our performance wasn't the best because they expect from us good attitude, tackles, the DNA, the blood of Manchester United.",
      "\"And I can really understand because sometimes it's like 'what are we doing here?' And today, that is the standard for this club.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",
      "\"Let's judge it over the next few months. The key for him is trying to get momentum in the team. He is an English coach, the English media will be pushing for him. He has done well today, but let's see how he does.",
      "\"They've won one game! The last manager won one game. He's only been there three days.",
      "\"Darren Fletcher changed the formation, but there were players missing. Michael Carrick has come in to the dream scenario. Everyone is available, City at home, they've been a little bit off it, he could have had a man sent off.",
      "\"Timing and a bit of luck, they have made the most of it. Take nothing away from him - but everyone just calm down.\"",

      "It wasn't the last occasion, though, as Mason Mount came close to making it a derby day demolition when he thought he had added a third off the bench only for that to be struck off too.",
      "United's record number of offsides this season summed up a front-foot display that began when Harry Maguire's third-minute header crashed off the bar. Amad also saw a chance hit the goal frame late on with no side hitting the woodwork more than United in the Premier League this season.",

      "Mbeumo down the middle, the player with the most runs in behind this season in the league per 90 down the middle proved a masterstroke. Fernandes, the league's chief creator, back in an advanced No 10 role was equally fitting as he made his ninth goal of the season.",

Spurs are leaking goals, losing control of games they should dominate and looking short on belief when momentum turns against them.",
      "There was a time when Tottenham pulled the trigger quickly in moments like this. Nuno Espirito Santo found that out the hard way. The irony will not be lost on Spurs supporters that the man now sitting in the West Ham dugout - having just beaten them - was dismissed with a 53 per cent win rate, more than double what Frank has delivered across the last 18 games.",

      "Pep Guardiola pulled him off once it was clear the game was over, soon after Patrick Dorgu crashed in United's second. The striker finished with 14 touches, three successful passes and not a single shot on target. City were lost without his goal threat.",
      "The fact Haaland was brought off for an 18-year-old midfielder, Divine Mukasa, with 15 minutes of prior Premier League experience shows how sparse the current attacking options are for Guardiola. Omar Marmoush's return from AFCON can't come soon enough.",

      "The only world in which a title twist is imaginable is one in which Haaland is fit and firing on all cylinders. He looks in need of a rest and thankfully for City they have a rare off week before a home game against Wolves.",

      "Mikel Arteta has talked up the importance of rotation as Arsenal compete in four different competitions. They are on a gruelling run of four consecutive away games. But it still seemed strange that his most influential attacker was named on the bench against Nottingham Forest.",
      "There seemed no obvious need for it given Bukayo Saka had started only two of Arsenal's last four fixtures. Especially given the size of the opportunity presented by Manchester City's slip-up. What followed at the City Ground put the decision under even greater scrutiny.",
      "Arsenal laboured until Arteta's triple change early in the second half, after which Saka, on for Noni Madueke, looked by far the most likely player to make the breakthrough. He very nearly did, denied by Matz Sels at full-stretch when his header was bound for the corner.",
      "The draw is far from disastrous. Arsenal have added to their lead at the top of the table. But Arsenal supporters are entitled to wonder whether the outcome would have been different had Saka started the game rather than come into it late.Nick Wright",
      "Full-backs at Liverpool are going to be judged harshly. The shadow of those before you is long. But Milos Kerkez has stopped looking like a player learning his surroundings and started performing like one shaping them. Liverpool didn't get the result they wanted against Burnley but there were more positive signs that Kerkez is starting to look like the player they signed from Bournemouth.",
      "His game is built on intensity, but what has impressed most over recent weeks is control.",
      "After being likened to a youth player earlier this season by Gary Neville, there is a calmness to his positioning now, a better understanding of when to go and when to stay. Early-season exuberance has been refined into efficiency. He provided a real thrust down the left against Burnley and more assurance in his decision-making. No player created more chances (6) than him as he continually penetrated with conviction down the left flank.",
      "He looks stronger, sharper, and more attuned to the demands Slot wants. It bodes well for the future.Lewis Jones",
      "Chelsea won a game in which the spotlight once again shone firmly on Robert Sanchez - but this time, he stood up to it.",
      "The Chelsea goalkeeper has spent much of the last few seasons under constant scrutiny, with questions raised about his decision-making and reliability. On another afternoon, that pressure could easily have told. Brentford created enough chances to punish Chelsea, particularly in transition, and Sanchez was tested early and often.",
      "This was not a flawless Chelsea performance, but two things stood out.",
      "First, Sanchez’s response to pressure. The Spaniard produced several crucial saves, most notably racing off his line to deny Kevin Schade when the Brentford forward was clean through, moments that could easily have shifted the momentum of the game. For a player whose confidence has been questioned, those interventions mattered.",
      "Secondly, Chelsea’s growing ability to manage moments of danger. Even when Brentford threatened to force their way back into the contest, Chelsea remained composed enough to see the game out, with Sanchez providing a calm presence behind a defence that has not always looked settled.",
      "There will still be debate around Chelsea’s long-term solution in goal, but on this occasion, Robert Sanchez delivered when it mattered, and Chelsea took full advantage at the other end.",
      "Sometimes survival is just as important as style.Sam Cohen",
      "All is not well at Crystal Palace. The signs have perhaps been there for some times, certainly in terms of performances and results, but the last 36 hours have blown the roof off.",
      "First, there were the revelations that both Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi were heading for the exit. Rumours had circulated for some time on both and were perhaps not a surprise, but the manner in which the Austrian manager delivered them was.",
      "Usually a calm character, Friday's news conference and Glasner's bombshells pointed towards a shift at the club - one that just nine months ago, were basking in FA Cup glory.",
      "And after a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, in which Glasner says he was unable to bring on any substitutes to help the team, the manager took aim at the club's hierarchy over the timing of Guehi's departure.",
      "It's a direct challenge to the chairman - back me or sack me. So far, by Glasner's calculations, Parish hasn't done the former and managers who have challenged the club this season have often found themselves ousted not long after.",
      "On the pitch, it's now ten games and over a month without a win for Crystal Palace in all competitions. They are missing the likes of Ismaila Sarr and Daniel Munoz, although they should return soon.",
      "That will give the Eagles a much needed boost, but will likely do little to repair the relationship between manager and chairman. How that plays out for the remainder of the season will be an intriguing prospect.Charlotte Marsh",
      "The Stadium of Light has always been one of football's great grounds, and this season, Sunderland have made it their fortress.",
      "The Black Cats remain unbeaten there in the Premier League this season, which might come as somewhat of a surprise considering they lost their last three regular season games at the ground last term.",
      "Perhaps what is most impressive is the ability to come from behind to take points. They did so again against Crystal Palace on Saturday, and never looked harangued when going behind.",
      "Rege Le Bris praised the maturity and confidence of his team, and they certainly showed it. Especially in the second half, they remained patient before finally getting their deserved winner.",
      "Along with Leeds, the two promoted sides are harnessing the magic of their home support to help keep them in the league. In fact, Sunderland are just three points from the top four - a European push is more likely to happen than a relegation battle.",
      "It's been a sensational return to the Premier League for Sunderland and it will take some performance to end their unbeaten home league run.Charlotte Marsh",
      "It was one of those points that felt like considerably more than a point.",
      "Scott Parker's masterplan to take something from Anfield didn't involve conceding 32 shots, or Dominic Szoboszlai crashing a penalty off the bar, but it did without doubt revolve around the notion of staying in the fight.",
      "Burnley didn't flinch when Liverpool knocked on the door in the opening half hour. They didn't flinch when Florian Wirtz forced it open, either.",
      "Despite their lead it was Liverpool playing with urgency after the break. Without a second it was inevitable that Burnley would break out of their low block, if momentarily, and push for an equaliser.",
      "That part of the plan was executed to perfection. Ibrahima Konate nearly turned his ball into his own net moments before Marcus Edwards brought Burnley level.",
      "\"You never say die\" said Kyle Walker of his side's showing on Saturday. On a day when Leeds and West Ham won, Burnley's rope-a-dope point at Anfield could yet be pivotal in the battle to stay alive in the Premier League.Michael Morrow",
      "The screams of delight from Elland Road after Lukas Nmecha's last-gasp winner were so loud that you probably could have heard them from Barnsley.",
      "That's been the story at home for Leeds recently. They're now unbeaten across their last five Premier League home matches - gaining points from Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, and now an in-form Fulham side - and that run doesn't look like ending any time soon.",
      "Farke's revamped side have embodied a powerful, gritty style of play that the home fans are finding it easy to get behind.",
      "Their win today was earmarked by two 10-minute periods in which the powerful Leeds attack terrorised the frail Fulham defence. Leeds' two best chances - Calvert-Lewin's inexplicable miss from six yards out, and Brendan Aaronson's scuffed half-volley one-on-one with Bernd Leno - came when the home crowd was spurring them on the most, and should've resulted in goals.",
      "Just when the game looked gone, and Fulham's defence grew in confidence, the Elland Road roar got Leeds back in the game, just in time to rattle Fulham into three mistimed tackles, in turn creating the winning opportunity.",
      "\"To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means. The home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition,\" said opposition manager Marco Silva before the game. \"It is never easy to play there.\"",
      "And so it proved, as it has for almost every opposition side of late.",
      "With Farke's side continuing to grind out results with the help of their home crowd, it's hard to see any team remaining unfazed with a trip to Elland Road on the calendar.Noah Langford",
      "Fulham's recent unbeaten run has been so impressive that recent clamour for reinforcements seemed to have taken a back seat.",
      "Today's loss at Leeds is a harsh reality check for Marco Silva and his men, and demonstrates what Fulham fans know all too well - that the club will stagnate without new signings imminently.",
      "New injuries to Sasa Lukic and Emile Smith Rowe may take the headlines, but they are the least of Fulham's problems. The whites had just seven touches in the Leeds United box, their fewest in a Premier League game since December 2024.",
      "With Rodrigo Muniz out until February and Raul Jimenez having a poor game, Silva's only option up top from the bench was Jonah Kusi-Asare, the 18-year old Bayern loanee who is yet to score a professional goal outside the German fourth division.",
      "There are two weeks left in the January window - despite being heavily linked with attacking reinforcements, Fulham are yet to make a signing.",
      "\"Everything we try and do this January, we are relying on it. We are completely aligned,\" Silva said at a recent press conference.",
      "\"For me, it's tougher than the summer. If you sign players, they have to make an impact. Not just short term, for the long term.\"",
      "Should they fail to bring new faces, Fulham will be left not just short of players to make a push for Europe, but also possibly short of a manager to match their ambition come the end of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Nottingham Forest had one of the best defences in the Premier League last season but clean sheets have been hard to come by this term. Saturday's stalemate with Arsenal was just their fifth of the campaign - all of them have come under Sean Dyche.",
      "Holding the Premier League leaders felt very much like a Nuno Espirito Santo display from last season and there was a reason for it.",
      "This was the first game since August when Forest could start Matz Sels, Ola Aina, Murillo, Nikola Milenkovic and Neco Williams in a match. That was the back five that gave opposition attacks so little joy last term and it was the same for Arsenal on Saturday.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo made 15 clearances between them. Williams won seven duels when he was up against Noni Madueke and Bukayo Saka. Out of the back four, Aina won most possessions in the defensive and middle thirds.",
      "But in front of them was the star of the show in Elliot Anderson, winning 12 out of his 15 duels. Only William Saliba made more ball recoveries than the England international, who won the battle with Declan Rice in midfield.",
      "Forest may have been dragged closer to the drop zone by West Ham winning but if they keep defending like this, they will be fine in terms of survival.Sam Blitz",

      "Saturday 17 January 2026 18:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",
      "With only three days of preparation, United's new head coach successfully brought back 4-4-2 and delivered a statement performance that reminded Neville of the club he used to play for.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville added.",
      "\"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"I'm sorry, you can play that way in modern football, you've just watched 90 minutes of it, 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "Neville added: \"It's not a time to say that Manchester United will sustain this and carry up the league, this has got to be a bridge towards potentially getting a European place, top five would be amazing.",
      "\"But this is not the return of Manchester United, it's the return of at least something that looks like the club. It's been a pale imitation this last many years really. It's been awful. Some of the performances here, you have to see a good one to remind you about how bad it has been.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener came from a devastating counter-attack and wonderful combination play with captain Bruno Fernandes, no longer restricted to playing as a holding midfielder.",
      "\"I got quite emotional when that goal went in, because I thought, 'that's what I have been asking for, it's what everyone in this ground's been asking for'.",
      "\"Those players have set themselves a standard today, I have to say, they've set themselves a standard in attitude, in aggression, in positivity when they're playing with intent and playing through the lines, everything. You cannot drop below that.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes was Eric \"Cantona-esque\" back playing in the No 10 role after Ruben Amorim had so stubbornly stuck with him as a deep midfielder.",
      "\"That's where he's got to play, be near to goal, be where you can hurt them, because he's a great player. We don't want to see him back in a midfield two in front of a back three.",
      "\"Is that where we want to see him? No, it's definitely not right. I just saw so many things that reminded me of what this club plays like, what their DNA is, what they should be.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always said Manchester United's system is such, you have a forward and then you have a No 10, it can be [Dwight] Yorke, it can be Cantona, it can be [Wayne] Rooney, it can be [Carlos] Tevez, it can be [Dimitar] Berbatov. Those players that just drop in off a striker, Scholes did it for a number of years.",
      "\"We've always had that most talented player close to our striker and feeding them, and that's what made me a little bit emotional on that goal.\"",
      "Before the game, Neville said Carrick's spell in charge should be limited to the rest of the season as he called on INEOS to bring in an experienced head coach.",

      "I've had the pleasure of spending a bit of time with Michael Carrick in the last few months at two different charity events, the last being his own foundation's boot collection at Macclesfield FC recently.",
      "As I spoke to him off camera, I was left in awe.",
      "We were in a room with former Rochdale player Luke Matheson, who scored against Manchester United at the age of 16 in the Carabao Cup in 2019.",
      "Carrick, who was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's backroom staff at the time, remembered every moment of the game while talking to Matheson - whether it was details of the match or Rochdale's coaching staff and where they are now.",
      "One observation I have through my limited interactions with Carrick over these last few months is that he absolutely understands the significance of not just Manchester United, but how important football is as a tool to impact the community in various positive ways.",
      "As he repeatedly said in his first interview with the club, 'I am one of them,' he said when referring to the fan base at Old Trafford.",
      "You may ask, why is this important?",
      "Carrick takes over a club that seems to be at an all-time low. Not just in terms of results and missed opportunities this season, but in terms of morale and confidence - whether that is the players or the Old Trafford attendees.",
      "Being at Old Trafford after the 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton, it was not about the performance or even about the result - it was more about what the loss meant in the grand context of where Manchester United are at.",
      "Call it a climax of sustained mismanagement or a rude-awakening of years of decline, facts are facts: this United team have reached record-low numbers - whether it is the first time they've been knocked out of both cups in the first round since 1982 or having their lowest games in a season in over 110 years.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford was telling as well.",
      "A crowd who have remained as patient as possible, who have repeatedly been praised for that same trait, are losing faith with the team that is in front of them.",
      "It was telling after 14 months of Ruben Amorim (mostly) defending his players to the media and trying to protect them from the noise, Darren Fletcher had a different message to send after their FA Cup exit.",
      "In his last news conference as interim, Fletcher repeated that the responsibility has to be on the players in the squad to step up and change the fortunes at the club. He even sounded emotional towards the end. A man who has seen the highest of the highs at the club gave the impression he was left more than unimpressed by what he had seen.",
      "And that makes you wonder what Carrick's new backroom staff, which includes the likes of Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, will find as they take training for the first time this week.",
      "Will it be a team still reeling from Amorim's sacking, which happened just a couple of weeks ago?",
      "Amorim made it clear he had to essentially babysit the players at Carrington and they were not capable of carrying on through training sessions without him. I am not sure that was truly the case but it is easy to forget some, if not much of this squad, has now had five different voices coach and lead them since the start of last season.",
      "The team need consistency, time and more importantly - someone who can lead them.",
      "Whether we will see a repeat of the sad period that former caretaker Ralf Rangnick led or a resurgence which Carrick's competition for the role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, led during his interim stint... well, that is what will make United an intriguing story for the rest of the season.",
      "The good news for Carrick and United fans alike is he'll have much needed fire-power back in his squad for when they take on Manchester City this weekend, with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo having returned from AFCON.",
      "As they have shown in recent years, once again this season, this team have seemingly performed better against 'bigger' opposition this season and have notched impressive wins against Liverpool and Newcastle United for example.",
      "And who knows, maybe City will be the right type of opposition at the right time for this team.",
      "They have shown in draws against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month just how much they struggle to break down teams, especially when they sit in a low-to-mid block and that is the last thing you would expect to see from a City team who feel like the entertainers of the league at this present time.",
      "We know United entertained two former players in Carrick and Solskjaer in this process, but it is important to point out the hierarchy - including director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada - would argue they were not looking to capitalise on nostalgia.",
      "Instead they wanted an appointment who understood the club and could immediately hit the ground running, while also working in the current and relatively new leadership structure implemented at the club.",
      "Carrick certainly does have the above. He spent 12 years at the club as a player while also working under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer during his last stint at the club as a coach.",
      "A balanced and determined individual who has grown from his last time at Old Trafford, it will be especially intriguing to see how Carrick develops the playing style he implemented at Middlesbrough. His 4-2-3-1 out of possession would morph into something more similar to a 3-2-5 when his side attacked, but his team perhaps lacked the firepower and flair required to maximise that type of system.",
      "Whether this United are capable of showing the fight and passion to rescue their season remains to be seen, but Carrick's calm and collected approach feels the right type of character required at a time this team could not be lower on confidence and form.",
      "But it almost feels pointless looking too closely at his stint at Middlesbrough. He would himself admit how much he learned from his first permanent managerial position in football and has wisely stayed out of other positions to digest the two and a half years he had at his previous club.",
      "Solskjaer felt like the right person to manage the club when he rejoined at the end of 2019. He gave United the lift they needed after the end of the Jose Mourinho era.",
      "Although he was sacked in November 2021 after a turbulent run of performances and results, he had an incredibly moving exit interview that was published by the club where he was practically in tears saying goodbye.",
      "There were undeniable highs from Solskjaer's reign and perhaps if history had been tweaked - the Europa League final springs to mind - maybe we would frame his managerial pedigree in a different way with a European trophy to his name.",
      "But do sequels often work, even if it is a temporary one?",
      "Solskjaer's return would have been a popular one. There is no doubting his connection and relationship to the club and its supporters but there would have been fair questions targeted at the hierarchy.",
      "Since INEOS' investment, they have attempted to modernise the club as much as they have felt is possible.",
      "A revamped and improved training ground; a more data-led approach for recruitment and analysis; a drive to become best in class in several departments.",
      "Going back to an appointment who worked under the previous regime led by Ed Woodward does not quite feel connected to the previous points mentioned.",
      "Unfortunately for the Norwegian, we cannot forget history. We have to remember how Solskjaer's reign ended in a chaotic, sad fashion.",
      "His final five matches at the club included a crushing 5-0 defeat at home to Liverpool, an incredibly one-sided 2-0 loss to Manchester City and a 4-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road.",
      "Context is required too. Perhaps what pulls at United fans' heartstrings is that, after finishing second in his second full season in charge, there is an argument the carpet was pulled under him rather than letting him develop his system and style of play.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when United should have reinforced in midfield and a youthful long-term striker, the club re-signed a 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo and added Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Ronaldo compromised the counter-attacking style of football Solskjaer had tried to implement, while Sancho never found a home in the team.",
      "So maybe Solskjaer does deserve a reprieve for how his managerial era at the club ended, but perhaps he needs to rebuild his career elsewhere before a return to Old Trafford in the future.",

      "Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville implores club's hierarchy to move for Carlo Ancelotti, Thomas Tuchel or Mauricio Pochettino this summer as long-term successor to Ruben Amorim",
      "Thursday 15 January 2026 13:16, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Michael Carrick must not be Manchester United manager at the start of next season, and has offered his three-man shortlist he would like installed instead.",
      "Carrick succeeded Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford on Tuesday and has been tasked with leading the club - where he won five Premier League titles as a player - to European qualification before the season ends.",
      "Neville wished his former team‑mate well but warned any new‑manager bounce under Carrick, however transformative, should not be viewed as a long‑term solution.",
      "\"I hope Michael does really well,\" former United captain Neville told the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"We could be sat here at the end of the season with the fans up, with the team fifth in the table and back in the Champions League spots, and we could all be getting swayed with it.",
      "\"But there cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond the end of this season, for the sake of Michael and the club, even if he wins every single game.\"",
      "Neville accepted the decision to sack Amorim and hand Carrick the reins until the end of the season was ultimately the right one, but could not hide his disappointment at the sense of déjà vu it left.",
      "\"When Amorim was sacked and you started hearing the names Michael, Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer], Ruud [van Nistelrooy], it felt a bit sad, like 'we're here again',\" he said.",
      "\"We've been there before with Ole, with Giggsy [Ryan Giggs] when David Moyes was sacked. We've seen this movie before.",
      "\"I don't think there was any other option for the club right now. Most United fans will agree with the decision to get to the end of the season because of the managers who are becoming available.",
      "\"But if they weren't to get the manager in the summer, there will be massive pressure. They must be thinking they're going to get one of the big ones, otherwise they wouldn't have appointed a bridge now.\"",
      "Carrick's return to Old Trafford marks his second spell as interim manager and the 12th managerial change of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.",
      "Neville outlined the essential attributes United's next permanent manager must have - and explained why Carlo Ancelotti, Thomas Tuchel and Mauricio Pochettino best fit that bill.",
      "\"Manchester United have tried everything when it comes to appointing a manager, absolutely everything,\" Neville said. \"They just have to try to remove risks now.",
      "\"Who can handle the media? Who can sort the dressing room out? Who can handle the owners? Who plays a style of football that fans will at least enjoy watching? Who has Champions League experience? Who has big‑game experience?",
      "\"The three that stand out are Tuchel, Ancelotti and Pochettino. They could all be available after the World Cup. Eddie Howe - who has won a trophy, finished in the top four, and managed a big club in Newcastle - is another.",
      "\"To make United an attractive club for players, Tuchel and Ancelotti bring a seriousness to matters. If you appoint a younger manager, United will miss out on players.",
      "\"United are going to miss out on a lot of players anyway, but someone like Ancelotti would encourage players to come. They need that right now, because I'm not sure players are queuing up to join unless there is someone to believe in.\"",
