      "Rio Ferdinand thought he was going to DIE after being rushed to hospital with a nasty virus. The Manchester United icon shared a selfie from a hospital bed last week, confirming he would miss Arsenal's Champions League trip to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Ferdinand received plenty of well-wishes from fans and the 46-year-old has now revealed what was wrong with him, confirming he was blighted by a nasty virus that even led to him thinking he would never recover.",
      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, he said: \"I had a mad virus. I thought lights were out at some point, I thought it was gonna happen. I thought I was minutes away from lights out, seriously. I was in my house, I was in my bed like this [pained expression] and I couldn't even open my eyes.",
      "\"Then, the headache I had… I don't get migraines or nothing else so I don't know what they're like. I thought my head was in a vice and my eyes were going to pop out.",
      "\"Then, I was being sick, projectile vomiting in the toilet, I got back to bed and I was having vertigo. I was holding onto the sheets, I didn't know where I was. It was crazy.\"",
      "He added: \"I had to go to hospital and the doctor even said to me, \"Do you want an ambulance\"? So that's when I knew. He went, 'We're going to get your brain scanned'. I thought it was a virus or a flu or something so when he mentioned brain scan and the ambulance, the panic was nuts.",
      "\"I went to hospital and I was in there for a few days. I couldn't even enjoy the hospital food. The soup and the ice cream normally does wonders.\"",
      "Ferdinand now appears to be back to top form having returned to his self-named podcast. He also looks likely to return to punditry duty sooner rather than later, with his former side Manchester United set to take on Premier League rivals Tottenham in the Europa League later this month.",
      "Even during his off-screen time, Ferdinand still offered his take on the weekend's Premier League action. He publicly slammed Liverpool fans for their boos targeted at Trent Alexander-Arnold during Sunday's draw with Arsenal.",
      "He wrote: \"I can’t believe @LFC fans booing one of their own. I understand that some of you guys are not happy with his decision etc BUT to boo @TrentAA after he has won the lot with you is baffling! Didn’t cost you a penny.\""

      "Manchester United’s season hinges on their Europa League final showdown with Tottenham Hotspur. But the Red Devils will not go all out in their celebrations should they win the competition, having already binned the idea of a parade.",
      "The Red Devils will take on their Premier League rivals in Bilbao on Wednesday, May 21. And despite a potential third trophy in as many seasons being on offer, the real prize for United is a golden ticket into the Champions League and the potential riches that come with it.",
      "But even if United manage to see off Spurs and secure the Europa League title, it appears that their celebrations will be more of a lowkey affair. According to The Times, there will be no open-top bus parade through the streets of Manchester, with a barbecue instead planned at United’s Carrington training facility should they be victorious.",
      "Plans for post-final celebrations have to be put in place by clubs in advance and United’s scheduling has proven difficult to organise a city-wide parade. United take on Aston Villa at Old Trafford in their final league game of the season just days after the final.",
      "They will then jet off to Asia for a post-season tour with a game in Kuala Lumpur scheduled for May 28, before another clash two days later. Players are then expected to report for international duty straight away, meaning the chance of a parade is remote.",
      "Instead, a lowkey affair will be held at Carrington for players, staff and families to celebrate. Spurs, however, are expected to hold a parade should they clinch the Europa League trophy.",
      "United have not hosted a parade since 2013 and Sir Alex Ferguson’s last Premier League title success. Since then, they have won the Europa League, the League Cup and two FA Cups. And while victory in Bilbao would provide some welcome respite towards the end of a calamitous campaign, United boss Ruben Amorim insists a trophy will not salvage the season.",
      "“Everybody knows it’s really important for our season [but] we know nothing is going to save our season,” he said. “This can be huge, winning a trophy, getting in the Champions League to play European [elite level] games next year: [it] could change a lot of things in our club in the summer. [But] it’s not the most important thing.",
      "Who will win the Europa League? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "“Of course people are going to look in a different way for this season, especially at the coach. But it’s something more in the core of our club [that requires addressing].",
      "“We need to change a lot of things and need to be consistent. Europa League will not change our problems – it’s going to give us Champions League next year, more money to spend, but the problems are still there.",
      "“We have to change the minds of our fans with consistency, good decisions, good recruitment, good academy. This is what we need to change to take our club back to the top. This [winning the Europa League] is more of a shortcut to go to the European Cup games. Nothing more. The problems we need to solve in a different way with more time and we’re really clear on that.”"

      "Both men were named on the bench on Sunday as United were beaten 2-0 at home by West Ham, but ultimately didn't get any minutes. Fredricson could yet feature in the Europa League final having been added to United's B list whilst the squad deal with injuries to four of their centre-half options.",
      "Obi though is ineligible to figure in the final against Tottenham next week after United did not register the Denmark U21 international for their revised squad in February.",
      "Amorim has previously been hugely complimentary of Fredricson and said last month: \"He's really composed, he's really humble, every training he has with the first-team, he is really focused on every detail of training. He's really good on the ball, and it's a good opportunity for him.\"",
      "Obi meanwhile has been looking to take advantage of the issues United have in the final third. Several of the main forwards are struggling for form and the teenager has been given opportunities off the bench, but the Red Devils boss has urged him to keep his feet on the ground.",
      "\"He’s just told me to be humble and keep working hard every day,” Obi said on Amorim's advice. “And hopefully, I get more opportunities soon. My Dad and my Mum always told me to be a good person and listen to my coaches because they want me to get better, so it’s good.\"",
      "He added: \"I’ve learnt to be smart and to think quicker by training with the first team because the game is quicker compared to Academy football. It helps me a lot, training with them every day.”"

      "UEFA have confirmed that Felix Zwayer will referee the Europa League final between Tottenham and Manchester United. The two English clubs will clash at the San Memes in Bilbao on Wednesday, May 21, and the German has been selected to be the man in the middle.",
      "Zwayer, 43, recently took charge of Arsenal's Champions League semi-final second leg away to Paris Saint-Germain. Fans may also remember him from refereeing the Euro 2024 semi-final between England and the Netherlands last July.",
      "Despite his vast experience and pedigree, the Bundesliga official is renowned for being involved in a match-fixing scandal. In 2005, he accepted a £250 bribe from fellow referee Robert Hoyzer. Zwayer was slapped with a six-month ban while Hoyzer received a two-year five-month prison sentence and was given a lifetime ban from any role in football.",
      "The Berlin-born ref's chequered past hasn't stopped him from becoming one of the most highly regarded officials in European football, though. Zwayer has taken charge of over 685 top-level matches, one of those being a controversial Bundesliga clash between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in 2021.",
      "After Zwayer awarded a penalty to Bayern following a handball by Mats Hummels, then-Dortmund star Jude Bellingham brought up Zwayer's past. \"You give a referee, that has match fixed before, the biggest game in Germany. What do you expect?\" Bellingham said to Viaplay in an explosive post-match interview.",
      "\"You can look at a lot of the decisions in the game. For me, it wasn't [a penalty]. He (Hummels) is not even looking at the ball and he's fighting to get it and it hits him.\"",
      "Bellingham was fined £34,000 for his comments by the German FA and Zwayer demanded a personal apology. \"I would prefer to clarify this in a personal conversation with Jude Bellingham and have offered such a personal conversation to Borussia Dortmund,\" he told Bild.",
      "Who'll win the Europa League final - Tottenham or Man Utd? Give us your score predictions in the comments section.",
      "\"For me, it's not about punishment, but about the realisation that he went too far. I would accept a sincere apology. The statement deliberately creates the false impression that I did not referee the match to the best of my ability.",
      "\"It is personal, disparaging and disrespectful. Even if you put yourself in the subjective perspective, which is marked by emotion, his statement is far from professional or factual.\""

      "Danny Murphy has criticised Ruben Amorim for his consistent negative attitude towards Manchester United. The ex-Liverpool midfielder believes the current United boss should be thinking with a \"bit more positivity\" and looking ahead to their Europa League final, instead of dwelling on poor results.",
      "Results matches haven't exactly been the best way to exude forward-thinking at Old Trafford, with United's last Premier League win coming way back in March, with a 3-0 victory over now-relegated Leicester City.",
      "Europe aside, the Red Devils are in dreadful form in recent history, just two places above the relegation zone and with the club about to land their lowest ever Premier League finish.",
      "However, Murphy believes that Amorim could have a better attitude when talking about his team, especially considering their exploits outside of the league.",
      "Speaking on Match of the Day, the ex-England international said: \"I'm not a big fan of a manager continually and consistently talking negatively about how bad things are and how bad it is, how we're the worst team, worst United team in the Premier League etc.",
      "\"I'd like to hear a bit more solution-based answers and a bit more positivity and moving forward and thinking forward.\"",
      "These comments from Murphy come after Amorim admitted he may have to step aside at Old Trafford if form doesn't improve by next season. Post-match, the 40-year-old said: \"Everybody here has to think seriously about a lot of things",
      "\"Everybody is thinking about the [Europa League] final. The final is not the issue. We have bigger things to think about. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team. We need to change that.",
      "\"It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this. If we start like this, if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different people.\"",
      "Co-host Mark Chapman then directed the attention to United's latest statistics, as he said: \"When you look at that, it's a bit difficult to be positive isn't it?\"",
      "Prior to Erik ten Hag's dismissal from Old Trafford, he had only suffered two home defeats all season. These were 3-0 losses to current champions Liverpool and fellow Europa League finalists Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Meanwhile, under Amorim, United have faced home defeats against Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle United, Brighton and Hove Albion, Crystal Palace, Wolves and most recently, West Ham United.",
      "Despite this, Murphy was adamant that the Portuguese boss has not faced a lot of criticism during his time, and believes his attitude must change soon.",
      "He said: \"Well, I'm not talking unrealistically, but well, just, you know, they have got a final to look forward to. They could be Champions League [next season], he's got a, hopefully, got a summer of a lot of activity in the window to bring in some of his own players and start moulding his own team if you like.",
      "\"They've only had one signing since he's been there, so he's not faced a lot of criticism, I don't think, considering how bad they've been.",
      "\"So yeah, I've always felt that the leader of the clubs I was at and the managers there, if they're putting on a nice, positive front and trying to be forthright and looking forward, then it'll help the players, rather than constant negativity.\"",
      "Next up for Amorim's team is a visit to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea in the penultimate game of the Premier League season, before an all-important clash with Spurs in a European final."

That one of those two sides will be in the Champions League next season is at odds with a competition supposedly showcasing the best sides in Europe, with Amorim unsure if playing in it would benefit United.",

      "Amorim's forthright nature has been refreshing, but his admission United may be better off without the Champions League and he may not be the man to lead them long-term, was ill-advised. His comments will certainly have not gone down well with the club's hierarchy, in particular co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",

      "He said: “It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons.”",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon chief added: “I feel how a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed. It’s hard to accept. We need to be more aggressive, and we need to feel that it is the end of the world when we are not winning a game. Especially when we are not winning.",
      "“So it's a big problem that we have here at the club. It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to address that. It's a big problem because it's mentally. We are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United. We don't have that fear anymore and that is the most dangerous thing that a big club can have.”"

      "Former Manchester United starlet Daniel Nardiello was one of the first casualties of the Glazer family's takeover, being released by the club before earning just £90-a-week at Blackpool.",
      "This Monday marks 20 years since Malcolm Glazer launched his formal bid to take over the Red Devils. He acquired John Magnier and J.P. McManus' 28.7 per cent stake, boosting his own share to around 57 per cent. By the end of that month, he had a whopping 76 per cent ownership of the club.",
      "And by June, the American tycoon had secured 98 per cent of shares and control of United, causing outrage among fans for having funded his purchase with loans secured against the club's assets.",
      "Since then, the Glazers have been at the helm and faced repeated backlash for the decaying of the club's infrastructure as well as the team's decline on the pitch. In February 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was given complete control of football operations by the family after buying a minority stake in the club.",
      "One of the first moves made by the Glazers in June 2005 was to let go of a group of players. The released players included Coventry-born forward Nardiello, Northern Irish goalkeeper Roy Carroll, Spanish shot-stopper Ricardo, Republic of Ireland defender Paul Tierney and Gambian striker Arthur Gomez.",
      "Nardiello, who came through the academy ranks at Wolves, joined United in 1999 and quickly rose through the Under-17 and Under-19 teams to make his debut in 2000/2001 in the League Cup against Arsenal.",
      "The following season saw him mainly playing in the reserves, where he netted 12 goals before being loaned out to Swansea City for a month in October 2003.",
      "The Welsh international spent the latter half of the 2003/04 season on loan at Barnsley, scoring seven goals in 16 matches. He returned to Oakwell for the 2004/05 season on loan, adding another seven goals to his tally in 30 games.",
      "Deemed surplus to requirements by Sir Alex Ferguson and the new club hierarchy, he was released on June 30, 2005, ahead of the 2005/06 season, without playing a minute of Premier League football and having made just four appearances in all competitions.",
      "After his release, Nardiello signed a two-year contract with Barnsley in July 2005, scoring two crucial goals in their League One play-off matches that season. After two years, he rejected a new contract offer to sign for Championship rivals Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer, before rejoining Barnsley on loan in January 2008.",
      "He returned to QPR at the end of the 2007/08 season, after which he inked a two-year deal with another Championship side, Blackpool. His full debut for the Seasiders only came in January 2009 following an injury-plagued stint at the club.",
      "And it was there that he agreed to a contract clause, which meant he, along with the other Blackpool players, was only paid £90-a-week during the summer break. When asked about his bizarre wages on the Undr The Cosh podcast, Nardiello explained: \"I went to Blackpool, I was on decent wages but every summer for six weeks I was being paid £90 a week.",
      "\"It was just really weird. There were lads there playing in the Championship on £600-a-week and they had to save their pennies for the summer. It was like what the hell is going on. It was such a poorly run club.\"",
      "When quizzed on what the benefit of that was for the club, the 42-year-old replied: \"They just saved on everything that club. It wasn't a Championship-run club.",
      "\"You had to take your kit home every day and wash your kits, there was no heating in the training ground and the food they served was like slop, when players were turning up in Porsches and lovely cars on Championship wages.\"",
      "He continued: \"It was such a strange club to be a part of,\" before being asked if he knew about the bizarre rule before signing. Nardiello replied: \"I knew about the £90 quid before I signed because they told me.",
      "\"I think everyone did [struggle with it]. Because you go from whatever you're used to getting on a monthly basis and then one month you're getting next to nothing and you've still got your mortgage to pay and your bills to pay.\"",
      "During his two-year spell at Blackpool, he was loaned out to Hartlepool United, Bury and Oldham before making a permanent move to Exeter City in 2010. Nardiello only played nine games for Blackpool, scoring one goal.",
      "He later had stints at Rotherham United, Bury, Plymouth Argyle and Bangor City before retiring in October 2017, after being let go by the Welsh Premier League team."

      "Manchester United matchgoers unfurled a foreboding banner bearing the faces of Robson, Cantona and Keane that read ‘Standards’ a few seasons ago. They may start to reassess their own.",
      "One of United’s worst ever teams is still applauded. They routinely embark on half-laps of honour in defeat, certain they will not be barracked. It is a far cry from three years ago and chants of ‘You’re not fit to wear the shirt’ and ‘F**k off Pogba’ during an actual win against Norwich City. The away-dayers re-aired the former at Brighton and Brentford that year.",
      "Wolves and West Ham United have done the double over United in successive months at Old Trafford and there was barely a murmur of discontent in the stands. Apathy is rife.",
      "One is not advocating booing or abuse. A new benchmark was set at Selhurst Park last season. That 4-0 drubbing was the seasonal nadir yet the support from the away end at full-time was remarkably, well, supportive. A friend in the Arthur Wait Stand described it as “poignant”.",
      "United supporters will not turn as long as there is glory on the horizon. That Europa League trophy they can see is not a mirage.",
      "Woe betide the players if they return from Bilbao without some extra hand luggage. The only thing more humiliating than finishing 17th and losing a final to Tottenham is relegation.",
      "The atmosphere on the final day against Aston Villa at Old Trafford will either be optimistic or antagonistic. There was more chanting against the Glazers and those now-permanent banners in front of the directors’ box were brandished again on Sunday.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has not been at the stadium since those choreographed protests against his callous treatment of loyal paying supporters began against Wolves on Easter Sunday. A startled security official strode to the front of the directors’ box during the impromptu protest in the first half against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Antipathy towards the owners and the hierarchy is simmering and confirmation of a worst domestic season in 51 years might halt the happy-clappy reactions. United have lost nine times at Old Trafford - as many as when the team was relegated in 1930-31. A tenth against Villa would be unprecedented in a single season.",
      "The supporters' silence spoke volumes on Sunday. There were no boos at half-time or full-time. That is commendable loyalty on a weekend that thousands of histrionic Scousers booed Trent Alexander-Arnold for having the temerity to walk alone.",
      "“It is hard to say something about our fans and everybody,” Ruben Amorim admitted. “There is no explanation, no matter the context. And I‘m talking here, I’m the biggest responsible for that. We need to change a lot of things during the summer.”",
      "Amorim has never been angrier at a post-match press conference. He could be seen gnawing at his knuckles seven minutes after West Ham went 1-0 up.",
      "Those of us present in the press room sensed he would cut loose. It was after a non-televised Sunday afternoon home defeat to Brighton in January that Amorim billed his United as “maybe the worst team in the history of the club”.",
      "The recent four-goal defeats to Newcastle United and Brentford could be dismissed; league fixtures sandwiched between European ties. West Ham was not.",
      "West Ham had not won a match since February 28. They were, at kick-off, the worst team in the top flight bar the three sinking ships plunging into the Championship. Their once placid manager had been so tempestuous in recent press conferences he appeared to be bordering on the brink.",
      "And still Graham Potter was able to motivate West Ham to win at Old Trafford. Amorim was incapable of motivating United’s players to win a first Premier League fixture in seven.",
      "He effectively acknowledged some players pick and choose when to perform. “It’s hard to explain that and that feeling,” he admitted.",
      "“For me, the biggest concern is that feeling it’s okay, we cannot change our position so much so it’s okay. That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it’s the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.”",
      "A colleague singled out Manuel Ugarte. Amorim was reluctant to throw players under the bus. If he was of that persuasion, he would still be in the press room.",
      "Ugarte can cope in the Europa League but barely copes in the Premier League. Rasmus Hojlund curates captions on Instagram more carefully than he strikes the ball. Luke Shaw cannot complete 90 minutes. Kobbie Mainoo does not know whether he is coming or going. Altay Bayindir wears the number one but is the third-best goalie.",
      "The majority of United’s league losses have been greeted with a shrug of the shoulders. Confirmation of a first bottom-half finish in 35 years against Brentford was not back-page news. Amorim ensured he was the splash on Monday’s editions.",
      "'I'LL HAVE TO GO', warns The Sun. The Mirror went with 'AMBARRASSED'. It was 'SHAMEFUL' on the Express. The Times opted for, 'Amorim: I'll quit if we don't fix this'. He won't quit. He will be sacked.",
      "United’s team against West Ham was stronger than expected. Harry Amass was the sole raw pick. Some starters were signed for £58million, £50m, £60m, £67m, £37m and £72m. United fired blanks for a 14th game this season.",
      "Records continue to tumble with any home United reverse: West Ham won their first league game at Old Trafford since May 2007. Six clubs have done the domestic double over United this season. They have not lost this many league games since they were last relegated.",
      "That is how bad this team is and the players still put their hands together and confidently approached the north-east quadrant at full-time. Old Trafford was half-empty at best and actions speak louder than words.",
      "Amorim pondered whether not winning the Europa League would be a blessing in disguise. United's FA Cup final victory proved to be detrimental in the long run as impressionable and fickle fans forced the decision-makers into a ridiculous U-turn on Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim suggested at his first Carrington press conference back in November that it would be fair to judge him after two years. Make that one year. United’s league position is borderline unforgivable. If they are in an identical position this time next year then there will be a different manager in the dugout.",
      "This has been the worst of the Premier League seasons since its inception in 1992, devoid of a title race and jeopardy at the foot of the table. United have won ten out of 36 games and half of them were against the relegated trio. Fulham (twice), Brentford, Everton and Manchester City ought to feel rueful.",
      "Lose in Bilbao and United should not expect to encounter the open arms of forgiving fans in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong on their post-season tour, either. Harry Maguire was booed in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin during pre-season. Ashley Young copped similar flak in Singapore in 2019.",
      "The memory of United fans serenading Anthony Martial after the final home game of last season was a minor but watershed moment. Martial had put his feet up for five months, failed to support Hojlund and ran down his contract yet got a hero's send-off.",
      "Conveniently, Martial returned to team training for the FA Cup final. Ten Hag coldly omitted him from the squad and Martial could not even be bothered to travel to Wembley.",
      "Those were standards."

      "Now or never was the message when Manchester United came knocking on Ruben Amorim's door last October.",
      "After making the decision to sack Erik ten Hag less than 24 hours after a 2-1 defeat to West Ham United at the London Stadium, United earmarked Amorim as their top target to replace the Dutchman at Old Trafford.",
      "United moved swiftly to get a deal in place, paying €10million (£8.3m) to trigger his Sporting Lisbon release clause.",
      "Amorim had put Sporting back on the map, winning two Primeira Liga titles in three seasons after the club previously gone 19 years without being top dog in Portugal. Sporting's style of play was also attractive to United, with club bosses hopeful he would be able to revolutionise the Reds' fortunes with a new-look style.",
      "However, Amorim was hesitant about making the move there and then, informing United that he wanted to wait until the summer to become United's next permanent head coach. He had already informed Sporting of his plan to leave the club at the end of the season.",
      "United, though, were not willing to take no for an answer and Amorim had to make a life-changing decision there and then.",
      "\"The season started, we started very well, and then Manchester United came, they pay above the compensation clause and the president defends the club's interests,\" Amorim explained back in November.",
      "\"I never discussed anything with the president. For three days I said I wanted to stay until the end of the season, but then I was told it was not possible.",
      "\"It was now or never, or Manchester would go for another option. So, I had three days to make my mind up, to make a decision that changes radically my life.\"",
      "On reflection, it is easy to understand why Amorim wanted to take charge at United ahead of the start of a new season, getting the opportunity to oversee a full pre-season and start afresh. Instead, he has overseen 14 defeats in his first 39 games in charge.",
      "He said in February: \"When you start a season it's completely different [how] you feel things, have pre-season and time to change things you feel are necessary in a team and a squad, that is clear.",
      "\"That was the choice so I don't want to talk about that. I had my reasons to ask for it and I have the most important reasons to accept the job. I knew it would be tough and a risk but it's Manchester United and you can't say no.\"",
      "Of course, the fact Amorim has led United to the Europa League final cannot be ignored, and nor should it. He deserves credit for leading the club to their first European final since 2021.",
      "However, if they are on the losing side against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao next week, it will count for nothing. Their Premier League campaign has been nothing short of embarrassing, with the defeat to West Ham leaving them 16th in the table with two games to go.",
      "Defeats to Chelsea and Aston Villa either side of the final would see United end their Premier League campaign having lost half of their 38 matches. For a club of United's size, there is no escaping that.",
      "Amorim inherited an expensively-assembled squad in November, still fresh from five new additions being added to it last summer, but its profile, as the last few months have highlighted countless times, is not wedded to Amorim's philosophy.",
      "Only come the summer transfer window will Amorim get the chance to make just some of the necessary changes. It will be impossible for every change that needs to happen to take place in one window.",
      "It is unfair to judge Amorim until he has had a meaningful opportunity to build his own squad, with only Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven being signed since he was appointed, but he is not a position where he is immune from criticism.",
      "He has won just 24 points from 25 Premier League games in charge, with ten of them being amassed against the three relegated clubs, highlighting just how poor United's league form has been in recent months.",
      "It was clear from his initial hesitation about taking the job mid-season that he was conscious the timing wasn't right for him to come in and make an immediate impact, referencing the importance of pre-season. He will get the opportunity."

      "Amorim merits backing but, irrespective of whether United return from Bilbao with a new attraction for the club museum, the scrutiny on his position will be intense before each of those first three autumnal international breaks in the first third of next season.",
      "He admitted on Sunday that if the complacent culture continues to linger next season he should be sacked. Amorim has the matchgoers onside, so much so his name is chanted more regularly than any of the players.",
      "United supporters are often dignified in expressing their disapproval. It took a 4-1 humbling by Watford for them to specifically boo Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Vicarage Road. In front of the Sir Elton John Stand, Solskjaer was barely still standing.",

      "Amad and Fernandes renewed their contracts in the last year, Maguire had his extended until 2026 and Yoro only arrived in July. Casemiro's Europa League pedigree has endeared him to supporters who appreciate his commitment and gutsiness after 18 months in decline.",
      "The purported poster boys of the new United, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, have had trying campaigns and the bond between academy starlets and supporters is not as ardent as it was a year ago. A rejected bid for Garnacho and a rejected contract by Mainoo have doubtless contributed. Both players' agents were sat among the United squad's family and friends in San Mames two weeks ago.",
      "As for the rest, fans would not kick up a fuss if the majority left. United acquired a dependable squad player in Noussair Mazraoui, Ayden Heaven showed promise before injury and Lisandro Martinez is an undeniable asset when fit.",
      "Then there are the frozen assets - those who freeze in the United shirt. Serie A remains a dumping ground for English clubs and United have to write off at least one of the £108.5million misfits Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Hojlund has eked three goals in 32 games and this is his second season. Zirkzee creditably rallied after his ignominious first-half substitution against Newcastle United but United are not going to get to where they aspire to be with him in the team. The two forwards bought from Europe's boot should be given the boot.",
      "Manchester City's dominance under Pep Guardiola was underpinned by them clearing the decks at full back in the summer of 2017. Bacary Sagna, Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy were released while Aleksandar Kolarov was sold. City invested £126.5m to recruit Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo.",
      "By City's sixth game of the 2017-18 season, Walker and Mendy had tallied more assists than Sagna, Zabaleta, Kolarov and Clichy had done between them in the previous campaign. Although Mendy succumbed to an anterior cruciate ligament injury in City's eighth fixture, the die had been cast. Fabian Delph came in as an auxiliary left back and the front-footed approach had a profound effect on serial matchwinning wingers Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane.",
      "Walker is a City great. Mendy is not held in remotely similar esteem for obvious reasons and without him Guardiola reinvented the wheel at left back. Delph and then Oleksandr Zinchenko had successful stints out of position there. City have still not signed a recognisable left back since Mendy.",
      "United, meanwhile, still have a left back who joined 11 years ago. They are saddled with Luke Shaw, approaching the last two years of his contract. Victor Lindelof's outstayed welcome will end after eight years and the United hierarchy must have breathed a sigh of relief when they discovered that there was not a one-year option on Christian Eriksen's contract.",
      "Loanees Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have to be shifted permanently. United may have a similar waiting game with Rashford to last summer's with Sancho, who joined Chelsea at the 11th hour. Europa Conference League finalist Antony is at least creating a market that should ensure his fee prevents United from making a loss on him under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "Casemiro's European form cannot hoodwink United. If they lose to Tottenham in Bilbao, no European football next season would effectively render Casemiro more redundant than some of the staff the club are letting go. The 33-year-old's revival has been restricted to the Europa League.",
      "Should Casemiro stay or go, Amorim would be sanguine. His perception of the Brazilian has altered drastically since the end of the winter transfer window. As instrumental as Casemiro was against Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Bilbao, hardly any clubs would stump up the £15m United require and match Casemiro's handsome £300,000-a-week salary.",
      "Unlike Manuel Ugarte against Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro is brave, at least."

      "Every child who plays football is taught that if you lose the ball, try your best to win it back.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Manuel Ugarte seemed to break that golden rule on Sunday.",
      "Ugarte was dispossessed by Mohammed Kudus near the centre circle at Old Trafford, but Kudus had already sprinted to the penalty area by the time Ugarte had finally risen to his feet.",
      "The 24-year-old had no reason to be hurt by Kudus' challenge, which made the time he took to stand back up even more baffling and gave the impression that he couldn't be bothered.",
      "Ugarte should perhaps be given the benefit of the doubt - maybe he'd taken a knock? However, there's no denying the optics weren't good and it certainly didn't go down well with fans.",
      "Ruben Amorim was asked for his thoughts on Ugarte at his post-match conference, but he declined to get stuck into his display and responded: \"I don't want to talk about specific players.\"",
      "Amorim worked with Ugarte during his time in charge at Sporting Lisbon and has described him as an example in the United dressing room. There was nothing exemplary about his performance against West Ham, though.",
      "Ugarte seems to be like Marmite among supporters. Some fans don't think he offers much at all, while others believe he's been a good addition. The truth is probably somewhere in between.",
      "There have been good and bad days for Ugarte in his first season in English football since he signed from Paris Saint-Germain for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons.",
      "Ugarte is a mobile No.6, someone who can protect the defensive line by intercepting and recovering balls, but his passing leaves a lot to be desired, and there's a conversation about whether United need another player in his position.",
      "The very fact those conversations have taken place tells you Ugarte's first season hasn't gone as planned because if it had, United would not need a midfielder in that mould this summer.",
      "Last summer, United were reluctant to match PSG's asking price of a €60m (£50.6m) fixed fee for Ugarte, and they believed the deal they eventually agreed vindicated their patient approach to negotiations.",
      "Having said that, that can only be true if the knocked-down £42.3m fee for Ugarte can be considered value after his first season, which is doubtful.",
      "Ugarte has been hit-and-miss, although he certainly isn't the only member of the dressing room who has fallen short of expectations in this campaign.",
      "Every single player, with the exception of Bruno Fernandes and Amad, will end this season with some reputational damage, but it's disappointing that United might already need to sign a player of Ugarte's ilk.",
      "There have been some good displays from Ugarte, particularly alongside Fernandes in the pivot, but Amorim will be unsure whether they are a good enough midfield pairing for next season.",
      "United are targeting a top-six finish in the Premier League next term, so can they achieve that with Ugarte and Fernandes starting the majority of games in the pivot? Perhaps the answer is no.",
      "The club will admit they have been unconvinced about Ugarte, who was still signed for a reasonable sum, despite it being less than PSG's initial asking price, if they look to sign another midfielder this summer.",
      "Performances like Ugarte's against West Ham on Sunday won't help his case, either."

      "Winning that competition will guarantee a place in the Champions League next season which will be huge for Ruben Amorim, particularly as he looks to strengthen his squad. The added funds would allow him to do just that and while it wouldn't save the season, it would be good to leave this dreadful campaign on a high.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a closer look at a couple of reports surrounding United going into the transfer window which could benefit them greatly.",
      "According to Football Espana, Real Betis are starting to fear that they may not be able to sign Antony permanently even if they qualify for the Champions League. It is understood that both Atletico Madrid and Juventus are showing an interest in the Brazilian thanks to his brilliant form in Seville.",
      "Villarreal, who occupy the last Champions League spot, are thought to see Antony as more of a priority as do Betis and Atletico. Antony's current club are believed to want him on a loan deal next season but we understand that United want to sell him.",
      "What MEN Sport says: This transfer battle will be music to the ears of United as they look to secure funds for future signings. There could now be a genuine scenario where United will be able to demand more for Antony than Jadon Sancho which would have been unthinkable in January. What is particularly good for United is that a few teams want the winger and as such could drive his price tag up. United will need all the money they can get this summer so it can't be understated how welcome this report is.",
      "According to TBR Football, Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap's preference would be to sign for United over Chelsea in the summer transfer window. The forward will be available for £30m at the end of this season thanks to Ipswich's relegation and we understand the striker is a top target for Ineos this summer.",
      "What MEN Sport says: The lure of United will still be strong if they can persuade Delap to join them over Chelsea - particularly if Amorim's men are not in the Champions League. It helps that Delap has played in the city before and his roots are up in the north west but how big a factor is that now in the modern age? Delap is exactly the type of striker that Ineos would love to purchase but in truth, United may need one more to bolster their attack properly."

      "Delap had only been born six months before the Portuguese sensation completed his initial £12m switch from Sporting CP to Old Trafford in 2003.",
      "So he would have spent his formative years learning how to crawl, walk, run and then kick a ball watching the No.7 make his 236 appearances up until 2009, scoring 103 goals and providing 37 assists whilst winning the Premier League and Champions League.",

      "To their credit, the squad managed to turn up for the Europa League, and now just one match separates Ruben Amorim's side from an undeserving place in next season's Champions League, if Premier League form was anything to go by. Unfortunately, the United players did not have that excuse to hide behind on Sunday as they slipped to their 17th defeat of the season.",
      "West Ham were in as rotten form as United, but Graham Potter managed to mastermind a victory over Amorim's team in a game which the hosts dominated on every statistic bar the one that matters. Just Chelsea stand in United's way now before that season-defining clash with Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",
      "A victory over Spurs and United could count the season's objective as being completed. Lose, and there is nowhere to hide.",
      "Regardless of the result in the Basque Country, one matter that can't be hidden by Europa League glory is the substantial prize money loss that United will take from their league position. The exact figures for 2024/25 have not been confirmed yet, the Premier League often makes these figures public knowledge at the end of the campaign.",
      "However, they are likely to be similar to last season, which saw each position earn £2.8m more than the position below them. After a disappointing campaign that saw United finish eighth, they bagged a respectable £36.4m.",
      "If they finish 16th, which they occupy at the time of writing, they will manage to earn just £14m. This is a £22.4m loss from the season before.",
      "Winning the Europa League would manage to bag United roughly an extra £10.95m but that still would not cover the shortfall for their low Premier League finish. The real bonus would come next season when they entered the Champions League with £15.7m earned just for qualifying for the competition.",
      "However, that does not alter the stain that would be left on the finances this season. In a best case scenario, United could still finish as high as 13th which would bag them £22.4m based on last season's figures.",
      "But for that to happen, they would need to beat Champions League chasing Chelsea with a heavily rotated squad and Aston Villa. So that seems unlikely.",
      "More concerningly, if Spurs can pick up one extra point in their next two matches in comparison to United, the Reds will finish an embarassing 17th and will take home just £11m in prize money. Even the unlikely best case scenario is a measily sum compared to last season and forgetting the Premier League could cost United dearly in the transfer window.",

      "\"We are going to have difficult moments and we will be found out in some games, I know that,\" said Amorim.",

I would like to say different things, but I have to say again, the storm will come.\"",
      "Despite the 4-0 scoreline suggesting United had brushed Everton aside without a moment's hesitation, they had ridden their luck, particularly in the first half, with Everton failing to capitalise on chances that came and went.",
      "Since that victory over the Toffees, handsome scorelines have been at a premium, with United's only other four-goal hauls coming in the Europa League against Real Sociedad (4-1), Lyon (5-4) and most recently Athletic Bilbao (4-1).",
      "In the Premier League, United, since beating Everton on December 1, have scored just 25 goals in their last 23 games, once again shining a light on how indifferent their domestic performances have been in comparison to those that have been served up in the Europa League.",
      "Sunday's 2-0 defeat to West Ham United marked their 17th league defeat of the season and the 14th time they have failed to score in the Premier League this season. It also marked a ninth Old Trafford reverse of the campaign, meaning they have now lost exactly half of their home league games with just one left to play.",
      "United's home form in the Premier League this season has been a significant contributor to their domestic struggles across the board. They have amassed just 21 points from 18 home games this term, winning six, drawing three and losing nine.",
      "They are winless in their last four home league games, losing each of their last two. They have also failed to score in their last three.",
      "Since Amorim officially took charge at United during the November international break, his team has collected just 11 points from a possible 36 on home soil. Only Everton, Southampton and Ipswich Town have walked away from Old Trafford empty handed.",
      "Furthermore, five visiting teams at Old Trafford have recorded victories to nil during that period. The Theatre of Dreams has once again turned into the Theatre of Nightmares.",
      "After United's home record attracted justified criticism in 2020/21 and 2021/22, it was transformed under former manager Erik ten Hag in 2022/23.",
      "After losing 2-1 to Brighton & Hove Albion on the opening day of the Premier League season, United did not taste defeat at home in the league again all season. Sociedad, who visited Old Trafford on the same evening Queen Elizabeth II died, were the only other team to win at Old Trafford that season, and that defeat was played out in unprecedented circumstances.",
      "United won 15 of their 19 Premier League home games in Ten Hag's maiden season in charge, amassing an impressive 48 points - a record that was only bettered by Manchester City's tally of 52.",
      "After a period in which visiting teams came to Old Trafford and were confident of planting their flag in the ground and making a statement, Ten Hag turned M16 back into a fortress, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham, City and Chelsea all being beaten in 2022/23.",
      "Resurrecting United's home form was the backbone of the success Ten Hag enjoyed in his first season at the club, with it playing a key role in helping them secure a top four finish and reach the Carabao Cup and FA Cup finals.",
      "Amorim has already experienced far too many disappointing afternoons and evenings at Old Trafford, meaning improving United's home record next season has to be a leading objective for him.",
      "A club of United's stature should boast one of the Premier League's best home records season after season. If not, the storm that Amorim said was coming will continue to sweep its way through M16, and the damage could be catastrophic."

      "It's claimed that the Glazers would have the opportunity to activate their drag-along rights if interest of a full takeover emerges. Ratcliffe does, however, have the chance to counter any offers for their Class B shares, which hold more power than Class A shares.",
      "The Englishman would in that instance have to accept a full sale if he doesn't match the offer. Interest from a third party could put Ratcliffe's involvement into jeopardy with the drag-along rights reportedly coming into play in just three months.",
      "That will mark the year-and-a-half mark of his investment in the football club. It's claimed that Ratcliffe can sell his shares within the following 18 months and make all his money back, but beyond that, he would be obliged to accept whatever the Glazers may sanction - although there is no suggestion this situation is likely to happen as things stand."

      "Jarrod Bowen added to United’s misery shortly after Yoro’s withdrawal as he made it 2-0 to the visitors.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Inexplicably rotated back into the team and unconvincing yet again. Failure to catch a cross even contributed to Bowen's goal. 5",

      "They rose to 16th thanks to Tottenham, predictably beaten by Crystal Palace on their own patch. The Europa League finalists are also battling to outdo each other for the worst team not to be relegated from the top flight. \"If you beat Spurs, you're not all c***s,\" is just about the nicest thing West Ham's away-dayers have ever said to United.",
      "A West Ham staff member said to a colleague at half-time, \"If we win, we'll rinse this.\" West Ham had won four games on the road all season and they have left Old Trafford with three points for the first time since 2007. They had not won in nearly three months. Yet United are winless in the league in two months.",
      "West Ham are above United in the table now. United's numbers are worth outlining in black and white for anyone prepared to cut this United squad any slack: played 36, won 10, drawn nine, lost 17 and with a -11 goal difference. United last lost 17 league games in a single season in 1973-74. Ie. the relegation season. Their goal difference was actually better under Tommy Docherty's doomed squad.",
      "West Ham's followers chided Rasmus Hojlund with a chorus of \"F*****g useless\". That could have applied to the entire United side. They had signings purchased for £72million, £60m, £58m and £67m in their starting XI. United discovered years ago it is not about quantity but quality.",
      "United could realistically lose half of their 38 league fixtures. Chelsea and Aston Villa, their remaining opponents, are in pressing need of points in the attempt to qualify for the Champions League. The latter is four days after the Europa League final.",
      "Still the United matchgoers refuse to turn, not when there is a cup final on the horizon. The first half ended without any boos. There were none at full-time, either.",
      "The odd matchgoer vented, at Harry Amass deciding against a cross or the lack of pressing from Hojlund. The United denizens mostly stayed silent. That silence spoke volumes.",
      "United's supporters have become so accustomed to defeat they are apathetic. There was barely a murmur of discontent at their bottom-place finish in the Champions League group stage last season. Those feel like heady days now. Their league position is doubly worse than last year's eighth.",
      "The afternoon was compounded by a significant injury. Leny Yoro was able to walk off but his body language was downbeat. He was clutching his left foot when the physio Jordan Reece assessed him.",
      "Amorim immediately replaced Yoro and Luke Shaw, suddenly a genuine contender to start in Bilbao if Yoro does not recover within ten days. Shaw has not completed 90 minutes for his club since February last year.",
      "Despite the sunshine and serenity, Bruno Fernandes was not easy like Sunday morning. He rebuked Kobbie Mainoo for his positioning as early as the 12th minute while Yoro had the ball. Fernandes elaborated on his gripe when the ball went dead.",
      "With Fernandes back in midfield, United effectively accommodated four No.10s. Having been too defensive-minded against Athletic Bilbao, the balance was too extreme in the opposite direction.",
      "Amad, starting for the first time in three months, was effectively pitted against Mohammed Kudus. That was proven to be a mismatch when the Ghanaian held off Amad to drive the ball in for Tomas Soucek, holding off Harry Amass in another mismatch, to cutely flick the ball in.",
      "Amorim fretted over Noussair Mazraoui's fitness on Thursday evening yet he stayed in the starting line-up. Mazraoui at right centre back and Amad on the right wing was possibly a trial for the Europa League final. Amad teed up Fernandes for an early shot, drew the only save from Alphonse Areola in the first half and played Hojlund in. Amad was United's only positive.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka was greeted by Fernandes, Yoro and Victor Lindelof in the tunnel on his return. He was serenaded more often by the travelling Cockneys in five minutes than he was in five years at Old Trafford. He showed why he is serenaded so often with a canny reverse pass for the opening goal.",
      "Wan-Bissaka arguably saved his best performance at Old Trafford for his first visit as an opponent. He pickpocketed Manuel Ugarte and perceptively squared the ball for Jarrod Bowen to tap in for 2-0.",
      "Ugarte has admitted that physicality is the biggest difference between the Europa League and the Premier League. His dawdling on the ball encapsulated this United side in a microcosm. Every weekend, they live up to their 'worst-since-relegated' billing.",
      "West Ham's followers singled out Hojlund and he failed to convert a Harry Maguire knockdown three yards out from goal. David Moyes was in attendance and both of his former teams were better off with him in the dugout.",

      "Mainoo started successive Premier League games against Bournemouth and Brentford in the deeper midfield role, but he was relocated to the No.10 position against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "It took just 10 minutes to see why Mainoo probably shouldn't be playing as a No.10 in Ruben Amorim's system. He was in the wrong position when Bruno Fernandes was scanning the options in front of him, which led to the youngster receiving an earful from an unhappy Manchester United captain.",
      "Mainoo nodded as he listened to Fernandes' instructions. You cannot fault his effort and willingness to play in that role, but it's probably time to accept he's not as effective there.",
      "Amad and Leny Yoro were the only players in red to emerge with any credit from the first half, but Mainoo looked notably lost in the No.10 role and Amorim pushed him back after West Ham scored their second of the match.",
      "Mainoo returned from a muscle injury away against Lyon on April 10 and Amorim has made it difficult for him to find rhythm. He has continued to tinker with his position in recent weeks.",
      "A source close to the player has played down the effect the changes are having on Mainoo. All the evidence suggests he is not at his best when he plays in the No.10 role in Amorim's system, which even Amorim recognised when he dropped him back to play alongside Fernandes.",
      "Manuel Ugarte was hooked after he was dispossessed in the build-up for Jarrod Bowen's simple goal. The 24-year-old suffered a disappointing afternoon and it was logical to drop Mainoo back.",
      "Mainoo was slightly better after the tweak - West Ham were leading by two at that stage - because his qualities are almost certainly better suited to the deeper midfield position.",
      "Amorim is undecided about which role suits Mainoo best in his formation and it would be a shock if he started in the Europa League final, despite him starring in the FA Cup final 12 months ago.",
      "Imagine telling supporters after last season's FA Cup final that Mainoo could leave in the summer? They wouldn't have believed you, but an exit from his boyhood club is not off the cards.",
      "It would be a sad state of affairs if Mainoo leaves because he is a supremely talented young player. Having said that, it might be a move that eventually makes sense for both parties.",
      "Mainoo still doesn't have a settled role in this United team, but it's something he could perhaps be offered by another club. United would also bank a decent fee for an academy graduate if he did leave.",
      "It's been a difficult 12 months for Mainoo and tweaking his position hasn't helped him."

      "These six players could all be on the move this summer – three are basically confirmed departures, and Kevin De Bruyne is certain to leave Man City. We reckon Arsenal should be taking a serious look…",
      "",
      "Antony (Manchester United)\nWhat would have seemed a completely insane suggestion a few months ago is now something several big clubs might seriously consider. On loan from Manchester United to Real Betis, Antony has been on fire, helping the La Liga side reach the Europa Conference League final, where they will face Chelsea on May 28.",
      "But in the Premier League, Antony has been one of the worst signings ever. Only Alexis Sanchez’s miserable swap deal with Henrikh Mkhitaryan ranks lower among Manchester United transfers in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. And when it comes to £70million-plus Premier League signings, he’s second-last again in a diabolical list of flops.",
      "Yet there’s a chance the spinning Brazilian could still come good in England – not for United, but perhaps for someone else.",
      "The Red Devils played a blinder by sending Antony on loan to Spain in January. Before his resurgence at Betis, it was widely accepted that £15million would be a generous fee for someone who cost £65m more. Now there’s genuine hope United could recoup closer to £40m – still a colossal loss, but decent damage limitation.",
      "No one expects Mikel Arteta or Andrea Berta to spend too long pondering a move for Antony – and this isn’t a prediction that they will – but he’s shown he can thrive in the right environment, under the right management, and surrounded by competent footballers. Arsenal can offer all three, and if he’s willing to put the defensive work in, he could be a very handy back-up to Bukayo Saka.",
      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\nMartin Odegaard has been a little off the boil this season, and who better to ease the creative burden than a man who’s spent the last decade tormenting Arsenal?",
      "Obviously, wage demands and his injury record are two pretty major stumbling blocks when it comes to signing a player who’s clearly on the decline, but it’s Kevin De Bruyne, lads. He knows full well that the £400,000-a-week wages he earns at Manchester City aren’t going to be matched anywhere outside Saudi Arabia, and while MLS clubs might stretch to $300,000 per week, remaining at the top level still seems to be the Belgian’s main priority.",
      "With that in mind, Arsenal could be an ideal landing spot. We know all about his leadership, experience and winning mentality, but the fact is that KDB can still contribute. He still massively improves a Gunners squad that’s crying out for an X-factor signing – someone who could finally get them over the line in the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nHad Arsenal not made the pointless and panicky signing of Raheem Sterling, they might have thrown their hat in the ring for Marcus Rashford in the winter transfer window. He would have been exactly what Mikel Arteta was crying out for – and as someone who’s played plenty of football through the middle, he would have been a natural replacement for the injured Kai Havertz.",
      "Instead, Arteta was forced to chuck Mikel Merino up front, ignoring Gabriel Martinelli’s potential in that role. And with Bukayo Saka sidelined until March, there’s been a real lack of bite in the forward areas this year.",
      "Rashford – growing in confidence by the week at Villa Park before suffering a season-ending injury – has swiftly returned to something close to his terrifying best under Unai Emery, freed from the Old Trafford shackles just like Antony. He still has so much to offer, but once again, it comes down to wage demands and whatever fantasy figure United slap on him.",
      "At 27, there are legitimate questions over the logistics of any move – particularly given his wild inconsistency over the last few seasons – but honestly, you have to take the form of any Manchester United player with a hefty pinch of salt. As we’ve seen with Antony and Rashford this year, and Jadon Sancho in 2024, that club is bloody cursed.",
      "Rashford still has the potential to be a world-class forward. He just needs to get this summer move right, and Arsenal could be the perfect fit.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nNkunku scored a frankly ridiculous 58 goals and provided 29 assists in his final two seasons at Leipzig, earning a move to Chelsea.",
      "The Blues struck a deal to sign him before their spiral into chaos truly began. Had the Frenchman waited just a few more months, he might’ve ended up elsewhere – and kept hold of both his form and his reputation as an elite goalscorer.",
      "But he didn’t. And he hasn’t.",
      "Anyone who watched him tear it up in the Bundesliga knows there’s a top-class attacker in there somewhere, but signing Nkunku now carries an obvious degree of risk. Still, Arsenal do love a Chelsea cast-off – and at 27, Nkunku is a fair bit younger than most of the Stamford Bridge alumni they’ve taken on in recent years.",
      "📢 TO THE COMMENTS! Should Arsenal sign any of these six Premier League rejects? Have your say Below The Line…",
      "",
      "Evan Ferguson (Brighton)\nFerguson’s stock has fallen off a cliff, but under the right manager he could still realise his potential. If Arsenal do come calling, it’s likely to be either as a second striker signing or as their tenth-choice option – after being turned down by Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Jonathan David and half a dozen others.",
      "A loan spell at West Ham hasn’t had the desired effect, and Ferguson will return to Brighton for pre-season with a point to prove. Fabian Hurzeler appears content with Danny Welbeck leading the line and, while Welbeck remains a valuable player, he’s someone the young Irishman should be looking to usurp.",
      "A summer exit does feel somewhat inevitable. Arsenal will certainly keep an eye on things, and bringing him in alongside a marquee striker signing would be a statement of intent.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nNot quite a reject or an outcast, but certainly a player United would happily sell for some sweet, sweet pure profit.",
      "Arsenal need midfield reinforcements this summer, with Jorginho set to leave on a free. Martin Zubimendi is arriving from Real Sociedad for around £51million, and if Thomas Partey follows Jorginho out the door, another midfielder will be required.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo would command a hefty fee, but he’s one of the most promising young midfielders in Europe and would add much-needed dynamism and technical quality to an Arsenal midfield currently lacking both. Capable of playing as a No.6, 8 or 10, he fits the profile perfectly.",
      "United might baulk at the idea of selling to what they’d audaciously consider a ‘direct rival’, but if the right offer lands on the table, they’ll surely be tempted. PSR has been a real thorn in the Red Devils’ side, and the sale of an academy graduate would be a financial godsend.",

      "",
      "Nothing at Man Utd is as bad as it seems\nRuben Amorim seems like a decent man, and his admission after the West Ham game has sent the gossip machine into overdrive about his leaving the job. However, in the direst of dire seasons, it’s worth looking for signs of hope. Here are a few:",
      "This team had turned a corner around March, and while not winning games, was showing signs of solidity, especially against the top teams. But the dual challenges of the Europa League and the PL have meant the constant prioritisation of the former, in the last 4 weeks. So we’ve had a somewhat weakened team in the PL games, especially in defence.",
      "Harry Amass is far from Premier League ready, he probably needs to go on loan to a Championship clubs and play a season of punishing physical football. But as a team it’s clear that the Europa is being prioritised which I’m sure impacts the mental state of all players on the pitch.",
      "I’d really like to see a quantitative analysis of the injuries suffered by PL teams. Every team feels that they were unlucky with injuries, but I suspect United (and Spurs) have had it quite bad this year. Every time a player gains a little form he seems to go off for a few weeks (or months), for us. Martinez, Zirkzee, Dalot, De Ligt have all gotten injured just as a run of regular games in the right position was bringing them into some kind of confident form. Others like Mount, Mainoo, Amad, Maguire, and Shaw have had months out and have had to be nursed back with managed minutes.",
      "The lack of a settled defence is particularly debilitating – we seem to have had about seventeen thousand combinations of the back 3 in one season. The 18 year old Tyler Fredricson played well on the left in his first game, but then on the right versus Brentford. Lindelof’s confidence is so low, he might as well be playing his first professional game. Mazroui has been running on fumes lately, and Dalot is out for the season it seems. DeLigt has been in and out. Ayden Heaven looked great, for the few games he played before he went off injured. But he’s only 18. Shaw is still feeling his way in. Yoro is now injured – let’s hope not for too long.",
      "Dorgu is still relatively new to the PL and he’s 20 years old. Especially given the physicality of the PL, it’s a real challenge for the young players to come up to scratch physically and mentally. If we had a consistent run with say Maguire, DeLigt and Martinez as the settled back 3, with Yoro as the option, and with Mazraoi and Shaw able to step in occasionally – I think this season goes differently. Not to mention the cliche of the impact the lack of a settled defence on the goalkeeper.",
      "At the other end, it’s all about poor Hojlund. The one striker on whom everybody depends, who is so out of form that he couldn’t score a pint at a brewery. And yet there are no options here, with the Rashford meltdown, and Garnacho who is good for the odd worldy but generally unreliable with his decision making. And when your main striker isn’t scoring goals, the opposition find it easy to block the other routes. If your striker is in form, it also opens up opportunities for others to score.",
      "This is a feast or famine situation and United are most definitely in a famine. In the past few games we’ve created more chances than the opposition, but when you’re not scoring goals it always puts more pressure on the defence.",
      "How much of this is fixable? My argument is that Amorim desperately finds a way to bring consistency to his backline – whether through luck, or finding more indestructible defenders. And he needs at least 2 front players who are capable of scoring in the range of 20 goals a season. If the combined sales of Garnacho, Sancho, and Rashford allow for (say) Cunha and Liam Delap – it would be a different team.",
      "The midfield is actually quite competitive when everybody is fit and at the top of their game. When you can combine Dalot/Mazraoui/Amad on the left, and Dorgu/Leon (incoming)/Shaw on the right, with Mainoo, Bruno, Casemiro (managed minutes), and Ugarte in the middle. Sure, another solid DM wouldn’t hurt with the money we save from Eriksen and Lindelof salaries.",
      "None of this is to suggest that United will become CL contenders overnight. There’s a lot more missing in terms of chemistry and style. But maybe Amorim deserves one preseason and even then I’ll take a good run that gets us into the Europa League next season.",

      "",
      "Are we all Spurs?\nAppreciate we’re a week off it but with the Europa League final fast approaching I’ve been thinking a bit about who I’d rather won and, as a result, salvaged a modicum of pride from an absolutely disastrous season for both clubs by winning a second tier European trophy.",

After 40 years of being one, I don’t think I can carry on being a Liverpool fan.",

It’s pathetic man – grow up! “BuT He’s LeAvInG oN a FrEE!” – this was the only way he was ever going to get a move to Madrid which, let’s be honest, is a step up from Liverpool as a football club.",

      "“It is the announcing he’s leaving before the end of the season (so he can manoeuvre to play in a tournament for Real this season).” or maybe he just wanted to say goodbye at Anfield? (that worked out well)",
      "“It is because he’s done it in a way that has deprived us of a mega fee and will cost us a fortune to replace. The voices saying ‘he didn’t cost you anything!’ don’t understand basic finance”. For the last time, players do not owe it to you to sign a contract just to get the club a fee!!! This narrative is genuinely pathetic. He signed a 4 year deal. He fulfilled his end of the bargain. If he had signed a 6-year deal and then said he wanted to leave, I absolutely 100% know for certain that you would be criticising him for wanting to leave mid-contract.",
      "“It is that egotistical video that for some reason the club shared during the season. Wait until after the parade! But see above. He wants out asap to play for a European rival.” There is literally no club that Trent could move to that would not be a “European Rival”.",
      "“It is the ‘’I’ll always support the club’’… what? Even when we play against you?” Yes? Is that a problem?",
      "Trent has been a starring member of the team that has won it all and brought LFC to 20 English titles. He should be (and is) a club legend. The fact that is is being criticised for seeing out his contract, rather than handing in a transfer request mid-contract is just utterly bizarre. He should have got a huge ovation and we wish him well as he goes off to a new challenge. Instead, pathetic, small minded idiots chose to see him leave under a cloud.",

      "We’ve been pretty down on this Premier League season at various points so let’s give credit where it’s due: that was a brilliant weekend.",
      "And the not-so-secret reason why it was such a brilliant weekend? Misery. Despair. Hearts breaking in two.",
      "We haven’t yet fully recovered from the saccharine, sickly sweet response to Newcastle’s Carabao Cup win, an event we were all instructed was one of great wondrousness that we should all be enjoying. We were baffled then and remain baffled now.",
      "Why should anyone other than Newcastle fans be delighted about Newcastle winning something?",
      "What we do understand is why for plenty of other ‘neutral’ supporters it was the more desirable outcome from the final. Everton supporters, for instance. Manchester United supporters. Any fans who find Liverpool’s This Means More exceptionalism more grating than Newcastle’s Best Fans in the World exceptionalism.",
      "And that brings us to the key point underpinning so much of football fandom. It’s not just about nice things happening to your team; it’s about bad things happening to other teams. And not necessarily even ones you particularly dislike.",
      "When you stop and think about it, this is obvious. If we had to rely on the joy our own teams actually provide us then almost all of us would surely have packed up the daft idea of following a football team years ago. For the vast majority of clubs the joy-despair ratio is all wrong.",
      "No, what keeps us coming back over and over is the fact that no matter what guff and nonsense your lot might be up to, at least someone else somewhere is showing more of their arse.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim and Ange, Newcastle, Dias, Rusk, Beto, Jackson",
      "Now to be clear here, we’re not subscribers to the idea that rivals’ disappointment should be more important than your own success. There’s a sliding scale here, but this is where we’d place ourselves: Spurs fans being quite happy to lose to Man City and scupper Arsenal’s league hopes at no great cost to themselves (avoiding Champions League qualification last season could yet prove their best decision in decades…) is absolutely fine, but Spurs fans who would settle for the hypothetical scenario of them not winning the Europa League if it meant Arsenal not winning the Champions League is too much.",
      "But the disappointment and upset of others is still a huge part of being a football fan and it’s ridiculous to pretend otherwise. It’s one more reason why we didn’t really understand that whole Newcastle thing. Knowing other fans are having their piss boiled to dangerous levels is a huge contributing factor to what makes your own success so enjoyable.",
      "Why would you want everyone else to be happy about it? Where’s the fun in that? This applies to success both large and small, too. Do Liverpool fans enjoy their title win more or less because it’s caused Mikel Arteta’s salty head to fall off? Do Southampton fans enjoy their point against Man City more or less because it’s caused Ruben Dias’ salty head to fall off?",
      "The whole guard of honour discourse is quite silly, but its existence tells us that deep down we all know this phenomenon is real. The idea of seeing Chelsea or Arsenal or whoever forced into this weird ritual humiliation by a luckless quirk of the fixture list is deeply enjoyable for everyone else.",
      "Which brings us back to this weekend and why it was so good: because so few people were actually happy.",
      "Man City weren’t happy because Southampton decided to actually defend against them, which is in fairness quite poor etiquette when they haven’t bothered with it against anyone else for 35 games.",
      "Arsenal aren’t happy because they’ve won nothing again and have dread fear about multiple potential banter outcomes to this season.",
      "Even Liverpool weren’t happy at their latest Anfield title party because they had simply no choice but to boo a player who has helped deliver everything those fans had craved for 30 years but now fancies playing for the biggest football club on earth for a bit.",
      "Chelsea: not happy.",
      "Man United and Spurs: involved in what is perhaps the all-time greatest season-long act of piss-boiling ever conceived, one which can now only end with one of those clubs as happy as a dog with two dicks while the other hits new depths of despair and everyone else is furious about one side of the equation and laughing their bollocks clear off about the other.",
      "They are, therefore, clearly the two standout clubs of this season and we have no notes. The fact they have now become so committed to ensuring they finish 16th and 17th to maximise the emotional extremes at the end of it all is truly magnificent.",
      "Even Nottingham Forest have found a way to bring misery upon themselves in a season that now brings a guaranteed place in European competition next season. The owner is literally on the pitch having a go at the manager because they might now only finish seventh.",
      "Here, then, is just another way this game is far more about misery than joy. Because the shift in expectations that follows things like Forest’s profoundly unlikely-looking season means that ‘We’d have given everything to be precisely where we are now back in August’ ends up meaning two-fifths of f*ck all in reality even though its logic is utterly impeccable.",
      "Do we have any actual problem with Nottingham Forest? Not really. Did we nevertheless take perverse and extreme delight in pinpointing the precise moment yesterday where their hearts broke in two? Of course we did.",
      "And don’t pretend you didn’t feel it too.",
      "Social media and ragebait and the wider collapse of society in general may have all helped hasten football’s descent into rabid and often unhealthy tribalism, but let’s not pretend the despair of others hasn’t always been an absolute core element of fan culture.",
      "We all love to hate."

      "Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou cannot complain that their preparations for a ludicrously important game have been shocking. Newcastle are flying.",
      "",
      "Leicester\nIf annoying your rivals represents the high point of a season it has not gone especially well. But fair play because that is a very funny bit.",
      "",
      "Newcastle\nIt could have gone two different ways. Newcastle ending their long trophy drought might just as easily have derailed the rest of their season, the instinct to celebrate and that release of pent-up emotion providing the most intoxicating and understandable distraction imaginable.",
      "But harnessed properly, it was always a potential springboard for something not greater and certainly not as tangible, but definitely more beneficial in the long run. While Newcastle cannot put Champions League qualification alongside the Carabao Cup in their trophy cabinet, it means more for their future aspirations.",
      "And no team has earned more Premier League points since the Carabao final than winners Newcastle, who have used that platform and momentum to surge past almost all of their rivals into prime position:",
      "These games really do suit them like no other. Newcastle have played members of the Big Six eight times at St James’ Park this season, winning six, drawing two, scoring 17 goals and conceding six. Those results formed a crucial part of their Carabao glory and seem likely to do the same with this Champions League push.",
      "",
      "Simon Rusk\nPerhaps only Eddie Howe, Thomas Frank, Oliver Glasner, Vitor Pereira and David Moyes have met their Premier League job requirements as specifically and definitively as Rusk this season. The man responsible for a quarter of Southampton’s points and two-thirds of their clean sheets having taken charge of just one sixth of their games has crossed an underwhelming but entirely necessary finish line nonetheless.",
      "In dragging Southampton beyond record-breakingly dreadful and into the mere realm of historically poor without the stigma attached, Rusk has delivered on his remit and bruised some egos along the way.",
      "The 43-year-old should be allowed to step back into a permanent role on the first-team coaching staff in the summer under whichever poor sap is chosen to lead their Championship promotion charge. Rusk has shown enough to suggest he is worth keeping around.",
      "He is also one of five managers to face and never lose to Pep Guardiola in the Premier League, and probably in time the toughest of those quiz question answers alongside former Middlesbrough caretaker Steve Agnew.",
      "",
      "Brentford\nFour straight wins for the first time in their Premier League history has turned European qualification from distant chance to distinct possibility for Brentford. Their home and away form has finally aligned at the perfect time and the injuries have abated.",
      "It is a ridiculous achievement for them to be eighth, with the ritual sacrifice of their domestic cup hopes entirely vindicated if Europa Conference League football can be secured.",
      "Selling your star striker and scoring more goals than all but the current top four is wild. Frank is a ludicrously good coach, even if it does still feel as though he would be sacked within six months if appointed anywhere else.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace\nOne point from setting a new club-record Premier League tally after doing the double over Spurs, Manchester United and Brighton, with the FA Cup final to follow this weekend.",
      "One man will be particularly devastated but Oliver Glasner is doing phenomenal work.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa\nThe success of their January transfer gamble depends exclusively on reaching the Champions League, but Aston Villa qualifying for Europe through league position for a third straight season is an underrated accomplishment that surprisingly few teams have managed in recent years.",
      "Unai Emery’s worth is undoubted but he continues to prove it in circumstances such as these. Away at Bournemouth without Youri Tielemans and Marcus Rashford, the Spaniard figured that Villa’s best chance was also without the ball. And that in itself was a risk, considering their six lowest shares of Premier League possession this season had returned five defeats and a draw.",
      "Their four lowest shares of Premier League possession in 2023/24 yielded three defeats and a draw. It is not Villa’s typical game to sit back and soak up pressure.",
      "But against Bournemouth it was an inspirational call, with a more rudimentary defensive four than usual helping combine Ollie Watkins’ record-breaking goal with a clean sheet.",
      "The key to their season has been in games against the teams around them. Only Liverpool have more points against the top half than Villa (28), who have done better in just one Premier League season – the 42-game inaugural campaign of 1992/93. That is down to a change in mindset overseen wonderfully by the manager.",
      "Of course, it won’t be relevant for their final two games against the teams in 16th and 17th. But Villa have played a blinder in saving these miserable, preoccupied versions of Manchester United and Spurs til last.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nNo club has been behind in fewer Premier League games so the opportunities to do so have been limited, but had Arsenal been able to turn more of their deficits into draws or wins their season would have a vastly different complexion.",
      "As it is, recovering from two quickfire first-half goals at Anfield to draw 2-2 even against a slightly absent Liverpool provided welcome proof that they retain those powers of recovery.",
      "",
      "Conor Bradley\nHe might well get a statue at this rate.",
      "",
      "Beto\nIt might be that Moyes is able to resist the obvious temptation to sign Marko Arnautovic, whose Inter contract expires at the end of the season and will not be renewed. The success of Beto as his latest centre-forward reclamation project should offset any desperate transfer moves at least.",
      "There was one sensational line from the Everton manager about the Guinean’s progress. “He’s done great, he’s improving,” Moyes said. “If he was a 19-year-old striker you’d say he’s got a bit to go, he’s not but he’s certainly improving,” he added of a 27-year-old who cannot afford to coast on potential.",
      "Nor does he have any inclination. Moyes mentioning how Beto trains “like you wouldn’t believe” and “is really trying” is a better indication of his standing under the Scot than the seven goals he has scored in 17 games since his appointment – as many as he mustered in 50 Sean Dyche appointments.",
      "No player has scored more goals in the Premier League this season without providing a single assist, and that narrowed focus between the posts has worked wonders. Unless Leeds offer stupid money, Beto has a part to play in this sustained Everton revival.",
      "",
      "Brighton\nFrom a recent Winners and Losers:",
      "‘It will be a close-run thing but Yasin Ayari’s stunning strike against West Ham has given Brighton a chance. They have pulled level with Arsenal for the most different scorers in the Premier League this season (16 each) and can claim the crown outright over the next four games.",
      "‘Brajan Gruda seems like the safest bet but Lewis Dunk could continue his resurgence with a goal and if worst comes to worst, Bart Verbruggen can be sent up for a corner on the final day.’",
      "Fabian Hurzeler knows what he must do. Verbruggen securing Conference League qualification by sending a goal kick flying over Fraser Forster’s head is written in the stars.",
      "",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka\n“I can’t say this categorically because I don’t know Aaron’s career, but I can’t imagine he’s played as well as he has for us at this point in his career,” said Graham Potter of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who set up the clinching goal against his former club to render this his joint-best Premier League season in terms of an attacking return.",
      "It’s difficult to imagine he’s played many clever reverse passes in the build-up to a goal at Old Trafford either.",
      "Two goals and four assists is not especially productive but the full-back’s improvement in that department has been obvious. In a season of unrelenting suffering for West Ham his £15m signing and six-year contract offers hope.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE REACTION FROM F365\n👉 European qualification latest: Forest follow Manchester City in squandering huge chance\n👉 Trent replaced in Premier League XI of the season by proper defender\n👉 Premier League prize money table revealed with Liverpool breaking Manchester City record",
      "Manchester United and Spurs\nThere have been games with bigger stakes before, but surely none with such a ridiculous gulf between the potential reward for victory and further embarrassment inflicted by defeat.",
      "It is difficult to recall the last fixture both teams so willingly torched their entire seasons for. Neither Manchester United nor Spurs were particularly wrong to have prioritised the Europa League basically since the knockout stage commenced, but the idea their Premier League form had to be offered as an unavoidable sacrifice is preposterous – not least because their apparent advantage over continental opposition will be entirely redundant in the final.",
      "Both Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou made reference to “the levels” needing to be higher after their latest defeats, with surprise that players could not step up and motivate themselves for games the managers have openly written off in terms of importance.",
      "Their approaches in the build-up have been different, with Amorim publicly wondering whether Champions League qualification might actually be worse for his players, rather ignoring how it should offset the need for any more unnecessary job losses throughout the club, while Postecoglou has made no attempt to hide what it would mean for Spurs.",
      "But both have essentially said for months that these games don’t really matter, as their combined 37 Premier League defeats bear out. “Who cares if we’re struggling in the league? It’s a separate thing,” Postecoglou said in a fair reaction after reaching the Europa final, but that sentiment inevitably transmits through the squad.",
      "The result is two Premier League teams entering a stupidly important one-off game in wilfully abysmal form, and as much as the lucrative and glorious plaster on offer for the winners has been highlighted, it doesn’t feel like nearly enough has been made of what the loser will be left with: a historically bad campaign, a squad with shattered confidence, a manager with at best an uncertain future and a summer which must go perfectly just to stabilise themselves.",
      "",
      "Ruben Dias\nIt had been a while since someone associated with Manchester City decidedly to actively soil themselves in protest at an insolent team not rolling over to have their bellies tickled.",
      "If ever a season was going to properly humble and shame that dormant side of self-important, condescending arrogance Pep Guardiola seemed to have suppressed within his squad it would be this one – the reigning champions’ worst of the Spaniard’s reign by far.",
      "And to be fair to Guardiola, he outright dismissed the suggestion Southampton were somehow to blame for Manchester City’s failings.",
      "“They can do whatever they want. It’s on us to break them. They didn’t do much but we have to accept the way they play. I don’t agree with Ruben. We have to accept it,” is absolutely right.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that the aversion to introspection so proudly worn by one of their leaders does not pervade a side in no position whatsoever to snipe at the way other teams play. It was always curious when they blamed those rare slips at their peak on the opposition choosing not to hand three points over, but feeling the need to punch so far down when they have been laughably short of their own standards all campaign is embarrassing.",
      "Manchester City had largely outgrown that finger-pointing, responsibility-shirking part of their identity, and any rebuild should involve restoring it. As eagerly awaited as Rodri’s comeback is, it would be regrettable if it heralds the return of Manchester City’s sore loser edge too.",
      "",
      "Erling Haaland\nThe Are Manchester City Better Without Erling Haaland narrative strand will never die. A ten-year contract ought to have rendered such talk null and void but Guardiola’s side were notably worse for the Norwegian’s presence against Southampton.",
      "The strikerless 4-2-2-2 formation had been refined to the point Manchester City were on their longest winning streak since October, and sacrificing it to give Haaland the full 90 minutes on his return felt like a mistake.",
      "Guardiola “did not expect” Southampton to set up so defensively and simply said of Haaland’s lack of supply that “Erling needs people to deliver balls to him” regardless of what position they play, but it does feel as though his effectiveness is contingent on using wingers, which in turn relies on there being the sort of stable midfield Manchester City cannot currently offer.",
      "If Rodri cannot make it for the FA Cup final then there could be a good old-fashioned Guardiola overthink in reverting back to the system which inspired Manchester City to beat Crystal Palace 5-2 just one month ago. Omar Marmoush feels like the better option than Haaland right now.",
      "",
      "Fulham\nMarco Silva mentioned that “the last six or seven games” had not been good enough from Fulham, but it feels like the eighth in that sequence – the 3-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup quarter-final – was the most damaging.",
      "On the morning of that game, Fulham were eighth and three points off the Champions League places. But since then their form has been miserable, with only the two Europa League finalists and relegated three faring worse.",
      "The international break in March might have killed their momentum and that tendency to drop points from winning positions has become a particular problem. Only Liverpool, Arsenal and Nottingham Forest have led more Premier League games than Fulham this season but the Cottagers seem to build their foundations on quicksand and have too frequently squandered those advantages.",
      "That result confirmed this to be a season of consolidation when so much more was promised.",
      "",
      "Nicolas Jackson\nA quite silly thing to do for a player whose talents are obvious but his drawbacks no less so. The race between a player’s Premier League goals (24) and Premier League cards (18) should not be so close, particularly when his former manager outlined two years ago a need to be more disciplined which appears to have gone ignored.",
      "Another club might be more patient and accommodating; Chelsea are not that club.",
      "",
      "Wolves\n“I think this was the first match that I watched my team playing like this,” said Vitor Pereira, ruing how Wolves were governed by emotion and chaos and drawn into the “open, completely unpredictable game” Brighton would have preferred.",
      "Matheus Cunha leaned into the vibe by conceding a penalty after losing the ball on the edge of his own area, while Pablo Sarabia’s aimless switch was punished to the fullest degree.",
      "It was the first time in 17 games Wolves had lost by at least two goals, and not coincidentally the first time in a while Wolves played someone else’s game rather than their own.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth\nIt is starting to feel a little bit like those swashbuckling January wins cursed them. Bournemouth have not won consecutive Premier League games since dispatching Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in the space of a week so spectacularly four months ago.",
      "Their form since that pair of victories which left them seventh, a point behind both Manchester City and Newcastle, has been atrocious:",
      "Andoni Iraola emphasised the need to “manage the small things better,” presumably like not letting Tyrone Mings test the structural integrity of one’s jaw with his elbow. And when you consider Bournemouth have lost 13 games in all competitions this season, but the only two by more than one goal were both administered by Liverpool, you see his point.",
      "",
      "Ipswich\nThe record for fewest home points in a Premier League season remains seven, set by Sunderland in 2005/06. It is a bar Southampton (six) are set to clear, but Ipswich have only managed to match it while already conceding more goals at Portman Road than the Black Cats at the Stadium of Light two decades ago.",
      "Only four clubs have accrued more points away than at home, but none with such a drastic difference as Ipswich. If they are to return to this stage soon, correcting that must be the priority.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest\nAn undoubtedly frustrating result, performance and general petering out of a wonderful season, with Matz Sels still Golden Glove-bound despite not keeping a clean sheet in seven games.",
      "Forest are basically just knackered and really that is fine. More signings could have been made in January and fewer rotation risks taken in the FA Cup but neither would have guaranteed a better outcome and both came with risks Forest decided it was better not to take.",
      "How embarrassing to only maybe qualify for one of Europe’s lesser competitions after being projected to battle relegation for a third straight season. Definitely worth the owner staging a one-man pitch invasion.",
      "Ruben Dias has criticised Southampton for not simply bending over and letting Manchester City score eight goals at St Mary’s.",
      "Including a mere one Leicester City player, here is the worst Premier League XI of the weekend. Ratings are taken from WhoScored.",
      "Everton may well have a major transfer decision to make with David Moyes and the Friedkin Group set to make a bold call.",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola has revealed that Ruben Dias could miss up to four weeks with a muscle issue after their Manchester derby loss last weekend."

      "Four Manchester United flops are joined by one Liverpool struggler in the Premier League Worst XI of the weekend.",
      "As always, match ratings are taken from WhoScored.",
      "",
      "GK: Bernd Leno (Fulham) – 5.42\nLeno’s weak attempt to parry away Beto’s shot handed Everton an impressive away win, and that error earned the German a spot in the Premier League Worst XI. He has a pretty poor season by his standards.",
      "",
      "RB: Ola Aina (Nottingham Forest) – 5.80\nIt was a close call between Aina and Bournemouth’s Adam Smith (5.83), but the Nottingham Forest man makes the cut after a lacklustre performance in his side’s disappointing 2-2 draw against Leicester City.",
      "Aina picked up a yellow card, lost his only aerial duel, committed an error leading to a shot, and failed to make any tackles or interceptions.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.11\nManchester United have won six, drawn six, and lost 13 of their Premier League matches under Ruben Amorim. That is a diabolical record, and their latest defeat – at home to West Ham on Sunday – left them 16th in the table with a -11 goal difference.",
      "Say what you want about this being a transitional period, the players not being Amorim’s, or the focus being on Europe – this is still a squad worth over £700million in transfer fees and packed with international footballers. Amorim is embarrassed, and rightly so; winning the Europa League should not paper over the cracks of a worst-ever Premier League campaign.",
      "Anyway, rant over. Yoro struggled on Sunday before coming off injured.",
      "",
      "CB: Luke Shaw (Manchester United) – 5.90\nShaw played 52 minutes against West Ham, coming off alongside Yoro. He wasn’t injured – Amorim is simply managing his minutes carefully given his wretched injury record.",
      "Deployed at left centre-back in a back three, Shaw offered little defensive output: just one clearance, no interceptions, no tackles, and not a single aerial duel contested.",
      "",
      "LB: Harry Amass (Manchester United) – 5.76\nSticking with the shambles that is Manchester United, 18-year-old left wing-back Harry Amass made his fourth Premier League start in five games, which sounds promising until you realise he’s lost every single one, with an aggregate score of 11–4. Not ideal.",
      "United have now won just once in nine league matches, having seemingly written off their top-flight campaign the moment Ruben Amorim walked through the door.",
      "In their latest disappointment, Amass was dribbled past twice and probably shouldn’t have lasted the full 90 minutes.",
      "For the record, the lowest-rated actual left-back this week was Arsenal’s Myles Lewis-Skelly (6.08).",
      "",
      "DM: Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool) – 5.62\nIpswich’s Jack Taylor and Chelsea’s Romeo Lavia both had tough weekends, each recording a 5.78 match rating – but it’s Liverpool’s Ryan Gravenberch who claims the unwanted spot in this week’s worst XI.",
      "Arsenal came from two goals down at Anfield to salvage a point that should offer real encouragement heading into next season. They were helped by a toxic atmosphere following Trent Alexander-Arnold’s introduction, with the bizarre boos clearly unsettling Arne Slot’s side.",
      "Gravenberch, in particular, looked uncharacteristically unsettled. He was dribbled past once, failed with his only dribble attempt, misplaced four passes, made no interceptions, was dispossessed twice, committed one foul, and made an error leading to a shot.",
      "Fair play to Arsenal, who managed to rattle the Premier League’s best No.6 this season without Declan Rice.",
      "",
      "CM: Manuel Ugarte (Manchester United) – 5.74\nBack to the shambles at Old Trafford, is it? Hardly surprising that another goalless home defeat sees four Manchester United players in the worst XI – and rounding it off is £50m summer signing Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Uruguayan lasted just 59 minutes after failing to make any meaningful impact, with a dreaded error leading to a shot contributing to his poor 5.74 rating.",
      "",
      "CM: Andreas Pereira (Fulham) – 5.66\nFulham took the lead against Everton in the most 3pm blackout fixture imaginable – but they never took control and ultimately slumped to a deserved 3-1 defeat.",
      "They lost the midfield battle, with Andreas Pereira and Sander Berge struggling to assert themselves. Pereira committed one error leading to a shot and lost possession nine times.",
      "It’s a limp ending to what has been a genuinely fantastic Premier League season. Fulham have now lost four of their last five matches, with their only win in that time coming against the second-worst team in Premier League history.",
      "",
      "RW: Matheus Cunha (Wolves) – 5.73\nCunha is gleefully aware that he is, by some distance, Wolves’ best player. With that status comes a sense of responsibility – one that seemingly compels him to drop all the way back into his own box to collect the ball from goal-kicks. Against a high-pressing Brighton side at Molineux, this proved costly. Caught in possession by Mats Wieffer, the Dutchman was brought down in the box for a stonewall penalty. Danny Welbeck converted from the spot to score his tenth Premier League goal of the season – the first time he’s reached double figures in a single campaign.",
      "It could have been worse for Cunha, who was fortunate not to be sent off for the last-man foul. There was no common sense applied by VAR, who deemed the double jeopardy rule sufficient to spare the Brazilian a red card. But watching the replay, it’s clear there was no attempt to play the ball – Cunha’s eyes are fixed on Wieffer before he deliberately brings him down.",
      "Oh well. Wolves still lost 2-0, so literally only I care about that.",
      "",
      "LW: Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa) 5.27\nVilla secured a crucial 1-0 win at Bournemouth to keep their Champions League hopes alive. But on what had been a decent afternoon for Jacob Ramsey, a second yellow card ensured a nervy finish for Unai Emery and his players.",
      "They held on – but that doesn’t do Ramsey any favours here.",
      "",
      "ST: Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea) – 4.98\nSent off for an incredibly stupid assault on Newcastle United’s Sven Botman, Jackson seemed to have sabotaged Chelsea’s chances of a comeback in their biggest league game of the season. Oddly, though, Enzo Maresca’s side looked far better without him.",
      "Either way, he was a shoo-in the moment that first-half red card was shown.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘preparing a massive outlay’ to ‘secure’ three Premier League stars as ‘key signings’ this summer.",
      "PGMOL has been asked to consider John Brooks’ future as a Premier League official after Nicolas Jackson’s red card for Chelsea vs Newcastle.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is a fool but Chelsea were much better without him anyway. Newcastle were very good then pretty bad, but we can’t imagine they give a damn.",
      "A former England international has likened one of Man Utd’s summer transfer targets to Eric Cantona, but warns they’ll need to do much more.",
      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Super agent Jorge Mendes could complicate Manchester United’s summer move for Wolves attacker Matheus Cunha, according to reports."

      "Remember when ‘playing on a Thursday night’ was uttered as an insult? A symbol of a club’s failure to get in the Champions League. Treated as a kind of curse, the Europa League just got in the way of the important business of earning free money in the Premier League from a higher finish. Money which could be frittered away on second-rate talent, of course.",
      "The PFMs sat with their legs apart and held it in contempt, very much the glass of dry white white wine to their three bottles of strong Barolo and they would put out weakened sides in order to get knocked out as soon as possible.",
      "“It’s one of those competitions that teams get in and then they try to get out of,” said Harry Redknapp who spoke and, to an extent still speaks, for this viewpoint. Playing on a Thursday and Sunday was spuriously claimed to upset players’ delicate biorhythms.",
      "“It takes an even bigger toll in my opinion, that’s the problem. That Thursday night one, every week, and playing Sundays every week…it’s not ideal,” said Redknapp, a physiological expert in his own lunchtime. Is he saying it now that it’s much easier for rubbish Premier League teams to get to a final?",
      "Foreign clubs could cope, of course, but not the delicate Premier League players. Some fans bought this line of bullsh*t and still cling to it, for some reason downplaying one of the few trophies that can be won in a season, having written out an ordered list of trophy importance, based on nothing but some invented truths only they believe.",
      "But now it’s an all-English final, they seem to have decided to take it seriously in a way they did not when Porto beat Braga or Sevilla remarkably won it three times consecutively. Or perhaps we do now because the manager that achieved that feat works in the Premier League so must now be respected. That’s how English exceptionalism works.",
      "Much humour has been derived from Manchester United playing Spurs. Two absolutely chronic bin fires who are both some shade of disgraceful. But the Premier League rewards even the worst with more than £100million of free money; no one from Europe can compete with that.",
      "The truth is, as anyone who watches European football will tell you, other leagues are certainly more regularly entertaining and there are loads of great players who have no interest in playing for an English club. Even though they might earn more, they know that’s not the most important thing. But the teams they play for have diminishing chances of doing well because of simple economics.",
      "A lot of the best players, but not all, have been drawn to the Premier League. That doesn’t mean they play the most entertaining football, of course, but the weight of numbers and overall quality are having an effect because of the sheer volume and depth of resources in favour of the Premier League.",
      "The imbalance is now so massive that it just can’t be ignored, best expressed with Spurs playing Bodo/Glimt. The disparity of resources was profound. Just in case you don’t know how profound, Bodo had one player in the squad worth six million Euro, Spurs had 26 worth more. Now, you don’t have to be critical of this competitive imbalance to recognise that it exists and must influence results. Imagine if, say, rubbish Italian clubs had such an advantage. It’d feel unfair wouldn’t it? Not that it’s possible to totally even out resources and we accept there’ll be differences. It’s the extent of the disparities, not the disparities per se.",
      "As the Premier League becomes ever more financially dominant, it will obviously have an impact on European competitions, especially outside of equally financially dominant sides in the Champions League. Even these rubbish Premier League sides can’t be competed with and they are really terrible. Is it desirable that this should be the case? We’re now at a stage where only a handful of clubs can win any European trophy.",
      "For example, watching Chelsea beat Djurgårdens wasn’t interesting for anyone not a Chelsea fan because of their altogether vastly superior resources. It’s like if they got to an FA Cup final by beating Walsall. You’d think, well, so what? Of course they did.",
      "When West Ham won the Conference League, only when they beat Fiorentina in the final did they play any side even vaguely near their resources. It was hailed as a great victory, but how great was it really? You wouldn’t think that if they won the FA Cup after only playing third or fourth-tier sides and then beat a top Championship side in the final.",
      "If money means anything at all, the Europa and Conference League final should always be between English clubs and if they were as good as is often claimed they are, probably the Champions League too.",
      "Part of the fun of football is not knowing the outcome of games but when fixtures are so imbalanced, you inevitably do. The argument for a separate European money league grows ever stronger the more the gap widens. You just want teams to have a decent chance and right now, that chance is diminishing every year.",
      "It’s not even just about the winners so much as just doing well. How does UEFA pass these tournaments off as proper competitions, because they’re not. Maybe they want them to harden around a few teams. Predictability attracts more investment after all, so the last thing they want is unpredictability.",
      "The Thursday night curse may have been lifted from Premier League clubs just at a time when the competitions are having their competitiveness undermined by grotesque financial imbalance."

      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton.",

Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place.

      "",
      "4) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.7\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his last five games.",
      "",
      "5) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",

That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",

      "",
      "10) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.3\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",

      "13) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.0\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine.

But he under-conceded v Liverpool to drag himself level for the season.",

Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",

      "Manchester City – three times (in 2013/14, 2018/19 and 2023/24)\nGames have been raised and pretend (and actual) cup finals won by all manner of Man Utd managers for and in this fixture, from Louis van Gaal to Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag and even Amorim. But Pep Guardiola has managed to overcome such ridiculousness a couple of times and Manuel Pellegrini needed those six points to help deliver a title.",

Then Fabian Hurzeler repeated the feat in just the worst campaign.",
      "",
      "Liverpool – two times (in 2013/14 and 2021/22)\nIt really should have been more, and indeed Liverpool will be frustrated to have completed more Premier League doubles in 21 attempts against Ferguson’s Man Utd than in 12 tries against the incompetent mess he left behind. Considering how generally excellent the Reds have been in that time it is especially curious that Jurgen Klopp could only do it as often as Brendan Rodgers – and that was against the risible combined efforts of Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick.",
      "",
      "West Ham – one time (in 2024/25)\nWhile many Hammers will still fondly remember the work of Alans Pardew and Curbishley in beating Man Utd 1-0 home and away to help secure Premier League safety in 2006/07, for many the double act of Julen and Graham will be the first taste of that particular double.

      "",
      "Newcastle – one time (in 2024/25)\nSo confident were Newcastle that the demons of Kevin Keegan could finally be exorcised that they trusted Jason Tindall to finish the job at St James’ Park.

      "Spurs – one time (in 2024/25)\nIn an abysmal and very possibly sack-worthy domestic season for Ange Postecoglou, almost one-fifth of his total league wins have come against Man Utd.

      "Arsenal – one time (in 2023/24)\nThe tide has only recently turned definitively in favour of Arsenal, who had waited so long to vanquish Man Utd that Emmanuel Adebayor and Thierry Henry were their heroes on the most recent such occasion. The roles were recast for Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard 17 years later.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace – one time (in 2023/24)\nHaving never beaten Manchester United twice in a league season, Palace made it look mightily easy when they followed up 1-0 win at Old Trafford in September with a proper paddling at Selhurst Park the following April. That was the Casemiro “leave the football before the football leaves you” game; it was an absolute humiliation.",
      "",
      "Swansea – one time (in 2014/15)\nPerhaps the most surprising side to take advantage of this hilariously embarrassing era to register their first league double over a club which must technically be described as Man Utd was Swansea. Their highest-ever Premier League finish of 8th was at least in some part supported by a couple of 2-1 wins, with Ki Sung-yueng scoring in both. The great man is still playing, and even being captained by Jesse Lingard at FC Seoul, no less.",

      "Man Utd will finish this season with a record-low Premier League points total and their most-ever defeats in the competition",
      "By Pete Gill and Ron Walker",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 18:11, UK",
      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and the top-flight is so great otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go.

      "Arsenal had two of their biggest tests of the season this week and how they close the gap to those two teams cannot be clearer now.",
      "Both matches started in the same vein - Arsenal came flying out of the blocks in both. Like in Paris on Wednesday night, the Gunners had multiple chances to open the scoring - most notably Bukayo Saka's from a free-kick - but they failed to take them. Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side ended the first half with the same number of shots as Liverpool, but they were two goals down. Liverpool took their chances while Arsenal didn't have the firepower. It hit the nail in the coffin that a new striker was needed.",
      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",

      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Monday 12 May 2025 10:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim insists Man Utd are \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\" after admitting to being “embarrassed” about his side's lack of urgency amid their Premier League struggles.",
      "United returned to earth with a bump three days after reaching the Europa League final as fellow strugglers West Ham secured their first Premier League win at Old Trafford since 2007.",
      "Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen scored in a 2-0 triumph that meant United have now lost an eye-watering 17 top-flight matches this term, with nine of them coming on home turf.",
      "Their latest meek performance infuriated Amorim, who says there is a \"lack of urgency in everything we do\" and a worrying mentality at a club sitting 16th in the standings.",
      "\"For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK', and 'we cannot change our position so much so it's OK',\" the United boss said.",
      "\"That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.\"",
      "Amorim said it is \"the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club\" - one that is without a league title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",
      "\"I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here. Everybody is thinking about the final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club.",
      "\"We have bigger things to think and we have to change a lot of things in the end of the season.\"",
      "Amorim then appeared to cast doubt over his own role at United he reiterated that United \"need to change a lot of things during the summer\" and acknowledged that could eventually lead to a change in the dugout, having overseen just six league wins since succeeding Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Asked how he changes the players' attitude given his struggles to do so, he said: \"I don't know, and I don't want to talk about players. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team.",
      "\"I have that feeling, we need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this.",
      "\"If we start like this, or if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.\"",
      "So poor have United been that he even suggested that Champions League qualification may be an issue.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I'm not concerned about the final,\" he said. \"It's by far the smallest problem in our club. We need to change something that is deeper than this.",
      "\"We are showing that in the end of this season that playing Premier League and Champions League for us is the moon, so we need to know that.",
      "\"I'm not concerned about the final. They (the players) will be focused and I don't know what is best, if it's playing Champions League or not. So, let's think about Chelsea to improve a lot of things.\"",
      "Man Utd deserve to be in a relegation scrap.",
      "If you take the three relegated clubs out of the equation, Manchester United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games.",
      "They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and top-flight is so great, otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go. If they lose both their remaining league games, they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",
      "Apart from the flashy feet of Amad Diallo, who got 80 minutes under his belt down the right-flank, this was another dispiriting afternoon for the locals. West Ham carried the greater attacking threat, were more robust without the ball and were clinical with their finishing.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Yet this team are one win away from playing Champions League football next season. Someone make it make sense."

      "Amad was the spark and he was denied by a smart save from Alphonse Areola, but the atmosphere soon went flat as West Ham, who were without win in eight league games themselves, took control.",
      "Mohammed Kudus was the standout player on the pitch and his drilled cross into the six-yard box was flicked in from close range by Tomas Soucek to give the visitors the lead.",
      "The problems continued to mount up for Man Utd in the second half as Leny Yoro was forced off through injury just 10 days before the Europa League final.",
      "The West Ham supporters were celebrating again soon after as Manuel Ugarte was caught in possession by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Kudus then exploded into space and the ball broke for Wan-Bissaka, who decided against shooting and played the ball across goal for Bowen to tap home at the far post.",
      "Man Utd tried to find a way back into the game and their best opportunity fell to Rasmus Hojlund, but the striker was brilliantly denied from close range by Areola at full stretch as the Hammers sealed a first league win since February.",

You can feel it at the beginning of the game. Between our box and opponent's box there is a lack of urgency. That is something we have to change in this club.",
      "\"I am responsible for that. It is frustrating because we are so near the goals. We have such a lack of urgency to protect our goal. This is week by week. We don't play so well in the Europa League but we have a different sense of urgency.",

      "Man Utd are winless in seven Premier League games (drawn two and lost five), their joint-longest ever run in the competition, also going seven without victory from September to November 1992.",
      "West Ham have completed only their fifth top-flight double over United, after 1926/27, 1928/29, 1976/77, and 2006/07. Indeed, this was the Hammers' first league win at Old Trafford since 2006/07, ending a run of 16 league trips there without a win (drawn three and lost 13).",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game.",
      "But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in to this team in the longer-term.",

      "Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch.",

      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",

      "\"Mason Mount, I am so happy for him, he is such a player. He works really hard. He has quality. I really like Kobbie Mainoo, just 10 minutes on the pitch, but everything he did was really good.",
      "\"Sometimes you are on the bench, but you change the game.",
      "\"It is hard to describe what it is like to be a manager in this kind of club. You want to give something to the fans, because we've been so disappointing in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"It is more important to give something to the fans, than to add something [to my CV] as a winner.\"",
      "Asked in the press conference about that final against Tottenham, Amorim said:",
      "\"The position of the coaches is quite similar. The context is different, but we are struggling, both of us. So I don't know what is going to happen. That is the good thing and the bad thing with this team, I never know.\"",
      "\"Games last 90 minutes,\" said Athletic coach Valverde. \"You have to be on it for 90 minutes, especially against teams that won't let you off. It was a wide scoreline.",
      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",
      "Tottenham await Manchester United in the Europa League final.",
      "It takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Man Utd beat Athletic Club 7-1 on aggregate in their Europa League semi-final to book their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21; Mason Mount scored twice, becoming the first United substitute to do so in a European knockout game since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 11:43, UK",
      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",
      "\"It was too long,\" he added, referring to his wait for a feeling like this on a big night.",
      "Mount, who had never scored at Old Trafford for United, became the first substitute at the club to score twice in a European knockout match since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",
      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He's a really good player and you can see both goals are really good goals. So I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, but also the team-mates, they were so happy for him.\"",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",
