      "Manchester United's summer transfer window has entered something of a holding pattern after missing out on Liam Delap. The Ipswich Town star had been their top target as they look to strengthen their options at striker.",
      "But the Englishman instead decided to join Chelsea, forcing the Red Devils to explore alternative options. One of those options is Viktor Gyokeres, though negotiations with Sporting Lisbon are proving to be more difficult than expected.",
      "Talk around the Swedish star has cooled as the window has progressed, with the player himself growing increasingly frustrated. Another alternative is Victor Osimhen, who had appeared set to join Galatasaray.",
      "But there still appears to be time for United to steal in and sign the Nigerian international. One move certainly not happening is one that would have taken Gianluigi Donnarumma to Old Trafford.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma has insisted he has no intention of leaving the French capital this summer. The Italian is entering the final year of his contract at the Parc des Princes.",
      "That had attracted the attention of United, who are looking to replace flop Andre Onana. But Donnarumma has now made it clear he wants to stay in Paris and is confident negotiations over a new contract will progress quickly.",
      "Victor Osimhen has emerged once again as a potential option for Manchester United as they search for a new striker. Napoli are keen to sell the Nigerian international this summer, with his contract entering its final year.",
      "The Serie A side are demanding a fee of £63million, putting off his suitors so far. Osimhen has already rejected a move to Al-Hilal and Gazzetta dello Sports now claim that he is instead 'dreaming' of playing in the Premier League.",
      "Osimhen's rejection of Al-Hilal has put United on red alert, with the Red Devils exploring a swap deal. Alejandro Garnacho is one potential option, while Joshua Zirkzee has also been floated as a potential makeweight.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres' frustration with Sporting Lisbon is growing, with the Portuguese side continuing to block a transfer deal. Gyokeres is a target for several sides, including United, after another stunning season for Sporting.",
      "But the Portuguese champions do not want to let him leave easily, prompting a rift to form. According to A Bola, Sporting agreed last summer that Gyokeres could leave for £53m this year.",
      "They have upped their asking price to £67m though, creating a 'rift' between the player and the club. Gyokeres is said to have made it clear to Sporting's chiefs that he wants to leave this summer, with the 27-year-old insisting he feels ready to make a leap up a level."

      "Former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag reportedly tried to stop the club signing Antony for £85million in 2022 despite previously working with the Brazilian at old club Ajax. However, it's claimed the club ignored him because they were worried Arsenal would swoop.",
      "Ten Hag bought two players with him from the Amsterdam club when he arrived three years ago, with Antony joining Lisandro Martinez, while fellow Dutchman Tyrell Malacia signing from Feyenoord. Last year he signed his old Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "But Antony in particular struggled to repay that huge transfer fee and was heavily criticised over his inconsistent performances. In his first two seasons in the Premier League, he managed five goals and three assists. This season, he failed to start a game in the top flight under Ten Hag before he was sacked in October.",
      "Things didn't improve under his successor Ruben Amorim, who sent him on loan to Real Betis in January and he now looks set to leave the club in the near future after a hugely successful spell with the La Liga side - which just added to questions of whether it was the Brazilian or the culture at Old Trafford that was the issue.",
      "Now it's claimed Ten Hag never wanted to bring Antony to United in the first place and attempted to pull the breaks on the transfer, despite previous suggestions he was key to the move happening.",
      "The claim also suggests United pushed through with the move after learning Arsenal were set to make an approach for the player - but Ten Hag still supported him and tried to help him during his time at the club.",
      "Kees Vos, the co-founder of Ten Hag's agency, wrote in the book 'Liverpool and the Dutch': \"Ten Hag and Vos were not in favour of this and wanted to stop the transfer.",
      "\"But the club wanted to push through at all costs, because Arsenal was also interested in Antony. The risk of a stronger competitor would be great. Ultimately, Manchester United paid almost €100million for Antony.",
      "\"Although Ten Hag did not support this transfer, it stuck with him throughout his entire time in Manchester that he took over the attacker from Ajax for this ill-fated amount, who was never able to fulfil his promise.\"",
      "Antony has been a much bigger success in La Liga, where he has scored nine goals and provided two assists and has become a much-loved member of the squad under new boss Manuel Pellegrini.",
      "Betis are hoping to sign him permanently this summer and Antony has previously spoken about how he has a smile on his face again after struggling with his mental health at United. In an emotional interview last month, Antony broke down in tears as he revealed he went days without eating and locked himself in his room.",
      "\"I went through difficult times [at United] when I no longer felt that pleasure. I even always told my brother, I told him that I couldn't take it anymore. [My brother] told me to hold on a little longer, that things were going to change. It even made me emotional, because they were very hard days for me.\"",

      "Stuart Dallas has said that Manchester United have been \"really, really poor\" this season, as the Red Devils lick their wounds from a devastating 2024/25 campaign. New boss Ruben Amorim was unable to turn the tide at Old Trafford after taking over from Erik ten Hag in November, guiding the club to a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League standings.",
      "While the Red Devils looked to save an otherwise catastrophic campaign via better performances in Europe, a 1-0 loss to a similarly struggling Tottenham Hotspur in last month's Europa League final only served as further embarrassment for the once-titans of English football.",
      "\"The two clubs together are so far down the league. Spurs have obviously been decimated with injuries. It's been really, really difficult for them.",
      "\"Their style of play, on their day when it clicks, they're a really, really good team. You can see what their DNA is, but Man Utd, on the other hand, I'm still yet to be convinced of what their actual DNA is. I don't see any change from a couple of things, but in general it's been really, really poor for them.\"",
      "Dallas also pondered whether a Europa League title was enough to argue that Spurs have had a successful season, given that the Lilywhites finished two places lower than United in the Premier League standings. He added: \"It's mad to think that they were both European finalists as well and Spurs have obviously come out on top.",
      "\"I don't know, is it a successful season for Tottenham? They've won the European Cup and they've got Champions League football. It's bragging rights over Arsenal.",
      "\"Arsenal have obviously had a fantastic season. They've come second, but they haven't won a Cup and they're in the Champions League. Spurs have won a Cup and are in the Champions League.\"",
      "Spurs are currently on the hunt for a new manager in the wake of parting ways with Ange Postecoglou earlier this month, with Brentford boss Thomas Frank looking increasingly likely to take tenure at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for 2025/26. Manchester United, meanwhile, are currently undergoing major revamps to their current squad with hopes that a summer transfer window and a full pre-season campaign can be a game-changer for Amorim.",

      "A crossroads stands before Manchester United in their hunt to sign Brentford talisman Bryan Mbeumo this summer. And with transfer funds not exactly flowing at Old Trafford right now, it could prove definitive for their other investments in the coming months.",
      "United's opening offer of £55million for the player was reportedly turned down by Brentford. And though another bid is believed to be imminent, Ruben Amorim's side would do well to take stock of their options before launching a follow-up.",
      "Despite finishing at an all-time low of 15th in the Premier League and failing to qualify for Europe next term, United at least have some cards in their hand. That's after The Athletic reported Mbeumo, who was keen to join a Champions League club, now has his heart set on a move to Old Trafford despite interest from the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle.",
      "That U-turn, after both those clubs were linked with Mbeumo in January, tilts the transfer battle in United's favour. Tottenham have also been mooted as a suitor amid talks that Thomas Frank is set to take over in north London, though murmurs suggest Mbeumo values the United cause above Spurs' upcoming European adventure.",
      "It's a similar sequence of events that saw Amorim land Wolves talisman Matheus Cunha in such swift fashion. The Brazil international was keen to play for United above all else next term, underlining United still have serious pulling power despite their absence from European competition next season.",
      "It's believed the Bees are seeking upwards of £60m to part ways with their player, an almighty fee considering United already shelled out £62.5m for Cunha. But if the Red Devils want their man they may just have to suck it up.",
      "Man United's second option is to finance the deal by parting ways with Alejandro Garnacho, which many might deem an inevitability already this summer.",
      "Argentinian newspaper Ole has suggested AC Milan have opened talks to sign Garnacho and are seeking a deal worth £50m. That's £15m short of United's supposed valuation of the player, though it may be enough to convince them, considering Amorim's difficult relationship with the 20-year-old.",
      "That sum also wouldn't quite cover the outlay required to recruit Mbeumo, who would come at a higher cost to the wage bill. However, it's a convenient route to offloading one troublesome asset while signing what would effectively be his replacement.",
      "Except Mbeumo plays almost exclusively on the right wing, while the majority of Garnacho's minutes are spent more centrally and on the left flank. It also poses the question as to what lies in store for Cunha and whether he's intended to start up front, behind the striker or out wide.",
      "Amad Diallo has just started coming into his own under Amorim, and he too operates almost solely off the right. After several years of overcoming injuries, managerial changes and loan spells away from Old Trafford, it would be a shame to see the 22-year-old's progress halted now.",
      "Yet United are in dire need of results now and can ill afford to bid their time on the hope of what may come down the line. In that sense, Mbeumo would be a proven Premier League upgrade based on what's been seen of the player in recent seasons.",
      "The Cameroon international finished this season with 20 goals and eight assists and appeared in each of Brentford's 38 league games. But he wouldn't be the first big investment to impress elsewhere before falling flat under the increased pressure at United.",
      "The Red Devils will be expected to fork out a heavy sum regardless of how Mbeumo arrives at the club. But the manner in which they balance the books could play a major role in how far the club can afford to invest elsewhere this summer."

The winger has been told to find a new club by boss Ruben Amorim.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has been urged to pick a move to Tottenham over Manchester United as the battle for his signature heats up. United are hoping to make the in-demand Brentford forward their next summer signing in a deal worth £60million after already capturing Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "However, Tottenham are understood to be attempting to lure Mbeumo to north London instead. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is expected to be appointed to replace Ange Postecoglou at Spurs next week.",
      "And it's understood that the Dane is eager to take Mbeumo with him, despite United holding extensive talks with the 25-year-old over a switch to Old Trafford. The Cameroon international now has a big decision to make, with the Red Devils ready to offer him a more lucrative deal, but Spurs holding the advantage of Champions League football and the potential of continuing to work with Frank.",
      "A former United goalkeeper has now weighed in on what Mbeumo's next move should be, and has surprisingly encouraged him to pick Tottenham. Ben Foster, who played for United between 2005 and 2010, believes Spurs have more potential for success under Frank next season and will help him to develop as a player.",
      "\"I would say that if you want to be part of something that's going to make you a better footballer and work hard and be part of a team, then go to Spurs with Thomas Frank,\" the ex-Wrexham shot-stopper said on his Fozcast podcast.",
      "\"If you are happy picking up your wages knowing that there's going to be an awful lot more pressure, a lot more eyes on you, a lot more judgement and failure is just part of what they do, then you'd go to Manchester United.\"",
      "Mbeumo has caught the eye of a number of Premier League teams after bagging 20 league goals over the past season. His seven assists were also important in helping Brentford finish in the top half, and a previous bid to sign him by Newcastle was rejected back in January.",
      "United have so far made two bids for Mbeumo, who is said to be open to a move, despite the club's poor start to life under Ruben Amorim. But a deal has yet to be struck with Brentford, potentially allowing Spurs to steal a march on their rivals.",
      "Foster has backed Mbeumo to have a big impact regardless of where he plays next season. The former England international made his prediction after praising his attitude.",
      "\"I'm not questioning Bryan Mbeumo about his ability, about his mentality or about what he's like as a person,\" Foster said. \"There's nothing to show me that I should have any worries about it. Whoever he goes and plays for, I think he would improve them and he gets into the starting line-up.",
      "\"He's got a proven record of being fit and scoring goals. He could get into pretty much all of the 20 Premier League teams and I think he starts, that's how good I think Bryan Mbeumo is.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a year left on his contract at Brentford with the option of an extra year. United's offer is said to be worth around £150,000-a-week for the player, rising to £200,000-a-week with add-ons, while Spurs are prepared to give him a basic package of around £130,000-a-week.",

      "Rabiot made 31 appearances in his first campaign with Marseille this season. He helped them secure a spot in next season's Champions League by finishing a distant second in Ligue 1 to his former side, Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Yet, Rabiot’s career could have taken a very different path both last year and once previously. In an interview with The Athletic, he revealed details surrounding his positive discussions with United on two occasions before ultimately deciding against a move to Old Trafford.",

      "Former Manchester United starlet Mason Greenwood has been praised by Marseille team-mate Adrien Rabiot. The Frenchman claims Greenwood could have been like Jude Bellingham in regards to stardom.",
      "Having emerged from the Red Devils' academy system, Bradford-born Greenwood swiftly made an impression under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and became the club's youngest European goalscorer at the age of just 17.",
      "In October 2022, Greenwood was charged with attempted rape, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and controlling and coersive behaviour. The UK's Crown Prosecution Service later discontinued these proceedings, and all charges were dropped in 2023.",
      "Greenwood was suspended by United after his arrest and was sent out on loan to Getafe that year. A year later, he made the permanent switch to Marseille. In Ligue 1, Greenwood has flourished, scoring 21 goals to tie with PSG's Ballon d'Or contender Ousmane Dembele atop the goal-scoring standings. Though some of his antics haven't gone down well with the club's fan base.",
      "His peer in France, Rabiot, has now claimed that Greenwood is an \"exceptional\" talent, and that he could have had a brand image like revered England and Real Madrid star Bellingham.",
      "\"Mason is an incredible player,\" Rabiot told The Athletic. \"If he hadn't had all of his problems, I think he'd have an image like (Jude) Bellingham. Mason would be the star.",
      "\"Because he's an exceptional player. He can score with his right foot and his left foot, he has an exceptional shot, and he can dribble. We're very lucky to have him. When he's really focused, he does really great things.\"",
      "Roberto De Zerbi's Marseille finished as distant Ligue 1 runners-up this season and have therefore qualified for the Champions League. Greenwood aided massively in these efforts, though it has been made clear that he has little chance of being named in an England squad again, having made his debut and sole appearance in 2020.",
      "Bellingham, the subject of Rabiot's comparison, however, is talismanic for his country at the age of 21, two years younger than former Red Devil Greenwood.",

      "Greenwood only kitted out once for England, in a 2020 UEFA Nations Legaue match against Iceland, and is therefore eligible to switch to the Reggae Boyz if he pleases.",
      "\"We are in contact all the time, with him [Greenwood] and his family,\" admitted Jamaica manager McLaren, who took up his current position in 2024. \"I am very confident he only wants to play for Jamaica. It is up to him when he moves forward with that. The ball is in his court.\"",

      "In the swirling vortex of the summer transfer window, few names are burning as brightly as Viktor Gyokeres at the moment. The Swedish striker – Sporting CP's goalscoring phenomenon – has become the subject of intense speculation, with several Premier League giants circling like hawks.",
      "Manchester United, under the stewardship of Gyokeres' former boss Ruben Amorim, have now emerged as frontrunners to secure the 27-year-old's signature, drawn by his prolific record of 97 goals in 102 appearances for the Portuguese champions.",
      "Arsenal, Chelsea and even Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have been linked, but it's a move to Old Trafford that looks likeliest as things stand, especially with the Gunners also focusing on Benjamin Sesko and Chelsea pushing for Hugo Ekitike, having already signed Liam Delap at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Gyokeres' frustration with Sporting has boiled over, with reports indicating the striker is 'furious' over a broken promise. He has an £84m release clause in his contract, though it's understood a gentlemen's agreement was made which would allow Gyokeres to leave this summer if an offer of around £60m was tabled.",
      "However, according to Portuguese outlet Record, Sporting are now reluctance to honour this deal, leaving Gyokeres feeling betrayed. The club, having signed him for £20m from Coventry City in 2023, now stand to make a significant profit, and are now demanding at least £67m.",
      "This, naturally, has sparked tension, with eagle-eyed fans noticing that Gyokeres has now removed all reference to Sporting from his Instagram bio. Though it must be said, he's also taken down mention of Sweden's national team and his sponsor, Nike.",
      "Sporting's revised asking price may shed light on why Arsenal – previously considered favourites to sign the Swede – have cooled their interest.",
      "Gyokeres is expected to demand a weekly salary exceeding £250,000. And when combined with substantial agent fees, any potential deal becomes a costly proposition.",
      "The additional £7m Sporting have tacked onto the transfer fee has only made the move more prohibitive, and may have sewn distrust among potential buyers. However, the ongoing tension between player and club could accelerate negotiations, giving United and others a chance to capitalise on the situation.",
      "In a bold move, Gyokeres has turned down a staggering £30m-a-year offer from Saudi club Al-Hilal, underscoring his ambition to compete at the highest level. The lucrative proposal, which would have made him one of the world's best-paid players, was rejected, with Gyokeres prioritising a move to one of Europe's top leagues instead.",
      "Al-Hilal, eager to sign a marquee striker, targeted Gyokeres after their high-profile pursuit of Victor Osimhen collapsed last week. Osimhen, like Gyokeres, is linked with multiple Premier League clubs and reportedly rejected a lucrative £650,000-per-week offer from the PIF-backed outfit.",
      "Their rejections signal a focus on sporting ambition over financial reward. That said, securing either player will still require substantial investment, and United must be ready to meet significant financial demands if they want to land a superstar forward this summer.",
      "United's pursuit of Gyokeres could have been finalised by now had the club qualified for the Champions League. Earlier this year, Amorim identified Gyokeres as his top attacking target and laid significant groundwork for the transfer.",
      "It's said the Swedish striker would have quickly agreed to join the Red Devils had they defeated Tottenham in the Europa League final to secure a Champions League spot. However, United's loss in Bilbao changed things. Fabrizio Romano reckoned a \"99% chance\", but as they prioritised Matheus Cunha, it has certainly never been that clear cut.",
      "Gyokeres is now weighing up his options. While he remains open to a move to Old Trafford, interest from overseas clubs like PSG, Juventus, and Barcelona could see him lured elsewhere.",
      "United are in frequent contact with Sporting and Gyokeres' representatives to negotiate a deal, but without Champions League football, their proposal could be less compelling than those of other clubs.",
      "Gyokeres' future remains a tantalising puzzle as the transfer window's first deadline approaches on Monday evening. United's hopes of luring him to Manchester will be buoyed by Amorim's close relationship with the player and the club's ambitious attacking overhaul, highlighted by the recent capture of Matheus Cunha and potential arrival of Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "However, a late twist remains possible. Arsenal could re-enter the race if their pursuit of Sesko falters and he takes the Al-Hilal cash, while whispers of interest from other Champions League clubs both domestic and overseas add uncertainty to United's chase.",
      "Gyokeres' next move will not only shape his career but could define the ambitions of whichever club secures his signature. For now, United hold the edge, but in football, nothing is certain until the ink dries."

      "Under Sam Allardyce, the midfielder showcased glimpses of his raw talent that had led many to label him as one of the country's most naturally gifted footballers. Now 32, Morrison's career has been a mix of brilliant individual moments and off-pitch mayhem.",
      "Talking on the Undr The Cosh podcast, the former Derby County player recounted how he found himself in hot water with Brady for driving to training without a full UK licence.",
      "\"So, obviously, I drove to training on a provisional license, and Karren Brady went mad. She went mad. I didn't do that again,\" Morrison said. \"Someone must have told her. Like, I had to apologise, pick up the keys, get someone to pick me up from the car.\"",
      "When quizzed if he’d bought said car before getting a proper licence, Morrison said: \"A provisional license. I didn't live that far from the training ground, so I thought I could just [drive to training] quick... but I didn't get away with it with Karren.\"",
      "Morrison revealed the reason he hadn't taken his test is that he struggles to navigate the theory section, claiming he wasn't \"the brightest\". However, he said he does have a Jamaican and Mexican licence - but not an English one.",
      "The one-time Manchester United prodigy often found himself in the limelight just as much for his extraordinary goals as well as controversial incidents off the field. Yet speaking to The Athletic in June, Morrison argued that the root cause of his issues was often simple errors such as oversleeping and missing training, challenging the more damaging rumours tied to his reputation.",

      "\"What I've found is that if you get a reputation early on, it can stick with you through life. Or it does with me, anyway.\"",
      "Morrison has struggled to settle in a career that has taken him to 15 different clubs since 2010. As well as spells in the UK with the likes of Birmingham City, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City, Morrison has been all over the world.",
      "He has played in Italy with Lazio, Mexico with Atlas, and also had stints with Swedish club Ostersund, Dutch outfit ADO Den Haag and MLS side DC United. However, he does have regrets.",
      "\"If I could go back in time I would change 90% of my life,\" Morrison said on Rio Ferdinand's Vibe with Five podcast in 2021. \"But you have to look forward, you can't think about the past too much.\"",
      "Morrison departed the Hammers in 2015 after making 24 appearances and scoring five goals, but has fondly recalled his stint in east London as an \"enjoyable\" one. \"If I had the opportunity I'd have stayed with West Ham all the way through,\" he said in February 2021."

At Molineux, the 24-year-old developed into a marauding wing-back and has now been snapped up by the Cityzens in a five-year deal worth £36m, with United missing out on their former target.",

      "Amorim, 40, managed a meagre seven wins out of 27 league games and subsequently missed out on European football qualification. Now, his relentless use of his preferred system has drawn criticism from Meulensteen.",
      "“I find it, in my personal opinion, a bit short-sighted in that respect,” Meulensteen said on the High Performance podcast. “I think if he worded it differently from the start, he would not have got hunted by it every single day because constantly the media will come back to him. ‘You’re losing again today, is it because of the system?’",
      "\"I think he should have said, 'Listen, I prefer a 3-4-3 system. I had a lot of success with it. I know it can work. I'm going to try to make it work at Manchester United. However, I need to have a look at the squad first. I need to look at how I can best use the players and utilise their strengths because that's what you need to do. And I need to get to know the Premier League and the opponents and everything.'",
      "\"There's so many variables that have an effect on whether that system is going to work or not,\" Meulensteen continued. \"So if he would have done that, he would have been more flexible in getting to grips with the size of the task anyway, never mind losing or winning games. Now, when you win games, things become easier, because you can get your message across easier.\"",
      "\"It is hard to say what kind of advice you would give him, because if he diverts from that, he sees it as a weakness,\" Meulensteen added. \"So that's why he's been, maybe, stubborn and stuck to it . 'I'm going to make it work, no matter what.'",
      "\"I don't think it would be a sign of weakness. He comes across a lot of times as very, very honest. Why couldn't you say, 'Listen I know I've said this. However, the experiences I've had over the last few months make me rethink and review. I genuinely believe that it is in the best interests of all of us–the team, the squad–-that I tweak a few things.'",
      "\"He has tweaked a few things, when he's played Garnacho in that number eight role on the left-hand side. He gave him the leeway to go to the wide areas because that's where Garnacho's strength is, and then run at people and come inside.",
      "\"I also do think that you never should stick yourself to one particular system, because a system is nothing else than a framework. How you're going to start the game. The moment the whistle goes, a 4-4-2 flows into a 4-3-3, a 2-4-4, however the game pans out. So that is not the most important thing.\"",
      "Regardless of whether Amorim makes a tactical switch or not, United are facing a crucial summer transfer window as they gear up for next season without the prospect of European football. The club have already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves and are targeting Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo."

      "The window is closing for six days to help the clubs that are competing in the Club World Cup, and talks will continue between the two clubs in that period.",
      "The player has indicated he prefers a move to Manchester and it's now down to United to negotiate a transfer fee with Brentford. The London club are in a relatively healthy financial position and have the option of another year in Mbeumo's contract, so they have bargaining power in discussions.",
      "Mbeumo will not be cheap, but there is a willingness on his behalf to leave and Brentford will not stand in his way should a fair transfer package be submitted by United.",
      "Tottenham closing in on the appointment of Thomas Frank could potentially complicate matters, as Frank has overseen Mbeumo's rise in England and the pair have a strong relationship.",
      "Spurs' decision to sack Ange Postecoglou and move for Frank has unsettled United fans, but there is no reason to panic at this stage because the player has given encouragement that he wants to sign for Ruben Amorim.",
      "It is also possible that Brentford could negotiate a clause in Frank's exit to ensure he cannot sign any of his former players for an agreed-upon period, to avoid some of Brentford's best players following him out of the exit door.",
      "Either way, United will be confident that they are in pole position to sign Mbeumo.",
      "United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle have been linked with the Cameroon international this summer, so the player indicating that he prefers a transfer to United was a significant development.",
      "How long it takes for another significant development with Mbeumo remains to be seen.",
      "United want a deal wrapped up as soon as possible so the forward can report for the beginning of pre-season, and they would like to complete the transfer before the end of the Premier League financial year with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) in mind.",
      "There is hope that Mbeumo will be a United player before the end of the month, and United will be delighted with their start to the transfer window if they can get a deal across the line by then.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo scored 35 goals between them in the Premier League last season, while United scored just 44 goals as a team, so they would strengthen a weak attack.",
      "United have made a strong start to the window, but there is still plenty of work to do."

      "The start of Manchester United's pre-season campaign will be here before we know it.",
      "United are scheduled to play the opening game of their pre-season programme on Saturday, July 19, facing Leeds United in Stockholm. They will then travel to the United States for their pre-season tour a few days later.",
      "United will play three games in the US, facing West Ham United, Everton and Bournemouth as part of the Premier League Summer Series. After returning to home soil, they will wrap up their pre-season schedule with a clash against Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "This will mark the third summer in a row that United have jetted off to the US for their pre-season tour. On the previous two, with the exception of just one game, United have been starved of an out-and-out centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived from Atalanta in August 2023 after United had returned from the US and he got injured in the opening game of last summer's pre-season tour, meaning he has not had a full pre-season since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He will desperately be hoping it is third time lucky for him this summer, although Inter Milan's interest in his signature could see him shipped out of Old Trafford before United board their flight to the US in the fourth week of July.",
      "With United prepared to sell any player this summer, they are unlikely to stand in the 22-year-old's way if an enticing offer is presented to them. He scored just ten goals in 2024/25 and patience with him is wearing increasingly thin.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, it is no secret by now that United are desperate to sign a striker. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen which direction that search will head in.",
      "They continue to be linked with the likes of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli, with both seemingly destined to move this summer, but no formal offers for a striker have yet been tabled by the Reds, with their focus currently on trying to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United have already strengthened their attack by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, and Mbeumo is likely to command a similar fee, but ending the summer without recruiting an out-and-out No.9 can't be an option.",
      "The transfer window will temporarily close at 7pm this evening (Tuesday), but will reopen again as soon as next Monday.",
      "Once the window reopens, United need to try and step up their efforts in the seller's market. They want exits to reach double figures this summer and they have a crop of players within their ranks they want to sell who could bring in useful fees.",
      "United have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales, while Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he can leave. Selling any player is an easier-said-than-done task, of course, but if United were to successfully offload the aforementioned quartet, they would be looking to bank over £100m.",
      "That would give them a huge boost in their quest to sign a striker. Gyokeres is set to cost north of £60m and he is currently looking as though he could be the most likely candidate to strengthen Ruben Amorim's front line.",
      "Whether it be Gyokeres or an alternative centre-forward, it would be ideal if United could get a deal wrapped up in time to take their new chief goalscorer on the pre-season tour. That adaptation period can be so crucial for players ahead of the competitive action kicking off in August.",
      "Getting a new striker in ahead of the season starting would give Amorim the opportunity to see how he bonds and forms on-field relationships with his new teammates. United were playing catch-up in 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee did not go on last summer's pre-season tour after being granted a period of leave following his participation at Euro 2024 with the Netherlands.",
      "With the Club World Cup taking place over the coming weeks, the summer break is bound to feel as though it is going that little bit quicker. It means the clock is ticking for United to secure their most important jigsaw piece."

      "The new Club World Cup format meant the window opened earlier than usual. It will reopen again next Monday and will remain open until September 1.",
      "United wasted no time in making their mark on this summer's window, announcing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves just 14 hours after the window had officially opened on June 1. He has arrived at Old Trafford after United activated his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Although no new arrivals are expected before Tuesday's deadline, that is not to say United's decision makers are going to spend the next few days with their feet up waiting for the window to reopen. In fact, they will be doing quite the opposite.",
      "United offered £45m up front and an additional £10m in add-ons. It is thought Brentford are holding out for a similar fee to the one United paid for Cunha, meaning it could take a fee in the region of £60m to reach an agreement.",
      "But if United are successful in their pursuit of the Cameroonian and successfully lure him to Old Trafford, the expectation is he will occupy the right-sided No.10 berth. Cunha is expected to operate from the left-sided No.10 role.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo and Cunha occupying the two spots reserved for the playmakers means both Bruno Fernandes and Amad are set to be deployed elsewhere. Fortunately, they are both versatile enough to play in the centre of midfield and at right wing-back respectively.",
      "United need to add goals to a blunt attack and Cunha and Mbeumo would do just that after scoring 35 goals between them in the Premier League in 2024/25. For context, United scored just 44.",
      "As fantastic and as exciting as it would be for United to add Mbeumo to the signing of Cunha, they are still without the No.9 they so desperately crave. United have been linked with plenty of strikers in recent months, but the one name that has not gone away at any point is that of Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "United's key to signing any elite-level striker this summer is via player sales. The prospect of them signing Mbeumo for around £60m before sanctioning any sales will almost certainly wipe out their entire budget.",
      "However, failing to sign a striker is a non-negotiable this summer. They are crying out for a reliable goalscorer and they simply have to buy one.",
      "In Gyokeres, United would be signing an established goal-getter whose numbers are just as eye-catching as Erling Haaland's have been in recent seasons. For all the talk about doing it in the Portuguese top flight, which, with respect, is not considered to be as demanding or as challenging as the Premier League, you can only judge a striker on his goals - and Gyokeres has scored a lot of them in the last two years.",
      "The prospect of United signing him and Mbeumo to join forces with Cunha in attack is exciting. Truthfully, it was fanciful only a few weeks ago.",
      "However, both Cunha and Mbeumo have expressed an eagerness to move to Old Trafford, highlighting the fact United still have plenty of pulling power.",
      "The midfield needs strengthening and there is a debate about whether Andre Onana should continue as the club's first-choice goalkeeper. However, right now, strengthening the attack is a far bigger priority. Three attacking signings could make the world of difference.",
      "United's dream XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Gyokeres."

      "In his first and only season at the Italian club, the Dane scored ten goals in 34 appearances across all competitions. It was a respectable return, but it was by no means eye-catching.",
      "However, United made the decision to pay £64million for his signature. The package could still rise to £72m.",
      "United, who had been interested in Harry Kane earlier in the window, were in desperate need of a striker and their search eventually led them to Hojlund. However, they bought potential rather than a finished product.",
      "He arrived at Old Trafford as an incredibly raw 20-year-old who suddenly had the weight of the world on his shoulders. He had been brought in to strengthen an attack that had been too reliant on Marcus Rashford in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "In truth, the jump from being a starting striker at Atalanta to being a starting striker at United was just too big for the Dane at such a young age. With the exception of the injury-prone Anthony Martial, Hojlund did not have anyone he could lean on for guidance or support.",
      "Despite that, he plundered a respectable 16 goals in his maiden season in England, and there was hope he would build on that tally in 2024/25. However, his performances regressed and he scored just ten goals, of which only four were netted in the Premier League.",
      "It further highlighted the feeling that Hojlund should have been signed to perform the role of United's secondary striker. Martial's injury record meant the Denmark international immediately had to step up and shoulder United's goalscoring burden.",

      "Since making that admission after United were beaten 1-0 by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge almost four weeks ago, United have learnt of interest from Inter Milan in Hojlund's signature. United are prepared to sell any player this summer and the striker is one of the more likely candidates to be moved on to raise funds for new additions.",
      "Whether Hojlund stays or goes, United desperately want to recruit a new No.9 this summer. Despite originally targeting Liam Delap, there is a need for them to recruit someone who is an established goalscorer and ready to hit the ground running.",

However, uncertainty surrounding his future at Parc des Princes has sparked interest from several top-tier clubs.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres' stance amid reported transfer interest from Manchester United has emerged.",
      "United could be set for a busy summer transfer window over the next few months, having already brought Matheus Cunha to Old Trafford. United agreed to pay the £62.5million release clause in the Brazilian's contract at Wolves to complete their first signing of the summer.",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo is also a target for United as Ruben Amorim and Co. look ahead to next season. Mbeumo may not be the only forward who United want to bring to the club this summer, though.",
      "Gyokeres has been linked with joining United for several months, with the rumours ramping up over the last few days. The Sporting Lisbon striker has also been mentioned as a potential target for Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea since the turn of the year.",
      "A fresh update has emerged in Portuguese news outlet Record about Gyokeres' future. The report claims that the striker is not happy with the Sporting hierarchy amid continued speculation about his future.",
      "It has been reported that Sporting are asking for a higher fee that what the club is said to have promised Gyokeres to allow the striker to leave this summer. The Sweden international has a €100million (£84million) release clause in his contract but has been reported to be available for €70million (£60million).",
      "However, it has now been suggested that Sporting are seeking a fee closer to €80million (£67.4million). This, the report claims, has made Gyokeres \"furious\" after the aforementioned agreement with the club.",
      "The report concludes by claiming that Sporting are yet to receive any bids from clubs interested in signing Gyokeres this summer. The striker enjoyed an impressive season in front of goal last term, finding the back of the net 54 times in 52 appearances and helping Sporting win the Primeira Liga title and the Taca de Portugal trophy."

      "Over the weekend, though, the transfer was thrown into some jeopardy when Spurs announced the sacking of Ange Postecoglou and Thomas Frank was quickly established as their preferred successor. It is understood that Tottenham were informed by Frank that he would want them to battle for Mbeumo should he be hired and Spurs agreed that this would be a good idea.",

      "They comfortably finished above the Reds and neither club could offer the Cameroonian talisman Champions League football. And yet, Mbeumo still favoured a move to Old Trafford and gave them priority to pursue him this summer.",
      "Clearly, the 25-year-old is not motivated by the short-term project nor does he feel like he needs to follow Frank to his next destination. Instead, he is motivated by the project at United and playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "This is not a case of when Antony wanted to follow Erik ten Hag from Ajax to United. Mbeumo wants to join because of the vision that Amorim is setting out for him and this is what gives the Reds a clear advantage over Spurs."

It was claimed that the Dane informed Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy that he would insist the club targets Mbeumo in the transfer window and the owner was on board with the idea.",
      "If Tottenham were to complete this deal for Mbeumo, they already have the perfect welcome gift for him. For his national team Cameroon, the 25-year-old wears the number 20 having worn number 19 for much of his time at Brentford.",
      "Spurs' current No.20, Fraser Forster, was confirmed to be leaving north London this summer when his contract expires meaning that shirt number would be available for the forward if he wished to take it. While United would not be able to offer Mbeumo the No.20 as it is currently occupied by Diogo Dalot, they could potentially go one better.",
      "The No.19 at Old Trafford is currently vacant having last been worn by Raphael Varane during the 2023/24 season. While his final decision is unlikely to be made based on available squad numbers, Mbeumo can at least rest easy that either his ideal shirt numbers are available at whichever club he moves to."

      "Having already secured Matheus Cunha's signature, some Manchester United supporters must have felt the need to pinch themselves after learning of Bryan Mbeumo's desire to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Just over 24 hours after United announced the £62.5million arrival of Cunha from Wolves, it emerged Mbeumo had informed Brentford's hierarchy of his eagerness to move to M16. United have since held talks with the Londoners and had a £55m offer turned down last week.",
      "However, discussions remain ongoing and United are expected to lodge a new and improved bid for the 25-year-old, who netted 20 Premier League goals for the Bees this season. It is thought Brentford will demand a similar fee to what the Reds paid for Cunha.",
      "Understandably, the prospect of Mbeumo being added to United's attack has increased the excitement levels among the fans.",
      "With that said, here are four reasons why signing Mbeumo would make such perfect sense for United and head coach Ruben Amorim:",
      "After turning to Italy for each of their last two attacking signings, it is nice to see United looking closer to home this summer. Cunha scored 15 goals in the league this season and Mbeumo netted 20, meaning they are well established in England's top flight.",
      "Since the beginning of the 2023/24 campaign, the duo have netted 56 Premier League goals between them, meaning they have established consistent records. Mbeumo, who has predominantly played out wide during his time at Brentford, has scored a respectable 42 goals in four Premier League seasons since the Bees were promoted in 2021.",
      "United last signed out-and-out attackers from Premier League counterparts on permanent deals in the 2017/18 season, swooping for Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez. At this particular juncture, United are much wiser to go for ready-made talents that are already proven in England.",
      "United's attack has lacked a multi-functional operator in recent seasons, meaning the prospect of Mbeumo arriving from west London would add another string to their bow. Traditionally a right-winger, he can also play through the middle as a No.9.",
      "In Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, the expectation is Mbeumo would operate as the right-sided No.10, operating close to the centre-forward United so desperately crave. However, the Cameroonian is also capable of playing as a striker himself, meaning he could operate centrally if asked to do so by Amorim.",
      "Furthermore, his power, pace and aggression mean he could play on the right flank as a wing-back. He is also renowned for his defensive work and willingness to track back.",
      "With the exception of Amad, United do not currently have another left-footed player who can realistically operate as one of the two No.10s, making the club's pursuit of Mbeumo all the more understandable. The Brentford man is renowned for drifting inside from the right.",
      "Amorim, last December, outlined his personal preference to have a left-footed player in the right-sided No.10 role, meaning it quickly became easy to understand why Amad was often tasked with playing in that role after initially being deployed at right wing-back after Amorim's appointment in November.",
      "Also hinting that Amad's long-term position could be at wing-back, it makes all the more sense for United to pursue Mbeumo's signature. He is a perfect fit for the role Amorim so desperately wants to strengthen.",
      "Most importantly, Mbeumo will add goals to United's blunt attack. The Reds scored just 44 goals in the Premier League this season, meaning they only managed to score 24 more as a collective than Mbeumo did on his own.",
      "Mbeumo has been a regular source of goals and assists in Brentford's attack since their promotion from the Championship four years ago, contributing 28 assists in addition to his 42 goals. Marcus Rashford (131) and Bruno Fernandes (113) are the only current United players with more direct goal involvements in the Premier League than Mbeumo (70).",
      "With that in mind, signing Mbeumo is a no-brainer. United need to inject goals, creativity and flair into their attack."

During the tour of Asia, Amorim admitted that he was not expecting huge amounts of business to be done due to the lack of Champions League football.",

      "What MEN Sport says: It appears that United are finally looking to address one of their most problems heading into next season. The lack of goals from centre-forwards this campaign was pitifull and it is no surprise to hear reports that Amorim is focusing efforts towards signing Gyokeres. We already know that the Swede fits Amorim's system perfectly and considering his sensational form this campaign, United would be mad not to look at the 27-year-old.",
      "It is understood that both Chelsea and Arsenal have made initial enquiries regarding the potential addition of Alejandro Garnacho to their squad. MEN Sport understands that United have informed Garnacho that he should seek a move away from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "TyC Sports reports that Garnacho's preference is to stay in the Premier League this summer.",
      "What MEN Sport says: When United told Garnacho that he could seek a move away in the summer transfer window, it is likely that their desire was for him to move abroad. Napoli and Bayer Leverkusen would have both been preferable options. The reality for United, especially if they want to spend considerable money on Gyokeres this summer, is that they will need to sell the likes of Garnacho to the highest bidder. In terms of the Argentine's case, a move to Chelsea or Arsenal would be more lucrative for United and as much as they won't like him going to a direct rival, at least they will get money to strengthen in the position that they want to."

      "8) Burnley – £35.22m\nLast season’s loans have been made permanent, with Bashir Humphreys the most expensive of the quartet. Now to persuade somebody not already in Burnley to sign for Burnley…",
      "",
      "7) West Ham – £35.4m\nPenny for the thoughts of Graham Potter, who inherited the ‘loan with obligation to buy’ deal that is Jean-Clair Todibo.",
      "",
      "6) Borussia Dortmund – £52.48m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could hey add Jason Sancho.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £58.5m\nThey have dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Welcome to the big time, Xabi Alonso.",

      "4) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £62.5m\nThey have completed the most expensive transfer of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo likely to follow. We’re not sure where all this money is coming from…",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £63m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves and a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and both feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and they are well on their way to making it a quadruple in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves."

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers.",
      "",
      "10) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Antony, Kenan Yildiz, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed has been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was electric at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "9) Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth)\nAfter racking up 11 goals and six assists in 37 Premier League games, Antoine Semenyo is a wanted man. He really does strike us as a future Tottenham Hotspur player, and with them back in the Champions League, the Ghanaian will surely be tempted – even more so if Daniel Levy swaps Ange Postecoglou for Andoni Iraola.",
      "Semenyo, still raw at 25, had a highly productive season. Bournemouth reportedly want £70million – which he’s definitely not worth. Fair enough for them to aim high, but thankfully for everyone’s sake, Manchester United can’t afford to get suckered in. Then again, they might lose the plot after Liam Delap chose Chelsea. Spurs are also reportedly keen.",
      "",
      "8) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "7) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. Actual Scott McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "Wages are the stumbling block. Only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "6) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nA free transfer makes Leroy Sane a very tasty proposition. He’s Prem-proven, which matters, but he hasn’t played in England since 2020 and is now 29 – just a year younger than a finished Raheem Sterling.",
      "He’s reportedly been offered to Spurs and Arsenal. Galatasaray and Fenerbahce have also reportedly offered the German big money. As a freebie, his wage demands will be monstrous, and he’ll want a long contract well into his twilight.",
      "But if you can stomach the wages, there’s no transfer fee, and he remains a brilliant addition for a top club.",
      "",
      "5) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund)\nA transfer to Chelsea looks extremely likely for the promising young winger, who scored 12 goals and provided five assists in 48 matches for Dortmund in 2024/25.",
      "The Blues want Gittens for the Club World Cup and are actively pursuing him, submitting a new €50m bid on Tuesday. If that fails, they won’t give up, and when the transfer window re-opens, they will surely land the 20-year-old – who has reportedly ‘ignored’ interest from Arsenal to pursue a move to west London.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked. Surprisingly, he wants to join the Red Devils over the other two clubs. Thomas Frank to Spurs could throw a spanner in the works, though…",
      "Newcastle need a right-winger despite Jacob Murphy’s freak season. Arsenal wouldn’t start him ahead of Bukayo Saka, but there’s a world where they co-exist, even if pushing either to the left isn’t ideal.",
      "Still, Mbeumo would improve any top side needing an X-factor.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nA £45m release clause for a player of Nico Williams’ talent is outrageous. But the full cost – including wages and bonuses – makes him an expensive project. Barcelona have walked away. Last summer, Arsenal and Chelsea didn’t bite the bullet.",
      "His Euro 2024 was electric, but five goals and five assists for Bilbao this past season didn’t boost his stock much. That said, the talent is unquestionable. He’s ready for a step up.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "His performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, seems expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club – and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",
      "Arsenal have been boosted in their pursuit of Rodrygo with everything pointing to the Brazilian leaving Real Madrid this summer, according to reports.",
      "Bayern want to keep Leroy Sane for the Club World Cup and have made PSG star Bradley Barcola their ‘top target’, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal will not be able to sign Real Madrid winger Rodrygo for €70m this summer as Florentino Perez wants more money, according to reports.",

      "These 10 Premier League players probably won’t be at the 2026 World Cup if they don’t move clubs in the summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace and France)\nThere’s not much more Mateta can do at Crystal Palace to prove to Didier Deschamps that he’s worthy of a place in his France squad. He did enough for Thierry Henry to include him in the Olympics squad last year – as one of the three over-23 players – after scoring 14 goals in the second half of the 2023/24 Premier League season.",
      "After another 14 goals – this time across the whole of 2024/25 – Mateta still isn’t in Deschamps’ thinking. It might take a move away from Palace to change that. Will Europa League exploits be enough? Manchester United could do a lot worse…",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Manchester City and England)\nIt’s not gone particularly well for Grealish at Man City, though he has plenty of winner’s medals from his four years in Manchester. His goal and assist numbers have consistently disappointed and his best – and debatably only successful – campaign on an individual level came in 2022/23, when he played a crucial role in the club’s historic Treble-winning season.",
      "His inclusion in Lee Carsley’s first England squad raised a few eyebrows and rightly so, but the winger justified the decision with a goal against the Republic of Ireland – a delicious narrative drawn up by football’s scriptwriters. But Thomas Tuchel has not picked Grealish in his first two squads and the ex-Aston Villa captain now has a lot of work to do to earn a World Cup place.",
      "There’s no question that Grealish has to leave City this summer. That’s not just for the sake of his international career, but his career full stop. Pep Guardiola’s rotation bingo can frustrate the best, and while injuries haven’t helped, his transformation under Pep has been for the worse. The exciting, direct, risk-taking Grealish we loved has been stripped away. A move would help him rediscover himself – and maybe a place on the plane.",
      "Is he joining Liverpool? No but…",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton and Brazil)\nIt doesn’t look like Pedro has much of a future at Brighton, with Chelsea reportedly interested in taking him off the Seagulls’ hands. A split seems inevitable after being left out of Fabian Hurzeler’s final two squads of the season following a training ground altercation (reportedly with Jan Paul van Hecke). Given he was the fall guy, we suspect Pedro was the one in the wrong.",
      "Brazil’s No.9 spot is wide open. New coach Carlo Ancelotti might prefer a winger through the middle – perhaps Rodrygo – but if he wants a more natural option, Pedro could still emerge as the go-to guy. The competition is Richarlison and Gabriel Jesus. Which says it all, really.",
      "Move to a bigger club, play more consistently, even just slightly up his game – and Pedro could be leading the line for Brazil next summer.",
      "",
      "Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United and Netherlands)\nHe’s only been at Old Trafford a year, but that’s more than enough time for anyone. United’s summer intentions are clear: improve in attack. That doesn’t bode well for Zirkzee, who’s a long shot for Ronald Koeman’s World Cup squad as things stand.",
      "Zirkzee clearly has technical ability, but he’s lacked the physicality and end product to thrive in the Premier League. There’s been talk of a Serie A return – even on loan – and with Matheus Cunha already in, Bryan Mbeumo likely to follow, and a proper No.9 on the agenda, minutes will be hard to come by. No one knows his best position and there’s no European football to help showcase himself either.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea and France)\nTalk of Nkunku leaving Chelsea isn’t new. Ending his Blues nightmare is essential to getting his career back on track and giving France another goalscoring option.",
      "Before moving to Stamford Bridge, he was one of Europe’s most highly rated forwards; he claimed 23 goals and nine assists in his final season at RB Leipzig after notching 35 goal contributions in the Bundesliga the year before. At Chelsea, he’s done well in the cups and Europe (11 goals in 15 games) but he’s barely started in the Premier League.",
      "Liam Delap’s arrival from Ipswich means even fewer minutes next season. Buying Nkunku is a risk, sure, but a calculated one. For the club, the player and for France, who could really do with Leipzig-era Nkunku in North America.",

      "",
      "Federico Chiesa (Liverpool and Italy)\nThere is no chance Chiesa makes it to the World Cup if 2025/26 is anything like his miserable debut season at Liverpool. Fourteen appearances. Four starts. Arne Slot’s side won the title at a canter and barely needed him.",
      "A serious knee injury after Euro 2020 prevented Chiesa from kicking on when he was being touted as one of the best wingers in the world. There was talk of a £100m move to the Premier League but he ended up joining Liverpool for around £12.5m in 2024.",
      "He’s now a shadow of his former self, and rotting on the bench helps nobody. Not him. Not Italy. He needs to accept defeat – urgently.",
      "",
      "Diogo Dalot (Manchester United and Portugal)\nDalot’s slipped down the pecking order at United following Erik ten Hag’s departure – not because of favouritism, but because he simply doesn’t suit Ruben Amorim’s three-at-the-back formation.",
      "His form has nosedived. There’s more room for improvement here than with most others on this list, but if he’s not trusted as a wing-back and can’t play centre-back, he’s going to spend a lot of time on the bench.",
      "United are open to selling anyone. They’d have flogged Bruno Fernandes if he’d been willing to move to Saudi Arabia. With a World Cup looming, this summer is pivotal for Dalot and friends.",
      "",
      "Niclas Fullkrug (West Ham and Germany)\nLike Pedro and Brazil, the No.9 spot is there for the taking for Germany. Kai Havertz is a shoo-in as things stand – and that’s not even his natural position. Then again, what is?",
      "West Ham’s 2024/25 season was a disaster. Fullkrug’s assessment of their “s**t” performances was the most entertainment they offered. The German needs service to score – and hasn’t had any. He didn’t adapt, and poor seasons from Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Paqueta and co. didn’t help.",
      "A swift return to the Bundesliga could be perfect. He scored 12 and assisted eight in 29 league games for Borussia Dortmund in 2023/24, and has 14 goals in 22 caps for Germany. If he stays at West Ham, the only justification for calling him up would be that goal record.",
      "",
      "Joe Gomez (Liverpool and England)\nGomez feels like a stellar squad player option for England, but even that might be out of reach if he spends another season doing next to nothing at Liverpool.",
      "It’s a surprise he hasn’t pushed for a move already. There’s no sign of him flying up Arne Slot’s defensive pecking order – not as a right-back, centre-back or left-back. That versatility makes him valuable for club and country. But not if no-one’s using it.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho (Manchester United and England)\nBack to square one, then? Where does Sancho go from here? A permanent exit from Manchester United is inevitable, but who’s going to take him?",
      "Swallowing his pride and moving to a West Ham or Crystal Palace might be his best option in the Premier League – they can offer European football, which United can’t. But it might be smarter to head abroad again. Borussia Dortmund gave him a lifeline and he repaid them by helping them reach a Champions League final. Maybe they’ll do him a favour again.",
      "Either way, Sancho needs to be playing regularly and impressively if he wants even a sniff of a World Cup return. Right now, he’s not even in the conversation.",

      "“I don’t think Gyokeres would be on £300,000 a week or more. So if Rashford and Sancho go they’ve got wage bill space to invest in these players, so that’s why if they bite the bullet on the transfer and agent fees, if they structure it in a way where they can start in the next financial year and get it on flexible instalments, it can be a way they can do that deal.”",

      "“That’s what happened in the last 48 hours over the weekend. From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",

      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo picking this abysmal version of Manchester United over Champions League teams has boggled minds but there is plenty of precedent.",
      "While Cunha has joined from Wolves with little competition for his signature, the revelation that Mbeumo wants to join Manchester United, a team which finished five places lower than the Brentford side for which he scored 20 Premier League goals last season, has confused many.",
      "Newcastle, Spurs and Arsenal were all linked with the Cameroonian forward but it is hardly the first time Manchester United have beaten Champions League clubs to a signing despite having no Champions League football to offer themselves. Plenty of other clubs have managed it too.",
      "",
      "10) Bruno Guimaraes\nThe spot could just as easily go to Alexander Isak, but Newcastle were at least on an obvious upward trajectory when they shattered their transfer record to sign the Swede from Real Sociedad in August 2022.",
      "The Magpies would qualify for the Champions League at the end of that season, with Isak’s goals a critical factor in helping transform Eddie Howe’s side. Yet it was Guimaraes who boarded the ship when the shore was a speck in the distance.",
      "Newcastle were in the relegation zone below Norwich when they somehow tempted Guimaraes to turn his back on long-term interest from Arsenal, the Brazilian having also popped up on radars at Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "“We are definitely going to be a club that is going to be a big power in world football,” said Guimaraes, and while it seems obvious in hindsight, in the exciting but uncertain post-takeover haze, it was far from guaranteed that Newcastle would embark on a revolution he helped kickstart.",
      "",
      "9) Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\nThings did not work out in a way that suited any party. The captain’s armband was stripped, the non-negotiables were ignored, backs were stabbed and the contract Arsenal were desperate for Aubameyang to sign after winning them the FA Cup was written off months early.",
      "Yet for a time there was talk of statues, proof of leadership, the glory of trophies and the scoring of more Premier League goals than Alexis Sanchez in fewer appearances than Philippe Senderos.",
      "It is a truly imperious record for Arsene Wenger’s last signing as a manager. A club-record fee was needed to extract Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund, the Gabon international departing as the Bundesliga’s Player of the Year in 2016 and Golden Boot winner of 2017. By the time it came to leaving Germany in January 2018, Arsenal were sixth in the Premier League and locked in the existential crisis that was their first year outside the Champions League since 2000.",
      "Aubameyang was supposed to be one of the building blocks placed in the foundation of Arsenal’s recovery; his removal ended up being part of the process in re-establishing their relevance as a force.",
      "",
      "8) Sadio Mane\n“If a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions,” Ruben Amorim told Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Jurgen Klopp ultimately put it best:",
      "“I always tell players if, when you are 35 or 36, you look back on your career and think about the one year you didn’t play Champions League, then you are really a poor boy. There are so many things you can do and reach if you go together with the team. You can qualify for the Champions League, play Champions League, maybe win it or whatever. That is a much more satisfying thing than all the rest. That is what I would say to players: ‘It is about pushing the train, not jumping on a running train.’ That is what we need here. If somebody says: ‘But you don’t play Champions League next year’, then goodbye and thank you, have fun next year wherever you will be. We will find players or we have players already that will go our way. That is not my way, that is the normal way for a club not playing in the Champions League.”",
      "The German did not have to worry about it often, only coaching two full Liverpool seasons outside Europe’s elite competition, but it was true. The Reds signed Sadio Mane 88 days later and Klopp secured one of the strongest pushers of his Champions League train in the process.",
      "Not only were the Reds out of Europe altogether in summer 2016, but they had finished two places below the Southampton side they were buying from. Mane bet not only on himself but the Klopp vision. A Premier League, Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup and Golden Boot suggests he was right.",
      "",
      "7) Moises Caicedo\nLiverpool supporters consumed dangerous and absurd levels of copium to come to terms with Caicedo’s decision to reject them in favour of joining Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "It was understandable to an extent. The Reds, managed by Jurgen Klopp, had just finished seven places higher than the Blues, who were a bastion of instability and player churn. The decision between the two seemed obvious once it was clear both were willing to make it worth Brighton’s trouble.",
      "But players tend not to glance at the most recent league table before making career calls. Caicedo took the most expensive step down in Premier League history and has played a considerable part in pulling Chelsea back up since.",
      "",
      "6) Leny Yoro\nReal Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool were among those linked but it was Manchester United who completed a genuine transfer coup in signing a player former sporting director Dan Ashworth described as “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”.",
      "Some will put that down to money, or more specifically the pressure selling club Lille reportedly applied on Yoro to take the more lucrative Manchester United offer.",
      "But for a Europa League club to capture such a coveted teenager was yet more proof of that unique allure Manchester United still possess. Yoro was seven when they had last won the title and still in nappies for their most recent Champions League crowning, yet Old Trafford still called.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Suarez\nWhile he would win the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, Suarez had only graced the competition proper in one season, scoring a solitary goal during the 2010/11 campaign in which Ajax exited at the group stage.",
      "He joined Liverpool later that season and by the time he had finally dragged them to European Cup qualification for the first time in half a decade in 2014, the Uruguayan forewent the fruits of his labour to rock up in Spain.",
      "Liverpool had finished seventh before Suarez joined, then sixth, eighth and seventh with him. But the forward was not tainted by those years of stagnation, scoring more than 50 goals. Among them were his efforts in the Europa League as Suarez netted four times in seven appearances in the 2012/13 season, which ended with him imploring Liverpool “to honour our agreement”, namely:",
      "“Last year I had the opportunity to move to a big European club and I stayed on the understanding that if we failed to qualify for the Champions League the following season I’d be allowed to go.”",
      "The Emirates was smoking to the tune of £1 but Suarez caught fire in 2013/14, rocketing Liverpool to a Premier League title tilt that faded in spectacular fashion for a runners-up medal. He left for Barcelona instead of sticking around long enough for Brendan Rodgers to put him on the bench at the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "4) Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nFrom his humble beginnings at Ajax in 2002/03 to the understated modesty that helped steer Paris Saint-Germain in 2015/16, Ibrahimovic did not miss a single Champions League campaign. He played at least six games in every season including and between those two quarter-final appearances, failing to score only when Igor Biscan belittled him in 2004/05.",
      "But it was neither injury nor under-performance that snapped that remarkable streak. Ibrahimovic instead vacated his seat at the European top table entirely of his own accord – by joining Manchester United.",
      "Louis van Gaal had sidestepped the first sign of the Pardpocalypse by quelling any Wembley dad dancing in the FA Cup final. The Dutchman also took Manchester United to within goal difference of the Champions League places but that was not enough and so Jose Mourinho was appointed. One of his first moves was to orchestrate the arrival of Ibrahimovic, who proceeded to talk the considerable talk while actually walking the quite brilliant walk.",
      "But the significant knee knack he suffered in the Europa League quarter-final meant he would play only one Champions League game for Manchester United. He holds the record of most different clubs represented in the European Cup at seven, even if his solitary match in the competition for the Red Devils was as a second-half substitute in defeat to Basel.",
      "",
      "3) N’Golo Kante\nA peculiar set of circumstances meant the £30m departure of the midfielder most vital to a Premier League title win for a team that had finished 10th passed by without much consternation or controversy.",
      "Leicester resigned themselves to the idea that Kante would be the first noteworthy cab off the King Power rank and Chelsea duly obliged after Arsenal pulled out of the running over seemingly extortionate agent fees.",
      "Kante thus had to wait until September 2017 for his first taste of the Champions League, missing out on Leicester’s journey to the quarter-final the previous year and instead busying himself winning a consecutive Premier League title. The Frenchman would claim his European Cup by 2021 as man of the match in the final, cementing a legacy of making up for lost time and receiving the ultimate award for what was quite the leap of faith five years previous.",
      "Chelsea were out of European competition completely but still signed the epitome of a Champions League calibre player as Kante called “the opportunity to work with Antonio Conte, a brilliant coach… simply too good to turn down”.",
      "It is unknown if he felt the same way about Frank Lampard.",
      "",
      "2) Angel di Maria\nHe was an ill fit, a ‘complete fanny’, the polar opposite to what his manager sought and emblematic of a period during which the club favoured style over substance in the transfer market. Manchester United made a loss on Di Maria less than a year after his purchase for good reason.",
      "But it was a monumental capture at the time, albeit a flexing of superficial muscles to stroke an ego bruised by one failed post-Sir Alex Ferguson season. Manchester United finished the 2013/14 campaign in seventh and under the caretaker guidance of Ryan Giggs; Di Maria ended it as man of the match in the Champions League final and leading assist provider in La Liga with 18, having scored in a Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona.",
      "The closest he ever got to playing European football for the Red Devils was the trip to lose 2-1 to Swansea in February 2015 before departing for Paris Saint-Germain that August.",
      "",
      "1) Paul Pogba\nThe world-record fee was used as a stick with which critics could relentlessly beat the haircut out of Pogba. His reign as the most expensive footballer ever lasted a solitary year before Neymar made the £89.3m Manchester United paid Juventus look like a Willian Prunier clean sheet bonus. Yet often forgotten is one of the many wrinkles in that deal: the pull of home, Mourinho or infuriating Graeme Souness on a weekly basis persuaded one of the best young players around to abandon a recent Champions League finalist and serial Serie A title winner for whatever state Van Gaal left Old Trafford in.",
      "It was believed at the time that Real Madrid were the favourites – proving one immutable transfer truth – but when Los Blancos withdrew from the race over money, it was time to dust off Stormzy for the unveiling.",
      "From December 2015 to September 2017, Manchester United’s last chapter in their estimable European Cup history was to bring on Nick Powell against Wolfsburg. In between, they spent more on a player than any team ever before. Pogba remains the last player to open the scoring in a winning continental final for the club, putting Ajax to the Europa League sword to ensure Champions League qualification for a club that finished seven points off fourth in his first season.",

      "Sporting paid about £8m to release Amorim from his Braga contract after just 13 games in charge in March 2020 and it was a masterstroke: he transformed the Lisbon club to the extent that they won two Primeira Liga crowns after an almost two-decade drought, while putting them on course for a third before his departure.",

      "Despite their awful season, INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have decided to stick with Amorim as they head into the summer and then next campaign.",

      "Sporting CP striker Gyokeres has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford, due to his connection with Amorim, but it was thought that he wouldn’t be interested in a move without Champions League football football.",
      "However, former CBS Sports journalist Ben Jacobs revealed on Thursday that the Sweden international is “very keen” on a transfer to Man Utd despite the lack of European football next term.",
      "Jacobs told The United Stand: “My understanding is that Viktor Gyokeres would be very keen on a move to Man United if they could pull that off, financially speaking.",
      "“I don’t think Gyokeres would be on £300,000 a week or more. So if Rashford and Sancho go they’ve got wage bill space to invest in these players, so that’s why if they bite the bullet on the transfer and agent fees, if they structure it in a way where they can start in the next financial year and get it on flexible instalments, it can be a way they can do that deal.”",
      "And now transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the latest on interest from Man Utd in Gyokeres with the Red Devils continuing talks over a deal.",
      "Romano told GiveMeSport: “Manchester United had more contacts with all parties involved in Gyokeres deal this week, to understand how the situation was developing for the Swedish striker.”",
      "He added: “It means Manchester United remain in the race and are currently informed on every step of the story, as they’re also aware of Italian clubs exploring the situation for Gyokeres.”",

      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 09:42, UK",
      "United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for the 27-year-old. Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",

      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",
      "Man Utd saw their opening bid of £55m rejected. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",

      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",
