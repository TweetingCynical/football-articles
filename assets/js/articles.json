      "Marcus Rashford says Frenkie de Jong has been helping him communicate to his new Barcelona team-mates. The former long-time Manchester United target's English-speaking skills were highlighted when Rashford opened up about his experience settling in at Barcelona.",
      "The forward was left out of United’s first-team training sessions during pre-season by head coach Ruben Amorim, after a falling out last December led to him being exiled from the squad and sent out on loan to Aston Villa until the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "The England international, 27, finally secured his dream move to Barcelona last month, albeit only on loan until the end of this campaign. Rashford has impressed for his new side in pre-season and appears to be settling in smoothly, registering a goal and two assists in four appearances for the reigning Spanish champions.",
      "Playing an important role in that process has been none other than Dutch midfielder De Jong, who once upon a time might have ended up at Old Trafford himself.",
      "Rashford was asked by Gary Lineker on the latest episode of The Rest Is Football podcast what the main language in the Barcelona dressing room is, having previously been Spanish and Catalan during Lineker’s time with the club in the late-1980s.",
      "Rashford began by saying: “It’s still Spanish, a lot of the lads speak Catalan, but the easy thing for me is that a lot of the lads understand English. So I’ve just been picking up on the basics on the pitch, which I think I’ve done quite quickly.”",
      "Rashford, who used Duolingo to improve his Spanish over the summer and has begun taking in-person lessons since his move to Catalonia, went on to explain De Jong’s role in helping him settle in.",
      "He added: “There are good people who are like a bridge. Frenkie [de Jong] speaks really good English, Jules [Kounde] speaks very good English, but they also have good Spanish because they’ve been here a few years.",
      "“But on the pitch, honestly it’s easier than what I thought it would be. Also football overall, I know a lot of people say it, but it’s a language in itself and it’s easy to communicate through the general vibe on the pitch.”",
      "De Jong during Erik ten Hag’s stint as United manager was frequently linked with the Red Devils, which may provide one explanation for his excellent English-speaking skills. Talks were reportedly held between the club and player in the summer of 2022 but De Jong was said to be reluctant due to United’s lack of Champions League football and his desire to remain in Barcelona.",
      "United and Barcelona reportedly even agreed an initial deal worth around £56million, indicating that the Spanish giants were willing to cash in on the midfielder, only for De Jong to refuse a move and United to bring in Casemiro instead.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest was sporadically mentioned the following year, with loose reports of some reignited interest. De Jong, whose current deal runs until 2026, shut down any further speculation this year by telling Sports Illustrated he hopes to renew his contract until 2029.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Liverpool have been tipped to retain their Premier League title by Opta's supercomputer with their algorithm giving the Reds a 28.5 per cent chance of going back-to-back for the first time.",
      "Arne Slot's side won the title relatively unchallenged last term and those on Merseyside and now hoping to claim successive Premier League crowns for the first time ever. Arsenal are backed to be their closest challengers.",
      "Unfortunately for the Gunners though they've been backed to finish second for a fourth season on the trot. Their likelihood of winning the title has been ranked at 24.3 per cent. In keeping with last season's table, Manchester City have been tipped to finish third.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side have invested in a bid to return back to the summit of English football, but the Catalan will go two years without a title for the first time in England if Opta is to be believed. They have an 18.8 per cent chance of success.",
      "Manchester United are hoping for a resurgence after a pre-season under Ruben Amorim and more than £200million of new signings, which includes Benjamin Sesko. However the Opta algorithm believes it will be another mid-table season for the Red Devils with 12th their predicted finish.",
      "At the other end of the table the concerning Premier League trend may continue. Opta's stats believe that Sunderland, Leeds and Burnley will all go straight back down with the Black Cats propping up the table. It would be the third year in successive all the promoted teams go back down.",
      "Wolves are the side tipped to struggle the most, but they will occupy the 17th spot so many teams covet. In fact their likelihood of relegation is just 7.3 per cent. Which is minimal when compared to Burnley (16.6), Leeds (17.8) and Sunderland (34.1).",
      "Chelsea are the team tipped to round out the top four. However the Blues hopes of becoming champions has been largely dismissed, given just an 8.4 per cent chance of finishing top which represents a major drop from the top three.",
      "Their London rivals Tottenham are eyeing a major rebuild under Thomas Frank but few strides are made on last season's difficult year. They remain behind the Red Devils with Opta handing them a finishing position of 14th - which is below Frank's former sider Brentford.",
      "Despite the wholesale changes and the loss of one of their best players the Bees are tipped to finish in tenth, which represents an impressive year given the loss of talent they have had to deal with.",
      "Nottingham Forest were the Premier League's surprise package but Opta has not backed them to replicate those lofty heights. European football could place more strain on their resources with a bottom half finish predicted.",
      "Crystal Palace are likely to be buoyed by the supercomputer's take on their season with the Eagles sat in seventh. That would likely mean European football once again as Oliver Glasner continues to take the club forward, albeit that may be dependent on them keeping their best players.",
      "Aston Villa and Newcastle remain part of the European picture, but there is a change to the order. Unai Emery's side nab fifth place, which could mean a return to the Champions League. The Magpies meanwhile drop to sixth which would be a blow.",

      "A statement on Tamworth’s social media account said: “Due to the medical situation, we are forced to abandon tonight’s fixture, details will be revealed in due course. We would like to wish safe travels to all the Man United fans, staff and players. We especially wish Sékou Koné a speedy recovery.”",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma's availability is also going to alert those at Old Trafford but rivals Manchester City too have acted to land the PSG goalkeeper, who is poised to leave the European champions.",
      "United's final weeks of the window could centre around getting a number of their big names off their books with Alejandro Garnacho and Antony still looking for new homes. Here's the latest from the red side of Manchester.",
      "Besiktas are hoping to complete a deal to sign United outcast Jadon Sancho after several of his other exit routes appear to have closed. Sancho spent last season on loan with Chelsea, but they turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, and despite agreeing terms with Fenerbahce and Juventus, those deals collapsed at the final hurdle.",
      "But Besiktas president Serdal Adali has come out and made his plans known after huge fan demand for his signature - a move that would also see Sancho reunite with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the man who bought him to Manchester.",
      "“Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too,” he told Turkiye Today. “What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here. Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.”",

      "Reports claim that a loan deal worth £5.2m - with a buy option of £38.8m - has been discussed with the Italian side. The Milan outfit would also cover the entirety of Hojlund's wages, making the deal even more appealing to United as they undergo a complete change in the final third.",
      "The 22-year-old Dane has been cast aside by Ruben Amorim towards the end of pre-season and the arrival of new striker Benjamin Sesko has pushed him even further down the pecking order. It was in Italy with Atalanta that Hojlund first made his name.",
      "Barcelona loanee hasn't been shy in speaking his mind about his parent club and claims the constant changing of manager's and strategies has been a major problem and urged them to stick by Amorim. A host of managers have been allowed to sign their own players to suit their own systems - and Marcus Rashford insists that has not been beneficial.",
      "He told The Rest is Football podcast: “To start a transition you have to make a plan and stick to it. This is where I speak about being realistic about what your situation is. We’ve had that many different managers, ideas and strategies in order to win that you end up in no man’s land.”",

      "\"I think the position he plays in on the pitch requires a lot of discipline, and we’re working on that discipline and decision-making. He is a really good player, but you can see tonight he’s had three, four or five shots and it’s like, there aren’t too many No.6s who are getting into the areas he is.",
      "\"You don’t want to stifle that completely, but if he’s not in the right area of the pitch, then it’s harder for the team to function and it’s harder for him to develop, so he’s working really hard through training and language support.\"",

      "Manchester United have been advised that they can secure a top-five finish by making one more crucial signing; Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. Ruben Amorim has been hard at work reshaping his squad this summer following a lacklustre first season in the Premier League.",
      "United's attacking prowess has been significantly enhanced with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Brighton star Carlos Baleba is also on United's radar as they aim to bolster their midfield options.",
      "However, Amorim still faces a conundrum in goal as he seeks to provide competition for current No. 1 keeper Andre Onana. The Cameroonian sat out United's pre-season due to a hamstring injury and was guilty of several high-profile blunders last term.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma has been touted as a potential addition at Old Trafford. However, French newspaper L'Equipe reports that an agreement has already been reached between him and local rivals Manchester City, with Pep Guardiola seemingly set to thwart any move to United, despite having already brought back James Trafford from Burnley this summer.",
      "Ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster has now urged his former club to refocus their attention on signing Villa's Martinez. A loan switch for the Argentinian was mentioned earlier in the transfer window, and was reportedly turned down by Villa.",
      "Foster reckons he could be the crucial component to help United secure a top-five finish this season, which would now guarantee them Champions League football for the subsequent campaign.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"United have got a better chance of doing it this year. I've loved United's transfer window. I think it's taken them and changed them from having another mid-table disappointment of a season to genuinely looking like competing alongside Newcastle and Villa.",
      "\"I think that if United get off to a good start, they can finish fifth this season. If they get another goalkeeper in, and if Emi Martinez has signed for Man United, they finish fifth this season.\"",
      "Martinez sparked concerns amongst Villa supporters that he was poised to depart the club after what seemed to be an emotional farewell at the conclusion of last season. As he left the pitch following the final home match of the campaign, he tearfully gestured to the fans before heading off the pitch.",
      "Villa are believed to have informed United that it would require an exceptional bid of around £40million to part with their first-choice keeper. Last month, The Athletic reported that the club would not be pursuing Martinez further due to the asking price and substantial wage demands.",
      "Meanwhile, former Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos has suggested that United should consider signing Inter Milan goalkeeper Yann Sommer.",
      "\"I think Yann Sommer is a very, very experienced player and a calming presence,\" Senderos told BoyleSports. \"He makes the defence better because of that presence.",
      "\"I can't really judge Andre Onana in this situation, but if United were to target Yann Sommer, I'd really believe he'd add invaluable experience.",
      "\"It's about how he is as a person, how he is on the pitch. He's a great character and amazing in what he brings to a defence. We've seen it with Inter Milan and Bayern Munich the year before.\"",

      "It has become apparent his new team-mates are doing their best to make himself feel at home. One star who has gone above and beyond is Leon, who gave up his first ever United shirt number to give it to the Slovenian international.",
      "Leon, who arrived shortly after Cunha from Paraguayan side Club Cerro Porteno, was initially given the No.30 shirt when he joined the club. After Sesko arrived, the young left back gave up his number - despite wearing it in friendlies against West Ham United and Bournemouth - so the forward can be handed his favourite shirt.",
      "For Leon, his move to United is a significant moment in his young career and it's likely his first United shirt will mean a lot to him. His decision to part with it and take the No.35 instead demonstrates his selflessness and ability to see the bigger picture.",
      "Sesko has worn the No.30 since 2020, when he was playing for RB Salzburg, before moving to RB Leipzig in the 2023-24 campaign. After his arrival on the red side of Manchester, he was paraded to jubilant United fans at Old Trafford, before his new side went on to draw 1-1 with Fiorentina.",
      "Shortly after securing his move, Sesko did not contain his excitement. He told the official Manchester United website: \"It's just a historical club that is unbelievable. For me, the team is great.",
      "\"It is getting better and better and that's why also there is just stuff that makes you come there, gives you this energy that you want to be part of. I think it's a great project, in general, and I can't wait to start, definitely.",

      "Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes are at odds over Manchester United's decision to splash out on Benjamin Sesko. Scholes fears the club is repeating past mistakes made with Rasmus Hojlund, but Ferdinand feels differently.",
      "The Slovenian international has officially put pen to paper on a five-year deal with the Red Devils after RB Leipzig accepted a bid of £66.4million plus £7.6m in add-ons. With a total package worth £74m, United pipped Newcastle to the post for Sesko's signature after the Magpies launched their bid earlier in July.",
      "Despite Newcastle offering the striker a more lucrative wage package than United, Ruben Amorim's project persuaded the 22-year-old to turn down the north east and the promise of Champions League football this season. However, United legend Scholes believes that Sesko may have made an error in choosing his former club. He fears the fans will scrutinise the young striker as they did previously with Hojlund.",
      "During The Overlap Fan Debate last week, the ex-United midfielder expressed his belief that Newcastle would have been a better place for young Sesko to develop. Scholes said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed – going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",
      "However, the former England international recognised the potential for future success at Old Trafford, but remained adamant in his belief that Sesko should have opted for Eddie Howe's side. He added: \"Which club are going to be successful first? Are Man United going to win the league before Newcastle – if they ever do? Of course they are.",
      "\"That's why he wants to go there, but I'm saying, from a United point of view, is it the best bit of business? I still think you're in the same boat as having Hojlund.\"",
      "Despite Scholes' reservations, another former United legend believes that Sesko arrives at the club with considerably more experience than Hojlund possessed in 2023. Ferdinand continued the debate on his YouTube channel, Rio Presents, protesting that Sesko will thrive in Manchester.",
      "Ferdinand said: \"Now we've got someone who's not as experienced but he's more experienced than Rasmus Hojlund. He's played probably almost double the amount of games as Hojlund when he came, he's two years older than what Rasmus Hojlund was when he signed.",
      "\"And he's shown that he can score goals. He hasn't gone and blitzed it and scored a ridiculous amount of goals, but he's a kid. He's young. Again, we can't expect that. I don't see him coming in and scoring 25 Premier League goals, or 20 Premier League goals.",
      "\"If he comes and scores between 10 and 15, I think that's an unbelievable return.\"",
      "When quizzed on why he believes Sesko will fare better at United than Hojlund has managed, Ferdinand added: \"Well, I think it's more hope at the moment. I think we've got to wait and see man. I think because you look at it and go, when Hojlund came and when Amorim came during the season, it's a new way of playing, a new style, a new environment.",
      "\"The manager was finding his feet and also you have a number nine finding his feet. So under Amorim, that's the way it's been for him [Rasmus]. So hopefully, there's a clearer picture, a clearer identity given the preseason that we've had.",
      "\"There's more goals, like I said, and players that understand the Premier League getting more experience up top, in the top end of the pitch. You'd like to think that counts for a lot going into the new season, to help a new number nine coming into the building.\"",
      "Whilst the two United icons might disagree over Sesko's potential impact at Old Trafford, the most crucial viewpoint belongs to the striker himself – and he certainly believes in his ability to restore glory to the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "In an interview with MUTV, the 22-year-old said: \"For me, the team is great. It is getting better and better and that's why also there is just stuff that makes you come there, gives you this energy that you want to be part of. I think it's a great project, in general, and I can't wait to start, definitely.",
      "\"I've just been here for a couple of hours and it's already been amazing. I can already feel that we're going to be a great family and it is a pleasure to be part of it.",
      "\"It feels good, you know, the thing is it [the badge] fits well and I'm looking forward to just playing in it a lot and try to represent in the good ways possible.\"",
      "With speculation surrounding his future at United, current number nine Hojlund previously insisted he will fight for his place in the squad.",
      "During the recent pre-season tour in America, the Danish striker said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Since then, however, it appears that Hojlund has warmed to the idea of a move to AC Milan. Only time will tell if he'll be giving Sesko a run for his money in the squad this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all arrived at Old Trafford to bolster Amorim's squad, and Silvestre, who made over 350 appearances for the Red Devils, believes his job could be in danger should they enter crisis mode after a poor start.",
      "\"I don't think [Ruben] Amorim is under any more pressure than any other manager in the Premier League, to be honest,\" Silvestre exclusively told Ladbrokes.",
      "\"I think they're all under pressure, it's just that he's at Manchester United, and they've now spent a lot of money. It's the size of the club, coupled with the interest from the media which makes it feel like there's more pressure there.",
      "\"There might be some pressure from the owners this season, but I would say that's the same with every other club. Amorim will go into this season under the same amount of pressure as every other manager; it's a fresh start.",
      "\"But, if you start losing three games in a row, and find yourself in that kind of form, that's when the crisis will start. That's when there's real pressure. For now, everyone is on zero points, they should all be treated the same and everyone will be judged against their objectives for the season.\"",
      "On the back of some promising transfer activity, Silvestre thinks the aim for United this season should be European football, but perhaps not the Champions League.",
      "\"As for my expectations of the club this season, they need to be qualifying for Europe,\" he continued. \"The Champions League isn't necessarily the target, but European football of any kind definitely is.",
      "\"Of course, everyone will always talk about the Champions League, but I just think that given the lack of consistency last season, I'm sceptical about their chances on that front.\"",

      "\"As for where they finish in the table, I'd say maybe sixth or seventh? I don't see them in the top four or five,\" declared the Frenchman. \"It's crazy saying that, to be honest. It just sounds so unfamiliar when we're talking about Manchester United, but that's the position the club is in right now, unfortunately.",
      "\"You know, you've got to be realistic about what the team has been achieving in recent years. OK, there are new players in place now, and a completely new dynamic. But in terms of dominating other teams and getting consistency, there are still a lot of question marks, in my opinion.\"",

      "Manchester United have forced 'hurt' Barcelona to alter their transfer plans by completing the signing of Benjamin Sesko for £74million. Sesko, 22, joined the Red Devils last week on a five-year contract, keeping him at Old Trafford until 2030.",
      "The Slovenian is considered one of the best young strikers in Europe, having spent the last two seasons developing with RB Leipzig. Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for the German club, proving himself in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League.",
      "Amid their search for a new striker, United made him their top target and beat Newcastle in a fiercely-contested race for his signature. But it turns out that Newcastle weren't the only ones to miss out.",
      "Barcelona were in fact considering a move for Sesko next summer. Catalan outlet Sport claim that Barca's management are particularly hurt by the 22-year-old's switch to Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko is highly rated by Barcelona sporting director Deco, who's working on a signing a successor to Robert Lewandowski in the summer of 2026. Lewandowski, who turns 37 later this month, has entered the final year of his contract with Barca and is likely to leave at the end of this season.",
      "Barcelona chiefs were well aware that Sesko wasn't guaranteed to remain at Leipzig for another year, so they weren't taken by surprise when United swooped. It's added that the La Liga chiefs weren't in a position to challenge the Red Devils for his signature due to their well-documented financial woes.",
      "Now Barca will focus on alternative targets, having previously been linked with Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez, Newcastle's Alexander Isak - who could also be changing clubs this summer - and Manchester City superstar Erling Haaland, who signed a mammoth 10-year contract extension in January.",
      "Haaland is reportedly Barcelona president Joan Laporta's dream signing, telling TV3 in May: \"Nothing is impossible. But we're not thinking about that right now. He also just signed a new contract.\"",
      "Who should Barcelona target as an alternative? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "The Blaugrana head into the new campaign with Lewandowski as their only recognised No.9. The Pole will miss Saturday's opening game against Mallorca due to injury, leaving the door open for Marcus Rashford, Ferran Torres or Dani Olmo to fill the void.",
      "Rashford is on loan from United, who've given Barca the option to sign him permanently for £26m at the end of the season. Torres was an able deputy last term, scoring 19 goals.",

      "He was linked with moves to Manchester United and Newcastle, but nothing materialised. Calvert-Lewin reportedly took the step of dismissing his agent to speed up the process and he now appears to have found a new home at Leeds.",
      "The Athletic reports that he has agreed terms in principle with the newly-promoted Premier League side and will undergo a medical. His lack of an agent will mean that Calvert-Lewin will be leading negotiations himself with Leeds, where he will compete with Joel Piroe and Lukas Nmecha for a place in Daniel Farke’s side.",
      "He was offered a new contract by Everton last summer, but an agreement was never reached and, after another difficult campaign, the two parted company on good terms. “This isn’t something I chose lightly,” he said after leaving.",
      "“Everton has been my home since I was 19 years old. It’s the place that saw potential in me, challenged me to grow, and shaped me both as a footballer and as a man.”",
      "His move to Leeds will please Rio Ferdinand, who had been baffled when the Red Devils were linked with a move for the striker, who has four goals in 11 appearances for England. Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, he said: “Dominic Calvert-Lewin cannot stay fit. Why are you bringing him into this club?",
      "“This club is built on the academy. You have Chido Obi just sitting there. Play him if you're going to think about five or six games. Not somebody who is older and cannot stay fit.” United have since signed Benjamin Sesko, in a £74million deal from RB Leipzig, to play alongside Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The major black mark against Calvert-Lewin has always been his injury record. He played just 26 times for Everton, scoring three times, last season and David Moyes admitted that his difficulties in staying fit were the main reason behind his departure.",
      "“I'll make the final decision, but Dom has to show us he's robust and can be fit to play,” he said in May. “Undoubtedly he's got qualities other strikers don't have, and he has to show us all when he gets the opportunities that he'll take it. We need him to be ready to train, play, be competitive in more games than he's been available for.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United were warned about splashing the cash on under-fire forward Rasmus Hojlund before they parted with £72million for the striker in August 2023. After a promising debut season, Hojlund has struggled at Old Trafford.",
      "The recent arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, in a deal worth £74m, has now also increased the competition for the young Dane in United's forward areas. Hojlund, 22, appears to have had a change of heart on his future too, despite claiming he would stay and fight for his place at United earlier on in the summer, with AC Milan now linked with a swoop.",
      "However, United could have avoided paying over the odds for a player that was once targeted by club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe for underperforming. According to The Telegraph, United’s data financial modelling claimed that Hojlund, who was playing for Atalanta in Serie A at the time, was actually worth £50m.",
      "Regardless, United chiefs stormed ahead with the move, paying £22m more than was recommended for the striker. Hojlund has since seen his valuation drop rapidly. The Denmark international, who has scored 26 goals in 95 games for the club, is now valued at around £30m by United.",
      "Not only did United's own data team warn about signing Hojlund, but his own manager at Atalanta, Gian Piero Gasperini, claimed the move to Old Trafford was coming too soon for Hojlund.",
      "The current Roma boss helped Hojlund become a force to be reckoned with in Bergamo, with the youngster scoring 10 goals and providing four assists in 34 games. But he harboured doubts on Hojlund continuing his development at United.",
      "\"I think so (Hojlund should stay one more season),\" the 67-year-old said. \"Then after that it’s difficult. He undoubtedly has great talent, but also great room for improvement. These things are visible in both senses, he must work to improve because he has the characteristics to become one of the strongest strikers in the world.”",
      "Gasperini's concerns were echoed by two top scouts as former United boss Erik ten Hag circled a move for the player. One said: \"He’s still unproven and the Premier League is a very unforgiving place especially if you’re in a Manchester United shirt.",
      "\"He’s left-footed, strong and powerful so inevitably there will be some comparisons with [Erling] Haaland but he’s not in his league. Haaland is a generational talent. Hojlund’s stats don’t come anywhere near Haaland and his finishing can be erratic.\"",
      "Hojlund is only two years into a five-year deal at United but the club decided earlier this year to cash in if they recruited a new centre forward, something they have now done with Sesko. United had hoped to offload Hojlund on a permanent deal this summer, but Milan are seeking to bring him on loan to the San Siro.",
      "Hojlund was an unused substitute in United's pre-season 1-1 draw with Fiorentina, which actually marked the first time he did not appear in any of United's five pre-season matches this summer.",
      "Yet sources close to Hojlund felt he would have to leave United should they bolster their forward line with Sesko. Ruben Amorim has also refused to give assurances that the player would stay, suggesting Hojlund's time at Old Trafford now looks to be coming to an end.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The recruitment team at Manchester United has been given a boost by the arrival of a key former ally to Lewis Hamilton. Michael Sansoni spent more than a decade working in Formula 1 for the Mercedes team and contributed to eight team's championships and six of the seven titles won by Brit Hamilton.",
      "An enormous amount of data is collected and analysed at every single F1 race and Sansoni has a wealth of experience when it comes to deciphering it. During his time at Mercedes, he rose to the position of performance engineer working specifically with Hamilton.",
      "But he left the team, which is one-third owned by Jim Ratcliffe through is INEOS petrochemicals company, earlier this year for a move to the British billionaire's flagship investment. Sansoni has been confirmed as the club's new director of data.",
      "\"Reporting to Omar Berrada, chief executive, Sansoni will be responsible for transforming the club's capabilities in data and artificial intelligence, drawing on his experience in machine learning and advanced modelling in Formula 1,\" a club statement read.",

To support these objectives, further recruitment is planned into a number of data, software and platform engineering roles in the coming months, as Sansoni builds out his team.\"",
      "And it seems their new recruit has begun in earnest. In a post on social media site LinkedIn, Sansoni suggested that two of Man United's major summer signings so far, forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo who cost the Old Trafford club a combined £133.5million, were identified as a result of his data-led efforts.",
      "He wrote: \"I am very lucky to have had not just one, but two dream jobs. After a phenomenal time in Formula 1, it is a privilege to now be part of the biggest club in world football.",

      "Man United have also added Benjamin Sesko this summer, signing the striker from Bundesliga club RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74m. And they have been heavily linked with a swoop for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba who would also command a significant transfer fee, should the Seagulls be willing to sell.",

      "Alexander Isak and Newcastle United have reached a bitter stalemate as the star striker pushes for an exit. But the Swede's career could have panned out differently if he had left former employers Real Sociedad for another Premier League heavyweight three years ago.",
      "The 25-year-old made his feelings known last month when he told the Magpies he wanted to leave, and after Liverpool saw a £110million bid rejected for him, neither party has budged. Eddie Howe's side remain adamant he is not for sale and will don a Newcastle shirt this season, while the player is said to be refusing to play for the club again.",
      "Having caught Borussia Dortmund's eye whilst playing in his native Sweden, Isak signed for the German side but left for Spain in 2019 after finding minutes hard to come by. With Sociedad, he became one of La Liga's most revered strikers, leaving many top sides vying for his signature. One of those interested parties was Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.",
      "Speaking in 2024, years after Isak made his Newcastle switch, Guardiola admitted: \"At Real Sociedad, we started to follow him, we were impressed. He was a target. With his skills, all the clubs around the world take a look. I think he adapted really, really well in the Premier League.\"",
      "City's reason for not pursuing Isak more vigorously? Erling Haaland. The Athletic reported in the summer of 2022 that the Norwegian was Guardiola's priority No. 1, ahead of Isak, and Haaland's arrival even persuaded him to pen a new contract with the club.",
      "The Spaniard got his way as Haaland's £51m Dortmund release clause was met that July, and he has become a two-time Premier League Golden Boot winner, scoring 85 league goals since 2022, to the 54 of Isak, who arrived in England a few months after him.",
      "City were reportedly not the only club in Manchester to admire Isak, as rivals Manchester United were claimed to have submitted a 'juicy offer' to the Swede that summer.",
      "Mundo Deportivo reported that before Isak completed his £63m move to Newcastle, the Red Devils, then led by Erik ten Hag, were in touch with his representatives, who persuaded the striker to decline their advances.",
      "Sociedad never received a bid from United for Isak, and having lost out on his signature, Ten Hag began his first season in charge with Cristiano Ronaldo leading the line, though that infamously only lasted until November.",
      "Arsenal were yet another club that had Isak on their radar before he signed for the Magpies, and they perhaps came the closest to securing his signature with an informal offer.",
      "The Gunners sought to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang up front and saw Isak as the ideal recruit. However, when approaching him in January 2022, they encountered some discrepancies regarding the Swede's price tag.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side tabled an informal £56m offer, which was far lower than Sociedad's estimations, as they were sticking to Isak's £74.7m release clause. The Athletic reported that this fee was just too much for Arsenal, who saw him as 'overpriced,' and Isak ended up at St. James' Park the following summer while continuing to be monitored by the Gunners.",
      "A fee of £75m would now be considered a bargain for Isak, who, after Liverpool's £120m bid was rejected, is thought to be valued at a potential British record transfer sum of £150m by Newcastle.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Harry Maguire admits he was gutted to lose the Manchester United captaincy - but was thrilled Bruno Fernandes was the one given the armband.",
      "In January 2020, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer named Maguire Red Devils captain, a matter of months after his £80million move from Leicester City. His turbulent reign as skipper, which saw him face enormous levels of criticism as United struggled under Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, ended in 2023, when Erik ten Hag stripped him of the captaincy.",
      "The ex-United boss handed the armband to Fernandes, who continues to wear it to this day. While Maguire admitted he was heartbroken to lose the honour, he wanted to do everything he could to help his Portuguese team-mate.",
      "Speaking on 'Rio Ferdinand Presents', Maguire said: \"When I was captain, Bruno gave me his full support. I leant on Bruno a lot to be honest.",
      "\"Whenever I had decisions to make, I had people around me like (David) De Gea, Bruno and Nemanja (Matic). I had good experienced pros there and I always leant on them. I built a good relationship with Bruno when I was captain.",
      "\"Obviously, Erik decided to change the captaincy because I was not playing in that first season. I really wanted it to go to Bruno if I’m being honest and I told Bruno the same. He came up to me and I spoke to him. I said, 'Look, congratulations.'\"",
      "When the legendary United defender pushed Maguire to offer an insight into the conversation between him and Ten Hag, the 64-cap England international said: \"It was a sticky conversation. The season before, I just didn’t feel as important to the club as I did under Ole.",
      "\"I think if you're the captain, you need to feel important, you need to have the backing of the manager, you need to have the backing of all the team. If you don't it doesn't work.",
      "\"Bruno was Erik's guy. Bruno is a great leader. Like I said to Bruno, I said, 'If I have to give it away to anyone - and I didn't want to give it away to anyone - he'd be the man I would want to take this club forward.'",

      "\"There's a lot of players in this game who obviously play for themselves, rightly so it takes them far. But there's also a lot of players who care about the team and making other people better and making young lads come through, feel comfortable and Bruno is one of those.\"",

Last season was shambolic for the Reds, who finished 15th and put in a lacklustre performance in their Europa League final defeat by Tottenham.",
      "While Amorim has mainly focused on bolstering his frontline with the acquisitions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, Maguire looks set to play an important role in the Portuguese boss's defence. He will be contending with Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui for a place in Amorim's three-man backline.",

      "Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford is expected to mark the birth of Manchester United's new front line.",
      "After finishing last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10, United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings in this summer's transfer window.",
      "United set their stall out on the opening day of the window, announcing they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha, triggering his £62.5million release clause. The deal was officially finalised 12 days later.",
      "United, following an extensive period of negotiating, went on to secure their second attacking signing of the summer, bringing in Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Like Cunha, the Cameroonian had his heart set on a move to Old Trafford, but the lack of a release clause in his Bees contract meant the deal was much more complex.",
      "Eventually, an offer of £65m plus £6m in add-ons was enough to extract him from the Gtech Community Stadium. He scored 20 Premier League goals last season and was one of the best players in the division.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The additions of Cunha and Mbeumo prior to the pre-season tour of the United States represented a fantastic start to the summer for United. The duo scored 37 goals between them last term, including 35 in the league.",
      "However, United were still without a much-needed centre-forward. Step forward, Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Less than a week after United completed their tour of the United States with a 2-2 draw against Everton in Atlanta, Sesko was unveiled to the fans at Old Trafford ahead of last Saturday's pre-season finale against Fiorentina.",
      "The Slovenian has joined United from German outfit RB Leipzig for an initial fee of £66.4m after scoring 21 goals in all competitions last season. He will succeed Rasmus Hojlund and become United's leading frontman.",
      "Hojlund, who could leave the club before the end of this summer's transfer window, joined United from Atalanta in August 2023 and has scored just 26 goals in 95 games for the Reds. United need Sesko to deliver the goods at a higher rate than that.",
      "Poised to spearhead an attack that will also feature Mbeumo and Cunha, Sesko should be confident about his chances. However, he will find himself under levels of pressure he has never previously experienced.",
      "The No.9 spot at United is one of the most scrutinised positions in world football, meaning he will be under enormous pressure to hit the ground running. But with the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Cunha, Mbeumo and Amad buzzing around him, the supply line should be productive.",
      "After scoring 21 goals for Leipzig last season, United will dream of seeing him score 20 goals in his first season at Old Trafford. Hitting the 20-goal mark would be a fantastic achievement.",
      "First and foremost, Sesko's first priority has to be reaching double figures as quickly as possible. United have signed him to score goals and ensure they are more prolific in front of goal.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are poised to play just behind him and they will also share ambitions of reaching double figures. However, just like Sesko, they are also going to experience a whole new level of pressure at Old Trafford in comparison to what they have been used to previously.",
      "With no European football on the agenda this season, the Premier League will be United's bread and butter. They need to atone for last season's struggles and make a push for European qualification for 2026/27.",
      "With a front three of Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko, United will believe they have the tools to do so. The last time United had three players reach double figures in a Premier League campaign was when Edinson Cavani (10), Marcus Rashford (11) and Fernandes (18) consistently delivered the goods in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "By contrast, nobody reached double figures for United in the Premier League last season; Fernandes and Amad were their joint-top league scorers with eight.",
      "Accounting for the increase in expectations and all of the other caveats that come with a first season at a new club, if United reach the end of the 2025/26 season having watched Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko reach double figures for league goals, it will be considered a job well done.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The player himself may well be open to a move to Old Trafford to join Ruben's revolution, even if he acknowledged last season that any transfer talk wouldn't affect his work rate or desire to be the best version of himself.",

      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it's not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.",
      "\"I don't know if I'm going to be the star or the next big thing. For me, being the star is quite a lot. Everyone talking about you, singing your name? That just doesn't do it for me. It's not something that gets me running. I just prefer getting my head down and working on the pitch.\"",
      "It's easy to see why United are interested in the Cameroon international. Last season he excelled on the south coast and is among the best performing Premier League players in several metrics - including ball recoveries and interceptions.",
      "He is a physical and competitive midfield general who also breaks the lines with his passing range. His game intelligence has seen him utilised as a sole sitting midfielder by Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler, emphasising how adept he is at reading the play and turning defence into attack.",
      "He's not the finished article but is a player with a high ceiling - and a high price tag - with Brighton having no desire to sell someone they spent just over £23million on two years ago. His contract runs until 2028 and reports put his asking price around four times that.",
      "The youngster is an upbeat person in the Brighton dressing room and a happy character with a steely determination to improve and become one of the best midfielders of his generation.",
      "\"I’ve already done some things that some kids will never do in their football career,\" he told the Guardian last season. \"I want to do more. I want to be a big midfielder, to be a legend, across the world. To arrive there, I have to work hard.\"",

Further business could still be done on the market despite their significant investment in three high-profile attacking signings.",
      "Carlos Baleba is of interest to United - albeit Brighton & Hove Albion are said to want £100million. Gianluigi Donnarumma is another name around whom speculation continues to increase after quickly falling out of favour at Paris Saint-Germain this summer. United, however, must move on multiple players before they go again in the market.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia spent pre-season away from the first-team squad to help secure transfers. Due to Sesko joining, Rasmus Hojlund is another player who appears to be on the way out, while another goalkeeper arriving could impact the futures of Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır.",

      "It's said that United would, ideally, like both, but Crystal Palace are expected to be even more difficult to deal with than the Seagulls.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly keeping an eye on long-time target Harry Kane. The 32-year-old, who joined Bayern Munich from Tottenham Hotspur in 2023, has a release clause in his contract which will come into play in January 2026.",
      "This could see him leave the Bundesliga champions for as little as £56m. Kane, who won his first major trophy earlier this season, has two years remaining on his current deal.",
      "Manchester City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Gianluigi Donnarumma over a move to the Etihad. The Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper has recently been linked with a move to the Premier League after he was deemed surplus to requirements at the Parc des Princes under Luis Enrique.",
      "United were one of several clubs linked with a move for Donnarumma, though it seems that bitter rivals City are now looking to strike a move for the shot-stopper. French publication L'Equipe claims that the 26-year-old had been in talks with both United and City but it is the latter who have reached an agreement on personal terms.",
      "Manchester United's blockbuster signing of Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko has reportedly caused frustration not only among their Premier League rivals, but also clubs abroad.",
      "It represented a major coup for the Manchester club, as the 22-year-old was also a top target for Newcastle United, who are desperately searching for a potential replacement for Alexander Isak. But it seems the Magpies were not the only club on the continent eyeing a move for the striker.",
      "According to Spanish outlet SPORT, Barcelona in particular have been left ‘hurt’ by Sesko’s recent switch to Old Trafford. Sporting director Deco is said to rate the player highly and was considering him as a long-term successor to Robert Lewandowski.",

      "Brighton are set to remain firm on their stance that Manchester United target Carlos Baleba is not available this summer, according to reports.",
      "TBR Football claim United, through intermediaries, are continuing to discuss a move with Brighton but the signals are not positive. The report adds that while the player is certainly open to a switch to Old Trafford, he is not actively pushing the move at this stage.",
      "The notion that it would take Moises Caicedo money - in excess of £100m - has once again been reiterated. Brighton would have to consider an offer in that range, but it has been claimed the Seagulls are not anticipating that sort of a bid from United.",

The 19-year-old has scored five goals across 18 appearances for Internacional and is already attracting interest from the Premier League. The report claims that United have sent scouts to watch Mathias in action, most recently last week for a 1-1 draw with Fluminense.",
      "Mathias is reported to have a £56.2million release clause in his contract with Internacional, with United said to be keen to put themselves at the top of the list of clubs interested in his signature. After the signing of Sesko, United now have four recognised centre forwards in the first team alongside Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Chido Obi. Hojlund, though, is being heavily linked with a move away from United, with AC Milan a potential destination.",

      "Man United can help Carlos Baleba to achieve what he has set out to do in his football career.",
      "The youngster is a versatile midfielder capable of contributing across the pitch and on paper at least, appears to be exactly the type of player Ruben Amorim’s team need. Baleba is about to embark on just his third season in the Premier League but his ambitions are clear - and United may feel they can help him achieve them.",
      "When asked if that was achievable on the south coast, the midfielder added: \"For me, there are opportunities everywhere. I can win trophies here with Brighton, I can win trophies at another club. My ambition is to just win trophies everywhere I go. Just doing that and making the world happy.\"",
      "On Tuesday, journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that talks with Brighton are ongoing as United try to understand the Seagulls' asking price.

      "Teddy Sheringham believes Sancho’s chances of joining another ‘big club’ are slim after his recent struggles.",
      "\"Jadon Sancho will definitely not play for a big club again,\" the former United striker told Snabbare. \"He might say he can and will, but I don’t see it that way. I think he’s burned his bridges with the manager and doesn’t even have a place in the dressing room.",
      "\"Maybe if he were given another chance, he could adapt to what Amorim wants. But from my experience, once you’ve gone down the path of being unhappy and wanting out, it’s very hard to turn things around -with the manager, the fans, and the other players.",
      "\"You have to show incredible mental strength to change that. It’s possible, and I know he’s talented, but I’d be very surprised if it happens now.\"",

      "The 28-year-old became a free agent after his Everton contract expired in June. A medical for the striker at Leeds' training ground, Thorp Arch, is said to be scheduled 'imminently.'",
      "Marcus Rashford believes Man United have never properly adapted after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013.",
      "Speaking to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest Is Football podcast, Rashford said: \"At times I feel like United has been… we’re hungry to win, so we will always try to adapt and sign players that fit this system, but it’s reactionary.",
      "\"If your directions are always changing, you can’t expect to win the league. You might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you have a good coach, good players and you have match winners in your team, you’re not there by accident. This is what some people forget.",
      "\"Yeah we have been way lower than what people deem United to be, but if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months, what do you expect? People say we have been in a transition for years. To be in a transition you need to start a transition. It’s like the actual transition has not started yet.\"",
      "Referencing the early struggles Jurgen Klopp endured as Liverpool manager, Rashford added: \"When Liverpool went through this with Klopp, they stuck with him. They didn’t win anything in the beginning. People only remember his final few years when he was competing with City and winning the biggest trophies, they did not win anything at the beginning. To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it.",
      "\"This is where I want to speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we’ve had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win, you end up in the middle of them, you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Manchester City have not denied interest in Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Donnarumma - but their preference is to keep Ederson.",
      "The Brazilian has been No.1 at the club for the past eight years and the intention is to make that nine. Tuesday saw an avalanche of media reports though regarding both Ederson and Donnarumma. There have been claims that Galatasaray are closing in on a deal for the former while City have agreed terms with the latter, whose time at PSG is over.",
      "A move for Donnarumma looks certain if Ederson leaves, and City will reluctantly let him leave if they get the right offer - just as they will Savinho amid Tottenham interest. However, club sources say that there is currently nothing on the table for Ederson from other clubs and they would like to keep it that way.",
      "The speculation adds to the uncertainty around City heading into the new season. Pep Guardiola said last week that he was not expecting any new arrivals in the remaining weeks of the transfer window, but City would be forced into action by movement around Ederson.",
      "More here.",
      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining Man United face a race against time to get their shopping done.",
      "Having failed to qualify for any form of European football this season, concerns were raised about whether United would find it difficult to attract players who would not look out of place in the Champions League. However, just as head coach Ruben Amorim stated back in April, United will always appeal to players.",
      "He said: \"It's Manchester United. What I feel is that there's a lot of players that want to play for our club. I know that if you look at our club at the moment it looks like sometimes with all the problems with the staff, people going, changing coach, the results, it looks like a little bit of a problem at the moment. But we have a clear idea. \"That is the easiest part to explain to a player. And then it's Manchester United. Everybody wants to play for Manchester United.\"",
      "United remain keen to strengthen their midfield options ahead of the window closing and Baleba is on their radar. He is one of European football's most highly-rated midfielders and his ceiling is sky-high. Like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, he would not look out of place in a team playing Champions League football this season.",
      "He can do a little bit of everything in midfield and his skillset is very attractive. With United's midfield in desperate need of fresh blood, the club's hierarchy will be hoping Baleba is the latest player to prove Amorim right and be attracted to the prospect of representing the Reds.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes report Man United have submitted an offer of around €80million (£69m) for Lopez. The bid is said to be hard for the Catalan club to ignore.",
      "Barca, who are dealing with ongoing financial challenges, recognise the viability of the offer and its potential benefits for the transfer.",
      "Last week, Lopez was asked about the transfer speculation, saying: \"I want to stay here - it’s my dream, and I will stay. I’m happy to help the team.",
      "\"A lot has been said, but I’m going to keep defending these colors and working harder than anyone. The fans can relax.\"",
      "Real Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo has confirmed the Spanish club is not giving up on re-signing Man United winger Antony before the end of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Antony is expected to leave the club ahead of the window closing on September 1. Betis have maintained interest in the Brazilian throughout the summer after signing him on loan back in January for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign. He excelled in Spain, scoring nine goals and registering five assists in just 26 games.",
      "\"Both parties want him to be here this season,\" said Fajardo, as quoted by AS. \"Every day that passes allows us to dream of him being here.",
      "\"If Antony is here, it's because the numbers add up. The most important thing is the club's sustainability; we can't do anything crazy. It's okay to think big, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground.",
      "\"If he doesn't sign with a club, there are still options, but the deal would take place within the parameters we have budgeted at the club.\"",
      "United need to sell the Brazilian for £32.58million this summer to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR). He has two years left on his deal at Old Trafford.",
      "Hull City are reportedly hopeful of securing a season-long loan deal for Toby Collyer.",
      "According to our colleagues at Hull Live, Hull view Toby Collyer as a player with significant potential and see him as a strong candidate for the number six role.",
      "The Tigers are believed to have been in talks with Man United for several weeks and are confident they’re leading the race to sign the 21-year-old, ahead of other Championship sides - including Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "They are said to be 'quietly confident' of completing a deal for Collyer ahead of Oxford United's visit to the MKM Stadium on Sunday, although the move is not yet finalised. The club is also still awaiting the outcome of their appeal against a three-window fee restriction ban.",
      "Sancho has turned down a transfer offer to leave Man United.",
      "The winger, who has reportedly held talks with several Serie A clubs, is said to have received another offer this week from Turkish side Besiktas.",
      "Besiktas president Serdal Adali said: \"Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too. What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here.",
      "\"Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.\"",
      "However, Fabrizio Romano reports that Sancho has rejected the chance to reunite with former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in Turkey.",
      "The 25-year-old is believed to be holding out for a move to Italy and has therefore turned down Besiktas’ advances. That stance, however, could change if he is still searching for a new club as the transfer deadline approaches.",
      "Man United have reportedly held talks to sign Dominic Calvert-Lewin following the expiration of his contract at Everton at the end of June.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Calvert-Lewin has parted ways with his agent as he continues his search for a new club, and he has signaled openness to a potential move to United.",
      "In addition to discussions with the Reds, Newcastle United and Leeds United are also said to have engaged in talks regarding a possible transfer. Meanwhile, Sunderland recently made an ambitious attempt to secure the English striker's signature."

That’s me as a person,\" those were the words of Marcus Rashford to journalist Henry Winter back in December after he first admitted his desire to leave the club.",
      "It was a noble stance to take considering he had just been left out, unceremoniously, from the squad that defeated Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. In the weeks that followed, Rashford would only make the bench at United once more for the loss to Newcastle before being shipped out on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "Before that transfer, the situation became even frostier between Rashford and Ruben Amorim. In a press conference after beating Fulham, the Portuguese head coach insisted that he would rather have goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital (now 64), on the bench before a player that did not have the right attitude.",
      "It was later clarified that Amorim was making a general point and not one about a specific player, however the remark was made after a question on Rashford. It was clear then that the dynamic between the winger and United had shifted.",
      "In the West Midlands, Rashford kept a low profile. He was protected from most media obligations and did not pass comment on United. However, that all changed this week when he conducted an interview with The Rest is Football following his loan switch to Barcelona.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He described the club as being 'reactionary' and the club have been in 'no man's land' due to the amount of transition and change since Sir Alex Ferguson left. He could have been more damning on the state that United have been in, but it is nevertheless clear the forward has changed his mind on keeping his true feelings suppressed.",
      "\"Show me a successful team that just adapts,\" Rashford said. \"When Fergie was in charge, not only the principles for the first team – the whole academy set up so you could pick players from 15 years and over – that’s a full generation. And they’d all understand the principles of playing the Man United way, right?",
      "\"You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time – they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been… we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction’s always changing, you can’t expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team – you’re not there by accident.",
      "\"This is what some people forget. So yeah, we’ve been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months – what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we’ve been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet.\"",
      "The timing of this change speaks volumes. Perhaps now he is certain to not have a future at United, Rashford feels more empowered to speak his mind.",
      "He could also feel that Amorim's behaviour towards him following the Winter interview has shifted the goalposts. But, there is more than one side to every argument.",
      "Rashford is not completely faultless for the demise of his United career or, in fact, the club as a whole. He is also not solely responsible for either scenario either.",
      "However, what is clear is that Rashford has taken a shift away from keeping quiet and is voicing his opinion on United - and that suggests the relationship with the club has now undergone a complete, and permanent, U-turn.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Manchester United are set to play Grimsby in the second round of this season's the Carabao Cup following the draw on Wednesday night.",
      "The last time they featured in round two of the competition was during the 2014/15 season, after finishing seventh in the league the previous campaign and missing out on European qualification. On that occasion, United faced MK Dons away, and were comfortably beaten 4-0 on the night.",
      "The competition was known as the Capital One Cup at the time and the result marked a dismal start to life under Louis van Gaal, who had been appointed earlier that summer to replace David Moyes. United were beginning what would prove to be a difficult period for the club as they tried to fill the void left by Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.",
      "This time, Ruben Amorim is overseeing things and he will be expecting a sharp increase in fortunes from last season's disappointing 15th place finish in the Premier League. The club were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the quarter-finals, falling to a 4-3 defeat to their eventual Europa League final conquerers Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United are entering the competition at this early stage due to their poor Premier League campaign, with only Wolves and Tottenham separating them from the relegation places.",
      "It means Amorim faces a huge task to change the club's fortunes, and he will be hoping to avoid a similar embarrassment to the one Van Gaal endured 11 years ago.",
      "Since their last appearance in the second round of the Carabao Cup, United have lifted the trophy twice. First in 2017 under Jose Mourinho, beating Southampton 3-2, and again in 2023 during Erik ten Hag’s first season in charge, with a 2-0 win over Newcastle United at Wembley Stadium.",

      "The National League Cup was introduced last season and the U21s are in Group A, and will also play Brackley, Rochdale and Solihull Moors before the knockout stage.",
      "Morecambe were initially in Group A but they have been removed from the tournament due to ownership difficulties, so Brackley were drafted in to take their place.",
      "Tottenham visited Tamworth in the FA Cup third round last season and required extra-time to progress.",

      "United's Under-21s' game against Tamworth in the National League Cup was forced to be abandoned on Wednesday evening due to a head injury sustained by Kone at the end of the first half.",
      "Kone required medical attention and was stretchered off the pitch to be taken to hospital. Another ambulance was required, so Tamworth announced the fixture had been abandoned.",

      "Kone is still being attended to by medical staff.",

      "That was the wrong decision because Baumann was in a great position to score.",
      "It's my first time watching Overy in the flesh tonight and his pace is impressive.",
      "Tamworth are growing into this now and Murdock just made a wonderful save to deny them a breakthrough.",
      "Murdock's punch from the Tamworth corner didn't go far and the hosts hit the crossbar with a header.",
      "United have been much the better side but don't have a goal.",
      "United have looked great on the ball and really dangerous, but they need a breakthrough to make their dominance count.",
      "Tamworth have struggled to get out of their own half and have just had a sniff from a corner.",

      "A Tamworth fan is shouting orders at their players, but I'm not sure they're going to listen.",
      "Baumann just came close to opening the scoring after a clever flick from Scanlon in the box. United are already in control of this game and are trying to unlock Tamworth's defence.",
      "I've watched plenty of Obi and he seems to look a tad taller tonight, so maybe he's had a growth spurt over the summer.",
      "Mantato just showed an impressive turn of foot down the right, but he was flagged offside.",

      "XI | Murdock, Kamason, Armer, Devaney (c), Overy, Kone, T.Fletcher, Baumann, Scanlon, Obi, Mantato.",

      "Chido Obi, Sekou Kone and Bendito Mantato are in the squad tonight. All three players were around first-team training last season and will be hopeful of getting senior minutes later in the 2025/2026 campaign. Someone who works for Tamworth just asked me about United's players and he was interested to hear Obi played for the first-team last season. Ruben Amorim handed eight first-team appearances to Obi, but he still has lots to work on (just like every other 17-year-old).",
      "I'm finally in position at Tamworth. It's a gorgeous night and it might actually be too hot for a game of football. United arrived around 20 minutes ago and I'll post some squad news in a moment, so stay tuned."

      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, plenty more transfer activity is expected at Manchester United.",
      "They still need to try and offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Antony, a handful of youngsters in need of loan moves and bring in a midfielder. The prospect of a goalkeeper also being drafted in is still possible.",
      "After experiencing their worst season in 51 years last term, United have had little choice but to splash the cash this summer. They have rightfully prioritised attacking signings, bringing in three new faces in the hope of increasing their attacking output.",
      "After signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves and bringing in Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford prior to the season tour of the United States, United completed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last weekend, bringing an end to their search for a striker.",
      "After recording a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League last season, United had to make the addition of a proven goalscorer their priority this summer. Sesko has arrived on the back of a 21-goal season for Leipzig last term.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "As a result of Sesko's arrival at Old Trafford, Rasmus Hojlund is looking increasingly likely to depart ahead of the window closing on September 1. It is understood he is open to joining AC Milan, who are in the process of rebuilding their squad under head coach Massimiliano Allegri.",
      "Hojlund started just two of United's five pre-season friendlies and watched attacking-midfielders Cunha and Mason Mount lead the line in his absence against Everton and Fiorentina. That was almost certainly Ruben Amorim's way of telling him he doesn't feature in his plans.",
      "Amid the increasing likelihood of Hojlund departing, United have been credited with interest in former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who is still a free agent after leaving the Toffees at the end of last season. It was reported by talkSPORT on Monday that United are one of three Premier League clubs he has 'held talks' with him.",
      "Reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford have baffled former United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "\"Calvert-Lewin can't stay fit,\" said the former United centre-back on his YouTube channel. \"No. Why would we bring him in to this club?",
      "\"This club is built on the academy and we've got Chido Obi sitting there. Play him if you just need someone for a few games rather than someone who's older and can't stay fit.\"",
      "Not only is Ferdinand right that United should steer clear of Calvert-Lewin, who scored just three Premier League goals last season, but he is also right that the club should prioritise the development of Chido Obi.",
      "Of course, the Danish youth international is only 17 and is still learning his trade, but he has an enormous amount of potential United should be trying to unleash instead of signing a 28-year-old that has scored just 17 Premier League goals in the last four seasons.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has only made it into double figures twice in the Premier League in his career, last doing so in 2020/21, scoring 16 goals under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "Sesko will be their main man at the tip United's attack this season and Obi will be hungry to be the support act, providing competition and help from the bench. He made eight appearances last season and will only get better the more game time he earns.",
      "United's history is built on promoting from within and their academy has been a consistent beacon of light throughout the recent struggles at first-team level. Obi has demonstrated he is an instinctive striker, possessing traits that cannot always be taught on the training ground.",
      "United supporters love nothing more than seeing an academy graduate make their mark in the first-team and there is every chance Obi will be able to do that in good time.",
      "Additionally, with no European football to come this season, United do not have as many fixtures to look forward to, meaning rotation will not be as heavy as in previous seasons. That could allow Obi to be eased in slower, helping him and United in the process.",
      "Obi is a much more appealing option than Calvert-Lewin as a secondary striker right now.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "There is a feeling of fresh optimism sweeping its way through the surrounding streets of Old Trafford after a positive summer. Pre-season performances were encouraging and United's work in the transfer market has attracted plenty of credit.",
      "After finishing last season with a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League, United had no choice but to prioritise attacking signings this summer, and they have done just that.",
      "After signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo prior to their pre-season tour of the United States, United added perhaps the most important piece to their jigsaw last weekend, signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Slovenian international's arrival at Old Trafford has finally brought an end to United's search for a striker. After missing out on Liam Delap, learning that Viktor Gyokeres had his heart set on a move to Arsenal and being informed Aston Villa had no interest in letting go of Ollie Watkins, United decided Sesko was their man.",
      "The 22-year-old has joined the club on the back of a 21-goal haul for Leipzig last season. He joined the German outfit from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in 2023 and scored 39 goals in 87 games.",
      "Having been linked with several big-name European clubs over the last few years, Sesko has developed a reputation as being one of the game's most highly-rated strikers.",
      "\"Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football,\" United director of football Jason Wilcox said.",
      "\"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.",
      "\"Working under the guidance of Ruben [Amorim] and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential.\"",
      "After being introduced to the crowd and watching last Saturday's 1-1 draw with Fiorentina from the stands, Sesko is in line to make his United debut against Arsenal this weekend. With Rasmus Hojlund being overlooked by two attacking-midfielders to lead United's attack for their final two pre-season friendlies, there is a strong likelihood Sesko will make his debut from the start.",
      "The No.9 position at Old Trafford is one of the most scrutinised positions in world football, and United have not had a figure befitting of that berth for a number of years. Here's hoping Sesko can make his mark.",
      "If Amorim decides to throw Sesko into the starting line-up at the first available opportunity, no United fan is likely to turn their nose up at the prospect of seeing him alongside Cunha and Mbeumo for the first time.",
      "Despite winning six of their last eight opening day fixtures, United have often lacked an out-and-out striker at the top end of the pitch. For example, Bruno Fernandes led the attack for last season's 1-0 win over Fulham, Marcus Rashford, who prefers to play on the left, got the nod for the slender win over Wolves in 2023 and Christian Eriksen was deployed as a false nine for the 2-1 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion for Erik ten Hag's first game in charge in 2022.",
      "Prior to that, Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial and Rashford again were all tasked with spearheading United's attack for a season opener. It is hard to make a case to describe any member of that trio as a true out-and-out striker amid their capabilities out wide.",
      "The last time United started a Premier League season with a proper centre-forward at the tip of their attack was when Romelu Lukaku was given his debut in 2017, fresh from arriving from Everton. He marked the occasion with a brace to help United beat West Ham United 4-0.",
      "Just the presence of having a new centre-forward at the tip of United's attack could offer a huge psychological boost, particularly when Sesko is expected to link up with two fellow new attackers.",
      "There are no guarantees Sesko will hit the ground running in the same way Lukaku did, but it's important for United to have the right jigsaw piece up front.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Less than 48 hours after Liverpool and Bournemouth open the 2025/26 campaign at Anfield on Friday night, Manchester United and Arsenal will take centre stage at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The visit of the Londoners will mark the beginning of Ruben Amorim's first full season as United head coach, and there is an upbeat mood surrounding the club heading into their season opener.",
      "A successful summer transfer window, which has seen four new arrivals, and a positive pre-season campaign means United supporters will be arriving at Old Trafford on confident last season's woes will be banished.",
      "But what could Amorim's matchday squad for the season opener look like?",
      "If Onana wins his fitness battle and gets the green light to start, it will be interesting to see the landscape of the back three he is tasked with marshalling. Leny Yoro is a guaranteed starter after starting four of United's five friendlies, but there is less certainty about who will join him in defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are competing to start in the middle of the back three and Ayden Heaven is rivalling Luke Shaw to start as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "All four players will believe they are worthy of starting berths, leaving Amorim with a selection dilemma to solve. There is no obvious answer, but De Ligt and Shaw could get the nod after making three starts each during the summer.",
      "Amad and Patrick Dorgu are shoo-ins to occupy the two wing-back positions. The latter came on in leaps and bounds during pre-season, particularly during the tour of the United States, while Amad started all five warm up matches.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is set to occupy one of the two midfield positions. The United captain has regularly flexed his muscles in the engine room and is a guaranteed starter.",
      "However, there is an ongoing debate about who should partner the Portuguese international. Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are the contenders and they all got opportunities to prove their worth during pre-season.",
      "In an ideal world, United will bring in a new midfielder before the transfer window slams shut, but that mission is unlikely to be fulfilled ahead of Sunday's game. It means Ugarte, amid his defensive profile, is the most logical partner for Fernandes.",
      "Mainoo will believe he is worthy of a starting berth, but he is a forward-thinking player, meaning the prospect of him partnering Fernandes in the centre of midfield would risk leaving United vulnerable to opposition attacks.",
      "Cunha, who scored 17 goals for Wolves last season, should start as the left-sided No.10. Bryan Mbeumo is the obvious pick to fill the other No.10 spot.",
      "Despite only featuring twice in pre-season due to a lack of match sharpness, Mbeumo impressed against both Everton and Fiorentina. He linked up really well with Amad and should be awarded his competitive debut for United from the start.",
      "Supported by Cunha and Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko should come straight into the team and lead the attack. He arrived from RB Leipzig last weekend to provide the final piece in the attacking jigsaw.",
      "As far as the bench is concerned, Amorim has a competitive squad at his disposal, meaning he will have options to turn to. Tom Heaton had a better pre-season than Altay Bayindir and should be promoted to second-choice in the pecking order.",
      "Defensive cover can come from Diogo Dalot, Maguire and Heaven. Mainoo and Casemiro can offer midfield cover and Mason Mount will be able to offer support to Cunha and Mbeumo in the No.10 position.",
      "Unless an exit materialises beforehand, Hojlund should make the bench. Chido Obi should also make the matchday squad against his former club.",

      "Donnarumma is due to leave Paris Saint-Germain, after being dropped by Luis Enrique for the UEFA Super Cup. The move comes after PSG signed Lucas Chevalier from Lille as their new number one.",
      "Manchester City and Manchester United are two clubs credited with an interest in the Italy international, whose agent has not ruled out a move to the Premier League either. City have already re-signed James Trafford from Burnley, but speculation still surrounds the futures of Ederson and Stefan Ortega.",
      "The club, however, would prefer to keep the Brazilian despite not denying interest in Donnarumma. In a statement issued on Tuesday night, the goalkeeper appeared to confirm his upcoming departure from the Parc des Princes.",
      "\"To the special Paris fans,\" he wrote. \"From the first day I arrived, I gave everything – on and off the pitch – to earn my place and defend the goal of Paris Saint-Germain. Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success. I am disappointed and disheartened.",
      "\"I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done. If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.",
      "\"I will always carry with me the memory of all the emotions, the magical nights, and of you, who made me feel at home. To my teammates – my second family – thank you for every battle, every laugh, every moment we shared. You will always be my brothers.",
      "\"Playing for this club and living in this city has been an immense honour. Thank you, Paris.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "L'Equipe claims City wanted Donnarumma last season and the report adds both Manchester clubs have been in talks with the player's agent, Enzo Raiola, for several months. The publication now reiterate reports in Italy that Donnarumma already has an agreement with the former after speaking to Pep Guardiola.",
      "But nevertheless, United still have the financial ability to make a move should they decide to do so. PSG reputedly want less than the £48m they have committed to Chevalier for their former first-choice.",
      "According to Reach PLC's chief business of football writer Dave Powell, United may well be able to afford such an outlay after only adding £40m to their balance sheet in terms of amortisation costs this summer, and still having around half of their revolving credit facility with multiple lenders that totals £300m able to be drawn down. The club are not unduly concerned about breaching Premier League profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) for the current period.",
      "Their confidence will come from the expectation of sales before this window closes. Departures for Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund would help offset their existing outlay. Jadon Sancho moving on would also help save several million on wages, much like with Marcus Rashford.",
      "The noise coming out of United may be that a move for Donnarumma remains unlikely, but the balance sheet says otherwise.",

      "The Italy international was left out of the French champions' squad ahead of their UEFA Super Cup clash this evening (Wednesday) against Europa League winners Tottenham, reportedly due to a contract dispute.",
      "Donnarumma has entered the final year of his contract at Parc des Princes, and both parties have been unable to reach an agreement, leading to Lucas Chevalier being signed as his replacement.",
      "After the goalkeeper took to social media to demand the chance to say a proper goodbye to PSG fans, his agent has criticised the club's handling of the situation. Raiola said (via Gazzetta dello Sport): \"Gigio is very disappointed, I'm shocked, I didn't expect this from PSG.",
      "\"We've had so many seasons of respect and success, a castle of four years has collapsed in ten days. The situation went on for a long time because PSG had offered lower terms in the spring, which Gigio had accepted out of respect for the club and the fans. However, in March-April, once we had decided to move forward together, the club changed the rules again. So we preferred to talk about it again after the Champions League final.",
      "\"We spoke again after the [Club] World Cup, they confirmed the situation, and I replied that Gigio would respect his contract but would not renew. Then, in the last ten days, PSG changed everything again. It's a lack of respect, beyond the technical decisions the coach talks about, and in the coming days we will also discuss with my lawyers how to address the situation. We will consider solutions now, maybe in the Premier League there will be clubs able to pay what’s needed. Paris Saint-Germain are asking for big money. They talk about respect, but it’s only about the money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, PSG boss Luis Enrique previously explained that the club needed a goalkeeper with a different profile.",

      "Rashford, 27, has admitted he would criticise himself harshly whenever he failed to deliver a flawless performance, regardless of the result. Portuguese legend Mourinho \"didn't care\" about how his side secured victory though - and that relaxed approach profoundly influenced the English forward.",
      "Rashford, currently on a season-long loan spell at Barcelona, was talking to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest Is Football podcast. When Lineker enquired which coaches at United had the most significant impact on him, Rashford mentioned Louis Van Gaal, Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Rashford explored what distinguished all three and explained how it was Mourinho, who led the club between 2016 and 2018, whose distinctive methods caught him off guard the most. \"Yeah, they're different, but [that's] because we've had so many different managers,\" Rashford said, referring to the 10 managers United have had since 2013.",
      "\"It's so hard, it's impossible for me to compare the managers, but when you're a developing player, like at a young age, you learn stuff that you've never... no one's ever taught you that before.",
      "\"So like up until Jose, I'd never had a manager that was so fixated on winning before. Van Gaal wasn't fixated on winning... he was fixated on winning, but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose don't care. Do you know what I mean?",
      "\"As long as you win, of course, if you could choose, he'd want you to play well. But if you win, you win. You move on to the next game.\"",
      "Explaining how Mourinho's methods proved a welcome shift for him, he continued: \"He had this attitude. In the beginning, it was confusing for me because all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style of, like winning a certain way. So in the beginning, I was angry all the time, like we've not played well today, we've won.",
      "\"But because we've won and he's a manager that is just a winner, he doesn't bring up the points that you know was missing from that last game because we've won. But when we lose, he brings up the points then. But after like six months, I just learned to respect it and then I started to reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "Following months of speculation, Rashford eventually left United, the club he joined at seven years old, for Aston Villa at the beginning of the year. After netting four times under Unai Emery, he chose to move to the La Liga champions this summer.",
      "United manager Ruben Amorim is now presiding over another fresh chapter at Old Trafford. His side finished 15th last campaign and suffered a costly defeat in the Europa League Final against Tottenham Hotspur. When pressed to identify what's gone awry at his former club, Rashford maintains the Red Devils have deserted the \"principles\" established by their ex-legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "\"When Ferguson was in charge, not only were there principles for the first team but they were for the whole academy,\" he said. \"So you could pick players from 15 years and they'd all understand the principles of playing the Manchester United way.",
      "\"Any team that has been successful over a period of time has principles that mean that any coach or player that comes in has to align to or add to the principles. At times, United were hungry to win but it was reactionary. If your direction is always changing, you can't expect to win the league.\"",

      "It seems that Gianluigi Donnarumma’s sudden availability has piqued the interest of one of the Manchester clubs: the wrong one…",
      "Donnarumma is desperate for a new club after it was made abundantly clear to the Italy goalkeeper that his services are no longer needed at PSG.",
      "First, the European champions signed his replacement, Lucas Chevalier, and in case Donnarumma had not quite got the message, he was left out of the squad for the UEFA Super Cup final before which Luis Enrique explained that he preferred ‘a different profile’ of goalkeeper.",
      "Hailing Donnarumma as “one of the very best goalkeepers out there and an even better man” makes it no less bitter a pill to swallow for a Champions League winner who intended to stay in Paris if renewal terms were agreeable. No doubt Enzo Raiola used interest anticipated from the Premier League as leverage in those doomed negotiations.",
      "Now Raiola and Donnarumma are left to gauge the level of genuine interest in signing one of the world’s top goalkeepers.",
      "Reports suggest Manchester City are keenest of the clubs who could afford the salary Donnarumma, currently on £210,000 a week at PSG, would demand on top of a transfer fee in the region of £25million.",
      "For City, though, such opportunism is unnecessary. For a few good reasons.",
      "First, they have already signed a goalkeeper this summer. City took their chance to match Newcastle’s offer to Burnley for James Trafford and the England stopper was delighted to return to the club he left in 2023.",
      "Now, Newcastle have been swerved by many players this summer and the allure of going back to his roots was strong. But ahead of a World Cup he intends to be a part of, would Trafford have returned just to sit on the bench when the No.1 shirt at Newcastle could have been his?",
      "Trafford, almost certainly, will have been given the nod to say that he will be City’s first choice. If not immediately then soon enough. A lot sooner than he might hope if Donnarumma follows him though the Etihad door.",
      "Did City need a new keeper at all? Ederson might not be the perfect goalkeeper – there isn’t one – but he has been perfect for City and the way Pep Guardiola insists upon dominating opponents.",
      "After eight years between Pep’s posts, around his 32nd birthday on Sunday, there are sensible sketches of a succession plan for Ederson. It is thought that any advances from Galatasaray might be welcomed and whether it is this summer or next, there is no doubt change is coming.",
      "The prospect of Donnarumma taking City’s gloves is bound to intrigue. But it would be a change too far.",
      "Ederson and Donnarumma have featured on every list of the world’s best goalkeepers for last five years but that is one of the few things they might have in common. As keepers, they are very different.",
      "Guardiola employs Ederson as a first line of attack more than a last line of defence. Which is fine when City have been as dominant as they have been since the Brazilian was brought from Benfica. The quality of his passing – the choice, variety and range – is just as important to Guardiola, perhaps more so, as the trustworthiness of his hands.",
      "You could argue that very few keepers have the talent in their feet that Ederson possesses. But Donnarumma isn’t close enough to make a swap viable.",
      "Donnarumma’s qualities lie in the more traditional aspects of goalkeeping. There are few better shot-stoppers in the world, because of the Italian’s size, speed, positional nous, and reactions. If you are looking for a keeper to guard your goal, Donnarumma is your man. If you’re minded to pick one to ping passes in possession, he is not. Which is a large part of why Luis Enrique ditched him.",
      "For Guardiola, open-minded though he is, that is a non-negotiable. One of his first acts as City boss was to bin Joe Hart and sign Claudio Bravo. A fantastic goalminder replaced by a playmaker in mitts. It set the tone for the next nine years under the Catalan.",
      "The traits he looks for in a goalkeeper are a non-negotiable. And Donnarumma simply doesn’t possess the right mix. Trafford is a better fit.",
      "🚨 MORE ON THE SUMMER TRANSFER FROM F365\n👉 Wirtz, Gyokeres, Mbeumo: Top 10 Premier League signings of the summer\n👉 Isak goes Full Kane in Liverpool transfer saga, and you never go Full Kane\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025",
      "There is a club across Manchester, though, who would benefit from a goalkeeper of Donnarumma’s type…",
      "United certainly need a new No.1. They appear tempted to kid themselves and persist with Andre Onana in their net while they throw resources at other priorities. Sure, their impotent forward line and the gaping hole in their midfield do command more urgency during this summer reset. But no one could watch United shamble through last season and pretend Onana is the reliable presence Ruben Amorim needs in his goal.",
      "From the half-hearted interest they showed in Emiliano Martinez, it would appear that United acknowledge the problem. And Donnarumma offers a golden opportunity to fix it.",
      "Of course Amorim wants a No.1 who can play with the ball at his feet but his goalkeeping priorities are weighted differently to Guardiola. If they are not, they really should be.",
      "More than anything, Amorim wants a reliable last line, one who relishes the responsibility of digging United out of the holes they dig for themselves. Not a keeper like Onana who has spent his two seasons at Old Trafford reaching for shovels.",
      "Onana was signed in part to improve United in possession. Maybe he is the Cameroonian Cruyff but he’s too busy fighting fires – and lighting his own – to pull strings.",
      "Which highlights that, in their sticks, United need a top-class goalkeeper above all else. In Donnarumma, they have an opportunity to sign one.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma’s agent has accused PSG of ‘zero respect’ and said his client will likely move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has reportedly agreed to join Manchester City after an ‘exchange’ with Pep Guardiola.",
      "Manchester United are considering a loan move for Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports.",
      "James Trafford could have a battle to land the City No.1 spot with the club intersted in Champions League winner Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Man Utd are looking to get two more deals over the line with Carlos Baleba and Gianluigi Donnarumma their top targets, according to reports.",

      "A Liverpool pair signed for £169m have been replaced for £49m, while a record Wolves flop could take the place of the new Manchester United saviour.",
      "It has been a busy summer transfer window featuring some remarkably expensive signings who have been excitedly crowbarred into prospective line-ups ahead of the new season.",
      "But far more interesting is how those players are going to be replaced by selling clubs with lucrative holes burning in their pocket.",
      "While the transfer plans of Premier League teams are intimately known and reported on, less publicised is how foreign sides respond to the loss of a player.",
      "These are the six biggest sales made by clubs outside the Premier League this summer – not including Victor Osimhen as Napoli had already moved on with Scott McTominay – and who has been or is expected to be signed to replace them.",
      "",
      "The Florian Wirtz replacement – Malik Tillman\nBayer Leverkusen have fulfilled their obligations as the sanctioners of a nine-figure sale, reinvesting the Wirtz money through the rest of their squad on expensive defenders, lavish forwards, a Brentford keeper and, most delightfully of all, a Senegalese defender named Abdoulaye Faye.",
      "But the fairly substantial hole left by a chief creator with 34 goals and 35 assists in the last two seasons could not be left vacated.",
      "Tillman is a slightly different sort of player, not to mention a little older and less experienced. But at £30m he will be expected to carry much of the attacking burden for Erik ten Hag, even if the new manager has described replacing their crown jewel as “almost impossible”.",
      "",
      "The Hugo Ekitike replacement – Jonathan Burkardt\nSigned around three weeks before Ekitike was sold, there must nevertheless have been a sense that Burkardt could ultimately be part of a wholesale redesign of the attack rather than a complement to Frankfurt’s breakout star.",
      "The loss of Omar Marmoush in January had already put a new forward towards the top of Frankfurt’s transfer needs ahead of a campaign in the Champions League; another expensive Premier League sale in Ekitike meant almost the entire window has been spent building their frontline back up from the ground.",
      "Burkardt is more of a natural finisher than Ekitike and indeed Marmoush, but Ritsu Doan of Freiburg can help sort the creative side. Both cost around €22m each and will be sold within 18 months for three times that.",
      "",
      "The Benjamin Sesko replacement – Fabio Silva or Romulo\nThe career of Fabio Silva remains a wonderful mystery.",
      "Since becoming their record signing in 2020 on the back of 21 first-team career games, the Portuguese has scored more goals for three of the four clubs he has joined on loan than he has for Wolves. And the five he plundered for the exception to that rule, PSV, match his total Molineux haul.",
      "Yet with a year remaining on his contract and his last appearance for the club having come in November 2023, Wolves still want around £22m for the 23-year-old and will very likely get it.",
      "Borussia Dortmund have been sniffing around but Leipzig have reportedly agreed personal terms.",
      "Yet transfer fetishist Fabrizio Romano has thrown a curveball with the revelation that a £21.6m deal has been agreed with Goztepe for 23-year-old forward Romulo, ‘the Sesko replacement they always wanted’.",
      "",
      "The Martin Zubimendi replacement – Ezequiel Fernandez or Jon Gorrotxategi\nThere has been talk of academy product Gorrotxategi stepping into Zubimendi’s shoes after an impressive loan with Mirandes, but Real Sociedad seem far more likely to go down a more proven route.",
      "The most concrete link involved Al Qadsiah midfielder Fernandez but that trail has gone cold since a €20m bid was knocked back by the Saudis in July.",
      "La Real have curiously spent basically nothing of the £60m or so they received for Zubimendi, adding £3.5m Wolves forward Goncalo Guedes and sending a small loan fee Lyon’s way for Duje Caleta-Car.",
      "They could even land a considerable windfall soon based on whether Alexander Isak can extricate himself from his Newcastle hostage situation. Real Sociedad hold a 10% sell-on clause on the Swede they kindly housed for a while this summer.",
      "",
      "The Mateo Retegui replacement – Rodrigo Muniz\nThe Saudi transfer revolution has undeniably slowed but the eight-point gap champions Al-Ittihad enjoyed at the end of last season has prompted the four sides immediately below them into action.",
      "Al-Hilal have brought in Darwin Nunez and Theo Hernandez at great expense. Al-Ahli staged a lovely hijack of Atletico Madrid to sign Enzo Millot. Al-Nassr generously rescued Chelsea from themselves over Joao Felix.",
      "And Al-Qadsiah decided to swap Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for Serie A top scorer Retegui on six times the wage he was earning with Atalanta.",
      "In response, the Italians have identified Muniz as their priority signing and have not struggled to persuade a player who has spent the majority of his Fulham career on the bench that some time playing Champions League football in Bergamo might be preferable.",
      "They face a slight obstacle in convincing Fulham to sell an excellent back-up striker in a summer the Cottagers have spent standing still while those around them jostle for position. A €40m bid has been rejected but €50m should do it.",
      "Leeds were interested in Muniz but have decided to spend that money on finding a physio willing to clear Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "",
      "The Viktor Gyokeres replacement – Luis Suarez\n“I’ve reached the peak of my career,” said Luis Suarez (not that one, that one, that one or that one) upon joining Sporting, which does imply a misunderstanding of the Portuguese club’s role in the food chain as a selling club.",
      "But for a forward who turns 28 before the turn of the year, who has spent the majority of his senior career playing in the second tiers of Spain and Colombia after spending three years on the books at Watford, it absolutely does represent the summit for Suarez.",
      "Sporting were never going to procure such a guarantee of goals as Gyokeres, who scored 97 times to deliver three trophies to Lisbon.",
      "But their plundering of La Liga 2 for the division’s top scorer who helped drag Almeria to the promotion play-offs does raise a slight eyebrow, especially at €27m.",
      "Leeds United could be edging closer to landing their main transfer target this summer after two major developments over the weekend.",
      "Leeds are pushing to add six more players before the deadline, with belief growing that a deal for their main striker target can still be done.",

Apparently, their fans left five million comments on his most recent Instagram post. Which is lovely but United can’t take that to the bank. Besiktas are no more likely to pay than any of the other teams who’ve expressed an interest in Sancho, so this will go close to the deadline and wherever he goes, it’ll probably be a loan with wages covered.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. It comes down to this: Brighton value Baleba at £100million. Man Utd do not. Are Brighton likely to come down? No. No they are not.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick appear to be wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Which makes us wonder what City might be up to…",

Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be at least £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out. Elliott is said to be interested in what the Bundesliga has to offer.",

      "13) 🔼 Kevin – Shakhtar Donetsk to Fulham\nFulham face the prospect of losing Rodrigo Muniz to Atalanta but the £30million-plus they receive from the Italians looks likely to be shifted straight to Shakhtar’s account in a deal which could break the Cottager’s record spend. It’s about time Fulham got around to doing something.\n12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",

They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",

      "10) Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. We doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step but it seems this one is moving forward. Which would improve Yoane Wissa’s mood.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",

Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £35million-plus-£8million offer, but the Saints want more up front. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasn’t included in Will Still’s squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off. Could Jack Grealish’s arrival impact things?",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. The best Newcastle have come up so far is £25million but an improved offer is expected this week. They would be wise not to waste theirs and Brentford’s time with another low-ball bid.",
      "",
      "6) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. They are hoping Leipzig take back £40million-rated Christopher Nkunku as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. United wanted at least £40million; we think they will settle for less as the deadline approaches.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nPalace admit they may have to sell Guehi this summer rather than lose a £40million-rated asset for nothing in a year. Liverpool’s struggles in defence against the Eagles in the Community Shield ought to refocus their minds, especially with Chelsea pondering how to fill the void left by Levi Colwill’s injury; not so especially Manchester United’s ‘official approach’ for which huge fistfuls of salt are required. Alas, their interest has intensified and personal terms reportedly agreed.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Giovanni Leoni – Parma to Liverpool\nLiverpool want Leoni in addition to Guehi and they might need to spend the same again to get the 18-year-old away from Parma. Apparently, Leoni is bang up for it having been told he will go straight into Arne Slot’s first-team squad.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. Romano reckons a verbal agreement is almost done after the two clubs were talking around the £40million mark.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nIt looks like Forest will win the race for McAtee, who has attracted interest from Germany. Reports suggest he’ll cost north of £20m having agreed personal terms with the City Ground club."

      "",
      "10=) Alexis Mac Allister (Liverpool)\nOn the shortlist for the 24/25 award, the Argentine had a belter of a season so seems a safe choice to be included again.",

      "10=) Rodri (Manchester City)\nThe current holder of the Ballon d’Or will be back at the base of Manchester City midfield and could be the difference between a trophyless season and the Quadruple.",
      "",
      "9) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\nThe first of the former winners, Van Dijk was a moderately surprising exclusion from last season’s shortlist. Anybody laying money on the Dutchman obviously did not see him in the Community Shield.",
      "",
      "7=) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nThe favourite to win the Golden Boot is pretty long odds to win the PFA Player of the Year despite being a former winner and really quite likely to score the goals to win the Premier League.",
      "",
      "7=) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nAnother shortlisted player from the 2024/25 season, the Swede is currently in a stand-off at Newcastle as he pushes for a Liverpool transfer. He will have to either eat humble pie in the north east or hit the ground like a demon at Liverpool to win this award.",
      "",
      "3=) Phil Foden (Manchester City)\nGenuinely odd inclusion after a pretty universally rotten 24/25. But he is a former winner.",
      "",
      "3=) Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nA phenomenal Club World Cup has raised expectations for Palmer, who is central to any Premier League title challenge from Chelsea.",
      "",
      "3=) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe likely three-times winner of the PFA award is up there again in the betting, though we have a feeling this will be an After The Lord Mayor’s Show of a season from the Egyptian. It’s telling that Liverpool’s newest toy is higher in the betting.",
      "",
      "3=) Declan Rice (Arsenal)\nIt’s interesting that Viktor Gyokeres is a rank outsider for the PFA award when his signing is likely to be the difference between being runners-up and finally winning some kind of trophy. But Rice is clearly a popular figure with his peers.",
      "",
      "2) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nThe most expensive signing of the summer is the only new signing of this list. There can be no bedding-in period when you cost upwards of £100m. If Liverpool are to retain the title, Wirtz needs to deliver a banger.",
      "",
      "1) Bukayo Saka (Arsenal)\nA curious one this but worth noting that he was an early favourite in the 24/25 betting before he got injured. Maybe everybody things he is due a trophy…"

      "Brighton midfielder Baleba has emerged as their top target in midfield as they look to provide some balance in midfield and Man Utd have now decided to make an offer for the Cameroon international.",
      "And now Indykaila, who first broke the news of Man Utd’s interest in Baleba, have claimed that an ‘intense board meeting’ was held on Tuesday with Amorim demanding the Baleba signing.",
      "READ: PSR? What PSR? Eight Premier League sides in 10 biggest spenders of summer 2025",
      "Getting fans of the account excited on X, they wrote: ‘It’s been a few days since we last heard about Carlos Baleba, and we know many of you are eager for updates. Well, good news is on the way! We just got word that we’ll have fresh details in just a few hours. So, mark your diary for 2pm.’",
      "Indykaila added on X: ‘Bid is imminent after board meeting! According to sources, @ManUtd had a big board meeting on Tuesday with Ruben Amorim, and things got pretty intense.",
      "‘Amorim made it clear that Carlos Baleba is a must-signing for this summer. The club’s credit facility is in place, so they’re ready to make a move. We understand Manchester United is about to test Brighton’s patience with an official bid.’",
      "Reacting to the news of Sesko signing and the Red Devils’ interest in Baleba, Man Utd legend Ferdinand wrote on X: ‘Mobility in Man United attack. Let’s gooooo! Baleba now pls’.",
      "The caption had an accompanying video, in which Ferdinand said: “The mobility in the front areas now, is something, as a defender, I’m looking at and I’m thinking differently about Manchester United’s front line.",
      "“I’d be sitting there going, ‘I’m going to have a physical presence up there, I’m going to have a physical test from all three positions and I’ve got people who can run and move up there – they’re mobile, they’re the things I was asking for, the last couple of years up there.",

      "Featuring plenty of new signings and a few players with a point to prove, here’s one from every Premier League club we’re predicting to be a surprise package in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: Noni Madueke\nMax Dowman would have been a fun inclusion, but he’s only 15. The old saying is that ‘if you’re good enough, you’re old enough,’ but we can’t see Mikel Arteta giving the incredibly talented winger significant minutes this season.",
      "With that in mind, it’s a new winger we’re backing to be a surprise success at the Emirates. He cost around £50m and joined Arsenal amid fan protests online. #NoToMadueke was trending on X. There were petitions. Deplorable stuff from supposed ‘fans’. The big cheer the ex-Chelsea man received on his first touch at the Emirates underlines the difference between match-going supporters and those who live chronically online.",
      "Still, there are big doubts over Madueke’s ability to justify his big fee, exacerbated by him being another Chelsea player that Arteta has been bizarrely happy to take off their hands. Here’s hoping those doubts cease to exist in a couple of months.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins\nVilla have been pretty quiet in the summer window and new signings are usually the go-to for this kind of feature. With that in mind, we’re plonking for Watkins. Surprised? Understandable.",
      "We think Watkins has a point to prove. He’s been overlooked by Newcastle United all summer; Manchester United picked Benjamin Sesko over him, and Chelsea, Liverpool, and Arsenal ignored him to pursue other targets. Why? Because he’s 29. With the bit between his teeth this season, Villa might get the best season of Watkins’ career.",
      "Of course, this all relies on Watkins not being sold before the window closes.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Alex Scott\nWe’re predicting young Scott will elevate his game to another level this season. He remains one of the most promising young midfielders in the Premier League but has flown under the radar since swapping Bristol City for Bournemouth in August 2023.",
      "The 21-year-old is developing at a comfortable level, but this could be the season he truly explodes.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Yegor Yarmolyuk\nThere aren’t too many reasons to be optimistic as a Brentford fan. Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and Thomas Frank have all left, and Yoane Wissa will soon follow. It’s a difficult time, but the Bees with their Moneyball approach will feel well-equipped upstairs to cope with such drastic change.",
      "One of their players destined for a big-money departure within the next two years is Ukrainian midfielder Yarmolyuk. Expectations are high but zero goals or assists in 15 Premier League matches in 2024/25 was obviously a disappointing return. He literally can’t do any worse this season. We can see a Mikkel Damsgaard-like improvement on the horizon.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Brajan Gruda\nPicking one of Brighton’s many impressive signings would be too easy.",
      "Gruda finished last season strong, bagging his first Premier League goal along with three assists in Albion’s final five matches, of which they won four and drew one, courtesy of an 89th-minute Alexander Isak penalty for Newcastle.",
      "The 21-year-old German also impressed for his country at the Under-21 Euros this summer and is one to watch in the Premier League in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "Burnley: Hannibal Mejbri\nKnown as nothing more than a wrecking-ball passion merchant during his Manchester United days, Hannibal was impressive for Burnley in the Championship, helping them gain promotion with 100 points.",
      "His energy in the middle of the pitch will be important in the Clarets’ bid for survival. We’re not confident in the slightest about their survival chances, but we think the 22-year-old Moroccan can make a name for himself…if he doesn’t get sent off three times.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Estevao Willian\nNot enough people are aware of how good this young man is. Chelsea have picked up an absolute gem, who will hopefully be more Neymar than Robinho.",
      "The 18-year-old winger is not being loaned out, and the only thing holding him back from exploding this season is the vast number of wide forwards at Chelsea. And Alejandro Garnacho is expected to join from Man United.",
      "If Estevao gets sufficient minutes, he’ll establish himself as a regular starter for the Blues. Watch this space.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Daichi Kamada\nMany people backed Kamada to be the bargain of the season when he joined the Eagles for free last summer, but he was very underwhelming until around February, when he looked much more comfortable in Oliver Glasner’s team.",
      "He was a superb player for Glasner at Eintracht Frankfurt and the Japanese international is showing signs of getting close to that level again. If he does, Palace have a real gem.",
      "",
      "Everton: Jake O’Brien\nThere is too much of a bias towards attackers and midfielders, so Everton’s surprise package will be Irish defender O’Brien.",
      "He did well playing right-back under David Moyes and we reckon his consistency levels will be surprisingly good this season.",
      "Everton could be a fun team to watch this season, with Jack Grealish joining Iliman Ndiaye. If they get Tyler Dibling, I will be changing allegiance from Arsenal…",
      "",
      "Fulham: Calvin Bassey\nOne of the more difficult teams, Fulham. Benjamin Lecomte is their only summer signing so far, which is far from ideal.",
      "As a result, we’re going rogue. Bassey will be surprisingly…rubbish. Yep, he’s the one player we’re backing to go the other way.",
      "",
      "Leeds United: Dan James\nExcellent in the Championship, James has a point to prove in the top flight. Everyone thinks he’s nothing more than a pace merchant in the big league. Time to show everyone they were wrong about you, kid.",
      "There are a few new signings we considered, such as Anton Stach and Jaka Bijol, but ultimately opted for former Man United winger James.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Conor Bradley\nOur logic is simple: Bradley will usurp Jeremie Frimpong as Arne Slot’s first-choice right-back. Frimpong as an out-and-out full-back scares us. Sure, he will have lots more attacking responsibility than defensive, but he’s more vulnerable playing there than Trent Alexander-Arnold ever was. And Trent got away with it thanks to his world-class technical ability. Frimpong has to do the same by chipping in with goals and assists for Liverpool or Bradley will seize his opportunity.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Tijjani Reijnders\nPeople don’t realise how good this guy is. Reijnders will take the Premier League by storm. Just you wait.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Joshua Zirkzee\nNobody knows this guy’s best position, but he might just stumble across it this season. He’s made for one of those ‘wide 10’ roles in Ruben Amorim’s system, and while Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have been signed, Zirkzee should get enough minutes to impress and give his head coach a real selection headache.",
      "Failing that, Zirkzee will become a more technical version of the Joelinton we’ve seen transform from a bumbling striker to an outstanding box-to-box midfielder for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Newcastle United: Aaron Ramsdale\nThe surprise of Newcastle’s summer is Alexander Isak’s desire to leave. Or being rejected by most of their top targets after qualifying for the Champions League and winning a major trophy. It’s not been fun.",
      "But watching Ramsdale should be interesting this season. He’s one of the few players Newcastle have convinced to join them this summer, yet fans are underwhelmed. Just as Arsenal fans were when they signed him. They quickly fell in love with the eccentric goalkeeper, and we think the same will happen in the north east.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Igor Jesus\nForest ended last season poorly, which cost them Champions League football. They were knackered and simply ran out of steam. That points towards more struggles this term, with the Thursday-Sunday schedule destined to take its toll. Nuno Espirito Santo needs a big and fit squad after using the fewest players in last season’s Premier League (23).",
      "With that in mind, we’re backing a summer signing to be Forest’s surprise package. Signed from Botafogo, Jesus scored match-winning goals in the Club World Cup against Seattle Sounders and European champions Paris Saint-Germain. More of the same in Our League, please.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Chris Rigg\nThe Black Cats have been busy bees this summer. At the time of writing, they’ve signed 11 players. Their most notable addition is undoubtedly former Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka, while there are high hopes for Simon Adingra, Habib Diarra and Noah Sadiki. Those three signings give us 2023/24 Burnley flashbacks, but we have higher hopes for this mob. And no, we’re not being naive. Shut up.",
      "Anyhow, the surprise star could well be Chris Rigg. The 18-year-old midfielder is destined for big things but is unlikely to be a regular starter in the Premier League, which is fine. We think that could change, with Rigg standing out in Regis Le Bris’ side, forcing the French manager to make him a key player.",
      "",
      "Tottenham Hotspur: Mohammed Kudus\nCan a £55m signing really be a surprise star? Probably not. They are expected to do well. Regardless, Kudus is our Spurs representative.",
      "Under Thomas Frank, and in a positive atmosphere after a miserable season for West Ham, we think Kudus will thrive, exceeding expectations to make Spurs both fun to watch and competent. Unthinkable, innit? Big Ange could never balance the two.",
      "Here’s a prediction that nobody asked for and unnecessarily puts our neck on the line: 12 goals, seven assists in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Jean-Clair Todibo\nAre we optimistic about West Ham this season? Absolutely not. Do any of their new signings stand out as especially exciting? Nope. Are we inspired by anyone in their squad enough to claim they’ll be a surprise star this season? Nah. Yet, we’ve somehow stumbled onto Todibo.",
      "The French centre-back flopped in his first season at the London Stadium, but the Hammers were forced to sign him permanently from Nice for over £25m, having set the incredibly low buy-obligation bar of avoiding relegation.",
      "After a difficult year, we are backing Todibo to be a much bigger success this term. He won’t become a leading Premier League defender, but we’re fairly sure his consistency levels will rise and he’ll become one of West Ham’s more reliable players.",
      "",
      "Wolves: David Moller Wolfe\nCards on the table…I don’t know an awful lot about Wolfe. What I do know is that he’s a left-back coming to the Premier League from AZ Alkmaar. Milos Kerkez did that two years ago and he turned out pretty good.",
      "Replacing Rayan Ait-Nouri will be tough, but not as tough, or as high-profile, as replacing Matheus Cunha, which Fer Lopez and Jhon Arias have been tasked with doing. It’s a big job for Wolfe, but there’s not the same pressure, which is only a good thing. Wing-back is a vitally important position these days and Vitor Pereira’s style of play should enable the 23-year-old to thrive in 25/26.",
      "READ NEXT: Cunha, Mbuemo or Sesko could be Man Utd’s Eric Cantona this season…",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is “not really worried” about the Red Devils being linked to Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins this summer.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, but Liverpool have speculated to accumulate the most expensively.",
      "Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice has hit out at the Gunners fans that criticised the signing of Noni Madueke before he even arrived at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "An ex-Arsenal striker has urged the Gunners to sign a free agent forward after sealing the £63m deal for Viktor Gyokeres this summer.",
      "Marc Cucurella has questioned the timing of Noni Madueke’s transfer to Arsenal, calling it ‘strange’ and a missed opportunity.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit."

      "There’s some Manchester United optimism and a theory that Liverpool might be pulling off the greatest transfer window ever.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Mustafa is back…\nWe talk about football like it’s a science. Systems, xG, squad depth, rotations. And yet, season after season, one truth keeps punching through the data: sometimes, one player really does make all the difference.",
      "Eric Cantona proved it. United in the early ’90s were talented but incomplete. Ferguson’s team had promise, but not inevitability. Cantona arrived from Leeds in ’92 and instantly tilted the Premier League on its axis. It wasn’t just his goals or assists – rather it was the attitude and swagger. United stopped hoping to win and started expecting to. Four titles in five seasons. That’s not coincidence.",
      "Leicester had their own catalyst in N’Golo Kanté. Vardy’s goals and Mahrez’s magic made headlines, but without Kanté’s supernatural ground coverage, they’re not lifting that trophy in 2016. The next season, he did exactly the same thing for Chelsea. Back-to-back titles with two different clubs? Try replicating that in Football Manager.",
      "Not every talisman brings a title, but the uplift can still be obvious. Bruno Fernandes didn’t win the league for United when he arrived in January 2020, but he did jolt the whole side awake. Before Bruno: hesitant, flat, predictable. After Bruno: quick, risk-taking, and suddenly worth watching again.",
      "It works the other way, too. Lose the wrong player, and the drop can be instant. United selling Jaap Stam in 2001 remains one of Ferguson’s few open regrets. The defence was never quite the same until Vidić arrived years later.",
      "City felt it when Vincent Kompany left in 2019. The squad was still stacked, but the leadership gap was obvious. You can’t measure what Kompany brought with stats alone – the calm in the chaos, the barked instructions, the refusal to shrink. His thunderbolt against Leicester in the 2019 title run-in wasn’t just a goal; it was a captain grabbing the season by the throat.",
      "Injuries and suspensions can have the same seismic impact. Cantona’s kung-fu ban in ’95 arguably cost United the title. More recently, City losing Rodri for a spell last season was the closest thing to vulnerability they’ve had in years. Without him, they dropped points and looked – briefly – mortal. When your defensive midfielder is also your tempo-setter, organiser and outlet, losing him is like removing the keystone from an arch.",
      "Which brings us to the here and now. Who’s to say one of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbuemo, or Benjamin Šeško couldn’t be that magic switch for United this season? Maybe even one-third of that trio. Football history is full of players who arrived without fanfare but altered the whole weather system of a club.",
      "And yes – for United to finish outside the top seven after the last two seasons wouldn’t shock anyone. But them winning the league? That’s still possible. All the hand-wringing and mockery after I dared to suggest it last time was fascinating. People talk like the gap between first and fifteenth is a canyon. It isn’t. This is the top tier. Everyone starts with zero points, everyone’s an elite athlete with two legs and a brain wired for competition. Margins, not mountains, decide things.",
      "Fans of clubs like United don’t watch for the comfort of ‘respectable’ finishes. We’re not and never want to be Arsenal – popping champagne for fourth place. Eww! We watch for the thrill of potential glory. For the hope that the next signing, the next breakthrough, the next moment of magic might turn a season. That’s the drug.",
      "Because sometimes it only takes one player. Sometimes it’s the swagger of a Cantona, the legs of a Kanté, the leadership of a Kompany, or the control of a Rodri. Sometimes it’s a kid no one’s talking about in August who’s a household name by May.",
      "And that’s why, even when the data, the form table and the pundits all say ‘be realistic’, I can’t bring myself to close the door. In elite sport, the difference between unforgettable and forgettable can walk into the room wearing one set of boots.\nMustafa (no-one can drink what I’m having because its not for sale)",

      "It might not all come to pass, one or two deals might fall through but even then can anyone tell me a transfer window that comes close?",
      "We may or may not win the league with the above, not because I’m lowering expectations just because integrating that amount of players in a few weeks is an impossible task. But with the above summer done and one of the finest coaches in the world at developing even average players in situ the mind boggles at what this Liverpool have become.",
      "And even if it is the greatest flop in history, no one will ever take this window away from me: it’s been like thinking you’re going to your local Tesco to get the milk, meeting Scarlet Johansson in the baking aisle and spending a weekend together in the Maldives.",

      "Liverpool haven’t so much as replaced an entire XI but it’s certainly looking a substantially different side. And I’d have said as much before the Palace loss at Wembley and before some of the mid-summer friendlies even took place because you simply cannot swap so many new faces with expectations of immediate cohesion. As new players cascaded in while others departed (via transfer or tragedy) I remember thinking to myself, Arne will have some job on his hands come August.",

      "Most probably understand the performance merits that come with teammate familiarity and a settled dressing room, which is why I’m surprised so many have installed Liverpool as easy title favorites. Pundits and mailboxers alike are so lazy in their thinking I often wonder if people are just generally getting stupider, or if social media takes away the need to procure any modicum of original thought or make one’s own analysis. Oh I’ll just say what he or she’s said in a different but louder way and be done with it.",
      "I swear this is not disingenuous sandbagging to alleviate pressure from a big spend (or potential ridicule from rival clubs’ supporters), it’s only an honest assessment from what I see taking place, and what I think will happen. And that is, simply, that I don’t believe Liverpool are title favorites.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, we’re absolutely in with a shout and I reckon we’re built now (with pieces presumably still to come, in this or future windows) to contend for many, many seasons to come. I just don’t know if I truly believe 2025-26 is our year to instantly gel and win it again at first time of asking. I say “first time of asking” because I don’t ever recall being title favorites in the prem era, full stop.",

I’d like to know how many people include players that they’ve never or rarely seen play, just because of their reputation. I’m 57 and many of the greats of the game (Best, Pele, Cruyff, Beckenbauer, Eusebio) passed me by, because I was too young and there wasn’t a lot of football on the telly back in the day. We got one first division (think Premier League but on a smaller, grainier picture) match a week, and not from the start of the season*, plus some cup matches and the big day in May when we had a full day’s coverage of the FA Cup Final (believe it or not, this was the pinnacle of the football season for most people once upon a time).",

Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires, Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry were all in that category for me.",

However, with other players, both in the Premier League and other European leagues, I can only rely on the matches that I see them play and trust that they put in similar performances in all the games that I don’t see. Maybe everyone else in the mailbox does nothing else but watch matches from all around the world and know more than I do. I judge players by what I see and the joy they bring (regardless of who they play for) not by their reputation and the hot takes of others.",

Still the greatest night of my football supporting life.\nDave AFC",

      "“But at the moment, Manchester United are still waiting to understand the final official cost for Baleba – to understand when and how to try to make a bid, and to try to approach Brighton for Baleba.",
      "“For sure, the player is keen on the move, and the player is not closing doors to Manchester United even without European football. Baleba is keen on joining Manchester United, and now it will depend on the two clubs. My understanding is that Manchester United want to try.”",
      "Italian journalist Nicola Schira revealed earlier this week that Man Utd have already struck ‘an agreement in principle’ with the Brighton midfielder.",
      "Schira wrote on X: ‘#ManchesterUnited consider Carlos #Baleba as a main target and are ready to push to sign him. #MUFC are set to submit the first official bid to #Brighton as revealed today. Baleba has an agreement in principle with #mutd for a contract until 2030 + option for 2031. #transfers’",
      "After Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s stark warning around the Red Devils’ poor financial position earlier this year, there are concerns about how Man Utd would be able to afford a deal for Baleba.",
      "However, football finance expert Stefan Borson insists that Man Utd could get an extra £75m added to their transfer budget by rearranging their finances.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “Cash is probably their biggest challenge in terms of being able to do all these deals, but it depends how you structure the deals.",
      "“Likewise, it depends what your access to capital is from external parties. It may be that they’re just in a good position with Ratcliffe and the Glazers to either get Ratcliffe to put more money in and buy some more shares.",
      "“I think it’s unlikely, but it’s not impossible. Everybody will tell me it’s ridiculous to suggest the Glazers would stump up some cash. But again, it’s not impossible. I would say a lot of United fans would say it is impossible.",
      "“It’s also not impossible that they do an equity raise from institutional shareholders. Again, pretty unlikely, but not impossible.",
      "“Then the most likely scenario is that they just get some short-term debt. So, they have a larger facility on their working capital facility. They pay about 6 per cent on that, so 2 per cent over the bank rate, SONIA.",
      "“So, you pay about 6 per cent per annum on that money. They will probably say, look, we can get another £50-75million that way.",

      "Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike have joined Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, respectively, meaning they are no longer headlining this ranking of the 10 best available strikers.",
      "Despite signing Ekitike, Liverpool are still in for Newcastle United rebel Alexander Isak, who has crashed into this ranking to take top spot.",
      "We also have the best available attacking midfielders, centre-backs, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Lois Openda (RB Leipzig)\nLeipzig have already lost Benjamin Sesko, but they are reportedly willing to listen to offers for Openda, who has scored 33 goals in 67 Bundesliga matches.",
      "Sunderland have, ambitiously, been linked with the Belgian, while Aston Villa chose Evann Guessand over him.",
      "",
      "9) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African striker’s move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers can’t be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football shouldn’t turn their nose at him, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",
      "",
      "8) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldn’t be ruled out either. But yes, a return to Turin feels inevitable.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping £80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but he’s only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. He’s been a colossal flop but there’s still hope for Kolo Muani.",
      "MORE: Ten players in the Club World Cup shop window for Premier League scouts",
      "",
      "7) Aleksandar Mitrovic (Al Hilal)\nMitrovic has been sitting around, watching his current employers aggressively pursuing striker after striker all summer. They eventually landed Darwin Nunez, which removes his name from this ranking and allows Mitrovic to crash in.",
      "A return to the Premier League has been mooted and there are plenty of teams that could be a lot worse. He’s scored 68 in 79 for the Saudi club, which does beg the question: Why did they want a new striker so badly? Ah well, their loss is another team’s gain. If Leeds United could pull this off, it would be an incredible coup.",
      "",
      "6) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him – it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "5) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, and the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford don’t want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning £65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting £27m for David Raya and £40m for Ivan Toney.",
      "Having broken a promise to the striker, the Bees are actively scouring the market for a replacement, so Wissa can get his move to Newcastle for around £30m.",
      "",
      "4) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nDuring his time at Leipzig, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino’s team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. Newcastle have been linked, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa. A return to Germany seems the most likely move, with Leipzig keen on a reunion.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If he’s available for under £35m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors. We have to assume he isn’t available for under £35m, because there are hardly any suitors.",

      "",
      "3) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface is the forgotten striker of the 2025 summer transfer window. He’s the third-best available one out there, yet there is nothing to suggest he could leave Leverkusen this summer.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "2) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentford’s Wissa. That’s why Manchester United picked Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Hello, Newcastle.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nThis is getting awfully messy. Isak reportedly informed Newcastle of his decision to leave last month, amid interest from Liverpool. Since then, the Reds have failed with a £110m bid, the Magpies have failed to sign their number-one target to replace him, Benjamin Sesko, Isak hasn’t featured in pre-season, is training alone, has moved out of his house, and most importantly, was not allowed any hotdogs.",
      "Liverpool have already spent over £100m on Florian Wirtz, £70m combined on full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and an initial £69m on Ekitike, but they still want Isak. After selling Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz for over £100m, we should expect a second bid. £150m should do it.",
      "Isak is one of the best strikers in world football, and his transfer stance has shocked many and rightly upset Newcastle fans, who are now dreading the loss of their talisman. The Swedish international has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances for the Magpies.",
      "",
      "Ex-Newcastle midfielder Nicky Butt has hit out at Alexander Isak over his treatment of the Magpies fans and his fellow team-mates amid Liverpool interest.",
      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney thinks Liverpool will “be unstoppable” if they manage to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle this summer.",
      "There is glee about a Proper Title Race, debate over whether Viktor Gyokeres will fly or flop, a tip for Nuno to be sacked and excitement over…Everton?!",
      "Liverpool have been told how they can ‘break the logjam’ and sign Alexander Isak this summer as Newcastle ‘still need a number of positions’.",
      "Premier League football will be back soon, and hopefully we can all just stop making things up about transfers and cup draws.",
      "The Alexander Isak Transfer Saga is now officially scaling heights the like of which we may never see again. Thank you, Newcastle. Thank you, Liverpool."

      "When put to him that Calvert-Lewin had emerged as a potential transfer option for Man Utd this summer, Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel: “Dominic Calvert-Lewin? What are you chatting about bruv?",
      "READ: PSR? What PSR? Eight Premier League sides in 10 biggest spenders of summer 2025",
      "“Calvert-Lewin can’t stay fit. No. Why would we bring him in to this club? This club is built on the academy and we’ve got Chido Obi sitting there. Play him if you just need someone for a few games rather than someone who’s older and can’t stay fit.",
      "“Sign Calvert-Lewin? On what grounds? No, I’m sorry, I disagree massively, I disagree massively. What message does that send to the rest of the Premier League or more importantly to your squad?”",
      "With the new Premier League season starting at the weekend, Ferdinand was also giving his predictions for how the new campaign will pan out come May.",
      "Giving his views on Man Utd and the Premier League’s top four, Ferdinand added: “I’m going to go Liverpool to win the league. Liverpool, Arsenal, Man City, Chelsea.",
      "“I think United are top eight, anything above that is ridiculous, like wow, wow, wow compared to what it was. Biggest improvement this season will be Man United.”",

      "",
      "Pre-season predictions ahoy\nAnd just like that, we’re almost at the dawn of another Premier League season. With this in my mind, I thought I’d share a few thoughts and predictions;",
      "1) There will be a proper title fight – Liverpool look to have spent very well, however we all know that players coming into the Prem from other leagues are not guaranteed to be successful. I also think they look a bit thin at the back, and one serious injury to a first-choice centre back leaves them vulnerable. This said, I’ve just got a feeling Man City are going to be absolutely mint, and Chelsea will not be far behind. Unfortunately for Arsenal, I see them finishing a rather distant 4th, and so ending ‘The Process’.",
      "2) Man United will be very, very good – Amorim clearly has something about him. Yes, he’s hellbent on his system, but every time he speaks, I listen (and no, I’m not “Man Yoo”). You can’t 100% rule out Cunha having a ‘Cantona Moment’ and ending up in the crowd with his studs deep in someone’s neck, however you also can’t rule out him being utterly fabulous. He was just born to be a United player, wasn’t he?",
      "3) Sticking with matters at Old Trafford – Either Vardy or Calvert Lewin will sign on a free, late in the window on a 12-month deal.",
      "4) Glasner will not be Crystal Palace manager at the end of the season – Clearly there are some frustrations with regards to recruitment at The Dogtrack (yes, I still miss you, Ted, Beard and Co.), and Glasner is also in the last year of his contract. A sticky start for Kompany at The Alianz, and it’s next-stop Munich for Olly G.",
      "5) Brentford could be many, many different kinds of f*cked – No explanation necessary, and still wishing you the best of luck, Keith.\nLeeds or Sunderland (or both) to stay up – I genuinely think Farke is a very good coach, and I think Sunlun’ have easily spent the best money of the three promoted teams. Given my previous comment regarding Brentord, and also with a slight worry for Wolves, I don’t think it’s out of the question one of, or even both Leeds and Sunlun’ survive (just). But what of Burnley I hear you ask, well……..",
      "6) Burnley to finish bottom and without Parker – Yes, they were promoted at a canter, but as long as I’ve got a hole up my ar*e, Scott Parker is not a Prem manager.",
      "Of course, now I’ve said all that, Arsenal will win the Prem and CL double, United will finish 15th (again) and Burnley will finish 11th (just above Palace, because…… well, Palace) with Parker wining manager of the Season. Either way, it’s nearly time and I for one, can’t f*cking wait.\nAndy FTM (I know I’ll regret saying this after he gets sent off for the 11th time on Boxing Day, but Granit Xhaka might just be the best £13 mil ever spent)",

      "Which club will be a pleasant surprise? Bias may come into, but I think Villa are being slept on. Missed out on CL football by goal difference having got to the QF of said competition. Can rotate more and still compete in the EL having not really lost many of the core squad. A pleasantish early fixture run too. I mean, see answer two.",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot? Oh. Hmmm. I may actually have to think about this for once… AFCON, Haaland might start slow, Isak may not start at all… Haaland pips Salah with a strong finish.",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? I think that Wirtz fella just be pretty good.",

      "* Clearly it’s a preseason game so you can’t put too much stock in it, but there is something encouraging about being able to come back from a goal down against Liverpool twice. The nature of the goals were good, too. The penalty was won from some typical Palace play and the second goal was a high press, a defence-splitting pass from Adam Wharton to put Ismaila Sarr one-on-one with the goalkeeper.",
      "* Oliver Glasner said to Guardiola after their second Premier League meeting that if Manchester City played that way in the FA Cup Final, Palace would win. Clearly, he also had a plan to beat Liverpool and, in something that vindicates one of my opinions if not one many others would share, it involved Virgil van Dijk. A lot of people would understandably force play away from the Best Defender in the World, but that is to buy into the hype instead of seeing with your own eyes.",
      "For the past few seasons, van Dijk has been repeatedly guilty of ball-watching and many of the goals Liverpool concede, particularly against counter-attacking sides, come as a result of this.",
      "For the first goal, van Dijk is supposed to be marking Jean-Philippe Mateta, but leaves him to lunge in at Sarr without getting the ball. There was no need to make that tackle, had he simply held his position in the line Sarr would not have been able to shoot. For the second goal, he is not the only Liverpool player suckered in. When Wharton receives the ball, van Dijk is isolated two on one by Mateta and Sarr, but is actually covering neither of them because he is only looking at the ball. Taking a couple of steps towards Wharton gives the Palace man enough time and space to realise Sarr is completely unmarked. If van Dijk holds his position in the defensive line, there is significantly less chance Palace score.",
      "It says a lot for Alisson really that people don’t realise how frequently this happens, and a significant part of that is because the world’s actual best goalkeeper bails his teammate out so regularly that the mistakes don’t lead to goals.",
      "* On social media before the game virtually every big Palace fan account was asking people to be aware that a silence was going to be taking place for Diogo Jota and Andre Silva, and that people should either get to their seats before it or wait on the concourse so they didn’t accidentally interrupt it. I’ve no idea why someone would deliberately interrupt a tribute like that and can’t quite believe it has happened. There’s been very little ill will between Liverpool and Crystal Palace over the years, something underlined by those fan groups encouraging people to support the silence (and by Liverpool and Everton fans singling out Palace for their absence of poverty chants), I don’t know why you’d want to change that.",
      "* Speaking of ill will with Liverpool, we come to Notts “Nottingham” Forest. Again, it’s weird that a club without a history of being rivals with Palace should celebrate defeat at the CAS with the combined glee of winning the European Cup with Brian Clough and seeing Derby County getting relegated. Then again, despite the constant reminders in West Bridgford and beyond, we are a long way removed from that era of Forest. Towards the end of last season they were a bit like a Roy Hodgson team, blessed with some superb attacking talent but not really doing a lot of attacking, and not scoring many goals. How much longer that’s tolerated by their notoriously calm, measured and patient owner remains to be seen.",
      "Forest fans have really shown their arse the past few weeks. Smugly saying “rules are rules” throughout Palace’s legal challenge, conveniently ignoring the rules they broke in open and shut fashion over the previous couple of seasons and complained like hell about being punished for. Palace’s challenge did have merit even if it was unsuccessful, although if history has taught us anything about Forest supporters is that they aren’t that keen on standing up to the authorities, or solidarity with others.",
      "* At least now we can get on with the season, which starts away at Chelsea on Sunday. It wouldn’t be Chelsea if there wasn’t some sort of squad overhaul ongoing, but the players they do have are more than capable of winning the game. Palace meanwhile have a settled squad and a draw plus tie-breaker win over Liverpool under their belts, so it should be a fun one.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "On the hypocrisy of Forest\nAs a Palace fan, the demotion from the Europa League stings. As it is surely clear to any reasonable, unbiased person, we are not one of the MCO’s that UEFA, in their rules at least, seem to be trying to prevent. The details have been well documented, but expecting Palace to have done something by that deadline when, by their own club’s setup, Textor had no decisive influence seems absurd for a club that was bottom-half and had never won anything or played in Europe before…. who then did their utmost to correct the situation and can now literally have no affect on the integrity of the competition, which surely is the whole point of the MCO rules.",
      "But if ‘rules are rules’ is your thing, and for CAS it has to be, then it has been applied correctly. Yay UEFA! That will show them!",
      "However, what rankles the most is the part Nottingham Forest played in the situation, the merits of which had absolutely nothing to do with them.",
      "They saw a chance to acquire something they had in no way earned, and contacted UEFA to help ensure the scales were tipped in their favour. That’s a simple fact; take the bullshit out and there is no other reason for getting involved.",
      "Now, let’s go back a couple of years… who was it who got into trouble over how unfair VAR was to them? They posted their views online about how unjust it was. As I recall, neither Crystal Palace nor indeed anyone else weighed in to ensure Forest lost out. It was not our business.",

      "Palace never thought they would qualify for Europe – at one stage there was a live scenario where 9 PL teams could qualify for Europe. When 3 teams in the league were utter muck, West Ham exist and you don’t think you are capable of snatching 1 of those you were probably right not to fill out the form",
      "Textor exerts no influence – yeah rich guys who chuck their money at football don’t exert influence. Even that lad at Forest introduces contract extensions although he has no role in the club.",

Drogheda qualified on November 10th 2024 by winning the FAI cup. Silkeborg qualified by being runners up in the Danish cup played on May 29th 2025. Silkeborg weren’t even in the same multi club structure on the date Drogheda won the cup. They lost their appeal to CAS, sucked it up and moved on. It cost Drogheda a minimum of €500k. To give context on how much this is worth, the prize money for winning the league is around €125k.",

That said, since the World Class article was published, and through the myriad conversations I’ve had since, I did want to try to figure something out.",

      "What do we reveal about ourselves by what we deem “World Class”?",
      "I love hot takes, just as much as I love hot cakes (and that’s a lot), and myself, Paches, Keef, Chazztopher, Micki, can all bellow out that Beckenbauer wasn’t world class, Antony would be World Class if he’d just be given the right service, Saka is bang average, or all football is barely watchable since 1997, but removing absolutely all individual opinion from the conversation…",
      "Why does it matter what World Class is to each and all of us?",
      "It’s not like Ollie “130k a week” Watkins actually cares that Johnny Gatekeeper thinks he’s world class or not when he’s played and performed at pretty much every level while earning more money in a training session than a whole F365 commentariat combined earns in a week, so why do WE think it matters? I’ll admit, I’ve actually had my heart-rate increase this week when discussing some of the wilder takes (probably the cakes, mind but still) but on reflection, I realised the problem was that my definition of world class is about inclusion and so because of that it became personal to me that someone would think Paul Gascoigne wasn’t a world class footballer, not because I care about Gazza, (though I do, god bless him) but because I will never not feel that moments of magic are just as important as rote consistency in our game.",
      "To try to restrict who is world class, who is bargain bin, who is bang average, and who is Lee Cattermole, when definable boundaries are not clear, is to deflect yourself onto the discussion. Those that disclude goalkeepers clearly don’t value what a goalkeeper can do, but also might be fair to say are risk averse individuals… the kind who at 5 a side belts up the pitch, loses the ball then just turns and watches as his 4 mates get torn apart by his failings and shrugs. Those that want 300 players to be World Class are the intelligent ones who… I kid, obviously, but I am aware my desire to be inclusive shows a large part of my lack of standards. The fact I genuinely think the impressive careers of Milner and Barry, great as they were, haven’t left the same cultural impact on football that say, the short careers of Wilshere or Dele did… (now THAT’s a hot take.)",
      "So for my part, while I remain resolute that “my” version of World Class is one that is more inclusive of the deficiencies of football (after all, what IS a perfect footballer?*) and allowing of bad days, I do want to make it clear that I appreciate some don’t like to colour outside the lines, or hear a bum note in a live album, and I am here for it, for it is our differences that make our sport what it is.",
      "In the immortal words of Yoda himself, “World Class may be Beckenbauer, but appreciate him you may not”.",

      "…Really interesting observation from Matt Pitt re: world class vs. good in their position. I was a bit surprised to see VVD (and Beckenbauer) in the latter list, but it got me thinking since Matt’s world class list had no defenders. Using his definition of talent evidenced anywhere on the pitch, what defenders were or are world class? Maldini? Baresi? Maybe Rio? But if not Beckenbauer, I think it’s hard to say any of these are world class too. Can defenders be world class or are we just putting the tallest four at the back and hoping for the best?\nNiall, Annapolis",

      "There’s only one Liverpool new boy in our top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United all have two…",
      "",
      "10) Granit Xhaka (Sunderland)\nThis shouldn’t be a thing, but it is. Sunderland, fresh off promotion, have convinced Granit Xhaka to swap Champions League football with Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap. And we love it.",
      "For just £13million, they’ve signed a player far too good for the bottom half. Sure, he’s had his critics – many of them loud and correct – but the Swiss international has matured and now walks into this team as captain-in-waiting. Sunderland have watched Burnley, Ipswich and others make transfer mistakes and get relegated. Some of their business points to the same mistakes being made, but landing Xhaka is doing things differently.",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nThis one shot up the rankings after Pedro tore it up in the Club World Cup. He wouldn’t have made the cut otherwise, but those performances were outrageous. The brace against his boyhood club Fluminense left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed out £55m, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "A few Chelsea signings deserve an honourable mention. Jorrel Hato, Estevao and Kendry Paez are three outstaning talents.",
      "",
      "8) Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford)\nAnother intra-Premier League move, Kelleher has finally left Liverpool to spread his wings as a top-flight No.1. As his ranking shows, this looks like an outstanding pick-up for Brentford, who replaced Mark Flekken superbly and sorted the goalkeeper spot early this summer.",
      "Kelleher had to leave, especially with Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving, and considering how brilliant Liverpool are at flogging fringe players, we’re honestly stunned his initial fee is only £12.5million. It could rise to £18m, which is still a steal.",
      "Selling him for half what Jarell Quansah cost Bayer Leverkusen probably sums up Liverpool’s weak stance in transfer talks. Kelleher wanted out, keeping him made little sense, and they weren’t d*cks about it. Brentford will be bloody chuffed.",
      "",
      "7) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nFinally. Arsenal have signed a striker who isn’t terrified of the 18-yard box. Viktor Gyokeres has been smashing in goals for fun over the last three seasons – 22 in 50 for Coventry, 43 in 49 for Sporting, and then an obscene 54 in 52 last term.",
      "Yes, it’s ‘only the Portuguese league’ and no, he’s not the next Bas Dost. We’re not expecting Erling Haaland numbers from Gyokeres, but we’re still backing him to be a success at the Emirates.",
      "MORE: Gyokeres to Arsenal: Bruno Fernandes second as Liga Portugal to Premier League signings ranked",
      "",
      "6) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Will Liverpool signings Ekitike and Wirtz fall victim to the dreaded Bundesliga tax?\n👉 Chelsea and Liverpool dominate top 10 genius Premier League player sales this summer\n👉 PSR? What PSR? Eight Premier League sides in 10 biggest spenders of summer 2025\n👉 Ten brilliant players ‘too old’ for a transfer in an ageist Premier League",
      "",
      "5) Martin Zubimendi (Arsenal)\nZubimendi has looked very promising in pre-season, with Mikel Arteta delighted to build his team around the Spanish defensive midfielder as his anchor. He should help Martin Odegaard get back to his best and now Declan Rice can relax, knowing that his full-time position is further up the pitch, providing support for Gabriel Martinelli on the left.",
      "The ex-Real Sociedad star looks like the calming presence every top team needs in the middle of the park. He might not reach Rodri’s level, but he can reach Rodri levels of influence on this Gunners side.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United)\nThere’s one glaring issue with this transfer: This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. They have a habit of botching signings, no matter how brilliant the player was before taking the graveyard shift at Old Trafford.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Ruben Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal for United.",
      "",
      "3) Matheus Cunha (Manchester United)\nAnother great player that Manchester United might destroy. Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season and now finds himself slotted perfectly into Amorim’s system as a left-sided ‘wide 10’.",
      "He and Mbeumo offer something United have been lacking: actual output. Now they just need an elite centre-forward. If they get that piece, top-half football might actually be on the cards. High hopes, we know.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling. He’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, it’s Man United.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nNico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. Because that’s what really matters – not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone who’s world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summer…so far.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "Arne Slot said Liverpool’s huge moves in the transfer window this summer have been justified by player sales, suggesting the club has done nothing new.",
      "Chelsea and Liverpool have both found value in the transfer market by underpaying for a couple of players each, while Arsenal have a bargain of their own.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal are in ‘do or die’ seasons for very different reasons as Mikel Arteta faces becoming ‘the new Brendan Rodgers’…",
      "Florian Wirtz’s father has revealed why the player snubbed interest from Bayern Munich to join Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool breaking the British transfer record twice to sign an elite striker and creator is ‘unthinkable’ but means they should be judged by the Quadruple.",
      "A Liverpool fan does not think the Reds are firm favourites for the Premier League title due to four concerns, with Florian Wirtz the ‘new Kai Havertz’."

      "Marcus Rashford has described Manchester United as \"reactionary\" and being in \"no man's land\" - and has called on his club to \"make a plan and stick to it.\"",
      "Rashford departed United to join Barcelona on loan for the upcoming season after a similar, successful spell at Aston Villa for the second half of last season. This was after the forward had been frozen out of United's first-team by Ruben Amorim.",
      "And now, Rashford has hit out at the club's strategy in recent years - saying the club have not begun a transition yet because they do not have a recognisable style of play throughout the club.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been: we're hungry to win, so we'll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it's reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction's always changing, you can't expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it's because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team - you're not there by accident.",
      "\"We've been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over the last six months - what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we've been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it's like the actual transition's not started yet.",
      "\"To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. So this is the thing that I feel - it's not easy. Because if it's not going well, the fans demand [change].",
      "\"But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we've had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win … you end up in the middle of - you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed which managers have been the most influential in his career - citing Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as inspirations - but he left out Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "The forward also went into detail about Mourinho's desire to win at United - irrespective of how well you played.",
      "\"They're different but because we've had so many different managers, it's impossible for me to compare [them],\" added Rashford.",
      "\"Up until Jose, I never had a manager who was so fixated on winning. Van Gaal was fixated on winning but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose didn't care.",
      "\"Of course, if he could choose, he would want you to play well, but if you win, you win and move onto the next game. He had this attitude.",
      "\"And it was confusing for me as all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style and winning in a certain way.",
      "\"And in the beginning I was angry all the time - because we had not played well and we won. But because we won and he is a manager who is just a winner, he didn't bring up the points that you know were missing from that last game. Because we've won.",
      "\"But when we lost, he would bring up the points then. After six months, I learned to respect it and reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed the importance of the move to Barcelona on his chances of making England's World Cup squad next summer.",
      "The 27-year-old was named in new head coach Thomas Tuchel's first Three Lions squad back in March - but missed the June camp due to injury.",
      "\"I try not to put too much pressure on the England set-up,\" said the Barcelona forward. \"It's clearly something I want to do.",
      "\"But you don't get that without putting in the hard work just day in, day out. And showing the hard work on the pitch. That's a knock-on effect to the stuff I'll be doing day in, day out.",
      "\"This current group of English players is extremely talented, it's going to be disappointing if we don't manage to go on and do something really special because I think we've come on a lot. For the last few years, it's been: the next step is to go on and win.\"",
      "Rashford also paid tribute to his former club Villa - saying the brief spell at Unai Emery's side went \"exactly how it was supposed to be\" after struggling at United.",
      "\"The timing of me going to Villa, now looking back, it was the exact time for me to do something like that,\" he said. \"The response and reaction of what I got from the people at the club and the fans, it was what I needed in that moment.",
      "\"Six months on, I feel like everything is completely different. Everything I did at Villa, apart from the injury at the end, was exactly how it was supposed to be. The club's on the up so the atmosphere at the club in that dressing room was positive.\""

      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 16:54, UK",
      "No 9s and No 10s have been the talk of the summer and big money has been spent in the pursuit of goals.",
      "Chelsea are hanging their hopes on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Arsenal have got all their eggs in the Viktor Gyokeres basket, while Man United have gone wild and revamped their entire forward line by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £207m.",
      "Liverpool have front-loaded, too, splashing a nine-figure sum on Florian Wirtz before pushing overall spending beyond the £250m mark with a £79m outlay on Hugo Ekitike.",
      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",
      "His versatility across a fluid frontline will nevertheless be helpful to Enzo Maresca, who could use Pedro as a second striker behind the former Ipswich target man if he so wishes - or even on the wing.",
      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",
      "Pep Guardiola professed not to want wholesale change at Manchester City midway through last season's disastrous collapse, but that appears to be what he's got. City went big in January and have invested further this summer.",
      "Rayan Cherki has drawn most excitement, not least because of comparisons with one Lionel Messi - which may have as much to do with his short stature as his impressive close ball control, but any association with the great Argentinian has got to be deemed favourable.",
      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",

      "Thursday 14 August 2025 06:22, UK",
      "The Premier League is back and has all the ingredients in the mix for this season to have serious G.O.A.T potential.",
      "For most of us the Premier League runs through our veins. Admit it, a little part of us has been missing these past few months. It is part of the fabric of society in this country - of why we all love this game.",
      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",

      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
