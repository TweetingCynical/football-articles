      "There are now just 29 days until the start of the Premier League season and squads are far from complete, with several massive transfers still in the pipeline.",
      "With the Club World Cup concluded, the focus is now on pre-season, with teams jetting around the world to build up their fitness. But for supporters, there is still the question of who will be playing for their side in the 2025/26 season.",
      "We have seen a few sagas develop over the past few months – we’re looking at you Viktor Gyokeres – while other stories have emerged more recently. Clubs have until September 1 to complete deals, but managers desperately want them done before the season starts, so the race against the clock is on.",
      "The Swedish striker is closing in on a move to the Premier League – finally.",
      "Gyokeres has been desperate to leave Sporting Lisbon and move to a bigger league to test himself this summer. At the age of 27, he wants to make the jump, just two years after leaving Coventry City for Portugal. \"What I managed to do at Sporting, I am convinced I can achieve anywhere,” he has said. “You haven't seen the best Gyokeres yet.\"",
      "Arsenal turned their full attention away from Benjamin Sesko to Gyokeres and sporting director Andrea Berta has gone through somewhat fractious negotiations with the Portuguese club.",
      "But now, after strike threats and presidential fury, a deal has been agreed between the two clubs, personal terms with the player are sorted, and it’s a matter of time before his £63.6million deal is all ticked through and he becomes an Arsenal player.",
      "A story that exploded and then seemingly faded in equally quick time.",
      "Like Arsenal before them, Liverpool declared their interest in signing Newcastle’s goal machine. They approached the Magpies over the subject on Tuesday, floating the idea of a blockbuster £120m transfer.",
      "Having already spent around £170m this summer to sign Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez and co, there was understandable shock among rival fans: How would Liverpool afford such expenditure in the age of profit and sustainability rules?",
      "The Reds believed a deal would be viable, with the sale of Darwin Nunez offsetting the cost, but the bigger stumbling block proved to be Newcastle’s stance: Isak is not for sale. And that has led them to the next player on our list.",
      "Newcastle and Liverpool are joined together in their transfer business this summer. Eddie Howe’s side bid £70m for Ekitike earlier this week, only to see the offer rejected – and now Liverpool are not just chasing the Frankfurt striker, but are fast closing in.",
      "Liverpool have come to this conclusion after determining that Newcastle won’t budge over Isak. The fact that their alternative also happens to have been a top target for the Magpies is a coincidence, which makes the whole situation more intriguing.",
      "Liverpool want to sell Nunez, who has not lived up to his billing. The Uruguayan had been set to join Napoli, having agreed to the move, but things ground to a halt over the transfer fee, with Liverpool holding out for £70m, while the Serie A champions would only pay £50m.",
      "That could still change, but with Napoli signing Lorenzo Lucca from Udinese, that avenue may be closed. Instead, it could be Saudi Arabia for Nunez, with sides pushing for his services. It's been claimed that new Al-Hilal boss Simone Inzaghi has identified the former Benfica star as a target if they fail to sign Victor Osimhen.",
      "Rashford isn’t wanted by Manchester United and has been placed in the bomb squad by Ruben Amorim while he tries to find a new club. The problem is that Rashford only has eyes for one club : Barcelona.",
      "He has rejected approaches from Saudi Arabia, despite their lucrative nature, and is waiting for Barca. There are many hurdles though: Rashford is paid £325,000 per week at United and is under contract until June 2028. He is willing to lower his wages, but United want a sale and Barca want a loan deal, due to their financial situation.",
      "It looks like this one could rumble on for some time, with a compromise needing to be reached.",
      "Garnacho is in the same boat as Rashford, training separately from their United team-mates while they await a transfer elsewhere. He attracted interest from Napoli, but is understood to prefer a move to a Premier League rival.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea and Tottenham have been monitoring his situation, but United’s £70m valuation is an obvious barrier to a deal, while his attitude towards the end of last season may have put off some suitors. The 21-year-old is under contract until June 2028 with United, but doesn’t appear to have any future under Ruben Amorim. United have so far failed to shift any of their unwanted players – a group which includes Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia – and will get increasingly desperate as September 1 approaches.",
      "One of the reasons they want Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and co gone is so there is space in the squad, and further funds, to sign Mbeumo. Brentford are standing firm over their valuation for the Cameroon international, who banged in 20 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "United have seen two bids rejected by the Bees, with the last around £60m. Mbeumo wants to move to Old Trafford and there is a sense that the deal will happen, because Brentford are loathed to keep players who don’t want to be there. But they are also more than happy to drag their feet and get the very best deal possible.",
      "Brentford's director of football Phil Giles is the man holding up the process – and it will take a third improved bid from United to land their man.",
      "Guehi is no stranger to a transfer saga, having been the subject of interest from Newcastle last summer. That ended when Crystal Palace rejected a £70m bid for the England centre-back, but the rumours are back this summer.",
      "Liverpool want a centre-back after letting Jarell Quansah leave for Bayer Leverkusen and amid rumours of Ibrahima Konate leaving for Real Madrid. Guehi has entered the final year of his contract with Palace and reports suggest that he is willing to wait it out. Palace now value Guehi at £40m and the ball is in Liverpool’s court.",
      "Things have become ugly here. Tottenham bid £60m for the playmaker, only for Nottingham Forest to react by considering legal action over what they believe may be an illegal approach.",
      "The £60m bid triggered Gibbs-White’s release clause and Spurs tried to line up a medical for the England star. Tottenham are understood to still be confident they will get their man, having opted for Gibbs-White over Palace star Eberechi Eze.",
      "Forest are perturbed that Spurs knew the exact details of their star player’s release clause and could complain to the Premier League, potentially holding up his exit.",
      "This one has come out of the left field. The idea that Chelsea might sell Jackson is not surprising, given they have signed Liam Delap and Joao Pedro this summer, but the potential destination is intriguing.",
      "Chelsea are said to value Jackson at £100m after hearing of interest from AC Milan – and now United are sniffing around. United could sell Rasmus Hojlund back to Serie A and are not convinced by Joshua Zirkzee, meaning they could move for another striker to complement Matheus Cunha and, hopefully, Mbeumo.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo's potential move to Manchester United has suffered another blow. United have already had several bids rejected for the Brentford star and the two clubs remain millions apart in their valuation of Mbeumo.",
      "It was recently revealed that appointment of Keith Andrews as Brentford's new head coach has complicated matters as he wants to keep top players like Mbeumo at the club. Andrews replaced Thomas Frank last month after the Dane took over from Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham.",
      "And United's pursuit of Mbeumo has taken another hit after it emerged that Newcastle are targeting Yoane Wissa, with Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike closing in on a move to Liverpool.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Newcastle are set to make a formal approach for Wissa, who is valued at more than £50m by Brentford. The report also states that Brentford do not want to lose both Wissa and Mbeumo in the same window. As a result, United could miss out on Mbeumo altogether if Newcastle are able to sign Wissa.",
      "The news comes after Brentford's director of football Phil Giles suggested Mbeumo could end up stating in west London after all. \"He had a fantastic season,\" Giles told BBC Sport said when asked about Mbeumo's future last month.",
      "\"We expected big interest in him, we have had big interest in him. He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career, of course he does – he is well within his rights to do that. We are in constant dialogue with him and representatives about that.",
      "\"As it stands at the minute we don't have an agreement in place for him to leave. It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay. It has to be the right deal for Brentford, any club will tell you that.",
      "\"If it's not right deal why would we do it? He is certainly one of our best players, if not our best player, and we need our best players. There's no harm in keeping your best players.\"",
      "Mbeumo was key for Brentford last season as he netted 20 Premier League goals in 38 games, with only Liverpool star Mohamed Salah, Newcastle striker Alexander Isak and Manchester City's Erling Haaland outscoring him.",

      "Chido Obi is being earmarked for regular first-team appearances at Manchester United in the new season. Obi, 17, made the bold decision to leave Arsenal last summer and joined the Red Devils, who won the race for his sought-after signature.",
      "Obi had to wait until February to make his first-team debut and he finished the season with eight appearances to his name. Although the Danish striker didn't find the back of the net, he did score twice in a post-season friendly win against Hong Kong.",
      "Fans were given a glimpse of Obi's potential and it's good news for those who are excited to see more of him in the 2025-26 campaign. The teenage sensation, who scored a record-breaking 32 goals in 20 appearances for Arsenal's under-18s before leaving the Emirates, is part of Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "As first revealed by The Athletic Obi will regularly feature in matchday squads and only play for the U21s occasionally this term. There have also been two big changes for the Denmark youth international.",
      "Obi has firstly received the No.32 shirt, having been No.46 last term. At Old Trafford, the number is most famously associated with Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed two prolific seasons playing for the Red Devils between 2007 and 2009.",
      "Secondly, Obi has visibly bulked up over the summer. The 17-year-old's transformation will stand him in better stead to deal with Premier League defenders and assert himself on opponents.",
      "Senior figures at Carrington are said to already consider Obi a member of the first-team squad, despite his lack of experience. Amorim has been passing on his wisdom to Obi, who said in April: \"He's just told me to be humble and keep working hard every day.",
      "\"And hopefully I get more opportunities soon. My dad and my mum always told me to be a good person and listen to my coaches because they want me to get better, so it's good.",

      "\"I've learnt to be smart and to think quicker by training with the first team because the game is quicker compared to academy football. It helps me a lot, training with them every day.\"",
      "Obi's first target is to impress Amorim during pre-season. United start their run of five friendlies by facing Leeds this Saturday in Stockholm, Sweden.",
      "The Red Devils will then jet off to the USA in the early part of next week for matches against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. Amorim's side finish their preparations against Fiorentina at Old Trafford on Saturday, August 9,"

      "Onana's injury also raised the prospect of United having to go into the market to buy a new keeper as cover for the Cameroon international until he made a full recovery. But it is understood Onana's injury - a strain, not a tear - is not as bad as first feared and he is responding well to treatment from United's medical and physio team.",

Former players are three-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than the general population, as a result of heading the ball over a sustained period during their careers.",
      "The PFA and the Premier League launched the Football Brain Health Fund (FBHF), with £1million initially made available to ex-players and their families who have been impacted by dementia. But former Manchester United defender David May said that figure is nowhere near enough to cover the costs for the families of those ex-players who are suffering from dementia.",

More recently, former United defender Gordon McQueen passed away from dementia, while ex Bradford and Hull striker Dean Windass, 55, has been diagnosed with the degenerative condition.",
      "The PFA said they have made offers to meet with May to discuss his views and their work on the issue, with that door still open to him. The union also said £1m was an initial figure to launch the FBHF, but the total amount of funding committed on an ongoing basis and allocated to families has exceeded £3m."

      "“This pre-season is all about getting the right players in and certain players out. Matheus Cunha, there's something about him, he's a bit like Eric Cantona. He has that nastiness about him. United need that and I'm sure the fans will absolutely adore him. The fact Bryan Mbeumo said he wants to come here – how good is that to hear? He's not coming for the money.",

Once he retired he became an U18s coach for League One club Fleetwood Town and was their interim manager in 2021 after they sacked Joey Barton.",
      "He left Fleetwood to begin work with Salford in 2022, where he was a first-team coach, which ultimately led to him being hired by United’s academy in September last year. Wiles is expected to work with Anthony Ryan when he joins Liverpool, who will step up from the U15s to become assistant head coach for the U18s.",
      "Ryan is currently working as Liverpool U18s’ interim boss after Bridge-Wilkinson left. The club's youth side has been effective in recent years with first Jurgen Klopp, and now Arne Slot, often giving the club's teenage talent a chance to impress."

      "Manchester United felt they were closing in on the signing of Bryan Mbeumo - that was before Brentford's appointment of Keith Andrews threw a spanner in the works with progress stalled.",
      "The Red Devils have seen several bids for the Cameroon forward rejected, the last being £60million, with the Bees sticking robustly to their valuation. The two parties remain millions apart in their respective figures and the change in the dugout has not helped.",
      "Andrews is another internal hire at Brentford, replacing Thomas Frank. The new Tottenham boss was thought to be keen on Mbeumo, but the north Londoners now look to have gone in a different direction.",
      "It leaves United with a free shot at the Brentford star, who himself wants the move, but they have struggled to agree on a fee. The MEN also understands that Andrews' arrival as the new head coach has further complicated matters with the Irishman wanting to keep his top players.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 times last term and has emerged as the club's prime attacking weapon, stepping up impressively after the departure of Ivan Toney.",
      "United had wanted to get Mbeumo through the door for the start of their pre-season having originally started negotiations weeks ago for the 25-year-old. That hasn't proved to be the case but if they can striker a deal he could yet join them on their tour of the United States.",
      "Brentford's director of football Phil Giles has maintained that the club will not do business unless it makes sense for them and has opened the door to the possibility of Mbeumo staying in west London for the foreseeable. Leaving it up to the Manchester outfit to table the necessary figure.",
      "He said: “We’ve made our point clear. If Bryan earned a massive move now and it was right for us financially, we’d be open to it. But if he ended up here with us next season, I wouldn’t be massively surprised. We’d be delighted. And it would save me a massive headache, frankly.”",
      "Mbeumo himself stands to massively increase his pay packet if he does secure a move to Manchester, which could still be on the cards. The Bees have targeted another forward in Ipswich's Omari Hutchinson, who could serve as the man to replace Mbeumo if he leaves."

The ex-Manchester United star made more than 30 appearances for Everton last term, proving that he can still play regularly in the Premier League, but was let go by the Toffees and is on the lookout for a new club.",
      "A romantic option emerging could see him head back to Vicarage Road with the Hornets, who are looking to land promotion from the Championship this season. Young is yet to drop out of the top flight since helping Watford win promotion back in 2006.",
      "TalkSport reports that the club have no concerns over his age or fitness, but will leave the final decision to new boss Paulo Pezzolano as he plots his recruitment. Young previously made 100 appearances for Watford, scoring 22 times before leaving midway through their relegation year in 2007.",
      "The veteran has now plans to call it a day and recently said: “It's been one of those things where I've played so much this season. I feel so fit. I've not felt as fit as I have done for years. I just want to continue playing, however that may look, however that may seem, I'm not ready to retire.",

      "After leaving Watford, Young's career continued to go from strength to strength. Whilst he was at Villa, he continued to impress and played in a side that threatened to crack the top four. He spent more than four years at Villa Park before catching the attention of Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "United signed Young for £17million in 2011 and he was an instant hit, winning his one and only title in his second season with the club. He would later enjoy a renaissance at a converted wing-back and that saw him continue playing for England, where he won 39 caps.",
      "He would leave Manchester in 2019 to join Inter Milan, where he spent two years before returning to England to have a second spell with Villa. Everton were the next club on his CV and Watford could now look to utilise that experience to aid their ambitions this term."

      "Teddy Sheringham hopes that Marcus Rashford \"doesn't get the move\" from Manchester United to Barcelona, claiming the forward isn't worthy of such a switch.",
      "The United academy graduate is tipped to leave Old Trafford this summer after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim. He was loaned out to Aston Villa for the second half of the season, but Unai Emery's side opted against making his move a permanent one.",
      "Rashford is now weighing up his options and those close to him understand that the dream scenario would see him head to the Nou Camp. The Spanish club are considering a swoop having missed out on some of their other targets this summer.",
      "Nico Williams chose to remain at Athletic Bilbao whilst Liverpool are determined not to sell Luis Diaz - which could see them turn their attention to the United outcast. Sheringham though doesn't believe Rashford's behaviour has warranted a move to one of Spain's giants.",
      "The player's attitude and off-field antics were called out by previous manager Erik ten Hag, who previously dropped him on several occasions. Amorim was also quick to highlight issues with Rashford, airing concerns with his application at training.",
      "Sheringham told Sky Bet: “If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you’re there, you appreciate it. You don’t throw it away and say you want to leave. I find the whole episode very soul-destroying, compared to the way I was back in the day and how I strove to get the privilege to play for such a huge football club.",
      "\"To hear someone talking the way he is talking, saying he wants out – I didn’t like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doing that at Arsenal, I thought it was soul-destroying, and I hope Rashford doesn’t get the move that he’s hankering for. From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that’s a step up that he hasn’t deserved.”",
      "United and Rashford are keen to part ways in a move that would suit all parties. He is one of a number of major names, earning big wages, who the club want to get off their books. The player has returned for pre-season but is training on his own at Carrington.",
      "Rashford has proved to be a devastating player in the final third when on form, previously hitting 30 goals in a season, but he's remained hugely inconsistent. Barcelona though may feel he can further their attacking quality if they can get him back to his best."

      "Doherty's quote about Cunha performing like a Manchester United player from yesteryear during his time at Wolves is why the forward should be an outstanding addition this season.",

      "Creativity and flair seem to be coached out of players in the modern game, with an emphasis instead placed on retaining possession and waiting for the perfect moment to take a risk.",
      "The Premier League has become worse due to that change, but Cunha is an entertaining player and he is worth paying to watch, something you can't say about many other players in the United dressing room.",

That has dampened enthusiasm, but it will be exciting to see Cunha in United colours for the first time and it wouldn't be a surprise to see him put on a show for Swedish fans.",
      "Cunha has the potential to quickly become a fan favourite because of how he plays the game. He is a stereotypical Brazilian on the pitch and, more importantly, is capable of finding the back of the net.",
      "Cunha scored 17 goals and tallied six assists in a struggling Wolves side last season and will provide firepower to a United side that looked hopelessly toothless throughout a grim campaign.",

      "With Cunha a shoo-in to take one of the three starting spots in attack, the right-sided No.10 spot and berth reserved for a striker are up for grabs. But with United yet to make a breakthrough to sign Mbeumo and their striker search still ongoing, Amorim will have to make do with the resources he currently has available to him.",
      "Fortunately, Amad enjoyed his best season of his United career thus far last term, scoring 11 goals and providing ten assists. He is a guaranteed starter this term, but it remains to be seen what his primary position will be if United get Mbeumo through the door.",
      "But with that particular saga showing no signs of coming to an end just yet, the Ivorian could flex his muscles as the right-sided No.10 against Leeds. Wholesale changes are highly likely to be made at half-time in Stockholm, meaning the most every player is likely to get this weekend is 45 minutes.",
      "Nevertheless, if Amorim goes with a strong XI in one half and one made up predominantly of youngsters in the other, Amad will feature in the former. The Mbeumo delay is his chance to try and make the right-sided No.10 spot his own.",
      "Through the middle, Amorim has two realistic options he can currently turn to in the form of Rasmus Hojlund and Chido Obi. The two Danes experienced contrasting campaigns last season and will both be determined to generate some healthy competition.",
      "Despite Obi's potential, he is still a tender 17-year-old. United need to manage him carefully and not put too much pressure on his young shoulders too soon.",
      "Amorim will use pre-season to evaluate his development and see how much progress he believes he can make in the coming season. On the flip side, the United chief will need to use the upcoming warm up matches to try and inject some confidence and belief back into Hojlund's veins.",
      "The former Atalanta man regressed last season and a first full pre-season at United could be his last chance to salvage his Old Trafford career. With support from Cunha and Amad behind him, it could be the ideal tonic.",

      "Onana made a strong start to last season, but the mistakes crept back into his game in the winter and many United fans would like the club to sign a replacement goalkeeper this summer.",
      "The 29-year-old has prepared for the new season under the assumption he will still be at United.",
      "However, Onana sustained a hamstring injury in training after returning to Carrington for pre-season and it remains to be seen whether United will move to sign another goalkeeper.",
      "In the meantime, former United player Strachan has questioned Onana's credentials, suggesting in an interview with bookmaker OLBG that he doesn't have the required qualities to succeed.",
      "“When I've been successful anywhere, I've had goalkeepers with personality and presence. Will it be a physical presence, a personality presence that is always needed in the team,\" said Strachan.",
      "“When they walk down the tunnel and they see a goalie in front of them with a physical presence, a personality presence, then you think, thank goodness he's there.",
      "“I don't think Andre Onana got either of them. I don't think he's got a physical presence and I don't think he's got this personality presence.",

      "Just how Manchester United will react to the loss of Andre Onana to a hamstring injury this pre-season remains to be seen.",
      "It emerged last weekend the Cameroonian goalkeeper had suffered a hamstring injury in the first week of pre-season training and is not expected to play any part in the upcoming tour of the United States.",
      "Onana is understood to have responded well to initial treatment and will go to the US with the rest of his teammates to continue his rehabilitation, but he is poised to take up a watching brief for the friendlies against West Ham United, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "As a result, Altay Bayindir is poised to step into the breach and be United's first-choice goalkeeper for the Premier League Summer Series. Despite that, it is still widely anticipated he will be sold this summer.",
      "Despite attracting interest from AS Monaco, Onana has no plans to leave Old Trafford this summer and will only leave the club if United want to sell him. He reported back to Carrington last week under the impression he will remain United's No.1 this season.",
      "However, news of his hamstring injury means he could be in a race against time to be fit for the start of the season. United face Arsenal in their Premier League opener at Old Trafford on August 17.",
      "Amid the increasing likelihood of him missing the entirety of pre-season, some United supporters are of the opinion the club should attempt to sign a new first-choice goalkeeper to compete with him for the starting gloves.",
      "Just 17 per cent said United should only move for another first-choice competitor if Onana is sold, and as few as eight per cent said they should swoop for a back-up option and sell Bayindir.",
      "With the World Cup now less than a year away, Bayindir will have ambitions of being Turkey's starting goalkeeper in the event of them qualifying. If he is to give himself the best chance of achieving that ambition he needs to leave Old Trafford this summer in pursuit of regular first-team football.",
      "He has made just 11 appearances for United since arriving from Fenerbahce in September 2023 and he has rarely been convincing. He can be quite erratic and his decision-making is often questionable.",
      "But with Onana now sidelined, United will have reservations about selling him until they can bring a new goalkeeper in. Tom Heaton currently sits third in the pecking order and can offer a wealth of experience, but he will have turned 40 by the time the 2025/26 season draws to a close.",
      "With Amorim having decided at the very start of this calendar year that he wants to recruit a new goalkeeper that can challenge Onana for the No.1 spot, United, as per their supporters' demand, should stick with that original plan.",
      "Onana should benefit from an improved level of competition in reserve, meaning it could be a win-win situation for everyone. The only impact his injury might have is how quickly United speed up the process of trying to recruit a new shot-stopper.",

      "One area of the Manchester United squad that almost certainly will not be addressed this summer is central defence.",
      "United have signed at least one centre back in seven of the past nine summer transfer windows. Three came in last season alone.",
      "After Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt joined in the summer, Ayden Heaven followed in the winter. In between, the one-year extension in Harry Maguire's contract was triggered.",
      "Once Lisandro Martinez has recovered from his anterior cruciate ligament injury, United will have five specialist centre halves with an average age of 24. Two are homegrown and three from overseas.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "It is a promising blend of youth (two teenagers), experience and athleticism. Maguire is the only 30-something and all five are ball-playing centre backs.",
      "\"I think if you really analyse our games, it's not that static,\" De Ligt said. \"It's in a way that we are always defending in a three, always in a four. I think in the build-up, all the European teams, the big European teams play with a three in the back. They switch the midfielder in the back or a full-back who comes back. So it's always in a three.\"",
      "Maguire, De Ligt, Martinez and Yoro also tallied a creditable nine goals between them. Heaven got on the scoresheet with a well-placed header in the post-season friendly win in Hong Kong.",
      "Yoro, at 19, was billed as a coup when United beat Real Madrid to him last year and he started to show his class during last season's run-in. After an unconvincing first six months, De Ligt found form before his ill-timed injury.",
      "\"We must remind ourselves he is really young,\" Maguire cautioned on Yoro last year. \"There are going to be mistakes but he has every attribute of a centre back in the modern game, he has it. So I’m sure he’s going to have a bright future.",
      "\"It’s our job as senior centre backs, my job, to help him along, communicate well, let him know what to expect. There are going to be times where I’m sure he’ll feel the world is on top of him, there are also going to be times where he’s going to feel like the best player in the world. And that’s what this club brings.\"",
      "Heaven has been a revelation and got better with every performance until he too hurt himself at Leicester City in March. At the turn of the year, Martinez turned a corner and was influential in January prior to his season-shattering injury against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford.",
      "Now into his sixth year at United, Maguire can fairly be regarded as one of the more respectable recruits of the post-Ferguson era at United. His first season was good, second decent, third a disaster and fourth worse, yet he has recovered commendably with impressive back-to-back campaigns. He has become a United captain without the armband.",
      "Maguire is a more authentic talker now he does not have that elastic wrapped around his bicep. The captaincy was so overwhelming at times that it doubled for a blood pressure cuff strapped to him.",
      "Like his fellow Yorkshireman Joe Root, Maguire has found a new lease of life taking a step back as the team's official leader. Root is the number two Test batsman in the world three years after stepping down as captain. Maguire will be aiming to earn a new United contract next year.",
      "The defensive quintet available to Ruben Amorim is a far cry from Jose Mourinho's final months at United in 2018 after Ed Woodward denied him a central defensive signing. Mourinho was responsible for the arrivals of Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof but inherited Chris Smalling and Phil Jones.",
      "When Mourinho telephoned Bailly, the defender thought it was someone playing a joke. Bailly's appearance average at United - fewer than 20 games a season - was a joke.",
      "It was no surprise to hear that Lindelof was one of three United players that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remains in contact with (Maguire and Bruno Fernandes were the other two). Lindelof benefited from Solskjaer's Scandinavian solidarity and had long outstayed his welcome before he was released last month.",
      "The caveat with United's current five defenders is they all had significant injury lay-offs last season. Yoro was on crutches after his second appearance in pre-season and had to wait more than four months to make his competitive debut.",
      "De Ligt's final two months of the season were practically wiped out, Heaven missed two months, Maguire was sidelined for around three months of the campaign and Martinez has suffered agonising injuries in each of his three seasons in Manchester.",
      "It was only 15 months ago that Casemiro was parachuted in at centre back for the FA Cup semi-final after Willy Kambwala (remember him?) broke down again. With Kambwala, Martinez, Lindelof, Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans all on the treatment table, the only centre back United had on the bench against Coventry City at Wembley was Louis Jackson.",
      "Given United operate in a back three, five centre backs with recent injury issues is a potential risk. The risk is offset by Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw, both experienced at playing at centre half and unlikely to be used on the wing.",
      "If need be, Casemiro has played in defence. Tyler Fredricson has received a squad number upgrade as well. That is nine options across nine months with a reduced workload due to the absence of European football.",
      "Expect a summer more like 2018 or 2020."

      "If Manchester United are serious about taking Bryan Mbeumo to the United States with them next week, they need to get a wriggle on.",
      "More than six weeks after tabling their opening offer for the Brentford attacker, United are still locked in negotiations with the Londoners to try and reach an agreement.",
      "United's second offer, which was made just over three weeks ago and understood to be in excess of £60million, looked as though it would be enough to extract the Cameroon international from the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "However, United still find themselves at the negotiating table and the clock is ticking. Ruben Amorim's squad is in desperate need of fresh blood this summer and the Reds are quickly falling even further behind their Premier League rivals.",
      "It goes without saying United are working under testing circumstances this summer. After failing to qualify for the upcoming Champions League campaign, they will be starved of valuable revenue streams this season, meaning they are having to box clever with their recruitment.",
      "United have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and they now need to prioritise sales to bring in funds that can be reinvested into the squad. At the same time, they are also having to find the right balance between securing the players Amorim needs and not pay over the odds.",
      "United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings this summer after finishing consecutive Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference. Cunha got 17 goals across all competitions last term and Mbeumo plundered 20 in the league.",
      "The prospect of adding Mbeumo to the signing of Cunha is exciting. Both players were among the best in the division last season and their records speak for themselves.",
      "However, how long can United, who also want to sign a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer, wait for Mbeumo? They are within their rights to continue pursuing their top target, firmly of the belief he will make an impact at Old Trafford, but they are running the risk of wasting too much time.",
      "Mbeumo was one of the best players in the Premier League last season and has been improving year-on-year. He is Premier League proven and that is the market United are shopping in this summer.",
      "If United's discussions with Brentford continue without a breakthrough, they may have to consider alternative options. And considering they are looking at players with Premier League pedigree, they could do far worse than running the rule over West Ham United ace Jarrod Bowen.",
      "Like Mbeumo, Bowen made his first claim to fame in the Championship. After scoring 22 goals for Hull City in 2018/19 and 17 in the first half of the 2019/20 campaign, West Ham swooped for him in January 2020 for a reported fee of £22m.",
      "Five-and-a-half years later, you will struggle to find a Premier League signing that has, pound for pound, been better value for money. Bowen, 28, has scored 74 goals in 238 games for the club.",
      "He has reached double figures for goals in the Premier League in three of the last four seasons, scoring 29 league goals since the start of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Like Mbeumo, Bowen is predominantly a right-winger who likes to cut inside and take full advantage of his trustworthy left foot. However, he is adaptable and can play pretty much anywhere across the forward line, including up front.",
      "Fresh from scoring 13 goals and racking up eight assists in the Premier League last season, Bowen is hot property this summer. He is West Ham's star man and they will be reluctant to lose him.",
      "Fortunately for the Hammers, the length of Bowen's contract at the London Stadium means they have a safety net. The England international signed a long-term contract in the capital in October 2023, keeping him at the club until June 2030.",
      "It means with five years remaining on his deal, West Ham will demand a sizeable fee to consider selling him this summer. Without player sales, which have so far been non-existent, United will not be able to swoop for Bowen should he crop into their thoughts amid the ongoing Mbeumo saga.",
      "But if United can eventually clear their departures lounge, Bowen could be an alternative to consider if Brentford refuse to budge. West Ham, though, could quite easily be just as stubborn.",

      "In between confirming they had reached an agreement to sign Cunha and formally unveiling him as their first summer signing, United tabled an opening offer for Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Alongside Cunha, the Brentford attacker was one of the best players in the Premier League last season, scoring 20 goals. United set an objective of signing him ahead of the start of pre-season training at the beginning of last week.",
      "After seeing an opening bid worth £55m knocked back and a second offer in excess of £60m not proving enough for Brentford to give Mbeumo the green light to move to Old Trafford, United could have been forgiven for walking away. Instead, discussions are still ongoing.",
      "United are determined to bring Mbeumo to Old Trafford and beef up their attack. They have rightfully prioritised attacking signings this summer and the prospect of heading on the upcoming tour of the United States with Cunha and Mbeumo in the bank would resemble a strong start to the window.",
      "In addition to chasing Mbeumo's tail, United are still eager to sign a striker this summer. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen who they will turn to in their pursuit of an out-and-out No.9.",
      "Furthermore, United also want to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer. It remains to be seen if Andre Onana's hamstring injury will force them to move for a shot-stopper earlier than expected.",
      "United's retained list confirmed the exits of three first-team players: Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen. Tom Heaton was the only out-of-contract player to be offered a new deal.",
      "The exit of the aforementioned trio immediately shrunk United's squad size. It has now been reduced by a further five players amid Tyrell Malacia's, Marcus Rashford's, Jadon Sancho's, Alejandro Garnacho's and Antony's absences from first-team training.",
      "The quintet have all informed United they want to leave the club and they do not feature in head coach Ruben Amorim's plans. With the exception of Garnacho, they all spent time away from Old Trafford on loan last season, with Malacia, Sancho and Rashford departing in the winter window.",
      "United are right to try and sell all five of them amid Malacia's struggles and Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation having no room for natural wingers. Cunha has been drafted in to play as the left-sided No.10 and Mbeumo could be an option for the right-sided berth.",
      "Having released three players and five more not currently training with the first-team, United's squad size is currently smaller than it was last season. However, they will play fewer games in 2025/26 after failing to qualify for Europe.",

With four attackers currently out of the picture and no guarantees about Rasmus Hojlund's or Joshua Zirkzee's future at the club, United face the prospect of being light up front.",
      "The obvious caveat to highlight is that Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are natural wingers and do not fit into Amorim's system, but they are still bodies Amorim could turn to in an emergency. They will, when analysing the landscape of the squad in terms of personnel, need replacing in some form.",
      "If United can add Mbeumo to the ranks, he and Cunha will be first-choice No.10 options. Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Amad can also operate in those roles.",
      "In terms of natural strikers, though, United still look light. Hojlund regressed in his second season at the club and Chido Obi is still raw and unproven, despite his exciting potential.",
      "The club's striker search is yet to offer the answer they are looking for and that will only change once funds become available via player sales. Departures hold the key to completing what many consider as United's top transfer objective.",

      "Sporting Lisbon supporters have delivered a scathing message to Viktor Gyokeres as the forward edges closer to a return to the Premier League.",
      "The Sweden international has been linked with a move to Manchester United, but now appears to be closing in on a move to Arsenal after effectively going on strike in an attempt to push through the move.",
      "Sporting fans have expressed their stance on the matter by unveiling several pointed banners directed at Gyokeres during their opening pre-season match against Celtic on Wednesday, a game Brendan Rodgers' team won 2-0.",
      "Portuguese media outlet A Bola noted that one banner proclaimed: \"I don't cry for those who leave, I'm happy for those who stay.\"",
      "Another declared: \"No one is above the club's interests, no matter who they are.\", reports the Mirror.",
      "Gyokeres has been a formidable scorer for Sporting, amassing 97 goals in 102 outings in all competitions since his transfer from Coventry in 2023 for approximately £20million.",
      "The 27-year-old's contributions have seen Sporting clinch two league championships and a Taca de Portugal, yet his tenure could conclude on a bitter note as he faces a penalty for not attending pre-season training.",
      "\"We're calm,\" Sporting president Frederico Varandas told Agencia Lusa. \"Everything can be solved with the closure of the market, a hefty fine and an apology to the group. If they don't want to pay Viktor's fair market value, we'll be very comfortable with that for the next three years.",
      "\"If the geniuses who are devising this strategy think that this puts pressure on me to make it easier for him to leave, not only are they completely wrong, but they are also making it more complicated for the player to leave. No one is above the interests of the club. Whoever they are.\"",
      "Gyokeres recently discussed his future aspirations with L'Equipe, expressing his ambition to establish himself in the Premier League after failing to make a single top-flight appearance during his stint at Brighton.",
      "\"It's one of the biggest leagues in Europe,\" Gyokeres said. \"I spent several years there without being able to play a single match. \"So, of course, it's something I would like to do. It would be a great revenge.",
      "He added: \"It's football, you never know. I'm not thinking about it, we'll see what happens. If something is going to happen, it will happen. The most important thing for me is to play for a club that really wants me.",
      "\"I'm definitely one of the [best strikers in the world ]. It's difficult to rank me but yes, I'm at the same table as them now. What I managed to do at Sporting, I'm convinced I can do anywhere. You haven't seen the best of Gyokeres yet.\""

      "United had hoped to secure Mbeumo ahead of their pre-season, having initiated negotiations for the 25 year old weeks ago. This hasn't transpired as planned, but if they can strike a deal, he could still join them on their tour of the United States.",
      "Brentford's director of football, Phil Giles, has stated that the club will only engage in transfer dealings if it benefits them, leaving the door open for Mbeumo to remain in west London for the foreseeable future.",
      "The ball is now in Man United's court to offer an acceptable sum.",
      "He stated: \"We've made our point clear. If Bryan earned a massive move now and it was right for us financially, we'd be open to it. But if he ended up here with us next season, I wouldn't be massively surprised. We'd be delighted. And it would save me a massive headache, frankly.\"",
      "Mbeumo could see a significant increase in his salary if he secures a move to Manchester, which remains a possibility. Brentford have identified another forward, Omari Hutchinson from Ipswich, who could potentially replace Mbeumo should he depart."

      "The Reds are also yet to shift anyone from their squad, despite Marcus Rashford, Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim. With that said, below are all the latest updates on United's pursuit of Mbeumo.",
      "The Guardian reported on Wednesday that United’s push to sign Mbeumo has stalled after Brentford raised their valuation to closer to £70m. They report that the change of stance has been met with resistance by Reds co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "The report claims that United's hierarchy do not wish to be held to ransom and are determined to be patient. They add that Brentford view their position as firm because although Mbeumo’s contract expires next summer, the club hold a one-year option.",
      "Ipswich Town have reportedly turned down a £35m offer from Brentford for winger Omari Hutchinson. The news could be significant for United with Hutchinson a potential replacement for Mbeumo.",
      "BBC Sport report that the Bees reached Hutchinson's relegation release clause, but as the offer was not cash up front, it was rejected. They claim that the clause has expired, but Brentford are still keen on a deal for the 21-year-old, although there is a reluctance to pay what Ipswich want for the player.",
      "It is understood that the Reds are still working on a deal to sign Mbeumo so he can figure on the club's pre-season tour of the United States.

      "Unless the situation takes a dramatic shift, Manchester United will not be parading Bryan Mbeumo in front of their supporters in Stockholm on Saturday.",
      "Despite submitting an opening offer for the Brentford attacker six weeks ago, United remain locked in negotiations to try and sign the Cameroon international. After their opening bid, understood to be worth £55million, was rejected, they tabled a second offer in excess of £60m three weeks later.",
      "United had planned to sign Mbeumo in time for the start of pre-season training last week. Instead, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon were the only new recruits who were introduced to their new teammates.",
      "With the opening game of United's pre-season tour of the United States now just over a week away, time is running out for them to sign Mbeumo in time for him to make the plane alongside the rest of the squad.",
      "No shortage of United supporters are frustrated by the ongoing delay, but the Reds, who face Leeds United in their opening friendly this weekend, are refusing to pay over the odds.",
      "Despite the ongoing delay, Mbeumo's hunger to move to Old Trafford is considered as a positive. There is a general feeling the deal will get finalised eventually. But how long is a piece of string?",
      "Amid the ongoing delay, those who could find themselves competing with Mbeumo for a place in Ruben Amorim's starting XI could be secretly pleased. The longer the deal takes to get done, the longer those who could soon be in competition with him will have to impress Amorim in pre-season.",
      "Mbeumo has made a name for himself as a goalscoring winger at Brentford, frequently cutting in from the right flank and using his trustworthy left foot. However, there is no room for natural wingers in Amorim's system, of course.",
      "Mbeumo could be used as the right-sided No.10 or as the right wing-back in the Portuguese chief's 3-4-2-1 system. Some believe he should be unleashed in the attack, while others are in favour of him occupying a place out wide.",
      "Whatever Amorim's plan is, he knows Mbeumo will have competition in the hunt for a starting berth. If he considers the 25-year-old as a wing-back, for example, he will face competition from Diogo Dalot and Amad.",
      "If he views him as one of the two No.10s, he will be challenged by Mason Mount and Amad. The latter is equally comfortable as the right-sided No.10 or as the right-sided wing-back, meaning he and Mbeumo would be able to provide similar characteristics.",
      "If Amorim intends on playing Mbeumo as an attacker, the longer it takes United to make a breakthrough in discussions with Brentford, the stronger Mount's and Amad's chances of nailing down a place in the starting XI will become.",
      "Amad was United's most improved player by a country mile last season and will be a regular starter in 2025/26 whether it be in attack or out wide. If Mbeumo is unleashed on the flank, Amad should start as the No.10 and vice versa.",
      "Mount, though, is a very valuable asset in Amorim's eyes. The United boss has made no secret of just how much he adores him, and there is a very good chance he could become a key player in his third season at Old Trafford if he can stay injury-free.",
      "Despite being signed by United to operate as a No.8 two years ago, Mount is much better when playing further forward in Amorim's system. He is well-versed in a three-at-the-back formation and has the intelligence to offer United what Amorim is looking for.",
      "Unlike Amad, he is not capable of playing out wide, meaning the right-sided No.10 spot, considering new recruit Matheus Cunha is poised to occupy the left-sided playmaker role, is Mount's route into the starting XI.",
      "But with Dalot still considered a valuable player by Amorim, too, he will be hoping to nail down the right wing-back spot this pre-season, meaning Amad and Mount could find themselves in direct competition to start in attack.",
      "Amorim will rotate and tinker throughout pre-season. It may not be until United's final friendly against Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9, by which time Mbeumo's signature might have been secured, that his first-choice starting XI for the season opener against Arsenal may be tested.",
      "United need to get Mbeumo through the door sooner rather than later to ease frustrations, but Amad and Mount might be only too happy to wait a little while longer.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "Andre impressed in his debut season at Wolves, forming a solid midfield partnership with compatriot Joao Gomes. He completed 93 per cent of his passes in the Premier League last term, winning 59 per cent of his duels with an average of six recoveries and three tackles per match. Although Andre doesn't have much aerial presence, he makes up for that with his work rate and high-octane running.",
      "His playing style would fit perfectly at United and would surely be the ideal teammate for Matheus Cunha, who signed for the Reds in a £62.5m move at the start of last month. Andre and Cunha played together at Wolves last season and are both involved with the Brazil national team.",
      "The duo have formed quite a close relationship since Andre decided to move to Wolves and that helped them put in a number of impressive performances on the pitch. Cunha was Wolves' standout performer last term with 17 goals and six assists in 36 appearances, but Andre wasn't far behind.",
      "It felt as though Andre's impact and presence in the middle of midfield helped open up space for Cunha to create opportunities and work up some magic in the final third.",
      "While Cunha might hit the ground running no matter who he has behind him, it has been proven that he can perform alongside Andre and therefore they could be the ideal fit together for United.",
      "Former Wolves star Dave Edwards heaped praise on Andre back in March and described him as one of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League. He said: \"I could talk about Andre all day.",
      "\"Very rarely do you see so much passion for defensive actions. He celebrates it like a goal, because, in reality, it’s as big as a goal, because he's stopping an attack, a moment for the opposition.",
      "\"It's great to see it means so much to do that side of the game because everybody wants to be the goal scorer, everybody wants to be the person creating and doing the tricks, but to take so much pride in that defensive work is magnificent, and every team needs players who do that.",
      "\"You can't just have a team of tricksters and flare players. You have to have an Andre in the team who is such an important cog in the wheel. He wins the ball back so many times.",
      "\"A lot of the time it's after we've had an attack, it breaks down, and then he's there to pick up the pieces and we start another attack. That just keeps the opposition under pressure and that's so important.\"",
      "Edwards added: \"He is one of the best number sixes in the league, there's no doubt about that. He really is at the top end of ballplaying central midfielders who start attacks. I've been delighted to see how much he's improved since he's come in, how effective he's now becoming for Wolves, and now how important he is.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to seeing many more games of Andre dictating the play for Wolves.\""

      "Arsenal looked to have moved to the front of the queue last month and made Sesko their first-choice No.9 target. However, the Gunners have since accelerated a move for Viktor Gyokeres instead, with the Sporting CP man closing in on a £63.8million switch to north London, having agreed a five-year contract.",
      "That has left the door open for others, including United, to swoop in and pursue Sesko. According to a report from TBR Football on Wednesday afternoon, intermediaries have offered United, Chelsea and Liverpool the chance to sign the former Red Bull Salzburg man in a deal worth around £60m.",
      "But Sesko has now dropped the biggest hint yet that he could remain at Leipzig for the coming campaign and beyond. In an Instagram story, Sesko posted two images of him wearing Leipzig's brand new 2025/26 kit and posing with the No.30 shirt on the back. He captioned the post: \"Getting some [flashing camera emoji] for new season.\"",
      "As he features in Leipzig's new kit launch and is more than open to promoting that on his personal social media, it's a big suggestion that he is going to remain at the Red Bull club this summer.",
      "Sesko's Leipzig future was the subject of much debate this time in 2024, but he ended that after signing a new five-year contract. Since, he has continued to excel in the Bundesliga and establish himself as one of the best strikers in Europe. He found the net against Bayern Munich twice last season.",
      "Speaking about his future back in May, Sesko said: \"The club has given me a lot and continues to give me a lot every day. It's a great club to develop at. I'm currently a player for RB Leipzig, so I'm taking it day by day. If a transfer happens, and if it doesn’t, then it doesn't.\""

      "Newcastle United are weighing up a potential move for Benjamin Sesko after walking away from talks to sign Hugo Ekitike.",
      "The club had explored a deal with Eintracht Frankfurt but have now ended their interest in the French striker. According to TBR Football, no formal bid was made, with sources at Newcastle suggesting the valuation was too high.",
      "The Carabao Cup winners have been forced to explore their options, with Liverpool courting Alexander Isak despite his £130m price tag.",
      "Sesko, who scored 21 goals and added six assists across 45 appearances for RB Leipzig last season, is now one of several options under consideration, according to the same report.",
      "The 22-year-old had been a key target for Arsenal earlier in the summer, but their attention has shifted to Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres following a breakthrough in talks.",
      "That shift has created an opening for other clubs. Intermediaries are understood to have offered Sesko to a number of Premier League sides, with Man Utd, Chelsea and Liverpool all linked in recent weeks.",
      "Newcastle are now thought to be assessing whether a deal is possible, particularly with limited value elsewhere in the current striker market.",
      "Leipzig reportedly demanded around £78 million when Arsenal were in discussions, and it’s unclear whether that valuation has changed.",

      "Sesko is said to be open to remaining in Germany but would consider a move to the Premier League if the right opportunity arose. He joined Leipzig from Red Bull Salzburg in 2023 and has quickly established himself as one of the most talked-about young forwards in the Bundesliga.",
      "The Slovenian forward recently took to Instagram to share snaps of himself modelling Leipzig’s new kit for the coming soon, suggesting a willingness to stay.",

      "A deal for Bryan Mbeumo is proving trickier than Man Utd would have hoped with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe refusing to reach the £70m that Brentford want to allow the Cameroon international to leave.",
      "And now Man Utd are looking to accelerate some exits from the club with Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho among the players the Red Devils are looking to offload this summer.",

      "Man Utd boss Amorim ‘has suggested Fermin Lopez as a possible bargaining chip in the deal, something Barca has categorically ruled out’.",
      "Amorim has given the ‘green light’ for Rashford to leave but he ‘not willing to accept a loan, which is the option Barca is proposing due to their financial constraints’.",
      "The report adds: ‘As things stand, Fermin’s inclusion in the conversation has been seen as a non-negotiable red line , further complicating an already seemingly difficult deal. The message from Barcelona is clear: Rashford yes, but not at any price, and much less if it means losing a jewel of the club like Fermin Lopez .’",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham doesn’t think Rashford deserves a move to Barcelona after failing to perform for the Red Devils in recent times.",
      "Sheringham told Sky Bet: “If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you’re there, you appreciate it. You don’t throw it away and say you want to leave.",
      "“I find the whole episode very soul-destroying, compared to the way I was back in the day and how I strove to get the privilege to play for such a huge football club.",
      "“To hear someone talking the way he is talking, saying he wants out – I didn’t like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doing that at Arsenal, I thought it was soul-destroying, and I hope Rashford doesn’t get the move that he’s hankering for. From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that’s a step up that he hasn’t deserved.”",
      "On the need to sell before Man Utd can buy, Sheringham added: “Manchester United did a lot of business at the start of the window – they got Matheus Cunha in and there was also talk about Bryan Mbeumo joining from Brentford. It was an exciting time, and it sounded like they’d have a right go this summer, but then it stagnated.",
      "“This stagnation has probably got a lot to do with the players that need to get out of the door this summer. When you’re trying to get players out of your football club that don’t want to be there, that’s probably one of the hardest parts of management, especially when they are on big money.",
      "“There is a lot of money they need to get off the wage bill before they start buying more players. The owners probably thought it would be easier to offload these players to other clubs, but they’re finding it hard – that’s the problem.”",
      "Juventus are also interested in bringing Marcus Rashford to Serie A this summer after edging closer to a deal for Jadon Sancho, according to reports.",

      "Man Utd and Marcus Rashford are at odds again as INEOS refuse to facilitate his move to Barcelona amid Jose Mourinho’s complicated involvement.",

      "It’s a Manchester United-heavy Mediawatch today, with absolutely everything (absolutely nothing) changing in their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "Learn to turn\nThe Mirror bring us the latest update from Manchester United’s frankly interminable quest to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "MBEU-NO! Brentford star’s protracted Man Utd transfer takes fresh U-turn as new Bees boss Andrews puts his foot down with Red Devils wanting to wrap up deal",
      "That’s the almost Mail-length headline that parps out at you from the Mirror’s football homepage this morning.",
      "The story itself has a slightly less parpy version, but it says much the same thing.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo to Man Utd transfer U-turn as manager privately changes things",
      "Mediawatch has largely given up on its dispiritingly futile campaign Words Have Meanings but we can’t help but reopen it for one day only.",
      "We’ve learned to be wary of assuming anything, but we are reasonably confident that the idea of a U-turn is widely understood. It represents at the very least a significant change in policy or point or view and ideally a complete reversal from that previously held position.",
      "As the Mirror themselves state, the problem for United getting the Mbeumo deal done has been that Brentford have stuck to their initial valuation and refused to budge.",
      "The Red Devils have seen several bids for the Cameroon forward rejected, the last being £60million, with the Bees sticking robustly to their valuation. The two parties remain millions apart in their respective figures and the change in the dugout has not helped.",
      "So what’s changed from the Brentford side here to represent a U-turn? Over to their director of football Phil Giles.",
      "‘We’ve made our point clear. If Bryan earned a massive move now and it was right for us financially, we’d be open to it. But if he ended up here with us next season, I wouldn’t be massively surprised. We’d be delighted. And it would save me a massive headache, frankly.’",
      "So Brentford’s position has U-turned all the way from ‘We are willing to sell him but only at a price that’s right for us’ to ‘We are willing to sell him but only at a price that’s right for us’.",
      "It’s all driving us round the U-bend.",
      "",
      "Tag nuts\nThe Mbeumo nonsense doesn’t end there, we’re afraid. It’s off to The Sun next on this magical mystery tour.",
      "Man Utd ‘refusing to be held to ransom’ as Brentford increase price tag for 20-goal star Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Have they? Have their increased their asking price? Let’s see.",
      "According to The Guardian, at the end of June Man Utd director of football, Jason Wilcox, believed a package of £65m would be enough to strike a deal.",
      "But since then, Brentford have raised their price for the attacker – who reported for pre-season training this week – closer to £70m.",
      "Not quite, is it? Clearly, £65m isn’t a number Man United have plucked out of thin air, but their believing it would be enough doesn’t mean Brentford’s actual asking price being ‘closer to £70m’ constitutes an increase in price tag.",
      "While we’re here, we’re also going to point out that wanting to buy a footballer for one price and his current football club insisting the actual price is slightly higher actually does not in any way constitute being ‘held to ransom’.",
      "Now Mediawatch has pointed that out, we know we can sit back comfortably, secure in the knowledge we will never ever see it again. It’s always worked that way before when we grind our teeth to dust about this kind of thing.",
      "Still, though. There’s undeniably an interesting dynamic that is present in almost all the reports around Mbeumo and Brentford and United today, and that’s the framing of Brentford as being the problem.",
      "Their position with regards to any potential sale of Mbeumo has been almost entirely consistent and thoroughly reasonable (‘We’ll sell, but only at our price’) throughout the summer, yet they are the ones portrayed as moving the goalposts with non-existent or wildly exaggerated U-turns and price-tag chicanery.",
      "Mediawatch cheerfully admits to being a massive cynic yet also tries to avoid ever descending too far down Tinfoil Hat Alley. But it’s impossibly tempting this morning to see the hand of one club attempting to steer the media towards a certain narrative here, if one is so inclined.",
      "",
      "One of Manchester United’s weakest squad areas is now their strongest after three transfers",
      "One area of the Manchester United squad that almost certainly will not be addressed this summer is central defence.",
      "United have signed at least one centre back in seven of the past nine summer transfer windows. Three came in last season alone.",
      "That’s where the headline came from, anyway.",
      "After Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt joined in the summer, Ayden Heaven followed in the winter. In between, the one-year extension in Harry Maguire’s contract was triggered.",
      "Once Lisandro Martinez has recovered from his anterior cruciate ligament injury, United will have five specialist centre halves with an average age of 24. Two are homegrown and three from overseas.",
      "That’s a fairly liberal coating of gloss applied to a brutal injury. Not United’s fault, of course, but the idea that the centre-back cupboards are overflowing while such a key defender is recovering from such a significant injury feels slightly over-optimistic.",
      "But it’s that average age we’re interested in. The devil is in the detail when it comes to average age, because 24 sounds absolutely ideal doesn’t it? That’s a great age for a player, carrying as it does the idea of having reached a particular level of experience and ability to be a reliable senior first-team player, while also still potentially approaching the peak with many years still ahead of you.",
      "Of course you want lots of 24-year-old players. But an average age of 24 doesn’t actually mean lots of players who are 24. And in the case of the five players here, you’re actually looking at players who are 18, 19, 25, 27 and 32. That’s suddenly two very inexperienced teenagers, one player nearing the end of his career and only two at or approaching their potential peak, one of whom is also on the road back from a very, very serious injury.",
      "Centre-back is absolutely not be the most pressing area of Man United concern right now, but we’d humbly contend that this is because other areas are more conspicuously f*cked than United having locked this particular area down for the next decade by being so brilliant.",
      "",
      "Strike it lucky\nAnd this Daily Express headline caught Mediawatch’s eye this morning",
      "Man Utd can strike clever Pervis Estupinan swap deal and solve Ruben Amorim headache",
      "Given everything we know about Manchester United and swap deals, we’re going to just go right ahead and say it: no, they can’t.",
      "Oh, and it’s Antony, by the way. If you’re interested. Because one news site in Brazil says they might have expressed some interest at some point in signing a player who is desperate to join Real Betis.",
      "Man Utd are not budging on their valuation of Bryan Mbeumo this summer even if it means moving on to different targets, according to reports.",

      "West Ham\nOUT: Graham Potter\nIN: Gareth Southgate",
      "It does seem far easier to envision a scenario where Graham Potter gets himself very quickly in very deep trouble at West Ham. He’s not been there long but has no real credit in the bank, while Howe has absolutely loads of it.",
      "We’ve said before that Potter and West Ham are perhaps the most interesting manager-club storyline of all heading into this season, because it feels like the one with the biggest range of realistic possible outcomes.",
      "Potter sacked by October feels entirely believable. Potter winning three manager of the month awards in a row with West Ham third in the table in October feels entirely believable too.",
      "But if it is indeed the former, where do West Ham turn next? They’ve tried Moyes and a Spanish Moyes and didn’t care for either. They’ve tried a coach’s coach. Again, does feel like the next step could be almost anything from anywhere.",
      "Almost every other name we’ve got on this list for someone else also feels like they could very much also end this season in the London Stadium dugout with all bubbles floating around them.",
      "We’re going with Gareth Southgate, though. A man so indelibly linked with the England job is perfect for a club that still bases around 63 per cent of its identity on ‘winning the World Cup’ in 1966. The remaining 37 per cent is split between Danny Dyer, the aforementioned bubbles, and disliking Tottenham. Just if you were wondering.",

      "Manchester United\nOUT: Ruben Amorim\nIN: Xavi",
      "It does rather look like Sir Scrooge McRatcliffe and his merry band of disruptors might be making another complete bollocks of another summer, which is absolutely delicious.",
      "They’ve managed to sign precisely one first-team player for a squad in very obvious need of far more significant surgery to give the manager they chose knowing full well how his teams played any kind of fighting chance of success.",
      "Matheus Cunha is a wonderful player, and we’re very excited to see him step up to a big club. But there’s also no denying that part of that excitement is because he is a very loose maverick who is liable to do something very batsh*t that, combined as it now is with the Manchester United spotlight, comes to dominate the news agenda for several days/weeks.",
      "And… that’s it. That’s all they’ve managed to do. Ruben Amorim, the manager in most obviously conspicuous need of getting a squad that is his and a pre-season with them is going to get neither of those things. And he’s still going to have Casemiro as his midfielder by the looks of it.",
      "So yes, the chance of another managerial search on the red side of Manchester this season is definitely very, very real, and there are only so many viable candidates for a club with their wild combination of heft and stupidity.",
      "It’s starting to look a little bit like it might almost be an impossible job, on the straightforward basis that anyone who’s actually willing to take it on has already in that act itself proved themselves unsuitable.",
      "So who knows where United turn next if turn they must. We’ve gone for Xavi on the basis that he is currently available and thus doesn’t require buying out of any current contract and does at least have ample experience of dealing with a football club that is ridiculously massive and massively ridiculous.",
      "",
      "Wolves\nOUT: Vitor Pereira\nIN: Sergio Conceicao",
      "Because he is Portuguese and a football manager. Next.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest\nOUT: Nuno Espirito Santo\nIN: Edin Terzic",
      "Easy to forget in the middle of a summer when Evangelos Marinakis has been so busy grassing up Crystal Palace to UEFA and throwing a strop because someone found out about a release clause that towards the end of last season he was having on-pitch arguments with the manager who had turned his relegation-threatened club into European challengers.",
      "So yes, while it may seem ridiculous it is entirely fair to say Nuno Espirito Santo is indeed Ralph Wiggum sat on a school bus at this point. Especially if the delicate balancing act between domestic and European exertions proves taxing. Especially as those European exertions will now be at the higher Europa League level.",
      "Simply being in Europe at all raises another problem for Nuno on the ‘victim of own success’ front in that it does mean the potential for Forest to be looking at a different level of manager than they could have considered previously.",
      "Former Dortmund manager Terzic is one such, and a man who has knocked about the top 10 contenders lists for at least half-a-dozen Premier League jobs in the last couple of years.",
      "",
      "Burnley\nOUT: Scott Parker\nIN: Sean Dyche",
      "When Scott Parker’s guileless attempts to bring his new sufferball antics from Championship to Premier League go inevitably and catastrophically awry, why do anything other than bring in the absolute master to show how it’s done. Step aside, McDonald’s Boy. This is job for gravel voices, disc beards and lard.",
      "",
      "Sunderland\nOUT: Regis Le Bris\nIN: Gary O’Neil",
      "O’Neil’s burgeoning reputation took a pretty hefty hit last season, especially when his failure to get anything out of that talented Wolves squad was compounded by Vitor Pereira getting a really quite compelling tune out of them for a really quite extended period of time, but he is still a man who despite limited Premier League experience has received two hospital passes and managed to make a decent job of both.",
      "Bournemouth and Wolves both looked in a dreadful mess when he took over and, while both have now taken leaps forward since moving on from O’Neil they would both surely acknowledge that they wouldn’t be in the position they are without his firefighting efforts.",
      "It’s a very useful skill – and reputation – to have. Every Premier League season now that doesn’t begin with O’Neil already gainfully employed will inevitably see him instantly linked with any club that quickly appears to be beyond all help.",
      "And this season that could be a lot of clubs. For ease, we’re just going with the most obvious here, with O’Neil set in our minds to replace Regis Le Bris as early as mid-September just days after Speaking Well, I Thought on MNF about the avoidable errors the Black Cats made in a 7-0 defeat at Crystal Palace.",
      "",
      "Brentford \nOUT: Keith Andrews\nIN: Kjetil Knutsen",
      "We wish Keith Andrews absolutely no ill will and would be delighted to be proved entirely and decisively wrong on this one, but we simply cannot recall a managerial appointment or set of circumstances more obviously doomed to failure.",
      "The desire for continuity is admirable, but continuity of coaching only really works if you also have continuity of players, and that is not a luxury the Premier League’s biggest clubs are minded to allow Brentford at this time.",
      "The other problem with promoting from within is that it also doesn’t really work if your departing manager takes five of his senior backroom staff with him to his new job and you end up having to promote the set-piece coach.",
      "Sure, we all know that set-piece coaches are the order of the day right now because of that fella at Arsenal who tells Declan Rice to take good corners and free-kicks, but we’re not really sure the set-piece coach is the obvious manager-in-waiting in any sensible coaching set-up.",
      "What Brentford surely needed was a manager with some experience of actual management, and notably of overachieving with a smaller club.",
      "Kjetil Knutsen has done all that and more in his transformative time at the helm of Bodo/Glimt, a club who have come to dominate Norwegian football without any of the usual surrounding unpleasantnesses that come with teams that emerge from basically nowhere to dominate a country’s football.",
      "",
      "Leeds\nOUT: Daniel Farke\nIN: Ange Postecoglou",
      "Leeds’ last successful crack at Premier League football didn’t last all that long but it was absolutely joyous while it did.",
      "The inspirational Marcelo Bielsa got Leeds back into the Premier League and then kept them there with great ease and enormous style. Leeds would eventually finish ninth in the 2020/21 table having given the season many of its most memorable moments.",
      "They scored more goals than fourth-placed Chelsea, and conceded more goals than 16th-placed Brighton.",
      "It all unravelled the following season, but forget about that for now. The point is that the last time Leeds had a good Premier League season, which is also the only time Leeds have had a good Premier League season since the very earliest days of the 21st century, they did it by unapologetically playing front-foot, attack-first-and-ask-questions-later football that led to more than enough memorably thrilling wins to counteract the inevitably dismal-looking defeats that attempting such football at such an elevated level inevitably brings.",
      "In short: it’s who they were, mate.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made the ‘fastest move’ as they look to fend off competition from rivals to sign a £45m Premier League star.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘frustrated’ at how this summer transfer window is going for Manchester United after making two ‘priority demands’.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has set a clear ‘deadline’ for Manchester United to complete their third summer signing.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘weighing up’ a ‘reunion’ for one of Ruben Amorim’s former Sporting CP stars, as it’s felt they will ‘listen to offers’.",
      "That an access-all-areas documentary about Man Utd next season was given the consideration it was shows again the size of the job before Ruben Amorim…",
      "Why are giving Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim excuses to be terrible? Plus, more on Spurs, Arsenal and Diogo Jota."

      "Aston Villa will move for a Man Utd target if Chelsea take one of their forwards, while Juve take their pick of the Old Trafford outcasts…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Juventus\nSky in Italy reckon Juve have ‘begun to explore the conditions’ around a deal to sign Rashford. Which is presumably when they discover they can’t afford him without one or two parties making serious concessions. Like Barcelona, the Old Lady would have to wait until United get desperate and start considering loans.",
      "",
      "19) 🔼 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao which, presumably, will supress the Old Lady’s appetite for Sancho. And with the talk of Juve interest in Rashford, what now for Sancho?",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Aston Villa\nJackson was rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United but Unai Emery is said to be keen to be reunited with the striker with whom he worked at Villarreal. Villa’s interest in Jackson is heavily linked to…",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Chelsea\nRogers is said to be Chelsea priority for the remainder of the window and while Villa are reluctant to sell, any big offer would have to be considered. If Rogers is to join Chelsea, likely triggering a Villa move for Jackson, it won’t be long before the end of the window.",
      "",
      "16) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern have made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool won’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, but £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, but it feels very unlikely the two clubs will compromise while they stand £30million apart in their current valuations. Diaz may have to force the issue.",

      "15) Pervis Estupinan – Brighton to Manchester United\nUnited have held talks with the left-back, according to Talksport, though AC Milan are also sniffing around a player Brighton seem happy to sell since they’ve already bought Maxim De Cuyper from Club Brugge. The one signing they made in January was a left wing-back, though Patrick Dorgu showed almost nothing in his half-season so far.",
      "",
      "14) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "13) Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Bayern Munich\nWith Arsenal looking to sign players in the positions Trossard plays, it makes sense that they cash in on the attacker. Who just so happened to change his representatives this summer to a fella well connected with the German big-hitters. Trossard has two years remaining on his contract and would be around half the price of Diaz.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere…",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nIt seemed as though United were at fault for this dragging as long as it has but now we hear of Brentford increasing their demand to £70million. Perhaps as a consequence of their own frustration at United’s lack of decisiveness. The Red Devils appear determined not to go over £65million, but Brentford’s show of strength could prompt them to get to their maximum a little faster.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool were rebuffed in their initial enquiry but we doubt they took ‘no’ as a final answer. We can still imagine a deal happening if the Reds say they will step back from Ekitike – and if Isak agitates for the move.",
      "",
      "7) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Newcastle\nSome reports at the start of the week suggested Ekitike’s agents were in Newcastle, others say a Toon delegation was in Germany. Whatever. Talks were certainly taking place, which apparently involved Eintracht saying ‘nein’ to Newcastle’s opening bid of £70million. It has always been reported that the Germans want more for the forward, perhaps as much as £85million. And they will feel emboldened by the bidding battle that could ensue since Liverpool are determined to ‘go to war’, according to The Telegraph.",
      "",
      "6) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nLiverpool heard the rejection of their advances on Alexander Isak and reacted with violence by targeting the striker Newcastle crave. We make Liverpool favourites here on the basis they have greater spending power. We assume so since they were willing to make a record bid for Isak. And also because Liverpool are the more attractive option right now. That’s not to denigrate Newcastle – it’s an exciting time up there too – but Liverpool have strengthened significantly as champions. Of course everyone else is playing catch up.",
      "",
      "5) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there. And Mosquera’s farewell message suggests it is heading in the right direction.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion amid reports a deal has finally been agreed between the two clubs. Indeed, Gyokeres’ representatives are in London now though a five-year contract was agreed weeks ago.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger will be unveiled by Arsenal any time now after a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

Anyone who’s ever spent much time in the mailbox knows there’ve been endless Liverpool net spend, salary spend, discussion since the mid 2000s at least. That’s because, for all of them being one of the biggest clubs in the world since Shankly did his thing, they’ve rarely spent like it. Hells, they’ve rarely had the ability to spend like it.",
      "When we were linked to Wirtz, I didn’t believe it. And continued to not really believe until it was firmly established as happening. And this is after bidding a billion on Caicedo a couple of years ago. The idea we’d get one of the best and brightest in the world is just foreign to me. I’m used to them either being much younger (and bigger gambles) previously failed (and so not trusted) or just being a relative unknown.",
      "Doing it once was crazy. Barely credible. We’d signed that level player two or three times since 2000. To do it twice in a window is madness. I’m giddy that it seems real. Wild.",
      "And yet, winning the league is hard. Winning it twice in a row is even harder. As much as I’ll never let a City fan forget how much (alleged) cheating was involved putting that group together, it’s still an accomplishment to do what they did on the field.",
      "Here’s the list of people who done it since WW2: Pep, Fergie (a lot), Jose (once), Paisley, Busby, Bob Jackson and Stan Cullis.",
      "Dalgish didn’t. Wenger didn’t. Shankley didn’t. Clough didn’t. Revie didn’t.",
      "Maybe if Slot wins another league, I’d be thinking differently. The hedonic treadmill is real. But right now, if you said “win the league but embarrassing lose in every other cup competition”, I’d bite your hand off.",

      "I can tell you honestly that never made me personally entitled. I have always found the specific moments and the experiences bigger than the actual trophy presentations. Hard to explain but Macheda scoring against Villa is a much bigger memory for me at OT than any of the title presentations. Raw emotion. Same recently with Maguire against Lyon watching it on TV. Not winning Europa in the end was disappointing obviously, but that moment was very special.",
      "For me as well, Henry and Bergkamp were two of the most special players to ever play the game. I can see a bit beyond blind loyalty. So with all this said just wanted to say that hand on heart, I cannot believe in a sports, business, hobby or even a fantasy gaming environment that anyone could do a worse job of running a football club than Sir Jim Radcliffe. We are extremely lucky that football really is not “life or death”.",
      "It would take me in my professional life between 1 to 2 hours to agree an internal budget for any asset on Earth and then a workshop lasting maybe 2 to 3 hours to negotiate that sale.",
      "Some of you need to think how long a drunk conversation takes in a pub to come up with a list of players you could realistically sign for your club and how much they would cost and then translate that in to ultra high value individuals backed by legal council doing it. It is a disgrace that an institution like Manchester United can ever have been brought to this. Please feel free to laugh at us but at some point, it would be good to worry about if it can happen to us who is next? Because we were rich as a business without oil and successful as a team with players no one else rated and they still ruined us because they could.",

All our best players since the Abu Dhabi era like Kompany, Aguero, Kevin, Rodri, Haaland etc were all bought, not developed. Barcelona seem to actively push their academy players in the playing 11, our academy seems to be a sort of profit machine i.e. A mini Benfica or Dortmund.",
      "It’s a bit sad to see these players like James McAtee come to the realisation, that after so many years at the academy, it’s next to impossible to get in the playing 11. I feel that Foden could burn the PL if he played for United or Tottenham, where he would probably be the biggest star. Here it will be difficult for a mercurial no 10, simply because it will be his responsibility to feed the best striker in the world. If he doesn’t do that properly enough, Cherki and Reijnders are just waiting for that spot.",
      "Ultimately, No point whining about these problems, the team does its main job quite professionally i.e actually winning things (never mind last season).

      "Manchester United have ‘turned their attention’ to a potential Chelsea swap as Sir Jim Ratcliffe refuses to be ‘pushed’ into a deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United completed a £62.5m deal for Matheus Cunha early in the window, while Diego Leon has also joined for £3.3m, but they’ve gone weeks without getting another transfer over the line as the club chiefs put all their efforts into landing Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "They’ve so far had two bids rejected, the latest thought to be worth £62.5m, but transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insisted last week that the “deal is absolutely alive”.",
      "He said: “The contacts are still ongoing between United, Brentford, people involved in the deal. Mbeumo still wants to go to Manchester United, and the club maintains their confidence, their optimism, to get the green light and sign Bryan Mbeumo in the next days.",
      "“So still no breakthrough in this story as of tonight but Manchester United keep advancing to find the right structure for the deal. They are working on easy and difficult add-ons, trying to make Brentford happy with their final proposal. So Man United are still on it. The Bryan Mbeumo deal is absolutely alive at this moment.”",
      "But The Guardian claimed on Wednesday that the Red Devils’ ‘push to buy Bryan Mbeumo has stalled after Brentford raised their valuation to closer to £70m, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe intent on not being pushed into paying more than his club’s £65m valuation of the forward’.",
      "After it was known that Mbeumo wanted to join Man Utd, Brentford ‘privately indicated a medical was expected imminently’ but now both Ratcliffe and technical director Jason Wilcox ‘do not wish to be held to ransom and are determined to be patient’.",
      "And now The i Paper claim ‘United have turned their attentions to Jackson as they desperately look to add firepower to their underperforming strike force’.",
      "While no bids have been made yet, ‘interest is there, especially if he can be acquired at a knockdown price’ on the back of Chelsea signing both Joao Pedro and Liam Delap this summer to compete for his No.9 spot in Enzo Maresca’s starting XI.",
      "And the report claims Jackson could ‘trade places’ with Alejandro Garnacho, who ‘retain an admiration for how Garnacho carries the ball and his willingness to take on defenders’, despite Chelsea making Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers their ‘top target’.",
      "Reports in Spain also claim Chelsea have ‘offered’ Real Madrid Jackson in a ‘direct exchange’ for Arsenal and Liverpool target Rodrygo.",
      "The i Paper states that Chelsea and United value their respective assets at around the £60m mark, though both are thought to be open to price reductions.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Both United and Chelsea would prefer straight player sales, especially United, given Garnacho is an academy graduate and any revenue generated goes down as pure profit in the eyes of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "‘However, one source admitted some form of swap agreement could see both deals come to fruition.’",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been left out of Man Utd’s pre-season plans as three Premier League clubs consider a summer transfer.",

      "We’ve given Man Utd, Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle and Arsenal a hand with a neat five-club forward swap deal to suit (almost) all parties…",
      "Chelsea have ‘reignited talks’ with the Man Utd outcast, who has ‘rejected’ a big-money move to Saudi Arabia to stay in the Premier League.",

      "Joao Pedro, Anthony Elanga and Mohammed Kudus have joined the legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m, with more deals to come.",
      "This is the summer of the intra-Premier League transfer but Alexander Isak and others considering future employers closer to home have some way to go to reach this list.",
      "",
      "25) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "24) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "23) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "22) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "21) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "20) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "19) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "18) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "A new report has revealed the ‘most realistic solution’ for Manchester City and England star Jack Grealish amid interest from Premier League rivals.",
      "Jack Grealish looks destined to leave Man City this summer but a £300k-a-week wage has made it hard for clubs to take the risk.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Every Cruyff turn is a footprint. Some players leave lasting impressions; others barely register. Was peak Eden Hazard the very best?"

      "Garnacho is one of Man Utd’s most talented youngsters, but his poor attitude has limited his development over the past 12 months.",

      "Man Utd opened the door to him leaving in January as they looked to sanction pure profit sales to raise funds, but a move to Napoli did not go through as the Premier League giants set an audacious asking price of around £70m.",
      "Garnacho was only a bit-part player during the run-in and the final straw came via United’s loss in the Europa League final, as the winger only made a brief 20-minute cameo off the bench against Spurs.",

      "He subsequently hit out at Man Utd over their poor season, with Amorim’s response to inform the winger that he needs to ‘find a new club’ this summer.",
      "Unite’s clear desperation to sell has provided a stumbling block for Amorim’s side as Garnacho’s long-term future remains uncertain.",

However, CaughtOffside have been informed that Aston Villa remain one to watch in the Garnacho transfer saga, with the player himself also keen to stay in the Premier League.’",

      "Rashford and Amorim reportedly butted heads over his attitude issues and the 27-year-old was left out of United’s squad for December’s Manchester derby before announcing his intention to leave his boyhood club in January.",

      "",
      "Arsenal – Raheem Sterling\n“Those players have been inspired by top players, top professionals, ruthless winners for many years,” Mikel Arteta said of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko shortly after their arrival from Manchester City.",
      "“They were looking at them, and now it’s their turn to do the same and inspire those younger players that we have in our squad to do the same and to show them what it takes to win, and the level of detail, hunger and dedication that you need to keep winning.”",
      "The pair were integral in one of a great many Arsenal phases which transformed them from European qualification also-rans to Premier League challengers. Raheem Sterling, who won 10 trophies alongside both at Manchester City, was rather less impactful.",

      "Aston Villa – Ashley Young\nTwo Aston Villa managers in successive summers deemed Young an integral part of their plans but Unai Emery weirdly does not share the vision of Dean Smith or Steven Gerrard.",
      "“The decision was tactical. It is always about how we can continue developing here,” the Spaniard said after Young’s contract was allowed to expire, the veteran having dragged himself up to ninth for all-time Premier League appearances as a Villa player.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth – Gary Cahill\n“I’ve achieved things I once dreamt of,” said Cahill upon his retirement in November 2022. Beyond the two Premier League titles, pair of FA Cups, Champions League trophy, PFA Team of the Year appearances and 61 England caps, he was probably talking about inspiring Bournemouth to promotion in his final act as a professional.",
      "",
      "Brentford – Jordan Henderson\nThis has been a watershed summer for Brentford even beyond the departure of Thomas Frank.",
      "The Bees had never previously signed a former Premier League winner, with Arsenal favourite, infrequent captain and perennial long-ball provider for Alan Smith knockdowns Paul Davis the last English top-flight champion signed by Brentford.",
      "That was that even as they rose through the league pyramid. But no sooner had the bus stop in Hounslow welcomed one former winner in Caoimhin Kelleher than a second came along in fellow Liverpool alumnus Henderson.",
      "",

      "Scott Parker will hope the right-back calls on the nous from his first six or so years at Manchester City rather than the final two.",
      "",
      "Brighton – James Milner\nTheir main strength might be extracting millions from Chelsea but Brighton have also tapped into the unique experience provided by serial trophy hoarders like few other clubs.",
      "Adam Lallana was leaned on particularly heavily by Roberto De Zerbi as he started to transition into a coaching role. Fabian Hurzeler has called Danny Welbeck his “connector trying to help everyone” and someone he himself “can learn from” due to his more limited career as a player.",
      "But Milner is the “leader”, the “role model in preparing himself for training and doing good regeneration”. And he almost certainly still wins the Brighton lactate test after extending his contract last month.",
      "",
      "Chelsea – Cole Palmer\nThe Chelsea transfer ethos tends to value young South Americanness far higher than experienced trophy-winning veterancy, but the opportunistic Palmer signing blended the lines somewhat.",
      "While far from a regular in the Manchester City Treble season, Palmer’s 25 appearances included 14 in the Premier League in a contribution more than worth the medals he gave his mum to “clear them out so I can stock up again”.",
      "After a slow start on that front at Chelsea there are Conference League and Club World Cup honours to add to the collection before PSG sign him for a world-record fee.",

      "The keeper had played nine games heading into the final day against Everton and even though the Gunners had wrapped up the title, Richard Wright was given the nod.",
      "Taylor was made to wait until the 86th minute before coming on as a substitute. And he still conceded. Then he joined David Hockaday’s Leeds in 2014. Not sure which is more embarrassing.",

      "Liverpool – Alex Manninger\nAnother back-up to David Seaman, it required special dispensation from the Premier League itself to grant Manninger a medal for his services to Arsenal’s first Premier League title push.",
      "The Austrian waited patiently for his opportunity in north London, the first of which came about in late January 1998 with an injury to Seaman. Manninger played six league games and kept a clean sheet in each, including a famous victory at Old Trafford, before being named Player of the Month for March.",
      "Unable to earn the gloves long term, Manninger embarked on a journeyman career which brought him back to England almost two decades later for a season with Liverpool before retirement, joining in the same summer as Sadio Mane, Joel Matip and Georginio Wijnaldum.",
      "",
      "Manchester City – Ilkay Gundogan\nPep Guardiola deemed it enough of a mistake to bring Gundogan back within a year when Manchester City did little to prevent his departure for Barcelona in 2023.",
      "The player himself might well have regretted his return when he made 54 appearances in a gruelling and often chastening season, at the end of which interest from Turkey might have looked awfully enticing.",
      "",
      "Manchester United – Jonny Evans\nUnless Ruben Amorim develops a sudden urge to sign Alexander Buttner, this will be the first season Manchester United have no Premier League winner in their squad since 1992/93, and the first Manchester United squad containing no-one who played under Sir Alex Ferguson since 1974.",
      "Fair play to Jonny Evans for keeping those records intact while “hammering” his teammates in a WhatsApp group with Rio Ferdinand and Anderson.",

      "Newcastle United – Sol Campbell\nIn the world of inconceivable team-mates, Campbell and Andy Carroll feels particularly difficult to picture.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest – Divock Origi\nLiverpool supporters can likely accurately describe 41 of the often pivotal and almost always slapstick goals scored by Origi for an English club; Forest fans would struggle to recall the 42nd, plundered in an ill-fated 22-game loan from AC Milan.",
      "",
      "Sunderland – Darron Gibson\n“I might be off my face in here but I still want to play for Sunderland,” Gibson told the disbelieving patrons of a bar in the aftermath of a heavy pre-season defeat to Celtic in August 2017, before identifying Lamine Kone, Jeremain Lens and Wahbi Khazri as being less enthused by the prospect of wearing the red-and-white stripes.",
      "Gibson had only joined the previous January as part of an unsuccessful bid for Premier League safety; by the following March he was released.",
      "",
      "Tottenham – Joe Hart\nJose Mourinho felt Hart was “the best English goalkeeper” as recently as April 2021 and the Portuguese was able to “sleep well” knowing he had a version of his ultimate favourite player: someone itching to prove Guardiola wrong.",
      "Hart did well when called upon, going unbeaten in his 10 appearances and keeping five clean sheets. But his lasting legacy in north London was to get the Spurs squad massively into cricket and for that he should be deeply ashamed.",
      "",
      "West Ham – Kalvin Phillips\nIt was claimed that West Ham coaches were ‘taken aback by his attitude in training and behind the scenes’ when Phillips was still in the middle of a disastrous 10-game loan spell from Manchester City.",
      "They were probably fairly surprised when Phillips was caught giving the middle finger to a fan who called him “useless” after one of his appearances. And it wasn’t even the one in which he was sent off for two yellow cards three minutes after coming on as a substitute.",
      "",
      "Wolves – Diego Costa\nNot only a free transfer which granted Costa the opportunity to net the single goal which dragged him above Efan Ekoku, Trevor Sinclair, Juan Mata and Darius Vassell in the all-time Premier League scoring stakes, but a perfect transfer of a man who remains unretired and thus likely to become the entrant for Manchester United on this list by September.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Former Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson will join Premier League side Brentford on a two-year deal after leaving Ajax, according to reports.",

      "Romano wrote on X: ‘EXCL: Liverpool made club to club approach with Newcastle to discuss record bid for Alexander Isak. If Isak won’t be available, Liverpool can enter Ekitike race. Decision up to Newcastle as they never wanted to sell Isak + offer new deal.’",

      "“So if Newcastle get Hugo Ekitike, Liverpool really want to try for Alexander Isak. That’s the mission for Liverpool.",
      "“Then if Alexander Isak will not be available on the market, Hugo Ekitike can be an option not only for Newcastle who wanted Ekitike and want Ekitike not based on what happens with Isak but in any case they believe they can play together and that could be also part of succession plan for the future of the club, but they wanted Ekitike, that’s the point. Full stop.",

      "“But for sure Liverpool want to try for their dream target with an eventual club record bid. So Liverpool are really intentioned to try and they made an approach, direct approach with Newcastle.",
      "“Then if they can’t get Isak, Ekitike could be an option for Liverpool while Newcastle are working on the deal because Newcastle at the moment are the only club that presented an official bid and are in negotiations with his agents and with Eintracht, so let’s see what’s going to happen there between Newcastle and Liverpool in this story for Ekitike.",
      "“But also in this story for Alexander Isak. That would be massive. That would be incredible for Liverpool.",
      "“They are actually trying but of course this is in the hands of Newcastle. Newcastle always wanted to keep the player, promise to the player that they want to offer him a really important new contract with a huge salary, but obviously now is in the hands of Newcastle to decide what they want to do because Liverpool for Alexander Isak are trying.",
      "“So they want to make something crazy happen that would be very difficult. They know that. But it depends on Newcastle.",
      "“The approach has been made. Otherwise, Hugo Ekitike remains one of the options in the list at Liverpool for this summer transfer window.”",

      "Send your views to theeditor@football365.com. Maybe read the mood rankings first.",
      "",
      "What is this Big Six business?\nCan we please have a chat about the Big Six Premier league clubs in advance of the new season. I keep on reading it and my brain does a fart every time I do. It makes no sense to me.",
      "By definition the Big Six should be a clearly demarcated separate group that are out in front of the pack, no?",
      "So we have based on last year’s table: Liverpool, Arsenal, City, Chelsea, Newcastle. So far so clear for me. Although there is very little point separation between Chelsea, Newcastle and Villa and Forest just behind them. Both Villa and Forest have very strong squads and a good financial setup. But I presume they are not included in the Big Six as there are two of them.",
      "So to drop the pretence of ignorance I presume United are the final Big Six club when I read it. Does everyone think this? Historically and financially they warrant their place undoubtedly but in terms of league position they obviously finished 15th and are not playing in Europe next year. But if they are included should we not include Spurs? They finished 17th and have a massive stadium and were in the top 4 not that long ago.",
      "Oh but you say it’s United’s spending power in the market. Is it though? They have signed one player this summer and appeared to have struggled thereafter. Spurs seem much more successful and proactive and comparable to the activity of the ‘Big Five’.",
      "To me United’s inclusion feels like a three-card trick we have all fallen for. So in summary league position matters for the top 5 but not the 6th position. History matters but only for 6th not 5th place and spending power matters but not what you spend it on or on who wants to join you.",
      "Simples.",
      "That’s the Big Six sorted.\nDave LFC",
      "(You are – wilfully or otherwise – confusing the top six with the Big Six. We are basically talking about the six clubs in the Premier League with the highest revenue which are – according to Deloitte – Man City, Man Utd, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea. Newcastle are sixth but their revenue is less than half that of Man Utd – Ed)",
      "",
      "We’re all just the Washington Generals. Or Ernie Wise.\nInteresting reading Paco’s nonsense countered by common sense from James, Chris and especially Ken in today’s mailbox. Ken’s point about entertainment usurping sporting values struck a particular chord with me.",
      "Back in the 60s and 70s when I were just a lad, and we all lived in a box in a hole in t’middle of t’motorway fast lane (“luxury!” I hear you cry), there wasn’t much on the telly, but we’d get a few treats at Christmas. Big film TV premieres, Disney Time, Morecambe and Wise, Top of the Pops with the Christmas number one. For a few years, we also got to see The Harlem Globetrotters travelling basketball / entertainment team. They always played brilliant, entertaining basketball with wonderful trick shots, dribbling, ball juggling and comedy routines thrown in. Their opponents were routinely made to look foolish, and, in my naivety, I often wondered what was in it for them, why did they keep turning up and suffering the humiliation Meadowlark Lemon, Curly et al would inflict on them.",
      "Of course that’s what they were there for, paid stooges to make the Globetrotters look good, like Ernie Wise was mainly there to highlight Eric Morecambe’s comedy genius. It turns out they were another touring team called the Washington Generals set up purely for that purpose. It wasn’t intended to be genuine sport, it was pretend eye-candy for TV viewers around the world.",
      "So what’s this got to do with football? Well, as a Villa fan, my team has progressed far enough to become one of those knocking against the glass ceiling of the ever more entrenched “wealthy elite”. Those in the elite were fortunate enough to have either been successful when the PL rose to prominence and gained a global audience via Sky TV rights and the internet, or they were able to buy their way unrestricted into the club via incredibly wealthy owners.",
      "By the time Villa, Newcastle, Forest and a few other clubs acquired owners who were willing to invest heavily in their clubs, the football authorities made sure the ceiling was not only firmly in place but was made of PSR/FFP/115 reinforced bullet-proof glass. And the football authorities’ clear intent is to disarm outsiders of any tools capable of breaking it and killing or wounding their golden goose.",
      "Thus it has effectively created a mini-super league within the PL (notwithstanding the astounding capacity of United and to a lesser extent Spurs to monumentally screw things up despite every advantage) and, to my mind, this is intentional, driven by fear that the wealthier clubs will be tempted to join an actual super league by the likes of Real and Juventus if their positions aren’t protected within the PL and CL.",
      "As a consequence it increasingly feels like Villa, and other ambitious teams in similar and lesser positions, are simply there to make up the numbers. Two thirds of the PL just a bunch of Washington Generals and Ernie Wises, stooges only there to provide pseudo competition for the wealthy elite, to make them look good.",
      "Surely it is only a matter of time before Chelsea, Citeh and their European counterparts start working comedy routines, trick shots and ritual humiliations into their performances for the delight of plastics, glory hunters (yes I mean you Paco – why Chelsea Paco, and not Fulham or Brentford?) and casual TV viewers across the globe, safe in the knowledge that they will still win because the other guys are only there to lose to them.",
      "The Club World Cup is just the latest inevitable symptom and manifestation of this travelling circus approach. There’s money in it for FIFA, and there’s money in it for those who already have more than anyone else, and there is gratification for some of the global glory hunters who will be queuing up for more.",
      "The issue I have is that PL clubs have the power to change things but they don’t seem to want to. I can only imagine that some smaller PL clubs without mega wealthy owners don’t vote to amend or abolish FFP rules because they fear that the elite group would only get bigger and they still wouldn’t be in it . Or they fear it will “damage the product” if certain teams aren’t successful all the time. If that’s the case they deserve nothing more than regular humiliation at the hands of the big boys.",
      "Anyway how fitting that a club that’s been a clown car on fire for the last 2-3 seasons should win the CWC and that the world’s second biggest clown should be upstaged by clown number one at the trophy presentation. You couldn’t make it up.\nKevin Villa (my rants are getting longer as my patience wears thinner)",

      "Newcastle optimism still abounds\nI recently wrote in about my worries about NUFC’s transfer business, but right now I’m feeling a little silly. Our pursuit of João Pedro had me suspecting that Eddie Howe was pursuing the squad flexibility for a 442 or a 352; the sudden news that Ekitike was on the table makes me wonder why we ever bothered with Pedro. If Eintracht is compliant about payment structure, this could be a real coup, and I hope it goes through.",
      "Isak and Ekitike playing together could be madness in its own right, but the option of reverting to a front three when one is injured or misfiring is gold, as far as Eddie is concerned. Low blocks have flummoxed the Mags since he arrived, and he hasn’t previously had a Plan B. Elanga and Gordon will pin fullbacks wide if we play a 442, I could see Tonali and Bruno scoring a lot more goals in that system.",
      "If it’s Eddie and his son getting these deals done, Imma have to admit I’m impressed. Isak is going nowhere, whatever Liverpool supporters’ fever dreams tell them. I suspect, however, that either Barnes or Gordon would leave by January. Joe Willock to Manchester United has never been mooted, but it would be a decent move for them, West Ham, or any of the promoted sides. He seems fully engaged with the squad, but isn’t at his best as a squad player. As a recent article here pointed out, we’d be stupid to sell home-grown Sean Longstaff going into the UCL.",
      "But we definitely need a RCB. There’s been a lot of talk about Giorgio Scalvini, who has about as big an upside as I could hope for, but Marc Guehi would probably be available at a similar price, and he’s pretty reliably healthy. Tough call, but Newcastle hasn’t gotten many calls wrong since the takeover.\nChris C, Toon Army DC",

      "All indications?\nI wish I had Dion’s confidence when it came to transfers, but I would take issue with their suggestion that “all indications seem to suggest” Eberechi Eze will join Arsenal. In fact, I’d argue there is one crucial indication suggesting he won’t, so far, and that is Arsenal’s refusal to meet Crystal Palace’s valuation of one of their best players. A valuation, he says reaching for the drum, which will be based on the cost of replacing him with someone else’s best player, and them knowing Palace have just come into a lot of money.",

Holding AFTV against us at this point is about 5 years out of date (they’ve been an afterthought/meaningless for ages) and the social media/reaction game with other clubs has far evolved them at this point.",
      "Is the mood really 16th? Of course not, we’re going on a spending spree now that those of us who ground through the early Emirates era could only have dreamed of. The Gyokeres/Sesko debate/hysteria was fuelled as much from outside voices as the inside (it was never a clear choice between them and reasonable points for/against either). Sure, as a paid up member of Team Sesko, its a bit disappointing and I have some worries, but like 99.9% of normal fans, it isn’t hard to move past that and support Big Vic.",
      "There’s a lot riding on this season for sure, so nervous anticipation might be the best mood descriptor, but after last season, which felt like a series of cartoon anvils and grand pianos falling on our heads, I don’t think it’s too presumptuous to say we’re quite looking forward to going into a new campaign with real squad depth, a proper preseason and hopefully no immediate injuries.\nTom, Leyton",

      "…Thomas McConnell is right. Darwin is going to have a massive season and I put it down to his haircut. Mo went close-cropped last summer and had the best individual season in PL history, so now that Darwin has done the same I’m expecting 20 league goals.",
      "Though probably for someone in Saudi, sadly.",
      "On the CWC, the biggest issue beyond overplaying players and the dreadful spectacle around the games is that the amount of money involved is going to massively skew domestic leagues across the world. Auckland FC made USD3.5m for being in the tournament – that’s 4 years of turnover. How can other clubs in their league compete? It’s like when the Champions League expanded and clubs from smaller nations that happened to be in the first iteration got enough money to dominate their leagues for a decade. More money to fewer clubs means less competition – all Infantino seems to want is to have the best teams play each other all the time to make as much money as possible, which reduces the excitement and ultimately overall quality of the sport.\nTom, Andover",

      "But I remember players having that one season (maybe 2) where everything clicked and they rose from mediocre/decent to look like world beaters. Like when James Beattie played his way into the England set up in 2003.",

      "We upgraded 9 of our starting 11, and bought 16 players in total.",
      "TLDR: We lost our style of play, culture, and resilience, and were still trying to find our best team in April.",
      "Bedding down new players is not easy, from Real Madrid downwards.",
      "The guys that secured 100 points and promotion basically have to be trusted, even if it is clear that they’re not good enough – some of our best results (not many, I know) had a core of 6-7 players who played for Ipswich in Div 1. The rest were strangers until it was far too late…",
      "That, of course, is the Sword of Damocles attached to promotion – damned if you do, damned if you don’t.",

      "Bellingham (why always me indeed) 671 mins\nFoden 622 mins",

      "Leaving him out of the Conference League squad in the first half of the season was superb decision making as was recalibrating the team to be less reliant on him during the season.",
      "Chelsea need to go cojones out next season in terms of trusting their whole squad (including George and Acheampong). The top players should only be playing 2 games in 3 and squad players should be starting 1 in 3.",

      "A final word on the Club World Cup\nI think the main thing that folks like me have against eminently political things like the revamped Club World Cup, is the encouraging of political discourse in football, and mails like the intellectual drivel contained in Paco’s note from Accra.",
      "In it s simplest form, you have the claim from football fans the world over, when something they want is acquired by an arse, or a nation state, or gets a sponsor from a pollutant or war criminal, that ‘what are they supposed to do; I was a fan first, my story with this is longer than theirs’. And it’s hard to argue against. I know how I’d hope to react if it was my team, but I don’t know what I’d do for sure.",

But, it’s the World Cup. Football has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. It brings people together and is a cauldron for joy, for the most part. So if folks wanted to watch Qatar, they should.",
      "But those arguments don’t apply for the revamped version of the CWC; This is a ‘new’ tournament, so an opportunity to hold to your principles, or declare you have none. The CAPSLOCK brigade can rightly and perpetually laugh at Jordan Henderson for demonstrably being dim, but if they watched the CWC then I can’t see how they can have a go at him for his ethical stances or lack there-of.",
      "It was funded by the Saudi regime, proposed by Infantino and for the personal glory of Infantino, hosted by Trump under the spectre of ICE, and played upon condemnation from player-unions and managers like Ancelloti amongst many, many others. You had the very easy option of just electing not to watch, but if you did it was transparent what you were supporting, who was paying for it, and who benefited from it.",
      "As for Paco’s arguments about its reception globally, his raving review doesn’t tally with there being literally zero bidders to broadcast it, so it had to be propped up by the ghouls behind DAZN, and ticket sales were considerably lower than when the same teams visit the same venues for pre-season friendlies.",
      "We have to be mindful of our own echo chambers and just because mine thinks one thing it doesn’t mean everyone’s does, but it shouldn’t also tally that just because Paco had a whale of time watching this it doesn’t mean broadcasting and attendance numbers haven’t been abysmal for this thing that they literally had to give away free-to-air because no one would pay for it.",
      "And it expressly being a vehicle to increase the wealth of European football clubs does somewhat chime against your ludicrous point that this tournament offering three games to Boca so Real Madrid, Chelsea or PSG can win a billion is for the benefit of the ‘global game’.",
      "Finally, my not watching this has sod all to do with bigotry or the colonial past of Britain, which you mis-spelled as England. I’m well aware of what was done, and the reason I’m aware of it is because there is considerable effort to try and educate on it, via school, subsidised documentaries and case histories from the BBC, and eminently successful historians, of every race and nation, whom are either British themselves or found a home and commercial success in Britain in trying to educate us on the abominations of the past and present, and those voices are amplified in the mainstream print media rather than quashed.",
      "There is no comparison as to what nation is ‘worst’ without a tedious race to the bottom and attempts to trivialise what should never be trivialised. But politely, what is now Ghana does not have a history of rainbows and unicorns. I say this not to say ‘you’re just as bad’ but to say that every nation, hidden it’s dark recesses, has been an arsehole. The more pertinent question is what is your country doing to try and move things forward, and of that, I am at least grateful that Britain does more than post colonial France, and Belgium, and Spain, and Portugal. This is not a source of pride in any way shape or form.",
      "In fact for the most part, I see the country led by morons trying desperately to undo the very small positive steps taken. But the things you know happened account for 13% of our 3000 year history. It’s enough to damn our reputation but doesn’t damn who we are trying to be. We are, after all, the land that has a red cross as a flag because we stole from it from a bigger-boy in the Mediterranean, entirely because we were so repeatedly raided and enslaved that we had to steal the valour of someone who could fight back, until we were able to ourselves.",
      "We are the fans that march behind a song written by left wing comedians and scousers, about the improbability of hope and tacit acceptance that we could be successful but likely won’t be. The nation that has three lions on our badge rather than one, like Scotland, as it’s a crest of compromise. Just because we have taken against something, and are (in my case) white, doesn’t mean the opinion is invalid or due to bigotry.",
      "And frankly, when a site for chatting about the nonsense of football becomes an exercise of thought pieces on colonialism you have to acknowledge that the beautiful game is being stolen by arseholes with political ends. That the fact we are talking about this should emphasise this is not what football should be about.\nTom G",
      "",
      "Loving the Lionesses\nLike Matt (Gooner exiled in Essex) I watched the England Wales women’s Euro game rather than the Chelsea PSG men’s Club World Cup final. Largely because I had absolutely no interest in the two teams playing in the Club World Cup final.",
      "I don’t support any of the teams that played in the Club World Cup but I support England at that means supporting any England team be it the men’s senior England team, the U21 men’s England team and the senior women’s England team. I too found it refreshing and in general I find watching the women’s England team refreshing and more enjoyable than watching the men’s England team. This is because with the women’s team there isn’t the toxicity that surrounds the men’s team.",
      "No abuse directed at the players if they underperform, no racism aimed at the black players from knuckle dragging “fans” and no vitriol from the English media. Also the female England players private lives aren’t subjected to anything like the same level of scrutiny as their male counterparts so we don’t get who their dating as a media distraction. And in general there isn’t the same media circus that you get with the men’s team come every major tournament where everything including what the players had for breakfast is poured over and debated. It’s all so refreshing, more enjoyable and is about the football rather than anything else.\nDan, London"

Ideally, Amorim would have replaced him, but if not, the plan was always to bring in a goalkeeper to compete with Onana. That remains the case.’",
      "Man Utd have been linked with several potential replacements, with £45m-rated Aston Villa star Emiliano Martinez mooted as a potential option.",
      "Martinez’s form dipped last season after being one of the standout goalkeepers in the Premier League, so Villa are reportedly open to letting him leave for the right fee as they look to avoid a PSR breach.",

      "‘The Red Devils were the fastest movers to secure the Argentina national team goalkeeper’s signature, beating out other interested parties such as Barcelona, Galatasaray, and clubs from Saudi Arabia.’",
      "Lots of Premier League managers will start the 25/26 season under pretty hefty pressure. Here then are their potential successors.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘frustrated’ at how this summer transfer window is going for Manchester United after making two ‘priority demands’.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has set a clear ‘deadline’ for Manchester United to complete their third summer signing.",
      "Man Utd could have a chance of signing Emiliano Martinez this summer as Aston Villa prepare to announce a new goalkeeper signing, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘weighing up’ a ‘reunion’ for one of Ruben Amorim’s former Sporting CP stars, as it’s felt they will ‘listen to offers’.",
      "According to reports, a Chelsea “hijack” on Manchester United for a £45m Premier League is “looking likely” during this summer’s transfer window."

      "The 23-year-old made 44 appearances in all competitions and emerged as one of the most effective shot-stoppers in Europe. DataMB claim Lammens made 177 saves in 2024–25 and prevented 16.47 expected goals, more than any other goalkeeper in world football.",

      "Barcelona make Marcus Rashford their top left-wing target, according to Sky in Germany;  Barca are \"prepared to go all-in\" for the Manchester United forward; interest comes after Liverpool rejected Barca's advances for Luis Diaz, and Nico Williams' new deal at Athletic Club",

      "Friday 11 July 2025 19:41, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is now Barcelona's clear left-wing target, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Barca are expected to try and agree a deal and are \"prepared to go all-in\".",
      "This is because Liverpool have rejected their advances for Luis Diaz, and Nico Williams has signed a new deal at Athletic Club.",
      "The forward has returned to Carrington despite being offered extra time off and is training away from the first team, using the medical and rehab facilities.",
      "The 27-year-old is among five Man Utd players who can explore a potential move away after expressing a desire to leave.",
      "Matheus Cunha has taken the No 10 shirt from Rashford, who said he wanted a \"new challenge\" before joining Aston Villa for the second half of last season.",
      "There have been no official offers for Rashford after he returned from his loan at Villa.",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did two weeks ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "Read here for a 360 look at Rashford's future.",

      "Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.",

      "Antony impressed on a straight loan in the second half of last season at Betis, scoring nine goals in 24 appearances.",

      "Both clubs have been made aware by United what fee it would take to sign Sancho - believed to be £25m, with the sides both discussing terms with the England international's representatives.",
