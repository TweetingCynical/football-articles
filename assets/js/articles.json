      "Leny Yoro became Manchester United's most expensive signing of the summer after joining from Lille, but the teenage centre-back faces a battle to feature under Erik ten Hag",
      "New Manchester United signing Leny Yoro may struggle to find his place in Erik ten Hag's defence even when he's back at full fitness.",
      "The player's prospects look limited in the short term, even though United shelled out an initial £52million to pip Real Madrid to his signature. Yoro suffered a foot injury during a pre-season match against Arsenal and isn't expected to return to play until after the November international break.",
      "But even when fit, the 18-year-old's chances of starting don't look promising due to the arrival of Matthijs de Ligt, a more experienced central defender who has previously worked with Ten Hag. Despite Yoro's hefty price tag, the player was always seen as a long-term investment due to his youth, and he may not get the playing time he desires at Old Trafford shortly.",
      "The Athletic claims Ten Hag is likely to pair De Ligt with Lisandro Martinez on the right and left sides of central defence, respectively, if he has a fully fit squad. De Ligt, 25, was seemingly brought in as an upgrade on Harry Maguire, who has often been used as the aerial threat in defence to compensate for Martinez's lack of height.",
      "The Dutchman is still settling in at United and only played around 10 minutes off the bench in his Premier League debut during the recent 1-0 victory over Fulham. Ten Hag ended that match with three central defenders on the pitch after Jonny Evans also came on, suggesting there could be more flexibility in defence going forward.",
      "When it comes to Yoro's prospects in the starting XI, it's worth noting the talent - born in 2005 - will likely need considerable time to adjust to the demands of the Premier League. The English top flight is notoriously challenging for young foreign players, and even Yoro's hefty transfer fee doesn't guarantee he'll rise to the occasion.",
      "This raises questions about whether United - fresh off their worst-ever Premier League finish of eighth - might have been better off investing that money elsewhere. The club is currently negotiating to sign midfielder Manuel Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain, while a top-tier striker is also believed to be on the wish list after Rasmus Hojlund's struggles as the primary forward last season.",
      "With Hojlund currently out of action, attacking midfielder Bruno Fernandes was deployed as the team's leading man against the Cottagers. Ten Hag previously experimented with his captain in a forward role during pre-season, but the results have been less than stellar.",
      "Yoro brings valuable experience from Lille having made his senior debut at 16 and clocked up 60 first-team appearances for Les Dogues. However, the weight of his price tag and the task of reviving the hopes of the United fanbase presents a new challenge - and no meagre one at that.",
      "For now, his injury means any queries about his absence from the starting lineup will be paused. However, there's a possibility both he and the club may question if his potential is being underutilised if he doesn't feature in Ten Hag's starting plans soon.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has delivered a touching tribute to departing Manchester United winger Facundo Pellistri on social media.",
      "The 22-year-old ended his four-year association with United on Wednesday by completing a permanent transfer to Panathinaikos. Pellistri made 13 appearances for the Red Devils in the Premier League and also spent time on loan at Alaves and Granada.",
      "United have included have included a 45 percent sell-on clause in the deal for the Uruguay international, who they signed from Penarol for £7.65million. The club have also negotiated a three-year buy-back clause after the player signed a four-year deal with the Greek outfit.",
      "Pellistri was afforded little time on the pitch Old Trafford but clearly left an impression on Manchester United captain Fernandes, who praised his ex-teammate's attitude and predicted a successful career in a classy post on Instagram.",
      "Fernandes' message read: \" Hermanito was a pleasure to meet you and play alongside you.If is there someone that deserves everything good in a football career is you ! An example of professionalism and humility.Big things are coming to you soon I’m pretty sure.\"",
      "That saw Pellistri return the compliment to Fernandes, who recently extended his contract at United until 2027. The Panathinaikos new boy highlighted that the 29-year-old was the ideal captain and provided plenty of support.",
      "Pellistri replied: \"The pleasure was mine to share and play with you! what a player and the most important thing, what a guy. Thank you for always being behind me and behind every player in this club, you are the definition of CAPTAIN!\"",
      "In addition to Pellistri, United have boosted their transfer pot through a number of summer sales. Alvaro Carreras completed a permanent move to Benfica following a loan spell, while Donny van de Beek, Willy Kambwala, Mason Greenwood and Aaron Wan-Bissaka have all moved on too, helping United recoup more than £50m in transfer fees.",
      "More departures could yet follow with Napoli heavily interested in Scott McTominay and Christian Eriksen also attracting interest from Anderlecht. United are not done in terms of incomings either and hope to strike a deal with Paris Saint-Germain for Manuel Ugarte.",

      "It looks increasingly likely Manchester United will eventually move into a new stadium under Sir Jim Ratcliffe's rule - which offers significant financial opportunity",
      "Manchester United could rake in half a billion pounds by selling the naming rights to their proposed new stadium, it's been claimed.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe made no secret of his desire to give the Red Devils a state-of-the-art stadium following his minority takeover. Old Trafford has fallen well behind the standards expected of one of Europe's giants.",
      "Ratcliffe wasted no time in getting to work on the matter, establishing a task force to determine the best path forward. Their conclusion announced last month favoured a new build to hold 100,000 fans on the club-owned land next to the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "It's been suggested both can co-exist, with United keeping Old Trafford as a secondary venue. It's the more expensive option, coming with an estimated cost of £2billion.",
      "But Dr Rob Wilson, a professor of Applied Sports Finance Sheffield Hallam University, has suggested a quarter of that could be recouped just through naming rights. \"Old Trafford would still be called Old Trafford and then the big stadium next door would be called the Snapdragon Arena or something along those lines so you don't have that misalignment anymore,\" he told Casasdeapuestas.bet, discussing the possibility of United's kit sponsor extending their partnership.",
      "\"I think in terms of figures, if it was Snapdragon, they'd look to try and tie that into their shirt sponsorship and some of their other activities. It could do one or two things that could suppress the value because Snapdragon put another 30 on top of their £70million shirt sponsor to make it a round number.",
      "\"I think the stadium naming rights could be worth probably £50m a year in their own right. So if other companies get involved in that, then you've got a misalignment of brand. So Snapdragon might say that they need that and we'll do a £150m deal for shirt and stadium naming rights.",
      "\"You could see it go up a little bit higher but somewhere in the region of about £50m per season, they'd want something long-term. So that's £500m over 10 years.\"",
      "Wilson highlighted how changing an iconic stadium name, as Barcelona have done with the Spotify Camp Nou, can lead to backlash. But if United follow their rivals, like Man City's Etihad home and Arsenal's Emirates ground, they can avoid any such issue.",
      "Dr Wilson believes Snapdragon in particular could be a smart choice of partner. The company, a subsidiary of US tech firm Qualcomm, offers long-term security, much like Etihad and Emirates do.",
      "He added: \"What's really clever about what United are currently doing is that Snapdragon are about to go on the next wave of their journey, which is all tied up in tech, which means that it has longevity as a brand in the same way that Arsenal with Emirates and Manchester City with Etihad went for emergent Middle Eastern airlines that have got these big growth trajectories.\"",

      "Left-back Ben Chillwell looks set to join Chelsea's summer exodus, and he's spoken in the past about his connection to Manchester United, who have been offered his services",
      "Chelsea castaway Ben Chilwell previously revealed he loved going to Manchester United games as a kid – and he could yet end up at Old Trafford as a player.",
      "The 27-year-old is another to have fallen victim to the Blues' chaotic recruitment drive this summer. He and a range of others, including the publicly ousted Raheem Sterling, have essentially been told to seek pastures new.",
      "Chilwell joined Chelsea in 2020 for a hefty £50million from Leicester City. But the injury-plagued England ace has failed to stake a claim to the first-choice left-back spot, being replaced by Marc Cucurella, who enjoyed a stellar Euro 2024 with Spain.",
      "Erik ten Hag's United have emerged as a potential landing spot. And if his past comments – that it was the Red Devils who helped him fall in love with football – are anything to go by, then it's a transfer he would welcome.",
      "\"I used to go to Man United games, funnily enough, with my dad, who supported them,\" Chillwell told Chelsea's official website back in June 2023.",
      "\"The first one, I can’t remember who it was against, but it was a Man United game. We always used to go to the Champions League ones after school, so it would have been a Champions League game at Old Trafford. That’s the first one I remember. Having your first one in the Champions League is pretty good.",
      "\"We used to go by train, we would have to take about four different trains straight from school, and just about make it for kick-off, then get about four different trains on the way home as well, get home for one o’clock in the morning, straight into school the next morning again, but they were brilliant memories.\"",
      "Chilwell joined Leicester at 12, working his way up to make his first-team debut under Claudio Ranieri in 2015. During the club’s miraculous league title success, he spent time at Huddersfield Town on loan and with the Foxes’ academy side.",
      "He did feature in a two-legged loss to Tottenham in the FA Cup that year, which earned him endless plaudits for a composed performance. On the back of this showing, he penned a new five-year deal and was handed a league debut later in 2016.",
      "He made 100 appearances in the Midlands before Chelsea snapped him up in 2020, where he has since won the Champions League. It wasn't the Foxes, however, that first ignited Chilwell’s love for the game – that accolade goes to the Red Devils.",
      "\"It’s nights like that [ watching United] which make you fall in love with football,\" Chilwell continued. \"Going straight from school, six- or seven-hour round trip, just to go and watch a game. Just being starstruck and in awe of all the players, that’s the kind of night which makes you love football, I guess.",
      "\"I was focused all on the pitch, trying to find my favourite players at the time and just seeing them in person was crazy. Just the feeling of awe at the position they were in and looking up to them like gods. Of course, the atmosphere’s amazing, but I was definitely one of those people focused on the pitch and the players.\"",
      "Ten Hag's team only hold reported interest in Chilwell currently. But, with the player on Chelsea's transfer list and United's first-choice left-back Luke Shaw currently sidelined again along with Tyrell Malacia, it could be a move to keep an eye on.",

      "\"Amad is still very, very young with a lot of football to play,\" the former United striker told Futbin.com. \"I think it was beneficial for him to go on loan to Sunderland because you could see he wasn't ready to face and play regularly in the Manchester United first team.",
      "\"Now there's an improvement and growth in the way that he plays football. I think Ten Hag said that Amad is now ready to make the difference and to play more but the competition is going to be high.",

      "A dream transfer scenario could see Chelsea and Manchester United conduct some major business that sees Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho swap clubs before the transfer window closes",
      "The Chelsea nightmare of Raheem Sterling could lead to the fulfilment of a childhood dream - if he joins Manchester United in the coming days.",
      "The England international is currently training away from Enzo Maresca's first-team squad with no future at the club after Chelsea offered him to Aston Villa.",
      "Sterling is yet to have potential suitors come forward with offers but a dream scenario could see him join United with Jadon Sancho - who has struggled to strike a rapport with boss Erik ten Hag - moving in the opposite direction amid rumours Chelsea are interested in a deal.",
      "Sterling, 29, has been stunned to find himself on the outskirts in west London, while Sancho's fallout with Ten Hag last season was well-documented. And there's evidence to suggest the ex- Manchester City star Sterling would be in favour of a move to the red half of the city - though there is no suggestion of interest at present.",
      "\"I shouldn't really say this - not now, definitely not now! - but when I was young I was a massive United fan,\" he told The Mirror in 2019. \"I had an old United kit, from when they won the last FA Cup. I was at the final in 2007.\"",
      "Sterling has seemingly been written off by Maresca just as the new campaign gets underway, with a wave of new arrivals creating even greater competition at Chelsea. The Blues had plenty of wide options including Cole Palmer, Mykhailo Mudryk, Noni Madueke and Christopher Nkunku but the arrivals of Pedro Neto and Joao Felix have intensified the battle all the more.",
      "Having fallen victim to competition for places, Sterling will no doubt want a greater role in the next team he joins. So, a swap deal with Sancho would be a dreamy scenario given it could see him join the club he supported as a kid while also seeing a potential rival for minutes leave.",
      "Sterling's chances of starting would be further aided if the Red Devils were to also part ways with Antony, who has failed to set the world alight in England. Ten Hag pushed to sign his former Ajax charge in the summer of 2022, but a dismal return of 11 goals and five assists in 82 games for United has seen his stock plummet.",
      "The Brazil international has been linked with a move away on loan this summer, but finding a club willing to stump up even half of his £200,000-a-week wages may prove difficult. Sancho  , who was loaned to Borussia Dortmund last winter, is  more likely to leave this summer but United would still be left with solid options if Sterling signed and Antony also departed.",
      "In that scenario, United would have Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Sterling and Amad to choose from in their wide positions.",
      "Antony's agent, meanwhile, told journalist Fabrizio Romano earlier this summer that the Brazilian has no intentions of leaving. He said: \"I see reports about a potential exit on loan. Antony’s plan is clear: Manchester United. He wants to stay, he’s only focused on Man United. We already spoke about that with the club.\"",
      "It may also help a potential swap deal along that Sancho has confessed to being a Blues supporter in the past. And he once named two Chelsea icons as some of his heroes growing up.",
      "\"I’d probably say Frank Lampard,\" he told talkSPORT in 2021 when asked which players inspired him as a youth. \"I was a Chelsea fan growing up, I can’t lie. Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard were my favourite players at the time.\"",

      "Rene Meulensteen says the idea of Ruud van Nistelrooy replacing Erik ten Hag cannot be discounted if Manchester United endure a poor run of results in the Premier League",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe would consider replacing Erik ten Hag with Ruud van Nistelrooy if Manchester United make a poor start to the season.",
      "That’s according to former Red Devils first-team coach Rene Meulensteen, who was surprised to see the former United goal machine return to Old Trafford as a coach rather than take a management job elsewhere. After a torrid 2023/24 campaign – albeit one which ended with FA Cup glory – United got up and running in the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Fulham thanks to summer signing Joshua Zirkee’s late winner.",
      "It is imperative for Ten Hag that United improve on last season’s dismal eighth-place finish. A slow start would see question marks over his future resurface, despite the fact that the Dutchman penned a new contract in the summer. It has been speculated that Van Nistelrooy, who has previously managed PSV Eindhoven, would be the first cab on the rank if Ten Hag is dispensed with.",
      "Meulensteen, who worked under Sir Alex Ferguson between 2007 and 2013, will not be concerned but insists the prospect of co-owner Ratcliffe replacing Ten Hag with his countryman cannot be discounted.",
      "“I don’t think Erik ten Hag will be worried about Rudd van Nistelrooy potentially replacing him, he’s too focused on the job at hand,” Meulensteen told Gambling Zone.",
      "“But who knows what the future will bring. If United stutter at the start of the season and the results don’t go their way, Sir Jim Ratcliffe would consider Van Nistelrooy, but at the moment they believe that Erik is the right man and now we need to see what happens.",
      "“It is an interesting development, what has happened at Manchester United because Ten Hag brought in his trusted staff and many of them have gone. Now he has brought in his friend Rene Hake, who was manager of Utrecht, as well as Van Nistelrooy, so he has identified what he needs.”",
      "Meulensteen believes that Van Nistelrooy will inevitably return to management one day. He added: “I've stayed in touch with him and he's obviously keen to carry on in management and I thought that's what he's going to do.",
      "“I thought he may have gone to manage in Spain and then the Burnley rumours came up. I thought he would’ve continued as a manager so I was surprised when he joined United because I can see Ruud as a manager.",
      "“I think he's had a taste of it and I think he wants more of it. Why has he chosen to go with Erik ten Hag? Probably the fact that there's a chance for him to go back to Manchester United where he had some fantastic years and great memories.",
      "“He will be a good influence and a strong influence in the dressing room. People will respect him and I think he’s got a lot to teach all those young forwards.”",

Despite being 39 years old, he hasn't yet dropped any hints of retirement, his participation in the 2026 World Cup, or a move to any other club. Meulensteen feels as though calling it quits in the Middle East isn't fitting, and Ronaldo should return to Europe for a fairytale ending.",
      "\"There would be some romance in Cristiano Ronaldo returning to Europe to finish his career off,\" Meulensteen told Gambling Zone when discussing the Portuguese.",
      "\"But, one of the problems we saw with Portugal is that the focus becomes all about Ronaldo. It was all too focused on him which didn’t help, even though Ronaldo can still do a job as long as he understands his role and what he can contribute.",

      "Meulensteen began working with Ronaldo in 2007 when the Dutchman became a first-team coach under Ferguson. The superstar won his first Ballon d'Or a year later and left for Real Madrid for a then-world record £80million.",
      "His time with Los Blancos saw him develop into one of the greatest players of a generation, if not all-time. He scored 451 goals in 438 games and led the team to four Champions League titles and two La Liga crowns.",

      "Sven-Goran Eriksson has recalled a clash with Sir Alex Ferguson ahead of the 2006 World Cup over the at-the-time England boss's decision to include Wayne Rooney in his squad",
      "Sven-Goran Eriksson has opened up about his tumultuous relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson - and one fierce clash in particular over Wayne Rooney.",
      "The 76-year-old Swede, who is bravely facing the final stages of terminal cancer, shared insights into one time in particular that he didn't see eye to eye with the former Manchester United manager in a new Amazon documentary titled 'Sven'. Eriksson is most renowned for his tenure as England manager from 2001 to 2006, during which he guided the Three Lions to two World Cups and a European Championship quarter-final.",
      "He worked with the 'golden generation' of English talent including Michael Owen, David Beckham, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes, not forgetting a young Wayne Rooney. And it was Rooney's inclusion in the 2006 World Cup squad that sparked a clash with Ferguson.",
      "Rooney was a doubt for the tournament after breaking his metatarsal while playing for Manchester United in a 3-0 defeat against Chelsea in April that year. Despite this, Eriksson was keen for the then-20-year-old striker to play a significant role in his World Cup plans, even arranging for an England doctor to assess Rooney's fitness ahead of the tournament.",
      "This decision did not sit well with Ferguson, arguably the Red Devils' greatest-ever manager. In his new Amazon Prime documentary, 'Sven', Goran-Eriksson reminisced: \"I said to the players 'I can't see any team which is stronger than us'. The problem was Rooney of course. Rooney, as always, doesn't know where to stop - so I think he created that injury a little bit by himself.",
      "\"I had a lot of phonecalls from Sir Alex - strange man when you touch Manchester United in a way he doesn't like, he stops to be a gentleman,\" Sven said with a grin, adding: \"He [Rooney] was desperate to play, and whatever you asked him; 'no problem, no problem, no problem'. Maybe he shouldn't have been picked.\"",
      "David Dein, former Football Association vice-chairman, later claimed it was the only time he ever saw Sven annoyed. In his book, 'Calling the Shots: How to Win in Football and Life' shared in the Daily Mail, he wrote: \"The only time I ever saw Sven annoyed was when Sir Alex Ferguson called him at our World Cup base in 2006.",
      "\"Fergie was furious that Wayne Rooney was going to play at the World Cup, with England gambling on his recovery from a broken metatarsal. 'You're finished,' he screamed. Sven lost it. 'F*** off,' he said. 'Alex, I will pick Rooney. Have a nice holiday. Ciao, bye'.\"",
      "Rooney didn't make his 2006 World Cup debut until England's second Group B match against Trinidad and Tobago, replacing Owen in the 58th minute. Despite featuring in every subsequent game, his only goal was a penalty during the nail-biting quarter-final shootout with Portugal, which led to England's departure from the tournament.",
      "Following England's World Cup exit, Sven said goodbye to his role as England manager, making way for Steve McClaren. The Swedish coach went on to take the reins at Manchester City, Mexico, Leicester, Shanghai SIPG, Shenzen and the Philippines before hanging up his managerial boots in 2019.",

      "It would be a huge understatement to say that Chelsea have been busy in the transfer market.",

      "The latest to put pen to paper has been Joao Felix, who returns to Chelsea on a permanent deal from Atletico Madrid. Blues academy star Conor Gallagher has moved in the opposite direction as part of the deal.",
      "Chelsea might not be done there either, with a whole host of stars linked with moves away. Take a look at all of the rumours coming out of Stamford Bridge over the past 24 hours:",
      "Enzo Maresca has told Raheem Sterling in no uncertain terms that he faces little future at Chelsea. Speaking in a press conference, the Chelsea boss said: \"I'm not saying Raheem is not a good player but I prefer different kinds of wingers. This is the reason why.\"",
      "Sterling’s future already looks uncertain. The winger was left out of Maresca’s matchday squad against his former side Manchester City at the weekend, with his representatives demanding clarity in a strong statement.",
      "Sterling has also seen his squad number taken away from him. Chelsea announced on Wednesday that summer signing Pedro Neto will wear the number 7 shirt - previously owned by Sterling - for the coming campaign.",
      "Sterling, 29, was signed from Man City two years ago for £49.5m. He still has three years remaining on his contract with an option for a further campaign.",
      "Another player who could leave before the end of the transfer window is Ben Chilwell. The England left-back has been told to look elsewhere for his football.",
      "And it appears that Old Trafford could potentially be an option. According to talkSPORT, Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign Chilwell.",
      "The Red Devils are currently struggling with injury issues at left-back, with Tyrell Malacia and Luke Shaw sidelined. Chilwell, signed from Leicester, has three years remaining on his contract with Chelsea.",
      "While Sterling and Chilwell look set to leave in the coming weeks, another star who could be sold is Belgian frontman Romelu Lukaku. The striker has spent the last two seasons on loan with Inter Milan and Roma and could return to Italy.",
      "According to Sky Sport Italia, Napoli director Giovanni Manna is set to fly into the UK to hold talks with Chelsea. The Serie A outfit previously lodged a bid of €30m (£25.5m). Lukaku would move to Naples initially on loan before completing a permanent move.",

      "Erik ten Hag's defensive overhaul may not yet have reached its conclusion while Manchester United's midfield exodus begins entering the final week of a busy summer transfer window",
      "Manchester United have spent big on a defensive overhaul this season but they could still make another major addition before the window closes next week with talk of a deal for Everton star Jarrad Branthwaite resurfacing.",
      "Yet head coach Erik ten Hag must also trim his squad with the departure of Facundo Pellistri the first exit of several anticipated over the coming days.",
      "Meanwhile, one man who looks destined to remain is Brazilian midfielder Casemiro after he convinced Ten Hag of his value during pre-season.",
      "Here are the big tales from Old Trafford ove the past 24 hours.",
      "Manchester United are clearing out some of their fringe players with Facundo Pellistri joining Panathinaikos for £5.1million.",
      "The deal for Pellistri is close and United will have a 40 per cent sell-in clause inserted in the transfer. Pellistri, 22, had loan spells in Spain at Alaves and Granada and the Uruguay midfielder made four starts for United.",
      "He also came on in the Community Shield defeat on penalties to Manchester City and United are letting him go because he wants regular senior football. Boss Erik ten Hag wants another midfielder to partner Kobbie Mainoo in the holding role in his 4-2-3-1 formation and he does not see Pellistri getting much game time.",
      "Tunisia midfielder Hannibal Mejbri is also set to leave Old Trafford and Burnley and Leeds are battling it out for him. B urnley want a midfielder to replace the Fulham-bound Sander Berge and feel Mejbri can help.",
      "Casemiro has seemingly earned a reprieve at Manchester United after impressing Erik ten Hag during pre-season.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder, 32, impressed initially after joining the Red Devils in the summer of 2022 but there had been speculation he would be sold in the summer transfer window after a disappointing 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Saudi Arabia was touted as a potential destination for the former Real Madrid star, who is thought to be among United's top earners - but a new report claims Casemiro will stay.",
      "It was reported that the relationship between Ten Hag and Casemiro broke down last season after alleging the veteran was overweight and unfit at the start of last year's campaign.",
      "But now he is back in the first-team plans.",
      "Manchester United have not given up on signing Jarrad Branthwaite despite signing Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro.",
      "The Red Devils have spent more than £100million reinforcing their defensive options after seeing multiple bids turned down for the Everton star. There is however an admission that the move won't come before the end of the month.",
      "Branthwaite remains on United's radar ahead of a prospective move in 12 months time. The club offered as much as £50m before completing a £58.9m deal with Lille for Yoro and more recently landing De Ligt for £42.8m.",
      "The 22-year-old defender is said to have drawn interest from Manchester City and Liverpool this summer. Everton have made it clear they no intention of selling Branthwaite to Liverpool however.",
      "And United still appear to be keen.",

      "Manchester United have been pursuing a move for Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte all summer, and could snap him up using the money made from selling Hannibal Mejbri",
      "Sander Berge's £25million move to Fulham could boost Manchester United's chances of signing Manuel Ugarte - if they sell Hannibal Mejbri first.",
      "United have been aiming to sign a midfielder all summer, looking at Paris Saint-Germain's Ugarte and Burnley's Sander Berge. With the Clarets now eyeing Hannibal, it looks like United could have fashioned a swap deal with the side if they had pushed for Berge.",
      "However, Ugarte has always been the main target and United have now watched Fulham agree to a £20m-plus deal for Berge, according to The Athletic. However, United could still make a deal work with Burnley as they are still interested in signing Hannibal.",
      "The 21-year-old is entering the final year of his contract and the Championship side are keen to sign him, even if it is just a season-long loan.",
      "United would prefer a permanent transfer, with the midfielder failing to become a regular face in the first team, after enduring a tough loan spell at Sevilla last season.",
      "Burnley could utilise the £25m received for Berge to sign Hannibal, which could boost United's finances and enable them to sign Ugarte - who has reportedly agreed terms with the Premier League side.",
      "United were originally unwilling to match PSG's asking price of £51.1m for the Uruguay international, and also planned to sell Scott McTominay to Napoli to fund the transfer.",
      "The £25m asking price for McTominay may have put off Napoli, as they are also looking at Brighton's Billy Gilmour - but the sale of another midfielder could set the ball rolling for United.",
      "Erik ten Hag may also be interested in opting for a loan deal for Ugarte, with an obligation to buy - but fans will be waiting in anticipation to see what happens for the rest of the transfer window.",

      "The Dutchman found himself under pressure at Old Trafford this summer but retained the faith of Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Immediately after that decision was made, Ten Hag started to make sweeping changes behind the scenes.",
      "Steve McCLaren and Benni McCarthy were two members of staff allowed to leave, with Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake among those to arrive. Long-term goalkeeping coach Richard Hartis also departed to be replaced by Jelle ten Rouwelaar.",
      "Heaton has now opened up on the changes behind the scenes. While he was sad to see Sir Alex Ferguson ’s former colleague Hartis depart, he has been full of praise for Ten Rouwelaar’s work so far.",
      "“Obviously the coaching staff that have gone out the building were all fantastic in their own right,” Heaton said to The Independent. “Richard Hartis, the goalkeeper coach, who I have a brilliant relationship with, known him for a long time, was superb.",
      "“But the club and the manager decided to make a change, so Jelle’s come in with different ideas and I’m really enjoying working with him at the minute.",
      "“A lot of thinking behind his training sessions, making the goalkeepers… really stressing their thinking and understanding the in-possession tactical stuff.",
      "“It’s been really good so far. Real good guy, really enjoyed working with him, and that goes for the rest of the coaching staff that have come in. Ruud, I obviously played with when I was a kid, and Rene (Hake) and Andreas (Georgson). It’s sort of a fresh look.”",
      "Where will Man United finish this season? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "Ten Rouwelaar’s predecessor Hartis enjoyed two hugely successful spells at Old Trafford. He was initially at the club between 2001 and 2010, proving to be a pivotal member of staff under Alex Ferguson.",
      "Speaking about his exit back in July, he said: “Manchester United is a special football club and it’s been wonderful to be part of it on two separate occasions over the past 24 years. I am proud to have had the opportunity to work with some very hard-working and committed people across all areas of the club, and to have experienced so many great moments with them along the way.",
      "\"In particular, I would like to thank all the goalkeepers, both past and present, who dedicated themselves to representing the club and playing in a way that befits Manchester United. I want to wish everyone at the club the very best for the future.”",

      "Chelsea have offered Ben Chilwell to Manchester United as they aim to further trim their wage bill, it has been claimed.",
      "England defender Chilwell joined Chelsea from Leicester City in 2020, playing more than 100 first-team games during an injury-hit four years in West London. The 27-year-old signed a contract extension towards the end of the 2022-23 season, with his current deal running until the summer of 2027.",
      "Since signing that deal, though, two changes of manager have left him down the pecking order. Current boss Enzo Maresca has been brutally honest with the left-back, who barely featured in pre-season and has been told he will struggle for minutes without a move.",
      "A transfer to Premier League rivals United is among the possibilities explored, though it's far from straightforward. Erik ten Hag's side are currently without injured duo Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia, which may explain Chelsea's approach.",
      "According to talkSPORT, United have been offered the chance to sign Chilwell and Chelsea would not stand in the way of a move. He wasn't part of the squad chosen by Maresca to face Manchester City on Sunday, with Marc Cucurella starting at left-back.",
      "\"With Chilly it's quite clear,\" Maresca said in the lead-up to the Premier League opener. \"I love the way he trains, I love the way he is but the problem is that he struggles with us a little bit to find his best position.",
      "\"When you train everyday and you don't get minutes, it's not good for them and it's not good for me because I need to make decisions. For some players, it's sometimes better to leave and to go somewhere to get minutes. We will see what happens, the transfer window is open and we will see what happens.\"",
      "Chilwell is one of a number of senior stars left out of Maresca's squad to face Servette in Thursday's Europa Conference League play-off first leg. Raheem Sterling has also been omitted, with the former Manchester City star losing his squad number to summer signing Pedro Neto on Wednesday.",
      "Sterling, like Chilwell, was left out of the matchday squad on Sunday. \"I'm not saying Raheem is not a good player but I prefer different kinds of wingers. This is the reason why,\" the manager said.",
      "Joao Felix will also play no part against Servette despite completing his move from Atletico Madrid. However, Maresca expressed his joy at landing the Portugal international.",
      "\"He can play inside, outside, he can play as a No.9 and this versatility is one of the reasons why we have signed him,\" Maresca said. \"He’s a very good player and we are happy to have him here.\"",

      "Since completing his partial takeover of the club during the 2023-24 season, British billionaire Ratcliffe has embarked on significant cost-cutting measures. These include trimming the workforce by nearly a quarter, with some 250 of 1,100 staff members at risk of losing their jobs.",
      "The measures were brought into place following a review conducted early in the part-owner's reign, which uncovered a need for significant savings. Staff were told of impending redundancies in early July, with further cost-cutting measures anticipated at the time.",
      "Efforts have been made to eradicate \"non-essential\" activities, while some measures introduced before Ratcliffe's arrival have remained in place. Now, however, reports have pointed to further changes - some of which may affect staff's eating patterns.",
      "According to The Mail, workers have spoken of setting up a dining table next to toilet cubicles. However, United have indicated they have not been forced to eat in such an environment.",
      "Rather, the space in question is understood to be a staff room with adjoining toilet facilities. It is thought to be quieter than the designated area for staff to eat, and is used for breaks rather than being a required eating area.",
      "Staff also previously received a lunchbox from the club, but are now served food from the hot buffet which is also the source of food for some corporate guests. However, the club has indicated these meals are specially made, rather than being leftovers from the food provided to guests, while the lunchboxes were discontinued as a waste-cutting measure after the club found food was being left uneaten.",
      "Have you liked what Sir Jim Ratcliffe has done at Manchester United? Let us know in the comments section",
      "Avoiding waste is also understood to be the motivation behind providing half the attendees of corporate boxes with a programme. If any guest asks for a programme they are provided with one, while QR codes linking to digital copies are also available, but the numbers provided from the get-go come after a review found many were not taken home by guests.",
      "The latest news comes after reports emerged of efforts from Ratcliffe to uncover new money-making avenues. United have spent £150million on new signings this summer as they look to put last season's eighth-place finish behind them.",
      "One such avenue is a potential documentary putting some of the recent upheaval into focus. Rivals Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham have all been subject to behind-the-scenes shows as part of the 'All or Nothing' franchise on Amazon Prime, with the Arsenal edition - released in 2022 - the most recent.",
      "According to The Times, Ratcliffe began a video diary in February and has had his eye on a behind-the-scenes show of some kind. Amazon Prime have already made one United-focused documentary, '99', which focused on the club's Treble success in the 1998-99 season.",

      "The Uruguay winger joined United from Penarol back in 2020 for £7.65million, and they had hoped to turn a profit. However, Panathanaikos are reported to have haggled down to £5.1m plus add-ons - less than what the selling club were after.",
      "In exchange, though, United will benefit from a 45 percent sell-on fee, protecting them if his new club turn a significant profit. Not only that, but they also have a three-year buy-back clause after the 22-year-old signed a four-year contract in Greece.",
      "United have followed the lead of Arsenal, who have inserted a \"significant\" clause in a deal which will take Charlie Patino to Deportivo La Coruna. The Gunners are expected to receive just £1m initially for the 20-year-old midfielder, but could be in for a windfall further down the line.",
      "Pellistri initially joined United on a five-year deal in 2020. With that deal due to run out at the end of the current campaign, and with Erik ten Hag considering him surplus to requirements, they decided to cash in.",
      "The winger had to wait more than two years for his senior debut for the club, despite playing for Uruguay at the 2022 World Cup. That first appearance eventually arrived in January 2023, after two loan spells in Spain with Alaves.",
      "In a statement confirming Pellistri's departure, United pointed to his experience in Spain and his form for his country at the recent Copa America. \"Everyone at the club would like to wish Facundo the very best of luck with his new club, and thank him for his efforts here,\" the statement concluded.",
      "Pellistri made a total of 25 senior appearances for United, the msot recent of them in the Community Shield. He failed to score in any of those outings, but did bag his first goals in European football during a loan spell at Granada last term.",

      "\"So, that's why he deserved an opportunity, and I think he's taking that opportunity now. he did a great job for the team, he really contributed to our levels in the last two games.",
      "\"Every time he has to improve, and he has to give the evidence that he is worthy of playing. It's good that the internal competition is there, and hopefully, it will give other players a push that they have to bring more, and they have to add more.\"",
      "Yet, the midfielder was loaned out to Sevilla in January, where a £17m but out clause wasn't triggered after he made just six appearances. It now looks like he'll leave Old Trafford permanently, with the Championship his likely destination.",

      "Dan Ashworth is now pulling the strings at Manchester United and it appears he was told to sign one of Brighton and Hove Albion's best players",
      "Ex-Brighton and Hove Albion star Glenn Murray revealed he once told Manchester United supremo Dan Ashworth to sign Joao Pedro.",
      "Five years before he was installed as United sporting director, Ashworth was the technical director at the Amex Stadium. Over the last five years, Brighton have established themselves as one of the most financially savvy clubs in the Premier League and European football.",
      "One of their signings last season was former Watford ace Pedro, who signed from the Hornets for the Seagulls for £30million. A matter of years before he moved to the South Coast side, Murray, who played alongside the Brazilian at the Hornets, recommended his ex-team-mate in private talks with Ashworth.",
      "Ashworth never moved for him while he was at Brighton but rivalled his old club for Pedro's signature when he was at Newcastle United, which suggested he had listened to Murray's advice and taken a fancying of the player.",
      "While speaking on Brighton and Hove Albion's official YouTube channel, Murray was talking about Pedro with Danny Welbeck after the latter heaped huge praise on the Brazilian. Murray said: \"I must admit, when I played with you guys with Watford, he was the one that makes you go 'Wow, who is this kid?' The things he could do, he (Pedro) was so good.",
      "\"I think there’s a lot more growth in him, he has loads more to give. We’ve seen glimpses from last year of what he is capable of and his tally was impressive in the end. But, I think he can get so much better.\"",
      "He also added: \"I’ll be honest, he was my first call back to Dan Ashworth. I was literally getting on the train and I was like ‘You’ve got to sign this kid’. He was that type of player where you were just blown away by him.\"",
      "Ashworth departed Brighton in February 2022, just under 18 months before Pedro arrived at Brighton. He would go on to spend close to two years at Newcastle, before departing the Magpies to take over as sporting director at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "United have since been linked with a wide variety of players from Brighton. They are among the admirers of academy star Evan Ferguson, who hammered home 16 goals and five assists in his debut campaign.",
      "However, injuries last season restricted him to just six goals in 27 appearances. While his stock has dwindled slightly, United have still regularly been linked with a £50m move for the Irishman.",
      "Ex-United hitman Welbeck is still a huge admirer of the forward. The former England international, who has played with some of the best players in England over the course of his career, talked up the Irishman by branding him a 'predator in the box'.",
      "Welbeck said: \"Evan was unfortunate with injuries last season. It was one of them where once he gets his games this season, I’m pretty sure he will be just as lethal as he was when he came into the side.",
      "\"He’s a predator in the box and there’s not many like him around. He’s big and strong, but he’s agile and lethal in the box. I’m looking forward to seeing him back on the pitch and, obviously, we’ve got a lot of new players that have come into the side.\"",
      "United have already to Rasmus Hojlund - who is currently injured - and Joshua Zirkzee as their strike options this season but they will no doubt have liked what their ex-striker Welbeck had to say about Ferguson as Erik ten Hag continues to weigh up a transfer move for him.",

      "The £47.5m signing is among the 15 Blues players up for sale and banished to train away from the first team.",
      "Sterling wants to stay in the Premier League - he has been offered to Unai Emery's men, who can offer Champions League football - and his desire to win back his England place rules out a move to Saudi Arabia. Juventus were interested in a player swap deal, involving Federico Chiesa, which would not suit Chelsea.",
      "Sterling claimed he wanted “clarity” from the club after he was left out of the squad to face Manchester City in the Premier League opener. The former Liverpool winger is the highest earner at Stamford Bridge on £300,000-a-week while the average wage on longer, incentivised contracts is now only £60,000. And the five-time Premier League players need to sell players to balance the books.",
      "But on the day Chelsea completed the £45.5m signing of Joao Felix, the Italian head coach claimed Sterling is being sold for footballing reasons.",
      "\"I'm not saying Raheem is not a good player but I prefer different kinds of wingers,” he said. “This is the reason why.",
      "\"I spoke with Raheem, one-on-one the day before City and I explained him exactly the situation. I didn't see Raheem after the game. \"In this moment, they (Sterling and Ben Chilwell) are training apart. The situation with them both is quite clear. There is not any update on their situations.\"",

      "The Stamford Bridge club is now in a race against time to offload players before the August 31 transfer deadline - or risk needing to keep paying and playing the unwanted players.",
      "\"We'll see,” added the Italian. “Now it is a bit early. We still have 10 days of the transfer window. As I said many times, many things can happen in the last 10 days, the last week, so we'll see.\"",

      "Hojlund arrived at Old Trafford last summer in a £72million deal from Atalanta. He enjoyed a positive debut season at United after a difficult start, ending with 16 goals in all competitions.",
      "With the Dane having been their only recognised centre forward, boss Erik ten Hag opted to boost his options by bringing in Zirkzee from Bologna. He made the perfect start, scoring the winner on his debut to beat Fulham last Friday.",
      "Hojlund is currently ruled out with injury and United icon Dimitar Berbatov has warned him he will need to hit the ground running when he does return if he wants to retake his place from Zirkzee.",
      "\"Hojlund's goal ratio must improve. He should be better and I think he can be better. He can do better but it comes down to concentration levels. So this is the moment where he has to work even harder which won't be easy but it’ll be beneficial,\" Berbatov told FUTBIN.",
      "“It’s going to be a competition and because there's a lot of football to be played it’s good to have different options for different games and opponents. Sometimes you have to decide your team based on the opponents and the defenders of the team.",
      "“Sometimes it’s difficult for the attackers to understand why they’ve been benched and why another attacker is playing ahead of him but this is the job of the manager. My wish is, especially with Rasmus having a year in the Premier League, for them to score goals as soon as possible. This is how strikers are judged.",
      "\"As a striker I also look out for so many other things. How they open up the pitch, the spaces they leave for their team mates, how they control the ball, dropping back to get on the ball and then getting up the pitch, following the game. For Zirkzee and Hojlund, the most important thing is scoring goals.\"",
      "Boss Ten Hag has been delighted with the way Zirkzee has kicked off his United career. And the Dutchman has also revealed that the new signing will bring new attributes to his squad, which Hojlund does not possess.",
      "\"It is very good for a striker to come into Manchester United and to score the winning goal in his first game. We are very happy with him, it is very pleasing and we are very happy with him. It is also encouraging and it will give him courage and belief - and for the fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It is a very good start. He has some attributes we didn't have, straight away he showed that. He is very good in his linking up and combinations and we have some good ball-playing offensive players and they can take benefit from this.",
      "\"But that is what I wanted to say, he has to arrive in the box. He has to arrive in the box and score goals, he did and the winner is very pleasing for everyone. He has had an individual programme to build up his fitness and we then had to bring him into the team training.\"",

      "Roy Keane says Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso's underhanded attempts to quit Liverpool wouldn't have been tolerated at Manchester United.",
      "Gerrard very nearly swapped Liverpool for Chelsea in 2004 and again in 2005, and even submitted a transfer request to push for the move. He eventually rescinded the request and stayed at Anfield, though a very similar drama involving Reds team-mate Alonso, almost unfolded a few years later.",
      "According to ex-Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez, Alonso refused to take part in a Champions League game at the start of the 2008/09 season because he was on the cusp of joining Arsenal and didn't want to be cup-tied. While discussing the saga, Keane insisted Gerrard and Alonso would have been ostracised if they'd pulled the same stunts as United players.",
      "\"Jamie [Carragher], you're a Liverpool lad. With Gerrard, sometimes a player wants to leave a club. But when they refuse to play or they don't want to be cup tied, I'm surprised players don't turn on them when they are gone,\" Keane said on the Stick To Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"We wouldn't have tolerated that at United. [To Benitez] I know managers can have a disagreement with the player and the player wants to leave. It is straightforward for managers, to deal with a player who is not doing what he is supposed to be doing, when everyone is mates with him.\"",
      "Like Gerrard's prospective Chelsea switch, Alonso's move to Arsenal never materialised. However, the Spaniard did eventually exit Anfield, joining Real Madrid in 2009.",
      "Liverpool, during Benitez's era, often seemed like a launchpad for elite stars. Like Alonso, the likes of Javier Mascherano and Fernando Torres all left for clubs competing at the highest level, and Benitez has admitted his team \"couldn't compete\" with the wealthier teams around them.",
      "Shedding light on Alonso's situation back in 2008, the ex-Valencia, Newcastle and Chelsea boss explained that Liverpool needed to generate funds, and were forced to consider selling their best players: \"We needed to sell. Xabi had an agreement; he was talking with one club and had an agreement,\" Benitez said.",
      "\"We played Standard de Liege for a Champions League qualifier and we had Javier Mascherano and Lucas Leiva in the Olympic Games, Steven Gerrard had a lower back problem, so we had to play [Damien] Plessis and Xabi. Xabi had an agreement with Arsenal and didn’t want to get cup-tied.",
      "\"I told Jamie Carragher and Gerrard before the game that he had an agreement and doesn’t want to play, but he must because it is the most important game to qualify for the Champions League. Then when you were going out for the warm-ups, you said, ‘Poor Xabi.’ Not poor Xabi, he is playing for our club at this time. During the season he was our best player and didn’t go to Arsenal because he had to play [for us].\"",
      "Alonso was tipped earlier this year for a stunning return to Anfield as head coach when the Bayer Leverkusen boss emerged as a contender to take over from the departing Jurgen Klopp. However, the former Spain international chose to stay put, leading Liverpool to appoint Arne Slot instead.",

      "Manchester United have done the heavy lifting when it comes to their recruitment drive this summer.",
      "However, with nine days remaining for Premier League clubs to strike up further business, there might yet be more to come from Ineos and key figures behind the scenes. United are still in the market for another midfielder and their prime candidate - as it has been for several weeks - is Manuel Ugarte from PSG.",
      "It was thought that the proposed deal was dependent on outgoings - which are still being considered - but United are 'open' to a late change in approach for the Uruguay regular. The Manchester Evening News understands a loan with the option to buy could be priced-up to help them get Ugarte over the line before August 30.",
      "United are, meanwhile, prepared to sell five more players including Jadon Sancho this summer. Here, our dedicated reporters take a look at what could happen around Old Trafford between now and next Friday night's deadline, and offer up their dream scenarios for the closing days;",
      "Manuel Ugarte is a deal which needs to happen for United to call this transfer window a success. The midfielder could be United's most important signing of the summer and the difference between them finishing in the top four or not.",
      "Whilst Casemiro has looked better in the early stages of 2024/25, the 32-year-old cannot be relied upon for another season. After signing Ugarte, United's next priority should be selling several players who don't have a long-term future at Old Trafford, starting with Jadon Sancho.",
      "Victor Lindelof is another player who should go, although with his current injury that seems unlikely, whilst Christian Eriksen won't be much use this season. Scott McTominay may be worth keeping though, providing it doesn't impact a deal for Ugarte.",
      "The Scotland international proved his worth for Ten Hag's team last season and still remains a useful squad player. What United don't want though is keeping someone who doesn't want to be there which may necessitate a sale, regardless of how much he still offers.",
      "Heading into these final stages of the summer transfer window, United should have a clear goal in mind - signing a midfielder. To finance this, the Reds will more than likely need to sell McTominay which, for the right price, would be good business.",
      "If United can receive their valuation of £40m they will be laughing at that and considering the panic in the Napoli camp at present, this could well be doable too. After bringing in the money for the Scottish central player it is more than likely that Ugarte will be added to the team.",
      "The jury is out on the Uruguayan at present but there is still plenty of time for him to reach the heights needed to be a starter for United. Once again, the big issue here will be regarding his price tag with a loan move perhaps the wisest decision for now.",
      "After that, I am not sure that United would need to do any more business or be in a position to do any more for that matter. Sancho's sale is not necessarily the priority it once was and if the hatchet has well and truly been buried, there is no reason why he could not be a force this season.",
      "A loan deal for Manuel Ugarte looks to be on the cards for United in between now and the end of the transfer window. That signing would fill the position where the United squad are most in need.",
      "Getting the deal done on an initial loan does mean that funds raised through sales for the move won’t be so important between now and the end of the window. Therefore if no team reaches the £40 million asking price for Scott McTominay, then he will stay at Old Trafford for at least another six months before the situation is looked at again in January.",
      "Another source of income from player sales is Jadon Sancho. While the situation surrounding the public fall-out between him and Ten Hag now looks to have been resolved, it still feels that the player’s future lies away from Old Trafford. United have reportedly set an asking price of around £40 million, if they can get that, it would serve as a boost ahead of the January window.",
      "There’s no real other areas of the squad that obviously need strengthening for the remainder of the season. If the Ugarte signing gets over the line then the concentration should therefore be on outgoings.",
      "On paper, the dream scenario for United between now and 11pm on August 30 is rather simple. However, due to complex deals taking shape and one or two players facing uncertain futures at the club, the business that should map out - both in and out of Old Trafford - is anything but straightforward.",
      "A permanent sale for Scott McTominay would enable United to press ahead with Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Amid one or two question marks over his transfer fee, though, Ineos might be better-served following their 'new' plan and signing the Uruguay international on loan instead. That would allow them to keep McTominay around for one final year as his goals would be an additional bonus in a reduced, bit-part role.",
      "Cashing in on Jadon Sancho would be ideal, too, to perhaps allow United to bring in another striker. Ivan Toney is not exactly an essential recruit, but he could be a useful addition to injured Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee up top if United feel the need to spend whatever money they get from Sancho on an alternative profile.",
      "United's dream end to the transfer window would start with cashing in on Jadon Sancho and Scott McTominay before reinvesting that income into their defence and midfield. Victor Lindelof should also be off, freeing up his wages more than necessarily a transfer fee.",
      "Manuel Ugarte seems to be who they want, so agreeing to a loan deal with Paris Saint-Germain would be ideal, with an option rather than an obligation to buy the Uruguay international. Then, the dream scenario would be returning for Jarrad Branthwaite and signing the third central defender that the club have been open to signing this summer.",
      "That would represent a complete overhaul of the position and be necessary after offloading Lindelof. Branthwaite, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro would finally adequately address that problem position in the squad, allowing the new hierarchy to address other areas over the coming windows.",

      "Facundo Pellistri might no longer be a Manchester United player, but club officials will hope the winger continues to shine as he begins his career away from Old Trafford.",
      "The Uruguayn's permanent exit was confirmed with a £5.1m move to Panathinaikos on Wednesday, with a further £1.7m due in add-ons, but the most eye-catching part of the deal was the size of the sell-on United had negotiated with the Greek outfit.",
      "Whether Pellistri shines or not in Greece, United will pocket 45% of his next fee. If the 21-year-old is sold at a loss that won't amount to much, but if he thrives for regular game time and lands a bigger move, then a substantial sum could be heading back to fill the coffers at Old Trafford. Pellistri will hope to find his way back to a big five European league and United will hope he can achieve that as well.",
      "Sell-on clauses have gradually become more common in the game and United are starting to latch on. Almost all of the deals they have done for the sale of academy players this summer have included sizeable clauses and one will be included when Maxi Oyedele finalises his move to Legia Warsaw.",
      "There was what was described as a 'sizeable' sell-on clause included when Willy Kambwala left to join Villarreal and around a 50% clause included in the deal that took Mason Greenwood to Marseille. United also included a sell-on when Alvaro Fernandez joined Benfica while most agreements also include buy-back clauses.",
      "This is now the common structure when academy graduates are sold and United have made up ground in this department. They have certainly been more proactive around selling young players since Erik ten Hag arrived at the club, with Anthony Elanga, Zidane Iqbal, Matej Kovar, Teden Mengi, Axel Tuanzebe, Ethan Laird, Charlie Savage, Noam Emeran, and Marc Jurado all leaving last summer.",
      "In Ten Hag's first summer in charge James Garner was the headline academy departure, moving to Everton when a 15% sell-on clause was included. United are tending to get higher percentages now and it is sometimes worth accepting a smaller fee to land the higher clause, protecting the club if the player suddenly thrives with exposure to regular football.",
      "United are yet to see a major benefit to these deals, but it's no surprise they are getting higher clauses in deals when two former Manchester City powerbrokers now work for the club, in chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox. City lead the way when it comes to profiting from academy sales and often doing so twice.",
      "This summer they banked around £10m from the deals that took Aro Muric from Burnley to Ipswich and Douglas Luiz from Aston Villa to Juventus. They could cash-in again if James Trafford is sold by Burnley and collected twice in quick succession last year when Romeo Lavia left Southampton to sign for Chelsea.",
      "In an era defined by stricter spending controls, buy-back clauses are becoming a key weapon for big clubs. United have had to sell to buy this summer and could yet be forced to sell Scott McTominay to raise the funds to sign Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The £40m or so they have raised from selling Greenwood, Kambwala, Pellistri and Fernandez has been helpful, but the fees heading to United for that quartet won't end there.",

      "The 53-year-old ended his eight-year tenure with England following Euro 2024. In recent months, even before his exit from the England job was announced, Southgate's name had been linked to several positions, including Manchester United prior to Erik ten Hag signing a new contract extension at Old Trafford.",
      "Reports now suggest that Southgate has accepted a new position that will last until the end of the season. Meanwhile, Henry Winter claims he will be attending matches as a UEFA technical observer, alongside ex-West Ham United manager David Moyes.",
      "Technical observers are responsible for analysing matches from a coaching viewpoint and producing comprehensive reports with video and statistical analysis. They have access to multiple camera angles, cutting-edge visualisation tools, and a wealth of data to aid their observations.",
      "The role also involves identifying trends in football play, providing coaches and coach educators with a more holistic understanding of the game.",
      "Roberto Martinez, previously a UEFA technical observer, shared insights with the organisation's official website, saying: \"Instead of just watching the game for a specific reason, in my capacity as a national team coach, you are watching it in a more holistic way and appreciating the development of the game and the competition itself.",
      "\"It could be different types of performances, from young players, for example, or the way the competition is getting tougher physically and cuter tactically with the new trends within the competition.\"",

      "Matthijs de Ligt has Ajax, Juventus, Bayern Munich and Manchester United on his CV.",
      "He's exclusively played for some of Europe's biggest clubs at just 25 years old and arrived in Manchester this summer with the sort of pedigree most footballers dream of having. United signed De Ligt from Bayern Munich for €45m (£38.4m) with a potential further €5m (£4.2m) in add-ons earlier this month and that seemed a reasonable fee.",
      "Considering the experience De Ligt has and the potential upside to his arrival, his transfer seemed like smart business from United. Yet he may have to wait longer than expected to make his full debut for the club because Harry Maguire got the nod against Fulham last week.",
      "De Ligt has been signed to start and the expectation is he will partner Lisandro Martinez, but Maguire started on the opening day and won't give up his place without a fight. Maguire enjoyed a renaissance last term and clawed his way back into the starting side, despite losing the captaincy, which demonstrated his impressive resilience and determination.",
      "The 31-year-old has avoided injury for most of his career and was unfortunate to pick up two separate issues last term, a groin problem in December and April's calf injury. Some questioned the commitment of United's players last term and Wayne Rooney said in May that a few members of the dressing room were hiding behind injury, but that couldn't have been further from the truth with Maguire, who put his body on the line for the club.",
      "United's defenders dropped like flies and Maguire could have opted for a spell on the sidelines to get fully fit when his body was tested in April - but he didn't and continued. Maguire played through a knock away from home against Bournemouth on April 13 and was spotted clutching his left thigh in pain. Although it seemed likely he would be substituted at half-time, he received treatment in the dressing room and emerged for the second period.",
      "United played Coventry in the semi-finals of the FA Cup a week later and Maguire didn't train between games, yet he played 120 minutes and pushed through another issue. He is the type of character who will always be welcome in a United dressing room and his dedication hasn't gone unnoticed by fans, whose relationship with him has healed.",
      "Maguire picked up where he left off against Fulham and was one of United's best players, making crucial interventions when Fulham were close to Andre Onana's goal and seeming to meet every ball that was crossed into the box with his head. It would be wrong to name Maguire on the bench against Brighton on the back of that impressive performance, which means the wait for De Ligt's full debut should go on.",
      "De Ligt was introduced in the second half against Fulham and some fans will prefer him to start over Maguire at the Amex Stadium but it would send the wrong message to the squad. Maguire didn't put a foot wrong and the starting role should be his for as long as he continues to deliver strong performances. If Maguire underperforms then replacing him with De Ligt in the starting XI will be logical but he should start until then.",
      "Understandably, there is a clamour among supporters to see De Ligt start because he is brand new and shiny, but Maguire was excellent last season and won't be displaced easily. He is certainly not a glamorous player but he's dependable. He put an awful two years behind him last season and will make more starts than most expect in 2024/25. The defender has fought for his starting place previously and will do so again.",

      "\"But my teammates are the ones who see each other every single day. We have to come here and we still have to fight, and we still have to share these moments when things are not going well, and when the things are going well. This, ultimately, is my second family.",
      "\"This award is recognition by your team-mates, so I think it’s really special because they see you every day, they know the work that you put in behind the scenes.\"",
      "Dalot lost his starting role in Erik ten Hag's first year but forced his way back into the starting team in 2023/24 and became one of the most consistent performers in the dressing room.",
      "He started 35 games from a possible 38 in the Premier League and managed to avoid injury throughout the campaign, only being unavailable once through suspension.",
      "Dalot's durability was a huge asset in a season when most players seemed to pick up an injury and he probably played the best football of his career on an individual basis.",
      "Of course, last season was disappointing for United as a club, but Dalot emerged with credit and Aaron Wan-Bissaka was sold this summer, which ended their battle for good.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui has been brought in from Bayern Munich for €15million (£12.8m) with a possible €5m (£4.2m) in add-ons and club sources said he was signed because he is comfortable playing on either side of the defence.",
      "Mazraoui is versatile and that made him an appealing option, especially when considering that Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia missed large chunks of last term due to injury.",
      "The Morrocan international started against Fulham on the opening day of the campaign, but it became clear in the warm-up he was playing at right-back and Dalot was starting at left-back because they were preparing for kick-off by playing in crosses from those sides.",
      "Mazraoui made a confident debut and made a vital contribution in the first half when intercepting explosive Fulham winger Adama Traore after his tremendous run on the right.",
      "Traore sprinted down Dalot's channel but he was nowhere to be seen and Mazraoui thwarted the danger by coming across to his side and executing a brilliant slide tackle in the box.",
      "Overall, it was a pleasing first appearance from Mazraoui, but Dalot wasn't at his best on the other side and may struggle to reproduce his strongest displays at left-back.",
      "Thankfully, Shaw should return from the sidelines in a few weeks and Dalot should regain his starting role at right-back, but it seems likely that Shaw will be absent again at different periods this season, which means he may have to play on the other side when necessary.",
      "Dalot has plenty of experience of playing at left-back and featured there on several occasions last season, but his attacking threat is reduced when he doesn't start at right-back.",
      "In the scenario of Shaw being unavailable and Ten Hag preferring Mazraoui on the right side of defence, expectations of Dalot contributing in attacking phases should be lowered.",
      "Dalot is often seen making overlapping runs and crossing the ball using his right foot when he starts there and he's unable to be as effective when starting on the opposite side.",
      "It's something worth keeping in mind when assessing Dalot's performances in the coming weeks.",

      "Another incentive for Manchester United to prioritise sales over the next eight days is their squad size.",
      "The club website lists 32 players in the first team section. It is not as obese as Chelsea's squad but there is some flab to cut off.",
      "There are caveats. Dan Gore, last in a matchday squad in December and recovering from a shoulder injury following an unfulfilling loan at Port Vale, is listed as a first team squad member.",
      "Harry Amass, Toby Collyer and Ethan Wheatley were added earlier this month and the trio all started for the Under-21s in their captivating comeback at Barnsley in the EFL Trophy on Tuesday night.",
      "Facundo Pellistri is going and Hannibal Mejbri probably will go. In the best-case scenario that Scott McTominay and Jadon Sancho are also among the outgoings with Manuel Ugarte the incoming, then United would have a healthy squad size of 28.",
      "Clubs with European competition commitments to factor into their calendars need 25-man squads, minimum. United tend to favour that number and make allowances for academy breakthroughs. Wheatley became academy debutant 250 in April and Collyer was the 251st. Amass should be the 252nd.",
      "In 2016-17, United eventually settled on a 28-man squad (with the re-addition of Bastian Schweinsteiger) as they won the Europa League. The drawback was there was only one rookie bidding to breakthrough in Axel Tuanzebe, so Morgan Schneiderlin and Memphis Depay knocked on Jose Mourinho's door asking to leave long before the winter transfer window opened.",
      "Both left after only 18 months at United and so did Schweinsteiger two months later. Players started to drop like flies, with four on crutches for the Europa League final. Mourinho turned to the academy to supplement the squad and Tuanzebe was a regular in the run-in while Scott McTominay was promoted in a 64-game campaign.",
      "United have 38 Premier League games, at least eight Europa League league matches, League Cup and FA Cup third round ties this term. That is 48 matches minimum - only four shy of the 52 fixtures they had in the exhausting 2023-24.",
      "Erik ten Hag has three specialist left backs having gone the majority of last season without any. The two senior options are still crocked but Diogo Dalot is a secure stop-gap and Ten Hag believes Amass could be ready for competitive first team exposure in the spring.",
      "\"We have to make progress,\" Ten Hag said at UCLA on August 1. \"But we all see here a potential where we have seen in previous years, for instance two years ago, Garnacho last season. We had it during last season with Kobbie.",
      "\"But he (Amass) is not that far now at this moment. But if we train him well, if we coach him well, then in three months it's possible that he can be on that point.\"",
      "\"But in this moment he needs to catch up and he has to develop some skills already to play for Manchester United, competing for the highest positions in the league. But with big talent it can go up very quickly and that is very interesting to see if he is capable of doing this.\"",
      "Collyer has been named in both squads this season and is likely to be on the bench again at former club Brighton on Saturday. Wheatley could get more matchday involvement on Europa League nights when benches are expanded to 12 substitutes.",
      "There is ample cover in defence, even with two centre halves on crutches. Four centre backs played against Fulham and United will almost certainly have Victor Lindelof as an option when he is fit again.",
      "United would rather have Jarrad Branthwaite yet Lindelof's injury-ravaged pre-season leaves them saddled with a player they could have released this summer had United not triggered the one-year extension in Lindelof's deal.",
      "Five of the six injuries United have already suffered this season have been to defenders. Aaron Wan-Bissaka has gone and the small-fry Will Fish is bound for Cardiff.",
      "United's midfield and attack were seldom depleted last season. For the nadir at Crystal Palace in May, United fielded an attacking trio that cost £218.3million. There are two obvious picks for each of the front four positions.",
      "The issue last season was United effectively had one striker to depend on and Rasmus Hojlund, an unproven and callow striker signing, missed nine matches. United lost four of them and Hojlund's muscle injury on the eve of the visit of Fulham in February was the death knell for their Champions League qualifying chances. Fulham beat United and then City did the following week.",
      "United have creditably coped in their past five matches with a strikerless side and a substitute striker. Hojlund came on to score against Newcastle and Brighton while Joshua Zirkzee was the matchwinning debutant against Fulham.",
      "After the September internationals, Hojlund and Zirkzee should be in the same matchday 20, with the squad a healthier size.",

      "Pep Guardiola believes Manchester United's four new signings will provide momentum and help Erik ten Hag to steer his side into the Premier League top four this season.",
      "United have signed Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui this summer and are looking to sign a midfielder before the transfer deadline on August 30. Mazraoui made his full debut in the 1-0 victory against Fulham on Friday and Zirkzee scored the matchwinner from off the bench.",
      "De Ligt was also introduced to the game as a substitute and those new arrivals all played their part in claiming three points on the opening day of the season. Yoro was unveiled to the Old Trafford crowd before the game and he stood on crutches following a successful surgery on the metatarsal injury that he sustained in pre-season.",
      "The young defender, who was signed from Lille for an initial €62m, is expected to return to action in October and will attempt to help United qualify for Champions League football again. That is the minimum target for Ten Hag and Guardiola recently told reporters he expects United to be in contention for top four and to have 'momentum' after their summer transfers.",
      "“Always at the beginning of the season, the first target is to finish in the top four,” Guardiola said about the tough competition in the Premier League this season. “People say: ‘Oh, come on’, I say ‘no’. Newcastle are not in Europe, and are going to play one game a week. Newcastle with one game a week this season will be the Newcastle of two seasons ago.",
      "“Arsenal are not necessary to talk about. Liverpool are not necessary to talk about. I know the signings of United, they are going to take the momentum and they will be there.",
      "“Tottenham, I’m pretty sure they invest and with the young players and the manager knows better. There are a lot of teams - Chelsea again, the amount of players and their quality and the manager.",
      "“Six or seven teams will be there and if you drop a little bit, you will be away. This is the reality that I have felt since the first season I arrived here and after we proved to ourselves that we can do it and to try to do it again. It’s simple.”",
      "United finished eighth in the Premier League last term, which represented their worst finish in the top flight, and were eight points adrift from the Champions League places. The bookmakers have made City, Arsenal, Liverpool and United their favourites to finish in the top four, with Chelsea and Tottenham priced as the most likely after that.",
      "Aston Villa qualified for the Champions League last season but many expect Unai Emery's side to drop off, just like Newcastle did after playing in Europe's premium competition.",

      "After the game, Zirkzee highlighted his delight with his debut goal, claiming it was: \"A great feeling, a great feeling, it couldn’t be any better. What can I say? Debut, winning, scoring in front of the Stretford End, so yeah, it’s unbelievable. Where does this moment rank?",
      "\"Somewhere between my debuts and it’s a bit below winning the Champions League with Bayern and my national team debut, but it’s up there. I'm just trying to be the best version I can be, help the team and club, so no specific goals.\"",
      "Afterwards, Van Nistelrooy was spotted putting his arm around the new United frontman with a huge smile on his face, clearly highlighting his delight with Zirkzee's finish.

United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Scott McTominay issued the perfect riposte last season. Having been considered a sellable asset at Manchester United he returned his best campaign for the club to show his worth. So why, a year on, might he be sold for less than United rejected in 2023?",
      "In many ways, what happens with McTominay over the next eight days could expose the faultlines within the transfer market at the moment, conditioned by the financial rules enforced by the Premier League.",
      "Those Profit and Sustainability regulations (PSR) are a concern for every club but an unfortunate side effect of them is that they have made the sale of academy graduates more appealing. You only need to look to Stamford Bridge and the way Chelsea have forced some of their young players out to realise that they need a rethink.",
      "United haven't had to be quite as drastic as that but having struggled to sell as many players as they expected this summer, they are once again considering selling McTominay. They will be bemused that having turned down £30m last August, they are now getting offers of less than that for a midfielder who scored 10 goals in a struggling team last season.",
      "So many of McTominay's goals were pivotal and while the 27-year-old isn't going to be a first-team regular at Old Trafford, he has the experience of being a key man for a club of United's size and for Scotland. For so many teams, he would be an asset, including the one he currently plays for.",
      "But having failed to sell Casemiro and Christian Eriksen, United will consider selling McTominay to raise the necessary funds to sign Manuel Ugarte, with the 23-year-old Uruguayan the top midfield target this summer. United and Paris St-Germain have failed to agree a fee for Ugarte, but a loan with an obligation to buy could yet solve that dilemma.",
      "If McTominay does become a fall guy, however, it will once again show that the Premier League's rules aren't fit for purpose. United aren't desperate to sell the Scot and after last season he has a role to play, but the future of an academy graduate is up for debate because United need to raise funds to tick boxes.",
      "It's an unpalatable position for the club to be in as well. If they do sell McTominay this summer it will be for a fee well below his valuation. Somebody could land a bargain before the August 30 deadline.",
      "Fulham's offers for McTominay were below the £30m United rejected from West Ham last summer but rather than coming back to the table, the Cottagers have turned their attention to Burnley's Sander Berge, who was of interest to United but wanted guarantees over playing time.",
      "Any deal for McTominay is now likely to be with an overseas club, who simply don't have the same budgets as Premier League sides. Napoli hold an interest, as do teams in Turkey, but none could stump up £25m and United could even have to accept a loan deal with an option or obligation to buy.",
      "The only reason to do that would be to fund a move for Ugarte. He would add something to the United squad and would almost certainly be an upgrade in defensive midfield. It just wouldn't be a great way to get to that position.",

The Uruguayan is thought to be keen on a move to the Premier League and PSG look to be preparing for life without him having not included the player in their squad for the 4-1 victory over Le Havre.",
      "According to journalist Florian Plettenberg, negotiations between all parties are now at an advanced stage. While he stressed the deal is not over the line yet, there is a general reassurance that one will be completed.",
      "As such, a verbal agreement on the transfer has reportedly been reached. For the substance of the deal, it is believed either a permanent deal or a loan with obligation to buy are the two scenarios left remaining on the table.",
      "Elsewhere, The Athletic reports that United are internally preparing themselves for Chelsea to make a bid for Jadon Sancho before the transfer window slams shut. The Reds value Sancho at £40m and MEN Sport understands United would be open to selling him before deadline day.",
      "The report suggests that United are struggling to offload Sancho due to his wages with few clubs willing to match his current package. According to Capology, Sancho is on £250,000 per week at Old Trafford making him the fourth-highest earner at the club behind Casemiro, Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Despite this, it is claimed that some inside United feel Chelsea will make a last-ditch bid to sign Sancho before the window closes considering Raheem Sterling is being listed as for sale.",

      "When Manchester United splashed the cash on Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro earlier in the transfer window, it became clear they might have to be creative to sign a midfielder.",
      "United have worked with a limited budget and, like all Premier League clubs, have been conscious of PSR rules, which meant spending a multi-million fee on a midfielder without offloading Casemiro - there was a lack of interest in the Brazilian - wasn't going to be financially possible.",
      "That's without mentioning United also signed Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui for an initial combined fee of €60million (£51m) from Bayern Munich to strengthen the defence.",
      "With Zirkzee, Yoro, De Ligt and Mazaroui through the door, the club's attention has turned to signing a midfielder and talks are progressing with Paris Saint-Germain for Ugarte.",
      "A move for Ugrarte seemed to lose momentum last month due to PSG's valuation of the player, but a compromise to negotiate a loan deal for the 23-year-old is currently being discussed.",
      "United's preference is to buy Ugarte from PSG but they have been unwilling to meet the £51.5 asking price and a loan deal could be structured with the option to make it permanent.",
      "United were forced to be creative to sign Amrabat last summer, stumping up a hefty €10million loan fee and including an option to make the deal permanent for £25m, and it always felt likely that a breakthrough for Ugarte would require a deal to be similarly structured.",
      "The need for some fresh legs in the centre of the pitch has been obvious since November, despite there being signs in the last few weeks that there may be some life still in Casemiro.",
      "Although Burnley midfielder Sander Berge was considered by United, he's now on his way to Craven Cottage and that is expected to end their interest in Scott McTominay, who could have unlocked a permanent transfer for Ugarte if he was sold for £30m to the London club.",
      "Keeping McTominay, who became a matchwinner from the bench last season, and negotiating a workaround to sign Ugarte is the ideal outcome and United are hopeful of pulling it off.",
      "Well-placed sources have acknowledged there would be a benefit to United's profitability and sustainability calculations if a fixed fee for Ugarte is deferred until next summer and the Uruguay international was left out of PSG's squad last weekend as talks picked up momentum again.",
      "In terms of what Ugarte would bring to United, he's a highly mobile defensive midfielder and will be able to intercept and recover balls, which is what Erik ten Hag needs.",
      "The midfield was the biggest problem last term, which was partly due to personnel and partly tactical, and going into the new season without making a new signing was unthinkable.",
      "Casemiro has looked sharp in attacking areas in the Community Shield and on the opening day of the season against Fulham, however, he still looked off the pace defensively.",
      "Ugarte should be able to pick up his slack and could be the perfect foil for Kobbie Mainoo, with Bruno Fernandes starting in front of that pair in central attacking midfield.",
      "There has been a growing South American influence in the United dressing room since Ten Hag's appointment from Ajax in the spring of 2022 and Ugarte has the aggression, quality and mentality that is typically associated with players from that corner of the world.",

      "\"A great feeling, a great feeling, it couldn’t be any better,\" he said. Zirkzee was incredibly laidback in his first interview with club media last month and was equally relaxed when speaking to reporters, despite having scored the winner at Old Trafford around an hour previously.",
      "\"What can I say? Debut, winning, scoring in front of the Stretford End, so yeah, it’s unbelievable,\" Zirkzee added. Most players would still be riding the crest of the wave when speaking in the mixed zone after scoring on their debut but it was as if the 23-year-old had just played in a park.",
      "Some may interpret Zirkzee doesn't care because of his laidback nature but it's part of his charm - there won't be an occasion that fazes him and that will help at the world's biggest club.",
      "United are the most scrutinised team in the world and Zirkzee looks tailor-made to deal with the pressure, simply because he chooses not to feel it. \"Where does this moment rank? Somewhere between my debuts and it’s a bit below winning the Champions League with Bayern and my national team debut, but it’s up there,\" he said with an endearing grin on his face.",
      "\"I'm just trying to be the best version I can be, help the team and club, so no specific goals.\" However, Zirkzee does want to start for United and many believed he should have featured in the Community Shield last weekend, a game in which even Jadon Sancho was used in.",
      "\"I’m sure the manager had a good reason for it, I’m not too difficult with these things. It’s his choice and today, my debut, wasn’t too bad,\" Zirkzee replied about that decision.",
      "So is he a natural goalscorer? \"I’m not going to talk about myself like that, but it was a good touch today, so hopefully more of that,\" said Zirkzee. \"Not really [doesn't come naturally], it’s something you really have to work for and my role is probably what works best for the team.",
      "\"I’m a striker that’s comfortable coming in deep and helping the team play football, so it doesn’t really matter. This was my game in Italy [dropping in deep positions] and previously in Anderlecht, so that could be an option but if the manager needs me to do something else, I’m here.\"",
      "Zirkzee became the sixth Dutchman to score on his Old Trafford debut for United after Jordi Cruyff, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Robin van Persie, Alexander Buttner and Donny van de Beek.",
      "The goal extended United's opening day record in the Premier League - they have won more opening games than any other team - and also provided Zirkzee with 'relief'.",
      "\"I mean yeah, first game, first goal, it’s always a relief to have that off your shoulders, but it goes on,\" he explained. \"I saw the replay of my goal and it didn’t look too bad.\"",
      "United paid €42.5million (£35.8m) to sign Zirkzee from Bologna this summer and he made the best possible start to vindicating that investment by scoring the winner against Fulham.",
      "\"Why Manchester United?,\" he laughed. \"For some people, it might be crazy, but for me, this is the biggest club in the world, so it wasn’t a difficult choice to make, to be honest.\"",
      "Zirkzee is being coached by Ruud van Nistelrooy at Carrington and he described the opportunity to work with the legendary former striker as a privilege. \"Yeah, it’s a privilege to have someone like that. As a striker, it’s not every day you have someone that you grew up watching,\" he said.",
      "\"That’s pretty much it, but everybody in the staff up to now has been great and I enjoy working with these people a lot. It’s not just him, but obviously it’s an extra privilege.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy is a familiar face to Zirkzee, given he idolised him as a child, but he has established friendships with United's latest signings, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "\"I mean they’re two great players and we’ll see in the future what they can bring,\" said Zirkzee, who played with both players during his time spent with Bayern Munich.",
      "\"I’m sure they’ll do a lot of great things here. I think Mazaroui had a great game today as well and I think De Ligt came in with a lot of good energy as well, so yeah, it’s good to have familiar faces around, but everybody in the team has been very kind and it’s top being part of this group.",
      "\"He [Mazraoui] arrived this week and it’s not easy to come into a team and play the way he did. I think it all looked natural and that was the most special part of his game today.",
      "\"But yeah, that’s just the player he is, he’s there to do his job and perform the best way he can and I think he did great today… and I'm not just saying that because he’s my friend!\"",
      "Most United fans will want Zirkzee to start against Brighton next weekend and in the meantime, they might find him walking his dog around the leafy suburbs of Manchester.",
      "\"I don’t do much, I have my dog, I take him for a walk and sit in the house and watch a TV series, play PlayStation or do whatever,\" he said about his hobbies. \"I’ve just finished The Umbrella Academy on Netflix and it wasn’t too good of an ending but I enjoyed it, it was good.\"",

      "Manchester United could sign their third Bayern Munich player of the summer and their former midfield target in one fell swoop after the German giants put Leon Goretzka up for sale",
      "Fabrizio Romano reports Bayern will make it clear to Goretzka that he will not have a starting role under new manager Vincent Kompany this season. With the German international surplus to requirements, it would make sense for last year’s Bundesliga runners-up to cash in on the box-to-box midfielder.",
      "There has not yet been any reported interest from United’s part regarding the 29-year-old. But that could well change as the Red Devils are currently in the market for a similar profile of player.",
      "Erik ten Hag’s current options in the centre of the pitch are Kobbie Mainoo, Scott McTominay, Mason Mount and ageing duo Christian Eriksen and Casemiro. Goretzka is currently in his prime and offers dynamism in midfield, capable of playing in a three and in a double-pivot.",
      "Should United make a successful approach, Goretzka would astonishingly become their third Bayern signing this summer. It comes after they secured a double swoop of defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui for a combined sum of over £50m last week.",
      "The move may not be as simple as it may seem initially, though, with Goretzka repeatedly insisting his desire is to stay at Bayern due to his love for the club and the city. Yet he would be forced out should a tantalising enough offer come in, as Bayern will look to cash in on him before his contract ends in 2026.",
      "United also have other targets who play in the same position, such as Burnley’s Sander Berge and PSG’s Manuel Ugarte, who are valued at £30m and £52m respectively. Goretzka, however, was a target last summer at Old Trafford and towards the backend of last year, with reports claiming United had “never lost focus on Goretzka” after he fell out of favour with at-the-time Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Goretzka signed for Bayern in 2019 as a 22-year-old with expectations on his shoulders. His career in Bavaria has often been blighted by injuries and his progress hampered as a result of falling down the pecking order under a merry-go-round of new managers.",
      "He played a key role in Bayern’s historic sextuple-winning season in 2019/20, however. And last season was one of his most productive to date, featuring in 42 games across all competitions, scoring six and setting up 11.",
      "Vincent Kompany's brutal stance on Goretzka also comes just 12 months after club chief Christoph Freund branded him a dressing room leader, saying: \"Leon is an absolute top player, which he has consistently proven at the highest level over many years. In the past few weeks, he has shown strong performances in various positions, playing with a broken hand – that shows his great mentality. Leon is a leader who always leads the way on the pitch and takes responsibility even in difficult situations.\"",
      "However, Ugarte remains United's No 1 target and they want to sign him if PSG lower their demands, while the club have submitted an offer for Burnley's Berge, which is said to be below their £30m valuation, according to the Daily Mail.",

I said that when a player becomes my player, I'm the first to pin him to the wall when he makes a mistake. But towards the outside, I will always defend him as I would defend my son.\"",

      "As for Sancho, he was left out of the United squad to take on Fulham. The 24-year-old, who came off the bench in the Community Shield against Manchester City last week, didn't make the 20-man contingent for the opening Premier League fixture.",
      "Explaining his absence, Ten Hag said: \"First of all we need squad depth, this season will be survival of the fittest, I can only put 20 players in the squad. Then Jadon in the week had an ear infection, he was not 100 per cent fit. He could play but we made the choice, we preferred [to have] others on the bench. But that can change. It will change.",

In our latest look at the media headlines, we analyse a dream transfer the Reds could make as well as how one current player could unlock a surprise signing.",

He told reporters during the pre-season tour that he is committed to seeing out the remainder of his contract in the Premier League. Bringing in £5m for the midfielder would be a boost for the Reds considering they brought him in for free after his Brentford contract expired and a departure appears to be the dream solution for all parties at this point, with Eriksen not expected to feature much for United this season should he stay.

      "Casemiro was often blamed as being off the pace in the midfield which forced United to lack a defensively minded player in the centre. Upon his arrival at Old Trafford, you would expect Ugarte to form a partnership with Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "During the summer, we saw how Mainoo blossomed alongside Declan Rice for England at the European Championships and having a player who can effectively mop up in front of the back line should allow Mainoo to roam forward and show off his attacking capabilities. One person who is confident Ugarte can produce this role is former United striker Diego Forlan.",
      "He told ESPN Uruguay last year that he had spotted the midfielder's potential early and expressed: \"He is very important in the middle to free Valverde and Bentancur. Defensively he adds a lot. If I were a coach, I would love to put Ugarte in the middle.\"",
      "Having that anchor in the centre should not only allow Mainoo a bit more freedom but also give captain Bruno Fernandes the opportunity to focus solely on his offensive work.",

He should not be preoccupied with defensive duties - this should be left to Mainoo and Ugarte.",
      "Having Fernandes dictating play in the upper third of the pitch should not only help the young centre-forwards but also bring into play Marcus Rashford who is on a journey to rediscover his form. At his worst, Rashford looks isolated on the left flank but with Fernandes given more freedom to create, there is an opportunity there for the winger to be reintroduced into the attack more regularly.",

      "Manchester United youngster Sam Mather has signed a new long-term contract with the club.",
      "Mather's previous deal expired in June 2025, meaning he'd entered the final year of his contract, and he's now signed fresh terms that will ensure his future beyond next summer.",
      "The youngster, 19, was brought to the United States for the first-team's pre-season tour this summer and spent time with Rochdale on a flexi-loan in the second half of 2023/24.",
      "United created a flexi-loan system last year, which allows youngsters to gain senior experience whilst remaining involved in the day-to-day environment at Carrington, and Mather scored twice in 10 appearances for Rochdale, who finished in midtable in the National League.",
      "Mather was increasingly present in United first-team training before signing for Rochdale on a flexi-loan and his contract deal is a reward for his continued progress in the academy.",
      "Mather started every game in the successful 2021/22 FA Youth Cup campaign and contributed three goals and two assists on the way to winning that trophy.",
      "From that crop of players, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo are now established first-team players, while Dan Gore and Charlie McNeill have been given senior debuts.",
      "Shortly after the Youth Cup triumph, Mather was sidelined with a long-term injury, but he returned to full fitness last term and was in great form in academy fixtures.",
      "He caught attention when scoring four goals for the U21s in a 4-2 win over Norwich at Old Trafford in January, and finished last season with seven goals in 10 academy appearances.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "Manchester United got off to a winning start after a debut goal for Joshua Zirkzee earned a 1-0 triumph over Fulham.",
      "It was by no means a gold standard performance from Erik ten Hag's side but they did enough to pick up their first win of the season - extending their formidable run on the opening day of the Premier League season.",
      "United can sit back and relax for the rest of the weekend and watch the action unfold throughout the English top-flight as the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and other contenders look to get off to winning starts.",
      "Friday night saw a host of debuts with Noussair Mazraoui starting at right-back after signing from Bayern Munich this week. Match-winner Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt were second-half substitutes with the defender brought on in the latter stages to see the game out with Harry Maguire taken off as a precaution. With all that said, MEN Sport takes a look below at some of the latest media reports surrounding United as well as a view on each one...",
      "\"This morning we had 22 players training and if you ask all of them they want to play against City on Sunday but that is impossible,\" Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said speaking ahead of Sunday's clash with reigning champions, City.",
      "\"When you train every day and not get any minutes it is not good for them or for me and I need to make a decision. Probably it is better to leave and go and get minutes. The transfer window is open so we will see what will happen.\"",
      "According to BBC Sport, the new Chelsea manager has told England defender Ben Chilwell that he can leave the club this summer. The full-back has suffered with injury problems since arriving at Stamford Bridge.",
      "And earlier this summer, Man United were linked with a move for the full-back. It was claimed that United were considering an approach for the left-back to bolster their full-back options.",
      "MEN says: Friday night saw another makeshift left-back as Diogo Dalot was forced to filter over to that side while the new arrival started in the position on the right. Injuries have ravaged through United's ranks in the position with Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia on the treatment table and while there is a timeframe, there is always the challenge of getting up to speed with the Premier League intensity as well as forcing the returnee back is likely to spark more issues.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to sell Chilwell could put United on alert as he may be available at a bargain price. With that being said, there is always a concern with the defender's injury record.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte was left out of the squad for their opening day win over Le Havre.",
      "The Parisiens' curtain-raiser coincided with United's opener against Fulham but the Uruguayan was forced to watch on as PSG earned a commanding 4-1 win.",
      "United have held an interest in the midfielder with the Ligue 1 giants open to selling the former Sporting CP man for €60million (£51m) but it appears that there is still a distance between the clubs coming to an agreement. Nevertheless, there will be some encouragement as he was left out of the squad as interest swirls.",
      "MEN Sport says: Kobbie Mainoo needs a midfield partner and United will do what they can to accommodate the starlet. Casemiro started against Fulham but the scrutiny will not be far away from the former Real Madrid midfielder following his showings last term. Having splashed out on Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee, De Ligt and Mazraoui, United may have to tighten their belts in order to not fall into the trap of breaching Profit and Sustainability Rules.",

      "Having made light work of Newcastle United in their opening Premier League fixture of the 2010/11 campaign, winning 3-0 at Old Trafford, Manchester United travelled to the capital the following weekend with ambitions of scooping another three points.",
      "Goals from Dimitar Berbatov, Darren Fletcher and Ryan Giggs had sealed a comfortable opening day triumph over the Magpies at Old Trafford and a road trip to Craven Cottage looked like another enticing opportunity to get maximum points on the board.",
      "Having taken an 11th-minute lead through Paul Scholes, United's army of travelling supporters in the Putney End were confident of enjoying another comfortable afternoon watching their team.",
      "However, Fulham, who were under the stewardship of Roy Hodgson at the time, hit back 12 minutes after half-time through Simon Davies. It was nothing more than what the hosts had deserved and United knew they were locked in a battle for maximum points.",
      "But when Cottagers defender Brede Hangeland turned the ball into his own net with just six minutes of regulation time remaining, United looked on course to preserve their 100 per cent start to the season. Just moments later, the Reds were given a golden opportunity to make sure of the points once and for all.",
      "After Damien Duff sliced his own clearance, the ball struck his own arm. A penalty was awarded and United were given the opportunity to wrap up the game from 12 yards.",
      "Giggs, who had stepped off the substitutes bench a little over 10 minutes earlier, was United's designated penalty taker at the time and looked set to place the ball down on the spot. However, Giggs handed the ball to Nani, who had forced Duff's error to win the spot-kick.",
      "The Portuguese international stepped up and saw his effort saved by Fulham goalkeeper David Stockdale. It was a relatively easy strike for Stockdale to react to, palming it away to his right-hand side.",
      "No doubt preparing himself to face the wrath of Sir Alex Ferguson for his failure to convert from 12 yards, Nani's fears of a tongue-lashing from the former United manager worsened when Hangeland atoned for his error, scoring at the right end in the 89th-minute to earn Fulham a point.",
      "It was an action-packed conclusion to the game that saw Hangeland at the centre of the drama. Whereas the former defender had looked set to leave the hero as a villain, it was Nani who was in the firing line.",
      "\"That day he [Ferguson] was so mad at me,\" Nani said. \"But he preferred to kill Giggs, because he had the ball and was the most experienced player on the field.",
      "\"But because I was playing so well and I won the penalty, I wanted to score it. Giggs saw that and said 'yeah, take it' – but then I missed.",
      "\"When we went to the dressing room, Sir Alex was shouting at Giggs, saying 'Why did you do that?' and then said to me 'Nani, you'll never take penalties anymore'.\"",
      "As is still the case when United play in London, the squad made the trip back north after the stalemate on the banks of the Thames by train. They alighted the service in Macclesfield - roughly 20 miles south of Manchester - and Ferguson was in need of a lift home.",
      "Living next door to Ferguson at the time, Nani was tasked with the responsibility of chauffeuring the legendary Scot. Having missed from the penalty spot to wrap up three points just hours earlier, the now-37-year-old could have been forgiven for fearing an ear-bashing.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "£43",
      "After getting into the car, Nani anticipated a dosage of the infamous hairdryer treatment. Instead, Ferguson did not say a thing.",
      "\"When we got off the train, we had to go home, and because Sir Alex was living next to me, someone said 'Can anyone give a ride to the boss?' and I said 'I can, no problem'.",
      "\"When we got in the car, we were not talking for one minute. I was waiting for him to say something to me but he didn't.",
      "\"Then I said 'I'm sorry boss, for missing the penalty' and he said 'No problem son – you could have hit it better, but it's okay'.\"",
      "Ferguson evidently held no grudges against Nani for his failure to convert from the spot, rewarding him with a starting berth for United's following game. He scored and provided an assist as they brushed West Ham United aside at Old Trafford, winning 3-0.",
      "The winger, who was often a box of tricks, enjoyed a stellar start to the 2010/11 Premier League campaign, scoring five goals and registering 11 assists in his first 15 appearances of the season.",
      "However, Ferguson stuck to his word and never allowed Nani to step up from the penalty spot again. Fortunately for the former Sporting Lisbon man, he enjoyed enough moments in a United shirt not to rely on a kick from 12 yards.",

However, 14 hours away next to the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California where the Reds faced Arsenal in pre-season, the supporters in attendance would beg to differ.",

One fan Chigozie (aka Slick Rule on X) from Birmingham was fortunate enough to be at the bar and told MEN Sport about his incredible experience watching the Reds like never before.",
      "\"I was actually at work, I live in Birmingham and I came to LA for a work trip,\" he explained. \"In the office we were discussing the Premier League season and someone says there is this nice place that has newly opened, it is close to the SoFi Stadium and they are going to be showing the game.",
      "\"I checked it out on my phone and noticed it was ticketed, they had different sections with different price ranges. The most expensive tier was about $100 (£77.86) and that was in a VIP section. The other price point was $22 (£17.13) and for that you could sit anywhere around the screen.",
      "\"When you walk in it feels like you are live at the game. You see every detail in the stadium, even the fans. I came to the US last Saturday, I have been to a lot of places - Hollywood and the rest - but this tops my experience in the US for this summer. It was simply amazing.\"",
      "Chigozie explained that rather than a cinema screen, the bar has installed a dome-like screen which immerses you in the experience. When the action is happening, cameras cut to different angles in the stadium to show you the best possible view of what is happening.",
      "Once at that angle, you could see the entirety of the action across the length of the pitch as the camera positioned you as if you were in the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand or the Stretford End. Unsurprisingly, Chigozie shocked his family and friends when he sent them images and videos of his view of the match on social media.",
      "\"I posted a lot of the videos on Twitter and I captioned it with: ‘Here at the executive director’s box at Old Trafford,’ and my friends thought I was back in the UK and were wondering how I managed to get a ticket in the box,\" he laughed. \"They couldn’t believe that I wasn’t actually in Old Trafford.\"",
      "While he admitted that he would love something like this to come to the UK, there is an acceptance that this could be difficult due to the 3pm blackout rules. \"I spoke to one of the US fans about it and I did wonder how possible it would be to have this in the UK considering not all games are available on a matchday,\" Chigozie concluded.",
      "\"But I think if something like this was to come to Birmingham and I could not go to Old Trafford, I think it would be pretty massive.\"",

The former Everton chief said: \"Unlike the US, there will be no government funding for a project like this.",
      "\"The only funding they will get will be around the changes to infrastructure – roads in the public domain. There really shouldn’t be any investment into a private club’s stadium. It will be up to them to assess the funding model they’re going to have and the size of stadium they’ll go for.",
      "\"We’ve been told that 100,000 seats is the target. It seems a sensible target for United, and the financial model should be able to sustain that. Interest rates are coming down globally, so it should be easy for them to get it financed. Even at £2billion, I can’t see it being a problem. If they reduce the numbers, it won’t be due to a lack of government funding.\"",

      "Former Brighton ace Glenn Murray says he once urged Manchester United sporting director Dan Ashworth to sign Joao Pedro.",
      "Five years before he took the job at Old Trafford, Ashworth was technical director at the Amex Stadium and oversaw a period of ruthlessly shrewd business that helped establish the Seagulls as one of the most financially savvy clubs in European football.",
      "During that period, Murray, who was on loan at Watford at the time, phoned Ashworth to tell him a young kid named Pedro, who had only just arrived in English football, was worth snapping up. Brighton never moved for the striker, but Ashworth obviously took the advice on board and tried to sign the Brazilian after becoming Newcastle's sporting director in 2022.",
      "Speaking on the official Brighton and Hove Albion YouTube channel alongside Seagulls ace Danny Welbeck, Murray, 40, said: \"I must admit, when I played with you guys with Watford, he was the one that makes you go 'Wow, who is this kid?' The things he could do, he [Pedro] was so good.",
      "\"I think there's a lot more growth in him, he has loads more to give. We've seen glimpses from last year of what he is capable of and his tally was impressive in the end. But, I think he can get so much better.",
      "\"I'll be honest, he was my first call back to Dan Ashworth. I was literally getting on the train and I was like 'You've got to sign this kid'. He was that type of player where you were just blown away by him.\"",
      "Ashworth left Brighton in February 2022, and a year-and-a-half later, Pedro signed for the south coast club.",
      "Elsewhere, United have been linked with a move for Pedro's Brighton team-mate Evan Ferguson, who notched 16 goals and five assists in his first two full seasons as a pro. The Irishman's stock has fallen slightly following an injury-disrupted 2023/24 campaign, but it's understood United are mulling over a £50million move for the striker.",
      "Welbeck, who played 142 times for United, says he's a fervent fan of Ferguson, and lauded the youngster as a \"predator in the box\". He said: \"Evan was unfortunate with injuries last season. It was one of them where once he gets his games this season, I'm pretty sure he will be just as lethal as he was when he came into the side.",
      "\"He's a predator in the box and there's not many like him around. He's big and strong, but he's agile and lethal in the box. I'm looking forward to seeing him back on the pitch and, obviously, we've got a lot of new players that have come into the side.\"",

      "Although some speculated that Ennis would leave on loan this summer after signing his new contract, he will continue to be an integral U21 player and could be allowed to leave on a temporary deal to challenge himself in a senior environment in the January window.",
      "There were high hopes for Ennis when United signed him from rivals Liverpool and his minutes were carefully handled last season, which helped him return to full fitness.",
      "Ennis signed his first professional contract immediately after celebrating his 17th birthday and only the most highly regarded academy talents are given pro deals so quickly.",
      "The Chesire-born lad scored 10 goals in 19 appearances for United's Under-18s in 2021/22, his first full season at the club, and his finishing ability is one of his finest qualities.",

      "Manchester United's academy building at Carrington is currently a hive of activity.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's project to renovate the main building, which is costing £50million, began in June and the senior players are sharing the youth building while construction is ongoing.",
      "There is a tangible buzz around the academy building and the Manchester Evening News were recently invited through its doors to speak with Under-21 manager Travis Binnion.",
      "Binnion has been generous with his time since taking charge of the U21s and discussed the likes of Toby Collyer, Ethan Wheatley, Harry Amass, and how INEOS have impacted the academy during the interview, which was ahead of the youngsters' game against Barnsley in the EFL Trophy.",
      "\"Over the last year, those two players you mentioned, Amass and Wheatley, have progressed a lot, a hell of a lot,\" Binnion said. \"Ethan Wheatley in particular has turned into a real eye-catching centre forward and his profile is one that managers like because he’s lean, quick and tall.",
      "\"If you drew a No.9, you’d draw him looking like Ethan, but his game has come on leaps and bounds, so knowing where to run and his link-up play has improved, and being in better positions.",
      "\"He’s spent around 12 to 13 weeks consistently training with the first-team, just like Harry, and I think within that environment, particularly when you’re having to play like they did in pre-season, you’re able to learn quicker. The good players always do in that situation.",
      "\"Equally, if you find it hard in that environment, it can be an unforgiving place to be because the level is possibly too high if you’re struggling. You find out a lot about yourself in terms of your game, but you also find out a lot about yourself as a person and as a professional as well.\"",
      "Wheatley and Amass were both taken on the USA pre-season tour and were given opportunities by Erik ten Hag, who named them in a handful of first-team squads last season.",
      "Both are highly regarded at United and Wheatley is seen as a young striker with vast potential, while some have predicted Amass could become Luke Shaw's long-term successor.",
      "\"Harry’s very good on the ball, he can defend well, but he knows a big part of his game is wider defending to ensure he deals with movement and defending space in behind,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"His game in possession is in a really good place and he’s physically capable, but he knows that he’s got to keep working, as most full-backs have, in their defensive moments.\"",
      "Collyer was another youngster to stand out during pre-season and Ten Hag said he'd 'earned' his first-team chances when he spoke to reporters before the USA tour.",
      "Last month, Collyer signed a new contract until 2027 and Ten Hag insisted on attending his signing ceremony at Carrington, while the Dutchman was also spotted deep in conversation with him after the FA Cup final, which was reminiscent of his exchange with Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Collyer's athleticism has impressed staff and his running stats are among the best in each training session, which saw him make his competitive senior debut in the Community Shield.",
      "\"If Toby had a clean 18 months and a clean two and a half years with us, we would be talking about a really top young player,\" Binnion said. \"We’re talking about a really good young player with high potential. He joined us from another club and took a little while to get going.",
      "\"He couldn’t play in the FA Youth Cup run, so he was here but couldn’t play. He's also had a couple of injuries and nothing terrible, but when you have a spell out of the game and have a couple of injuries that stop you playing, it takes a while to get going, but when we signed him, we had no doubts about what he was capable of - he's a fantastic athlete and effective without the ball.",
      "\"Toby is also making great strides with the ball, so we’re talking there about someone who can be really effective in all moments of the game and I think that’s what you saw on tour.",
      "\"That's why the manager has involved him in numerous squads. I think he’s earned the trust of the manager and that’s not easy to do, so great credit to him, he’s a fantastic lad.",
      "\"He's got a superb attitude and he’s getting what he deserves. We just know the manager really likes him and the conversations I have with Fletch [Darren Fletcher] are along those lines and we talk about what’s right for his development, so what’s next and what does he need to do?\"",
      "Kobbe Mainoo was standing outside the academy building, chatting to Hannibal Mejbri, before Binnion arrived for the interview and the U21 boss said the next step for the likes of Wheatley, Amass and Collyer is to emulate how he's established himself as a senior player.",
      "\"The challenge for those boys is to become Kobbie, [Alejandro] Garnacho, or Omari Forson, who has left the club now but he was around a lot of matchday squads and featured more than once.",
      "\"That’s your first step, train with the first-team all the time, which some of those boys are doing, then it’s to be in multiple squads, then it’s to make multiple appearances and then become an established sort of starter. There are four stages there and that’s if you stay in the building.",
      "\"I don’t think there’s a better club in the country to be at to aspire and achieve and see very quickly what you can do. With that comes a great expectation and you’ve got to be good enough, but I really don’t think there’s a better club to be at for the ‘pathway’. People use that word and I don’t like it, but that’s the title that’s given and this is the best club to be at for that.\"",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho have both previously starred in EFL Trophy fixtures, a competition in which Premier League sides field U21 teams against League One and League Two senior teams, and United get their new campaign under way on Tuesday night against Barnsley.",
      "United will also play Doncaster and Huddersfield in their EFL Trophy group and the U21 side has been followed by a sold-out away support over the last few seasons in the competition.",
      "\"My two fondest memories are the FA Youth Cup final, with the brilliant crowd that night, and Stockport away in the EFL Trophy,\" said Binnion. \"Salford was good last season, bar the result, and Fleetwood was great. Garnacho’s late winner at Barrow was great and we can’t shy away from the two drubbings against Bolton, so I’m glad we’re not in their group this year.",
      "\"But that was a great learning experience. We are very lucky to work at a football club where the academy is integral and you feel it. There’s an expectation that comes with that, but there’s excitement from the fans that I don’t see from any other club towards its youth players",
      "\"The EFL Trophy is the best competition for us, alongside the Youth Cup. They’re the two we’re involved in every year that I think we find the most about the players and the players look forward to most, so that’s a good indicator of the importance it plays within our programme.",
      "\"It gives the players a first taste of senior football and a real good opportunity against senior opposition, which brings different challenges, but they also have to deal with the expectation of having to deliver with a different level of challenge, which is obviously greater.",
      "\"The good players and the better players thrive in those moments, so I can remember both of those players [Mainoo and Garnacho] delivering high-level moments that gave the manager and fans insight into whether they had the capability of breaking into the first-team.",
      "\"It’s all well and good performing for the U18s or in the PL2, but there are certain games when you feel and can see in front of your eyes that players grow. On the other hand, some players don’t deliver the sort of performance you were hoping to see and that’s not terminal.",
      "\"But if over three games and two years of playing in that competition, they’ve maybe not delivered or they have, it probably points towards what they will do within the club.\"",
      "Binnion last spoke to the MEN in May for a season review article and he'd just overseen an academy trip to France that saw United take on the youth team of INEOS-owned Nice.",
      "Since then, INEOS' relationship with United's academy has strengthened and Binnion provided insight into how technical director Jason Wilcox and sporting director Dan Ashworth have been involved since joining from Southampton and Newcastle respectively.",
      "\"Dan and Jason have vast experience in the game and their relationship with Nick [Cox] and myself, along with the support from a wider perspective into recruitment from INEOS, only gives the academy more avenues to develop players and have greater depth of experience.",
      "\"I think the appointments, the resource and the experience they have, can only make the decision-making process around our players stronger. I've had meetings with both since they joined and they have been very involved in terms of supporting Nick and supporting myself.",
      "\"Whether that be from a recruitment, playing style or from a squad planning and loans perspective, they [Wilcox and Ashworth] are across all of that, so before it was [Darren] Fletch, Nick and myself. You've still got the same people involved, but there's now an extra layer from executive level, but we have football people, who have youth football experience, in those roles.",
      "\"Any level of expertise can only help us be even more aligned from academy to first-team. It will help us recruit the right players, the environment is important and the profile of our recruitment is important. If you get those right, with the right training programme, then you’ve got utopia.\"",
      "Binnion had a strong working relationship with Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag's former assistant manager. He departed this summer, but Darren Fletcher has been appointed as a first-team coach and the former United player is now the main conduit between the academy and first-team.",
      "\"Fletch has become even more integral in the first-team coaching set-up, so for me now, he was really important in terms of day-to-day involvement, loans and player minutes,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"I got close to Mitchell about what he saw each day, but with Fletch increasing his amount of coaching, I’ve kind of got one person to deal with now for almost everything, so Mitchell has gone and that’s happened, but Fletch is doing more and that’s only a good thing for our younger players.\"",
      "The transfer window shuts in 10 days and a few academy players could leave on loan before the deadline. \"There could and should be two or three exits on loan,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"I won’t say who because those players are because they could be disappointed if they stay in the building, but as I’ve stressed previously, the loans have to be right for them.",
      "\"We’ve seen previous loans of just getting the boys out of the building are not good enough. They need to get out there, play, learn and get the opportunity to develop.",
      "\"If we don’t get those opportunities, it can be a stagnant part of a player’s career, or if you get two poor loans in a row, it can be really quite detrimental to a player’s progress.\"",
      "Tickets for Tuesday's match at Barnsley are available here, while supporters in the UK will also be able to watch the fixture live on Sky Sports+.",

The former Watford and Sheffield United man has been credited with making massive improvements in the academy, and that is now filtering into the first team.",

      "Ten Hag has shown with Mainoo that he is not afraid of putting young players in if they impress. That’s a good sign for both Collyer and Amass ahead of the new season, but their development is good news for United, even if they don’t break into the first team.",
      "Their performances mean that clubs will be willing to pay good money if they are sold now or in the future. The fact that they are both academy graduates means that any fee made will go down as pure profit on the club’s accounts.",

      "England midfielder Grace Clinton says her aim is to win trophies with Manchester United after being voted PFA Young Player of the Year.",
      "The 21-year-old joined the Reds from Everton in 2022 though she is yet to make a competitive appearance for the club, having since enjoyed loan spells at both Bristol City and Tottenham Hotspur. Clinton excelled for the latter last term, scoring four goals and assisting four others in 20 Women's Super League (WSL) appearances and playing an integral role in Spurs’ charge to their first ever Women’s FA Cup final, though she was ineligible to play against her parent club and eventual victors United at Wembley.",
      "Her impressive form saw her receive her first senior England call up earlier this year. She made her first full start against Austria after two appearances off the bench, and duly made an impact with her first international goal in a 7-2 win for the Lionesses.",
      "Clinton impressed so much at Tottenham that the club were keen to make her stay in the capital permanent. “She cannot stay because she’s not a part of us next year,\" manager Robert Vilahamn told The Athletic in April. \"But if you ask me if I want to buy her, there would be a high potential I want to do that.\"",
      "However United boss Skinner has always been unequivocal in his stance on the 21-year-old, insisting that her long-term future lies in Manchester. \"All I hear is Tottenham want to keep Grace, of course they want to keep Grace,\" he said when quizzed on the club's plans for Clinton back in May. \"She's a fantastic player.",
      "\"We don't get the credit that we identified her qualities at Everton, we brought her to Manchester United, gave her six months, sent her on loan at Bristol – she got experience. She then went on loan to Tottenham to get more experience. I don't think people recognise that – there is a plan for each individual we bring into the club.",
      "\"With Grace, it's absolutely worked. I want to bring her back to the club and be part of what we're doing because I think she has a huge say in how we'll play.\"",
      "And Clinton has now voiced her commitment to the Reds, insisting her ambition is to add more silverware to the club's collection. \"To go to Tottenham and get confidence was just amazing,\" she said at the start-studded awards ceremony on Tuesday night. \"And to improve obviously personally. The aim is always to win trophies with Manchester United.\"",
      "On her award, Clinton added: “It’s such an honour to be voted by the unbelievable players that play in this league. It’s the best league in the world. “To go out on loan, learning as a young player and being recognized is lovely. I’ve played with confidence and when you play with that then you see the best version of a player. Tottenham have been a massive part of my journey, and I can’t thank them enough. Goals and visualisation are important to me but most of all just enjoying playing. If I’m enjoying myself then I play my best football.”",
      "Clinton also featured in the PFA Women's Team of the Year, alongside Manchester City stars Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw, Yui Hasegawa, Lauren Hemp, Khiara Keating, Alex Greenwood, Laia Aleixandri. She beat out a host of talented players to earn the award with Lauren James, Aggie Beever-Jones, Khiara Keating, Maya Le Tissier and Jess Park among the names on the Top Six shortlist.",

      "\"For a team that has only been together for six weeks they weathered the storm quite well,\" manager Casey Stoney told BBC Radio 5 Live after the game.",
      "\"I recruited from the second tier, they've stepped up and shown they are more than capable of playing a level above that. There's no pressure from the club to get promotion but these players want to be playing in the top flight. They're history makers now.\"",
      "In spite of Stoney's measured assessment of United's ambitions, the Reds did achieve promotion at the first time of asking, subsequently finishing fourth in their first season in the Women's Super League (WSL). And now, just six years on from that League Cup victory over Liverpool, United are a card-carrying member of the top flight's elite.",
      "Stoney's departure in the summer of 2021 was a blow but her replacement, former Birmingham City boss Marc Skinner, has presided over the most successful period in the club's history. In 2022/23, the Reds took the title race to the final day, posting a club-record points tally in the process while also reaching the FA Cup final.",
      "Last term, despite a disappointing fifth-place finish in the WSL, United beat Tottenham Hotspur to the FA Cup trophy; a reality which would have seemed inconceivable on that momentous afternoon at Prenton Park more than half a decade ago.",
      "While the Reds have come a tremendously long way since then, it is fair to say this summer has not been without its challenges. First came the revelataion that Skinner had been handed a one-year contract extension - a decision which was not universally popular with the United fanbase.",
      "Then came the exodus of some of the club's biggest stars. England goalkeeper Mary Earps left to join Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), citing United's transitional state and her own ambition to compete for more silverware as her chief motivating factors. Club captain Katie Zelem also departed on a free transfer, as did fan-favourite striker Lucia Garcia.",
      "All of this unfolded has against the backdrop of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's barely concealed apathy towards Skinner's side. The INEOS chief gave a tone-deaf interview to Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "This was swiftly followed by United Women being ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp, though it is understood Skinner and his players will still have access to all the necessary facilities.",
      "Still, the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United have been concerning.",
      "That said, the Reds have recruited shrewdly in the transfer market, with the acquisition of Brighton & Hove Albion striker Elisabeth Terland and Swedish defender Anna Sandberg, in particular, inspiring excitement, while the appointment of Dan Ashworth as sporting director inspires hope of tangible change at the club.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said in an open letter to supporters last month.",
      "\"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",
      "“Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",
      "Indeed, six years on from that win over Liverpool, United now have all the ingredients in place to be truly successful. The Reds may already have made history in the years since their reformation but, with the WSL set to be more competitive than ever next term, it is clear the hard work is only just beginning.",

      "Dan Ashworth has met with Manchester United Women's players after a turbulent summer for Marc Skinner's side.",
      "United have come in for criticism of late number after a number of high-profile players, including England goalkeeper Mary Earps and captain Katie Zelem, were allowed to leave the club on free transfers, while co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy when he admitted plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "Fan frustration was further compounded when it emerged Skinner's side were set to be moved out of their state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate the men's team while a £50m refurbishment of their Carrington facilities was underway.",
      "However, Ashworth's long-awaited arrival from Newcastle United last month has offered some cause for optimism, with the sporting director having previously been a huge advocate for the growth of the women's game during his time with the Magpies and in his previous role at Brighton & Hove Albion. And the 53-year-old has now met with Skinner and his players as they ramp up their pre-season preparations at St George's Park.",
      "Pictures shared on the club's website show Ashworth giving a speech to the women's first-team squad and shaking hands with stars such as Ella Toone and Millie Turner. This comes after he outlined his vision for the Reds in an open letter to supporters.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said last month. \"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United.",

      "The 20-year-old midfielder joins the Reds from the United States collegiate system, where she represented the University of Southern California’s USC Trojans. Awujo made her senior international debut for Canada at 18-years-old and has 19 caps for her country to date, reaching the quarter-finals of this summer’s Paris 2024 Olympic games.",
      "Reflecting on her move to Manchester, Awujo said: “To say that I’m a professional footballer for Manchester United is insane. I’m so excited for the season ahead, what the future holds here and just to be a red devil. I cannot wait to play in front of the great Manchester United fans.”",
      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “Simi is an exciting young talent who we are delighted has chosen to continue her football journey with us here at Manchester United. Our wonderful fans can expect a midfielder with international pedigree, who will only develop further in our competitive English game.”",
      "Awujo is United's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Melvine Malard, Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandber. The Reds finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL) last term and won the Women's FA Cup. They will get their new campaign underway against West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday, September 22.",

      "England goalkeeper Mary Earps says she is hoping to add \"a few more trophies to the cabinet\" after leaving Manchester United to join Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).",
      "Earps joined the Reds in 2019 and helped the club win the FA Cup last year. However, the shot-stopper opted to embark on a new chapter when her contract expired in June after a disappointing Women's Super League (WSL) campaign saw United finished fifth last term - 21 points worse off than in the previous campaign.",
      "Despite being linked with a move to Arsenal, Earps chose to join PSG, who have qualified for the Women's Champions League for six consecutive seasons. Speaking on the latest episode of the BBC's Tooney & Russo Show, Earps said she has established some \"great relationships\" in Manchester, but her decision to leave was fueled by \"the opportunity to play for a great team in top competitions\" and be \"in a position to win silverware\".",
      "\"It's like an itch you can never scratch enough,” Earps said. And the 31-year-old's former United teammate Ella Toone, who also plays alongside Earps for the Lionesses, was full of praise for the goalkeeper.",
      "\"She deserves everything,\" said Toone. \"Mary's dream - and it always has been - is to play at the highest level, play in the Champions League and that's what she's done.\"",
      "Earps is not the only player to have left United this summer, with captain Katie Zelem and forward Lucia Garcia also having departed. Reflecting last month on her decision to move overseas, Earps wrote on Instagram: \"The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don’t feel it aligns with the timing of where I’m at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.\"",
