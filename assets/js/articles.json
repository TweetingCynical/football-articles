      "Rasmus Hojlund has claimed that he arrives at Napoli as \"a better football player\" following his two years at Manchester United - where he largely underwhelmed before securing his loan switch.",
      "The Dane moved to Old Trafford two years ago in a deal worth £72million, but struggled for much of his time in the Premier League, which prompted the Red Devils to go back into the market this summer to address their goalscoring issues.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came in and relegated Hojlund to a squad role with the ex-Atalanta man failing to appear in the early games of the season, making his exit almost inevitable. It was in Italy that he first made his name and now he'll hope to aid Napoli's ambitions.",
      "He joins the Serie A champions, who have also added Kevin De Bruyne from Manchester City, and is relishing the chance to play in a successful team having been at United during a difficult period. Despite his struggles, which saw him score just for league goals last term, Hojlund is confident he heads to Naples as an improved player.",
      "The 22-year-old told Napoli's club media: “I was very excited, because it’s a team that just won the league. I also know how great the fans are, the city, and I’m very happy for this opportunity. It’s different now, obviously, as I come with more experience and I’m a better football player. I come with a lot of international experience.",
      "“I played in the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, and in multiple countries. I come with a lot to prove, I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good.”",
      "Hojlund's deadline day move to Napoli will see the Manchester outfit will receive a £5.2m loan fee and £38m next summer with the Italians having an obligation to buy, provided that Antonio Conte's side qualify for the Champions League, which they are expected to do.",
      "Hojlund has gone straight into Napoli's Champions League squad with Romelu Lukaku left out. The Belgian is current injured and not expected back until the end of the 2025 - leading Conte to avoid taking risks over his fitness. The Italians will take on Manchester City and Chelsea during their European campaign.",
      "Their new signing has already pledged to go above and beyond to prove himself as he said: “I always work hard, I like to say I want to die on the pitch, to give everything for the team, to score goals, create, and fight for everything.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's new goalkeeper Senne Lammens has vowed to be “a rock” at the back for Ruben Amorim's side. United signed Belgium Under-21 keeper Lammens for an initial £18.2million on deadline day following early-season blunders from Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana.",
      "Lammens is viewed by United as their long-term future No.1 between the posts and the 23-year-old said he can bring calm and stability to Amorm's unreliable and leaky defence.",
      "“I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence,” said Lammens. “They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. Of course, I can improve in this because the next level is bigger, but it is one of my attributes that I am proud of and I try to improve.",
      "“My parents are also really calm and collected, but [I also developed this mentality] from growing up, when I was in the youth team and I thought about the goalkeeper I wanted to become later in life.",
      "“I think one of the best attributes you can have as a goalkeeper is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake or something. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.”",
      "Lammens also opened up on the process he goes through before and after every game, and the methods he employs to stay cool under pressure. ”Before and after the game, I just write key words down and my thoughts a little bit,” said United's newest recruit.",
      "“Sometimes, if you don't do that, it can be a lot going through your mind. It helps me with staying calm and staying in the moment a little bit, and not overreacting in situations.",
      "\"I write key words, trigger points. Maybe you're playing a team who put a lot of pressure on and then you know you don't have to think a lot during the games, so mentally you're already ready, already prepared for the game and what it's going to be like. So, when the game comes, you're not going to be so surprised by it. I think that's important.”",
      "The arrival of Lammens has cast doubt on the futures of Bayindir and Onana, with one of them set to leave for a club in Turkey or Saudi Arabia, to bring balance to Amorim's goalkeeper options.",
      "As well as Lammens, Bayindir and Onana, Amorim also has veteran keeper Tom Heaton as part of his squad, with one needing to depart before the transfer windows close elsewhere.",

    "date": null,
    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "Jeff Stelling claims Manchester United had a \"poor\" transfer window after failing to address major issues. That's despite backing from the board and more than £200million spent on new signings like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"I thought it was absolutely essential and they haven't done so. Yes, they've got Kobbie Mainoo but he hasn't got the sort of legs required to drive that midfield forward.\"",
      "However, Amorim dismissed the idea, saying last month: \"I want Kobbie to stay and he needs to fight for his place. We need Kobbie. That is not going to change. The players not playing with be disappointed but everyone will have opportunities. You have to fight in the week.\"",
      "Mainoo was eventually prevented from departing, yet the Red Devils made minimal efforts to bolster their veteran midfield. Despite prolonged speculation linking them with Carlos Baleba throughout the transfer window, Brighton's eye-watering £100m valuation for the player remained beyond United's reach for now, particularly after Amorim had allocated a substantial chunk of the club's budget towards revamping the attack.",
      "Nevertheless, Stelling also questioned the club's decision to pursue 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens, who arrived at United in an £18.2m switch from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. While the Red Devils had been connected with Aston Villa's unsettled Emiliano Martinez, they eventually settled on Lammens, who is nine years younger than the Argentine and represents a considerably more economical choice on paper.",
      "Although he offers the advantage of youth to Amorim's roster, he lacks the crucial Premier League know-how that 32-year-old Martinez possesses, considering his stellar performances for Villa across the last five years. And it's precisely this experience that Stelling reckons could have proved invaluable moving forward.",
      "He added: \"And, they've gone for the cheap goalkeeper option. Lammens might turn out to be a fantastic goalkeeper but it's a humungous step for him to go from playing for Royal Antwerp in front of 12,00 people in the Belgian league to huge crowds at Old Trafford. For me, Emi Martinez was the obvious choice for Manchester United.\"",
      "While Amorim claimed he was satisfied with his goalkeeping options earlier in the transfer window, the Portuguese boss appears to have since identified weaknesses in both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana's performances. Bayindir has started all three of United's Premier League matches this campaign, and faced criticism following the Red Devils' disappointing 1-0 opening day defeat to Arsenal.",
      "The 27-year-old made a hash of clearing a corner kick, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to ghost in at the far post and net the winning goal. Meanwhile, Onana was given the nod during United's Carabao Cup encounter with Grimsby Town last month, where he too was slated for mistakes that helped the League Two outfit establish a commanding 2-0 advantage before the interval.",
      "Although strikes from Mbeumo and Harry Maguire levelled proceedings, they were eventually knocked out following a nail-biting penalty shoot-out. United have endured a patchy start to the league campaign with one victory, one defeat and one stalemate from their first three outings, and Amorim will surely be demanding a more spirited display when they return to action after the international break for the Manchester derby come Sunday, September 14.",

      "Michael Owen has opened up on struggling to deal mentally with his decline during the latter stages of his career at Manchester United. The former England striker admits he felt \"embarrassed\" by how dramatically his level fell during the second half of his playing days, admitting it was \"killing him inside”.",
      "Owen burst onto the Premier League scene as a 17-year-old at Liverpool, quickly establishing himself with his lightning pace in behind defences and clinical finishing ability. He claimed the league's golden boot award in his first two full seasons before making his mark on the international stage with a stunning strike against Argentina aged 18 at the World Cup 1998.",
      "After playing a pivotal role in Liverpool's Treble success with the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and League Cup in 2001 - which earned him the Ballon d'Or - he secured a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2004.",
      "Owen spent just one campaign in La Liga before his £16.8million switch to Newcastle, where persistent muscle injuries meant he was sidelined for lengthy periods across the following four seasons on Tyneside. His fitness woes continued at Manchester United and later Stoke City, with the striker eventually opting to retire in 2013.",
      "The 45-year-old recently appeared on the Rio Presents podcast, where former Red Devils team-mate Rio Ferdinand asked him about the drop off from going from an elite environment to one that isn’t. Owen instead reflected on his own career, explaining he views it in two distinct halves: pre and post injury troubles.",
      "The pundit said: “Well, I've said before, I mean, I sort of split my career into two. Almost Liverpool and maybe Madrid. And then afterwards, because I just wasn't the same. Not that I didn't like it. I loved it at United. I love you and the lads and whatever.",
      "“But I'm not me. I'm not me. You know what I was when I was 18. And you know what I was when I was 30. It's like, I was half embarrassed. I'm coming out, they've been to these big stadiums, St James' Park, Old Trafford, with my name on my back.",
      "“It's like, can I not just change my name and just think of something, like call me something else? I don't want people to remember me like this. Still good, still scoring. But I'm not what I was. It's killing me. But it's like, what can you do?”",
      "Owen's time at Liverpool saw him score more than 20 goals in all competitions in each season but two. Following his 16-goal haul in 45 appearances for Real Madrid, his numbers plummeted dramatically as injuries mounted and his electric pace diminished.",
      "Speaking about his spells at Newcastle, United and Stoke, he candidly said: “I had it for eight years, when I'm thinking, ‘I don't like this.’ I was looking at the clock half of my career, thinking only 20 minutes. And I could still score. I could still play well.",
      "“I couldn't rip a team's heart out anymore. I could just finish if I get the opportunity. I'm relying on everyone else now. Whereas I used to be able to, I didn't need anyone else. Just give me the ball and I'll do it. And that change of mentality.",
      "“I didn't retire because of my body. I still played in a game the other day. I retired because my mind was about to explode. And I couldn't have it anymore that I was just a Premier League player.”",
      "Though his displays failed to meet his own lofty standards, Owen's time at Manchester United delivered an elusive Premier League trophy in 2010/11, along with another League Cup victory. He ended his career with an impressive record of 222 goals across 482 matches, alongside 40 goals in 89 England appearances.",

      "Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott thinks Ruben Amorim will have left Manchester United by Christmas. The Red Devils started the new season in promising fashion, albeit with a 1-0 loss against Arsenal.",
      "Though this defeat was valiant, and buoyed by recruits Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, the horizon looked bright. A 1-1 draw against Fulham soon darkened such hopes, and a Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two Grimsby Town was a new low.",
      "A last-gasp 3-2 victory against Burnley followed, but the win was not convincing, and an injury to new man Cunha acted as yet another stain on a campaign still in its infancy. Being knocked out of the League Cup on penalties to a relative minnow brought with it calls for the manager to be sacked. While such suggestions have quieted, Lescott still thinks that by the new year, United will have a new manager.",
      "After the international break, a daunting trip to the Etihad and rivals City beckons for Amorim. Pep Guardiola's side have not started the season well either, and Lescott insists both managers are under duress.",
      "\"The pressure is on for both managers [Amorim and Guardiola],\" stated Lescott on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"Different types of pressure, though.",
      "\"Pep's job isn't under threat, but Amorim's is, yeah,\" continued Lescott before predicting that Amorim will be 'gone by Christmas'. He added: \"I'd be very surprised if he (Amorim) is still there by Christmas. If he is there in January 2026, they're just being stubborn. He looks lost.\"",

      "Lescott, who played at the Etihad from 2009 to 2014 and made 160 appearances, further feels like Amorim's Manchester counterpart, Guardiola, has had his City exit signalled via new recruits.",
      "Asked if City are preparing for life without Guardiola, Lescott responded: \"Yeah, maybe. You're going to have to. The standards may be different this season because it's a new era, you know.",
      "\"When you've got experienced players who have been there for a longer period, they are the ones who get you through tough times. Whereas now, there's [Tijjani] Reijnders, [Rayan] Cherki. They're all experiencing negativity together for the first time. So who is going to get them out of it?",
      "\"I think, like prior to Pep, a lot of this summer's signings are post-Pep. Just like when they signed Kevin [De Bruyne], Delphy [Fabian Delph], Raheem [Sterling], they all signed before Pep arrived, but they were for Pep.\"",
      "Guardiola extended his stay in Manchester late last year by penning a deal that expires in 2027, and he told ESPN: \"After my contract with City, I'm going to stop. I'm sure. I don't know if I'm going to retire, but I'm going to take a break. How I want to be remembered, I don't know.",
      "\"All coaches want to win so we can have a memorable job, but I believe that the fans of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City had fun watching my teams play. I don't think we should ever live thinking about whether we're going to be remembered.\"",

The Portuguese boss has entered his first full season in charge at Old Trafford and was backed to the tune of over £200million this summer.",
      "A promising opening league loss to Arsenal was quickly forgotten after a lacklustre 1-1 draw at Fulham. When Amorim's side met Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, a new low was hit – United crashed out on penalties, and calls for the head coach to be axed bellowed.",
      "These were only slightly quelled by a somewhat fortunate 3-2 victory against Burnley last time out.",

      "\"Do I think there were players at United who didn't like him? To be honest, that's probably a ridiculous question because I'd say there are people in the United team now who don't like the manager,\" began Jones, speaking to Ladbrokes at the launch of Ladisfaction.",
      "\"But there are probably players at Man City who feel the same way about [Pep] Guardiola; they can't stand him. There's people like that in every team.",
      "\"These are big groups of players and different personalities, and all of them are competitive, and think they should be playing more than they are.",
      "\"That will never, ever change. Even when a manager is flying, there will always be someone going, 'Well, he's not playing me, so he's not good.' Trust me, I've been there myself. I've been a young kid moaning about training being rubbish. But in reality, it's not rubbish; you're just hurt and you don't know how to deal with it.",

      "Bruno Fernandes claimed that Alejandro Garnacho didn't \"have the best attitude\" when he broke through the Manchester United youth academy. The 21-year-old has now parted ways with the club altogether after finally securing his move to Chelsea.",
      "The Argentine winger signed his first professional contract with the Red Devils back in 2022 after making the move from Atletico Madrid two years prior. However, United club captain Fernandes claimed Garnacho didn't have the best attitude when he made the step up to the first team under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Speaking in November 2022, after Garnacho scored the winning goal in a Europa League group stage game against Real Sociedad, Fernandes told BT Sport: \"He was good but he knows we expect a lot from him. He’s still really young, doing really well.",
      "“At the beginning of the season, he was not at his best. On the [pre-season] tour he did not have the best attitude. That’s why he didn’t get his chance until now. He’s getting his chances because he’s training better, he’s having the correct attitude.\"",
      "Garnacho received a wealth of opportunity in his first season for the Red Devils, racking up three goals and two assists in the Premier League from 19 appearances. And while the youngster also initially looked to be a part of Ruben Amorim's plans when the Portuguese tactician arrived as Ten Hag's successor, things changed heading into the summer.",
      "Amorim's decision to deem Garnacho surplus to requirements at Old Trafford came after the winger publicly questioned the decision to bench him for the Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Garnacho only came on in the second half of the 1-0 loss in Bilbao. After the match, he told the media: \"Until we reached the final, I played every round.",
      "\"And I played 20 minutes today – I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "He also criticised the club's Premier League campaign as they finished in 15th place, claiming: \"Obviously it’s hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more.\"",
      "As per The Athletic, Amorim is said to have told Garnacho: \"You better hope you have a good agent this summer,\" during a training ground discussion ahead of United's final game of the season against Aston Villa, before the player made it clear that Chelsea was his destination of choice.",
      "While the Blues were in no great rush to submit a formal offer for Garnacho, they eventually snagged their man in the latter stages of the summer transfer window, coughing up £40million to take him off United's hands on a long-term contract until 2032.",
      "Taking to Instagram in the wake of his departure, Garnacho was quick to thank the Red Devils and their supporters for his time in the north west.",
      "He wrote: \"Dear Mánchester. After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close. We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I’m very grateful for this. To the coaches, staff, and my teammates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had.",
      "\"I leave proud of what we achieved together and excited for what’s to come. Wishing the club nothing but success for the future, while I look forward to giving my all in the next chapter of my career.\"",
      "A number of Garnacho's United team-mates were quick to reply to the post, with Kobbie Mainoo writing: \"All the best bro,\" while former Red Devils defender Sam Murray, added: \"All the best hermano,\" and the likes of Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Rasmus Hojlund and Fernandes liked the post.",

      "Manchester United's reason for not signing Gianluigi Donnarumma has emerged following his move to the other side of town. Donnarumma, 26, joined Manchester City on transfer deadline day, costing just £26million from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "PSG made the Italian goalkeeper surplus to requirements after he entered the final 12 months of his contract. There'd been attempts to extend his stay in the French capital but after negotiations turned sour, Luis Enrique shelled out £34m on a replacement - Lucas Chevalier from Lille - signalling the end of Donnarumma's time between the posts at the Parc des Princes.",
      "Reports that United were interested in Donnarumma surfaced after the Club World Cup, where PSG lost the final 3-0 to Chelsea. But it soon became apparent that the Red Devils wouldn't be making an offer for the 26-year-old.",
      "United ultimately opted to sign Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens for an initial £18.2m. The Red Devils also held talks with Aston Villa shot-stopper Emiliano Martinez.",
      "That gave City a free run at Donnrumma, who they signed for what pundits have hailed as a bargain £26m fee. But it wasn't what PSG demanded for the Italy international which put United off.",
      "Despite costing just £8m less, Lammens' modest salary represents a much cheaper package and someone who can be sold for a greater percentage of profit. The two goalkeepers could make their debuts against one another after the international break, as City welcome United to the Etihad.",
      "\"To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me,\" Donnarumma said. \"I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola.",
      "\"This is a club every player in world football would love to join. I have admired watching Manchester City for many years - so to now be able to play for the club is a huge honour and a privilege.",
      "\"I cannot wait to meet my new team-mates, the staff and the fans. Playing at the Etihad Stadium will be very, very special for me. I am very excited for what lies ahead and can promise that I will give absolutely everything to try and help the club achieve even more success.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been tipped to struggle at Manchester United with Louis Saha calling out his former club for not getting a creative midfielder through the door. Ruben Amorim spent more than £200million on reinforcing his frontline with Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha all arriving.",
      "Sesko himself cost £74m, arrives with a huge reputation and has been tasked with leading the line at Old Trafford. The young Slovenian has been named on the bench for the three Premier League games so far, failing to score in any of his cameos, and Saha is fearful that he may struggle if he does not have the creativity behind him.",
      "United under Amorim play without a playmaker, instead having two central midfielders and two forwards to aid the No 9. Saha insists it is vital that Mbeumo and Cunha hit the ground running with Sesko needing that supply.",
      "“I think he’s capable if the manager managed to get that link between midfield and striker,\" said Saha. \"Unfortunately we didn’t get the midfielder we wanted. So we’re still very weak in that department. And this is why I think Sesko will struggle maybe a little bit until we get that sorted.",
      "“He’s got the quality because he’s tall, he’s going to score goals in the air, and he’s very technical as well. All his movement is right up there, so I’m very confident he’s going to get chances and he’s going to score.",
      "\"But to get us where we want, I don’t think that’s going to be on him. Those two playmakers, (Matheus) Cunha and (Bryan) Mbeumo, will have to kick on very soon, (otherwise) you will see Sesko struggling as well.”",
      "United had struggled in attack in their opening games. In their first two outings they only scored courtesy of an own goal before they hit three past Burnley with Mbeumo getting his first goal in his new colours.",
      "Saha has maintained that United have continued their worrying trend of relying on young, inexperienced strikers to lead their line. The struggles experience by Rasmus Hojlund are well documented. The Dane couldn't deliver on his price tag and has been loaned out after two years.",
      "The Frenchman now fears that the club have simply repeated the trick by signing Sesko who, despite being tipped for big things, is still only 22.",
      "He added, speaking to the Athletic:: “The problems identified over the last three or four years (at United) is having the responsibility as a number nine or as a forward when you’re young. You’re still learning, you’re making mistakes. You don’t how to connect with the players as much as maybe Bruno Fernandes, as much as (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic before, or players like Andy Cole.",
      "“There (was a) combination at Man United to have a young player with a lot of talents, who’s going to disrupt, who’s going to actually bring in unpredictability, but at the same time, you have experience where it’s very valuable and you’re going to actually pass on the information.",
      "\"This is not the case in the last three or four years. So it’s been a really big mistake and I think they’ve done it again.”",

Cunha has been one of the more impressive performers for the Red Devils, despite their indifferent start to the season.",
      "The Brazilian signed from Wolves in the summer but has quickly settled in as he looks for his first United goal. However a hamstring injury saw him hobble off during the first-half at the weekend. Cunha was able to walk out of Old Trafford freely on Saturday night, giving those connected with the club hope that his injury was not as bad as was feared - and now the Brazilian has taken to social media to claim his absence will not be a long-term one.",
      "Having pulled out of the Brazil squad, he said: \"What an incredible environment, it’s great to be here. I’ll be back soon, always with joy and gratitude. Thanks for all the messages.\"",
      "Amorim was evidently concerned at the weekend with Mason Mount also a fitness concern. He said: \"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury. I don't know [if they are long-term injuries], I don't know but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",

      "It is nothing new to suggest that players who've headed to Manchester United for the past decade have generally looked less than the sum of their parts. It seems as if playing at Old Trafford sees individuals drop a level.",
      "A number of players have tried and failed to buck the trend, including some of the most expensive buys in the club's history. Manuel Ugarte is the fifth most expensive midfielder to sign for United and he arrived 12 months after being the subject of a transfer battle between Chelsea and PSG.",
      "The Uruguayan had impressed at Sporting Lisbon, playing under none other than Ruben Amorim. Several players have earned big moves after excelling with the Portuguese outfit.",
      "He failed to settle in Paris and he was signed by Erik ten Hag last summer, but a poor start for the Dutchman saw him sacked and so Ugarte was back working under Amorim. The man who had made him a player that some of Europe's elite were chasing.",
      "The new manager was confident their reunion would see Ugarte improve further. He said: \"All the Uruguayans I managed are incredible and that’s why I love them. Ugarte is a very talented boy and has a lot of room to grow. I am very happy to know that I have him back at Man United.\"",
      "Plenty in Manchester will have thought they had the ideal recipe to buck the trend of expensive arrivals falling well short of expectation. The current squad is full of players yet to deliver on their price tag and Gary Neville previously claimed that Old Trafford had become a \"graveyard\" for elite names.",
      "He said: \"I genuinely believe it's been a graveyard for every player that's joined that club in the last 10 years apart from Bruno. There's not one player joined that club that's improved apart from him. The rest of them, whether you go back to [Angel] Di Maria and [Bastian] Schweinsteiger, every player that's signed has gone backwards.\"",
      "But by Ugarte's own admission he is still not living up to standards with the hard-hitting defensive midfielder not delivering in an underperforming United side. He told El Observador: \"We haven't started the season very well. My level wasn't the best either, we have to be realistic and honest.\"",
      "Ugarte has found himself stuck on the bench throughout the year, coming on as a substitute for the first two games before he was left to watch on throughout the win over Burnley.",
      "The 24-year-old maintains that his relationship with Amorim remains a positive once despite him not being able to rediscover the form he showed at Sporting.",
      "He added: \"But I'm very confident, I have a very good relationship with the coach. I work well and I'm very excited and eager to earn a starting spot.”",
      "Ugarte is one of a number of signings made during the Ten Hag tenure who have failed to deliver on their fees, some already being pushed out the door. Antony headed to Real Betis, Rasmus Hojlund has gone out on loan. Now the latest set of recruits, the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, will be determined not to feed Neville's narrative.",

Rio Ferdinand won his sixth and final league title in 2012-13, as part of a strong English core under Sir Alex Ferguson, and believes compatriots Declan Rice and Harry Kane could have set United right in the years since.",
      "Since Ferguson stepped away at the end of that season, United have secured just five top-four finishes. They were distant runners-up behind Manchester City in 2018 and 2021, while last season's 15th-place finish was their worst in half a century.",
      "United have spent big in the last 12 years, breaking their transfer record in 2014 with a move for Angel Di Maria and again in 2016 when Paul Pogba rejoined the club from Juventus. Three of their 10 most expensive signings arrived in the window just gone, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko joining for a combined £200million.",

Both have been linked with Old Trafford switches in the past, only for Rice to join Arsenal when he left West Ham in 2023 and Kane to trade Tottenham for Bayern Munich a few weeks later.",

      "“When you have a club captain with an attitude like Fernandes, especially considering the previous leaders at the club that have been and gone, it’s slanderous to such a great football club. He’s very impetuous and childish. I can’t believe he’s never been sent off. If I was a referee, I’d book him every time he moaned or whinged.",

      "“They can’t get any worse than last season and after securing some good transfers like Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, they look a lot more balanced going forward, but there’s still a lot of question marks in the team.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones believes teenage starlet Chido Obi should be ready to play a part for the first team this season. The arrival of £74m striker Benjamin Sesko may limit the youngster's opportunities, especially with United failing to qualify for Europe and suffering an early elimination from the Carabao Cup, but Jones still sees him getting chances.",
      "Obi joined United from Arsenal's academy last season and made his debut against Tottenham in February. He played eight times under Ruben Amorim, becoming United's youngest ever Premier League starter when he was named in Amorim's XI to face Brentford in May.",
      "Jones, however, feels the Danish Under-21 international is more than ready for senior football after rising through the ranks. \"When he was playing 18s football, it was men against boys. He was bullying people, it was so easy for him,\" Jones told Metro courtesy of FreeBets.com.",
      "\"I think he needs to understand where he is at in his head and figure out what his realistic expectations are. Is he going to play every game? No. Is he going be on the bench every game? No.",
      "\"But what he needs to do is make sure that when he is called upon, and there will be times he is called upon and he will get chances, that he is ready and happy. He has to be professional and be ready because if he is they will have one hell of a player.\"",
      "Obi has returned to United's Under-21 squad for the early part of the season, with Sesko and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha getting minutes in the No.9 role. The teenager has played three times in Premier League two, starting twice, and scored his second goal of the season to help defeat Manchester City last time out.",
      "United have allowed other strikers to leave on loan, with Rasmus Hojlund joining Napoli in a deal which could become permanent next summer and Ethan Wheatley getting minutes in League One with Northampton Town. Obi, however, has remained at Old Trafford.",
      "Jones' comments come after Denmark Under-21 boss Lars Knudsen made it known that he feels Obi needs regular football. \"I can't stand here and say anything about that, because it's somewhere else than with me,\" Knudsen said, as reported by Bold.",
      "\"It's just a hope we have for the national teams, because we know that playing time is crucial. This is both for performance, but also for these young people in terms of developing themselves. Of course, we hope that he will get somewhere where he can play.\"",
      "Obi wasn't part of Denmark's squad for the Under-21 Euros, where Newcastle forward Will Osula led the line. He is part of Knudsen's first squad for the upcoming break, though, along with United striker Hojlund's younger brother Oscar.",

    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "For Manchester United, the summer transfer window was as much about clearing the decks as strengthening Ruben Amorim’s squad.",
      "After the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, United’s focus shifted to offloading Amorim’s ‘bomb squad’, those players he had exiled and whose futures lay away from Old Trafford . Namely, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "While United have made significant financial savings by jettisoning four of those five - Malacia still remains - in terms of wages and also recouped money in transfer and loan fees, they have taken a major hit on Antony, who cost £86milion but who joined Real Betis for just £21.5m.",
      "First out of the door was Rashford, who fell out of favour with Amorim a month into the Portuguese head coach’s arrival and who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "The England striker, included in Thomas Tuchel’s latest squad, has gone on a season-long loan to Barcelona, who are covering all of Rashford’s £325,000-a-week wages, an impressive piece of negotiation from United to ensure full coverage of his exorbitant salary.",
      "Under the terms of the deal, Barca have the option of signing 27-year-old Rashford on a permanent basis for £30m at the end of the loan agreement, a fee which would represent pure profit on the balance sheet in complying with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) because of his status as an academy graduate.",
      "The same is also true of Garnacho, who also fell foul of Amorim, after publicly criticising the United manager for dropping him for the 1-0 Europa Leage final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "From that moment on, Garnacho had no future at United, and was left off United’s pre-season tour of the USA, along with the other members of the bomb squad, and told to find a new club.",
      "While there was interest from a host of European clubs, including Napoli and Villa, Garnacho set his heart on a move to Chelsea, with United eventually agreeing a £40m permanent deal for the Argentina star, negotiating Chelsea up from their initial offer of £25m and again securing pure profit against the balance sheet because of his academy product status.",
      "Garnacho, who cost a nominal fee when he arrived from Atletico Madrid, became United’s biggest academy sale, his acrimonious departure ending his short-lived spell at Old Trafford and what at one stage promised to be a long and illustrious career at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "Antony, arguably the most costly flop in United’s history, represented the biggest hit they took in the window, although the only grace was accepting a lower fee to ensure they did not have to pay the Brazilian winger a severance payment as part of his early departure.",
      "Sancho’s deadline day season-long loan move to Villa represented another nomadic chapter in the outcast’s wretched United career. Villa agreed to cover 80 per cent or Sancho’s £300,000-a-week wages and, with the completion of certain performance related clauses, United expect full coverage of his salary.",
      "That leaves full-back Malacia as the only member of the bomb squad to remain at United, although he can still secure a move - loan or permanent - to a league where the window remains open.",
      "United achieved most of their objectives with regard to the bomb squad, in terms of players sold and loaned out, as well as wage recovery. While Rashford and Garnacho came through the club's academy, Antony, Sancho and Malacia were signed for a combined £173m before wages are taken into account.",
      "Club sources say they maintained financial discipline in terms of the fees paid, and with regard to PSR compliance. Offloading the bomb squad continued United’s squad evolution, which was always going to take more than one window.",
      "With fewer fixtures in the absence of European football this season, Amorim always had to work with a smaller squad. Now he has the players in that he wanted and has got rid of those who were not part of his plans, there can be no excuses",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "He bid an emotional farewell to Villa Park at the back-end of last season and then featured heavily on United’s shortlist as they searched for a new goalkeeper. And while he remained an option late into the window, the Red Devils eventually opted for another player.",
      "They completed an £18m deal for Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens on deadline day. With the dust now settled, Martinez has spoken out for the first time.",

And while Martinez will be keen to focus on his national team commitments for now, Argentina legend Sergio Goycochea admits he has concerns for his mentality right now.",
      "“He’s a guy with a lot of personality, and all that stuff he puts to his advantage in a lot of situations that make a difference. We’ll have to see how it plays out for him right now. That’s the only thing that scares me.”",
      "Meanwhile, United legend Rio Ferdinand has suggested that he would have preferred his former club to make a move for Martinez instead of Lammens.",
      "“Speaking on YouTube, he said: “I just think his experience, he's got the personality, the character, plays for Argentina where the pressure is absolutely immense, he's won a World Cup, he was one of the reasons they won the World Cup, the save in the final, a big moments man.",
      "“Man United need as much personality as they need ability coming through that door and I think he fits the bill in that sense completely.”",
      "Once the international break is over, Martinez will hope to return for Villa. Marco Bizot has started in two of the club’s opening three games, with Martinez being between the sticks for the 1-0 defeat to Brentford.",

      "Former Premier League star Connor Wickham bagged a sensational strike from the halfway line as he searches for a new club. The former Sunderland and Crystal Palace forward struck just seven minutes into the clash between a PFA XI and Manchester United's under-21 side.",
      "Wickham, 32, was the star as a squad of 17 players made the trip to Carrington as they bid to maintain fitness and find their next team. Other Premier League figures such as Cyrus Christie, Rolando Aarons and Kazenga Lua Lua have been involved in training, while a game against Brighton's youth team saw ex-Arsenal forward Tyreece John-Jules and former Chelsea youngster Tariq Uwakwe play.",
      "And it will be Wickham's goal that lives long in the memory for anyone watching. The veteran forward claimed a loose ball after United's youngster's lost possession and touched it into the opposition area before letting go with a considered strike.",
      "Goalkeeper William Murdock was left scrambling back to his goalline but was unable to prevent the ball hitting the net. The effort was the standout moment of the match but Red Devils teenager Shea Lacey delivered an impressive, curling strike of his own to ensure the game finished level.",
      "Wickham will certainly have widened his reach with his latest strike however as he eyes a move in the football league. The ex-Ipswich Town and Cardiff ace is looking to return to action having went without a club last season.",
      "Wickham last played for Charlton after impressing during a two-week training period with the club in March 2024. The ex-England youth international scored one goal in four appearances for the Addicks before departing at the end of his short term deal.",
      "Wickham has led a storied career and played for 10 clubs since making his Ipswich debut having just turned 16. Sunderland paid £8million for his services in 2011 in a record fee for the Tractor Boys.",
      "The striker saw a series of loan spells to Sheffield Wednesday as he struggled to make a sustained impact at the Stadium of Light but earned Premier League player of the month honours in April 2014 to help the team avoid relegation. Wickham eventually moved on to Crystal Palace but saw his career grind to a halt after a serious knee injury kept him out of first team action for almost two years.",
      "The striker suffered similar misfortune after moving to Preston following his time at Selhurst Park. Wickham suffered a hamstring injury five minutes into his second appearance for the club and was released months into his deal.",
      "After just days as a free agent, Wickham move to MK Dons on another short term deal but lasted until the end of the season before joining Forest Green Rovers. Despite scoring nine goals in 20 games, Wickham departed at the end of another short-term deal, before short spells with Cardiff and Charlton.",

      "He has suggested that Bayern Munich were interested in taking him to the Allianz Arena but he was only interested in a move back to Spain. Speaking to El Partidazo, Antony said: \"I spoke with Bayern Munich.",
      "“I don't know if it was [a] €7 million [offer], but I said I had Betis's word and that it was 95% certain and that I would respect my word. I feel comfortable making this decision because I'm very happy here. More than five teams called me.\"",
      "Antony will hope that he enjoys even more success with Betis during his second spell with the club. The 25-year-old scored nine goals and notched five assists in just half a season in Andalucia.",
      "Speaking at his unveiling as a permanent Betis player, Antony broke down in tears. He said: \"[Making the transfer happen] was very hard, but we're here now. I can't wait to wear the Betis shirt again. I can only thank everyone who made it possible.”",
      "He added: \"What a difference! Seville is more beautiful than Manchester. I'm finally here. I spent more than 40 days in a hotel; it was very hard, but everyone knew I wanted to return to Betis. Now with more time, there are so many things to do and achieve.",
      "“I had trouble sleeping after seeing so much love from the Betis fans; there were people waiting at my house at 2 in the morning.\"",
      "\"Being cared about is very important to me, it is something money can't buy. Here, I have had good feelings and felt lots of affection. It was always my first choice, and that's why I waited until the last day to return to Betis. Now I'm here and happy in a city and at a club that I love.\"",
      "While Bayern failed in their attempts to sign Antony, they still had an eye-catching window. The German giants completed a move for Liverpool wideman Luis Diaz earlier this summer.",
      "They also signed Nicolas Jackson on loan from Chelsea despite late drama over his future. The striker had flown to Germany to complete his move only for Chelsea to recall him following Liam Delap’s injury. But a deal was eventually agreed upon.",

      "Manchester United sanctioned loan exits for 10 Under-21 players this summer as a clutch of youngsters temporarily moved on in search of senior football.",
      "The loanees cover every level from the Championship to the National League as well as moves to Scotland and Switzerland.",
      "But it's perhaps telling that three prospects who could have departed on loan remain in situ at United.",
      "Gabriele Biancheri was linked with a host of clubs in the closing days of the window but has remained at Old Trafford while Sekou Kone and Shea Lacey are two other talented teenagers remaining in the Under-21 ranks.",
      "The decision to keep the trio in house points to the three being key performers for Travis Binnion's side this season as well as supplementing the senior training group.",
      "All three have been involved with the first team previously and Ruben Amorim could well call upon them again as the campaign continues. United are unlikely to rotate their side too much given the light schedule with no European football and an early Carabao Cup exit, but the likes of Biancheri, Kone and Lacey could be the next cabs off the academy rank if United need to promote from within.",
      "Lacey has showed his capabilities this week with a superb goal for the Under-21s on Wednesday and an assist in the Premier League 2 derby win over Manchester City last weekend. The 18-year-old has had injury problems but is now fit and firing and his talent is clear to see. He will likely emerge as a key player at Under-21 level this term.",
      "The same can be said of Biancheri who was linked with a loan exit to Welsh pair Newport County and Cardiff City during the summer window. The talented forward has trained with the Wales squad and is also eligible for Canada, who have made a play for his services at international level ahead of next summer's World Cup in North America.",
      "For Kone, the prospect has opened up of him having a say in United's midfield of the future.",
      "He started for the Under-21s against Tamworth in the National League Cup last month and sustained a head injury which resulted in the game being abandoned. He has recovered but has a long way to go and has been on a steep learning curve since his arrival in England.",
      "He has been forced to put on muscle, get up to speed with the intensity and improve his positional understanding. He did not play a single minute during the United States tour, but staff believe he could eventually contribute",
      "The Reds have been rapidly improving at academy level and there is plenty of talent ready to take the next step.",

      "Some trading periods are in fact still open with a few United players still having the chance to move to Turkiye and Saudi Arabia. Andre Onana is one of those and a transfer to the former appears a real possibility.",
      "Though United were active on deadline day, they failed to bring in a new central midfielder. Updates on Adam Wharton update and Morten Hjulmand, two players linked, have now emerged. Kobbie Mainoo meanwhile, was denied a temporary exit as he seeks more minutes.",
      "A January departure has not been ruled out however, with an update on his immediate future being provided.",
      "You can also click here to sign up to our FREE dedicated Man Utd WhatsApp service and receive updates straight to your phone.",
      "Jeff Stelling believes that Manchester United have had a \"poor\" transfer window after failing to address two key issues.",
      "The two principal reasons why I think United have had a poor transfer window is that they needed to bring in someone with an engine in that midfield.",
      "I thought it was absolutely essential and they haven’t done so. Yes, they’ve got Kobbie Mainoo but he hasn’t got the sort of legs required to drive that midfield forward.\"",
      "And, they’ve gone for the cheap goalkeeper option. Lammens might turn out to be a fantastic goalkeeper but it's a humungous step for him to go from playing for Royal Antwerp in front of 12,00 people in the Belgian league to huge crowds at Old Trafford.",
      "For me, Emi Martinez was the obvious choice for Manchester United.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has spoken for the first time since departing Manchester United for Napoli.",
      "I was very excited, because it’s a team that just won the league. I also know how great the fans are, the city, and I’m very happy for this opportunity,\" Hojlund told Napoli's club media.",
      "It’s different now, obviously, as I come with more experience and I’m a better football player. I come with a lot of international experience.",
      "I played in the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, and in multiple countries. I come with a lot to prove, I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good.",
      "I always work hard, I like to say I want to die on the pitch, to give everything for the team, to score goals, create, and fight for everything.",
      "I’ve been looking forward to this opportunity, I’m very, very grateful and I’m going to do my best to make us win something this year again, and to do the fans and club proud.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been handed a fresh Manchester United injury worry after losing Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount to issues against Burnley.",
      "Both attackers were forced off in the 3-2 victory, United's first in the Premier League, at Old Trafford and now Portugal have officially confirmed that Diogot Dalot has withdrawn from the national team squad after complaining of muscle discomfort.",
      "He will subsequently miss World Cup qualifiers against Armenia and Hungary, but Ruben Amorim will be hoping he can feature against Manchester City next weekend.",
      "Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, via his YouTube channel, has made some interesting Kobbie Mainoo transfer claims.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo had a complicated six to seven days. He went directly to Ruben Amorim and the club together with his agent to say he’s not happy.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo loves Manchester United, he’s really happy at Manchester United but he’s not happy about the game-time and Man United don’t have European football.",
      "This is why he asked to go out on loan, he never asked to leave on a permanent. It was a priority for Mainoo to go on loan but Man United said no.",
      "Internally, also with Sir Jim Ratcliffe involved, this was the decision made with all of the people involved. We cannot let Kobbie Mainoo go.",
      "I think there will be some interesting months ahead because if Kobbie Mainoo plays, the situation will be okay. But if Kobbie Mainoo stays on the bench, I think in January this could be a topic again. Now, the pitch has the final say on the future of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Manchester United have been linked to a number of midfielders with Adam Wharton as one of those.",
      "According to TeamTalk, United and Chelsea are frontrunners in the race to sign Wharton from Crystal Palace in the January transfer window.",
      "The report claims the two Premier League clubs have shortlisted the 21-year-old midfielder as a 'key target'.",
      "It's said that United and Chelsea view Wharton as a 'potential game-changer'. The former Blackburn Rovers playmaker sees his contract at Selhurst Park expire in June 2029.",
      "Sporting CP star Morten Hjulmand has firmly dismissed Manchester United transfer rumours when speaking to at Denmark's national team training camp, via Ojogo.",
      "They’re talking about rumours, but I don’t identify with them. I identify with the fact that I should start [preseason] at Sporting and get back in shape after the holidays.",
      "We had some very good games, in which we played at a good level, even though we lost at the weekend in a derby against FC Porto. We’re not in first place right now, and we want to get back there.",
      "The international break is often a time for fans to watch their respective clubs transfer targets in action. However, those of a Manchester United persuasion will not see Adam Wharton play any minutes.",
      "That is because he picked up an injury during Crystal Palace's 3-0 win against Aston Villa on Sunday evening. It was later confirmed the following day that he had pulled out of the England squad and was being replaced by Ruben Loftus-Cheek.",
      "An update on his adductor injury has since come to light with Bobby Manzi claiming he will miss the next three weeks. That likely means he will be absent for Premier League games against Sunderland and West Ham United alongside a Carabao Cup round three tie with Milwall.",
      "Andre Onana could yet depart Old Trafford over the next few weeks with interest from Turkiye in what now looks to be Manchester United's third choice goalkeeper.",
      "That is because Senne Lammens has joined the club and as Altay Bayindir had been played in the Premier League games. There is still a chance for Onana to escape United however, with windows in Turkiye and Saudi Arabia still open.",
      "With exactly that in mind, according to Hasan Tuncel, via 61 saat, Trabzonspor have contacted United over a potential loan deal for Onana. He has also been offered to clubs in the Middle East",
      "Hello Manchester United fans and welcome to our live blog right here on MEN Sport for all things United.",
      "The transfer window may have closed and international break arrive as such, but there is still plenty to discuss at Old Trafford. That includes updates on Adam Wharton, Andre Onana, Senne Lammens, Carlos Baleba, Kobbie Mainoo, Morten Hjulmand and much more",

      "On the face of it, Manchester United have had a positive summer transfer window.",

      "Unemployed Premier League boss Gary O'Neil believes his previous connections to the top position at Manchester United were merely speculation. The 42-year-old enjoyed two-and-a-half years managing in the Premier League across spells with Bournemouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "O'Neil stabilised matters at Bournemouth for a campaign following Scott Parker's dismissal after a humiliating 9-0 thrashing by Liverpool in August 2022. However, when the Cherries chose to bring in Andoni Iraola rather than retain O'Neil at the conclusion of the 2022/23 season, the Englishman moved to Wolves.",

      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here,\" declared Senne Lammens after securing his move to Manchester United.",

      "Most players who wanted to leave or were deemed surplus to requirements at M16 have now left and are off the Reds' wage bill. United's new signings, meanwhile, have, by and large, looked good so far.",
      "Matheus Cunha has impressed while Bryan Mbeumo has shown character against Burnley after an unfortunate penalty miss against Grimsby Town cost United their place in the League Cup. There will be some concern over Benjamin Sesko's early form in a Reds jersey and yet patience is needed with the Slovenian after his late arrival before the new season.",

      "Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller has dropped a major transfer hint about his future amid speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United this summer.",
      "According to @iMiaSanMia, who quote German outlet SportsBILD, Stiller said: \"I'm currently not thinking about a move. Generally speaking, I'm interested in moving abroad at some point; I thought that Florian Wirtz's decision to go to Liverpool was cool.",
      "\"But only one thing is certain for me: At the end of my career, I absolutely want to play in the USA, in the MLS.",
      "\"This is 100 per cent my plan, my goal.\"",

After reuniting with his national team colleagues, Martinez shared images of himself grinning during training sessions - accompanied by the Spanish word \"Feliz\" - which, as translated into English, means happy.",

      "The EFL have confirmed that Grimsby Town will travel to Sheffield Wednesday in the Carabao Cup third round on Tuesday.",
      "It emerged on Tuesday morning that the EFL had fined Grimsby £20,000 for fielding an ineligible player during the match. Clarke Oduor, who was the only Grimsby player to miss his penalty, was not registered on time for the contest, with the Mariners then admitting the clerical error.",
      "MEN Sport is under the impression that no replay or expulsion from the tournament is being considered.",
      "Now, the EFL have released fixtures for the third round of the Carabao Cup - and Grimsby are involved as part of the schedule - putting to an end any hope that United could be handed a second chance.",
      "According to The Athletic, Rasmus Hojlund was left 'heartbroken' when he was shipped off to Napoli. The 22-year-old striker had failed to impress since joining United from Atalanta for £72m a couple of years ago.",
      "This summer, he joined Antonio Conte's side on loan. The deal reportedly includes a £34m obligation to buy clause that will be activated if the Italian champions qualify for the Champions League.",

      "Toby Collyer could have provided extra midfield cover, but Amorim allowed the youngster to join West Brom on a season-long loan after deciding he would not receive adequate minutes.",
      "Unless United reach the FA Cup quarter-finals this season, the 2025/26 campaign will see them play the fewest number of games in a season since 1914/15 (excluding seasons impacted by war).",

      "Manchester United summer signing Benjamin Sesko has said it's a wish come true to sign at Old Trafford and believes he's getting better with each passing training session.",
      "Speaking to Slovenia’s Ekipa, he said: \"The level of the matches is certainly much higher, the players and teammates are also at a higher level. After all, English football is at the highest level in the world of football.",
      "“But I am very much looking forward to the coming period, also because I am getting better and faster in every training session, and I am also progressing in my football mentality every day.",
      "\"I wanted to move to England and fortunately my wish came true.\"",
      "Also discussing the upcoming Manchester derby, Sesko said: \"It’s true, it’s an incredibly big match coming up. There will simply be some pressure on both sides to just win this match. There’s still quite a bit to go until this match, but we’re definitely looking forward to a top-notch match.”",
      "According to the Dutch newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws in Belgium, as quoted by Sport Witness, Royal Antwerp were upset to discover that Senne Lammens had boarded a private jet to the United Kingdom before they had agreed terms with United.",
      "The report claims that the 23-year-old goalkeeper, who joined the Reds on deadline day, was 'theoretically not allowed to travel, but he did so anyway'. It's said that there was 'some resentment' within the club, having travelled without their approval.",
      "Antwerp finally reached an agreement with United when Lammens was airborne...",
      "Paul Scholes has named Gianluigi Donnarumma as the signing of the summer, overlooking the wealth of talent that United brought to Old Trafford. Following the Italy international's move to Manchester City, the former Reds midfielder took to Instagram.",
      "\"Donnarumma for £26m surely has to be signing of the window,\" said Scholes. \"Obviously apart from the 14 Salford City have signed [praying emoji].\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand was pleased with United's business this summer. The Reds forked out £230m on Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Ruben Amorim also managed to finally offload his 'bomb squad', with Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Marcus Rashford all finding new clubs.",
      "On his show, the United legend said: \"I'm going to give it a 7.5, maybe an eight. I think I'll give it an eight based on the players they've got out of the football club because they had the potential to affect the ambience if they were hanging around.",
      "\"I think it's been a good decision from the club, good active work from the people behind the scenes.\"",
      "Speaking on his latest YouTube video, Fabrizio Romano provided an update on United's unsuccessful approach for Conor Gallagher on deadline day. The journalist said: \"In the last 48 hours of the summer transfer window, Man United tried to sign Conor Gallagher.",
      "\"Man United considered the possibility to go for Conor Gallagher. It was not possible to make it happen, because Manchester United wanted to sign Gallagher on a loan deal, while Atletico Madrid already rejected a loan approach from Crystal Palace ten days ago.",
      "\"The top targets on loan for Palace were Conor Gallagher and Yeremy Pino. Pino arrived, Gallagher they tried to bring back to the club, he knows the club very well.",
      "\"But the answer from Atletico to Manchester United was no, no chance to that surprise proposal in the final hours of the summer transfer window. They tried for a midfielder, but no for the deal...\"",
      "Speaking to Spanish outlet Cope, Antony claimed he rejected an eye-watering offer from Bayern Munich to return Real Betis. The former United winger said: \"I spoke with Bayern, I don’t know if it was €7m (£6m), but I said I had Betis’ word and that it was 95% certain and that I would respect my word.",
      "\"I feel comfortable making this decision because I’m very happy here. More than five teams called me. Today will mark my life; it was very emotional, and I’ve never experienced that before.",
      "\"My family is very happy; it’s very hard to be away from them, and it’s been very hard being alone in the hotel for more than 40 days. My wife was waiting in Seville, and I told her my first choice was Betis.",
      "\"I was very moved seeing the affection of the Betis fans; I couldn’t get out of the car, so I ran out. It was a very nice party...\"",
      "According to TeamTalk, United and Chelsea are frontrunners in the race to sign Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace in the January transfer window. The report claims the two Premier League clubs have shortlisted the 21-year-old midfielder as a 'key target'.",
      "It's said that United and Chelsea view Wharton as a 'potential game-changer'. The former Blackburn Rovers playmaker sees his contract at Selhurst Park expire in June 2029.",
      "According to The Athletic, United recently considered signing Danny Welbeck from Brighton. The report claims that Erik ten Hag wanted to bring the 34-year-old striker to Old Trafford last year, but the Reds couldn't explore a deal due to hierarchy restructure.",
      "It's said that United tried again in the summer, and they were prepared to offer him a two-year contract. Welbeck has just entered the final 12 months of his deal at the Amex Stadium, making him available on a free in June 2026.",
      "Angelo Stiller has provided an update on his future at Stuttgart. Speaking to German outlet Bild, as quoted by SPORT, the 24-year-old midfielder said: \"I'm not currently thinking about moving.",
      "\"I've discussed it with my management that this is out of the question for me right now. I'm a regular and leading player here. The most important thing for my development is that I get my minutes – especially in a World Cup year. I definitely didn't want to jeopardise the World Cup.\"",
      "Stiller was linked with a move to United during the summer transfer window. The Germany international added: \"Basically, I'm attracted to moving abroad at some point.",
      "\"I thought Florian Wirtz's decision to go to Liverpool was cool. One thing is clear to me: At the end of my career, I absolutely want to play in the USA, in the MLS. This plan, this goal, is 100 percent.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim will be putting those still at Carrington through their paces over the next week or so as the Reds look to transform their fortunes. United were fortunate to end August with a win after a shaky start to the season."

      "Although club figures say signing a new midfielder was not the priority because of their 'strong' options, it feels like a calculated decision was made based on fixtures and finances.",
      "United have just 16 Premier League games before the January window. The board has looked at Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte, Mount and Mainoo and decided there is enough there to roll the dice.",
      "There is also a belief that Sekou Kone could have a first-team impact before the end of the season. Kone did not play a single minute during the United States tour, but staff believe he could eventually contribute.",
      "It seems doubtful Kone will make any impact in the first half of the season, though. The youngster has been on the cusp of the first-team and needs more time in training to make a solid case to Amorim.",
      "Kone started for the Under-21s against Tamworth in the National League Cup last month and sustained a head injury. Kone was taken to hospital and the game had to be abandoned with no replacement ambulance available.",
      "The midfielder stayed in the hospital overnight but was discharged in the morning. Kone has been described as \"fine\" by a source and he will return to grass imminently, so he could possibly feature in behind-closed-doors U21 friendlies against the PFA and Aston Villa during the international break.",
      "United paid around £1million to sign Kone from Malian club Guidars FC. He was scouted with a view to progressing to the first-team and the deal was low risk considering the fee.",
      "Travis Binnion (Under-21 manager) also took French lessons, but Binnion credited Rowe with pushing particularly hard to learn a new language.",
      "Rowe was appointed in an academy player-coach role last year. Sources have said he is the best United have had in the hybrid academy position, which has previously been held by Paul McShane and Tom Huddlestone.",
      "Fans wanted a glimpse of Kone in pre-season in the USA. They felt he could show his talent and potentially make a case for first-team minutes, but Amorim did not use him in any of the friendlies.",
      "Kone still has a long way to go and has been on a steep learning curve since his arrival in England. He has been forced to put on muscle, get up to speed with the intensity and improve his positional understanding.",
      "Earlier this year, Binnion told the MEN: \"He’s a good player and we have high expectations for him, and any player we sign, you want to have those expectations, otherwise you go away and you aren’t signing a good player. You can see with the lads in the first-team, the level of expectation is high.",
      "\"But the reward is high and our lads have to be ready, maybe sooner than other big clubs, which is a real positive for players in the academy, but it’s hard, it’s not easy, is it?",
      "\"He has trained with the first-team quite a lot now, but as you can see tonight and the games he’s played recently, a big part of his development is the games.",
      "\"And it’s a healthier part of our first-team in that position, and the demands on that position are really high, whereas a forward player, they can maybe make more mistakes and experiment a bit more.",
      "\"The games are really important for them to get used to, the style of play, the intensity of English football and just for him to make better decisions day in, day out, in each of the games, whereas if he didn’t play games and only dropped in now and again, I think you’d see a slower rate of development.",
      "\"A lot of [academy] players train with the first-team a lot because they’re further along in their development. He does train with the first-team, but he needs to make sure he’s developing his own game, so when he goes full-time with the first-team, he’s in the right space.\"",
      "United hope Kone can improve quickly enough to contribute to the first-team this season. But Kone will not be rushed because he was signed last summer with the long-term future in mind.",

      "Manchester United prospect Shea Lacey backed up Reds' Under-21 boss Travis Binnion's praise with a stellar performance and a wonderful goal for the academy on Wednesday.",
      "Lacey has long been touted as a player of real potential and after injury issues impacted his progress last season, he is now reminding everyone of his talent.",
      "The 18-year-old came off the bench in the Premier League 2 derby with Manchester City at the weekend, coming close to scoring with his first touch before setting up Amir Ibragimov to net the winner in a 2-1 victory.",
      "And Lacey stole the show for the Under-21s in a Carrington friendly with the PFA Pre-Season squad on Wednesday afternoon. The teenager produced a virtuoso display in midfield and scored United's goal in the 1-1 draw when he curled home a wonderful effort into the top corner shortly before the break.",
      "That cancelled out Connor Wickham's opener for the visitors. The striker scored from the halfway line as he caught out United keeper Murdock with an audacious finish.",
      "United also handed a first start at Under-21 level to summer signing Diego Leon, who played an hour as he adjusts to his new surroundings following his arrival from Paraguay. The 18-year-old full back was an unused sub in the EFL Cup defeat to Grimsby Town last week and is being handed minutes at academy level to help aid his progress.",
      "But it was Lacey who grabbed the attention with a display that merited the praise lavished on him by Binnion over the weekend.",
      "\"Listen, everybody in the world knows about Shea Lacey,\" said Binnion after United U21s beat City on Sunday.",
      "\"So he needs a little bit of fortune, he needs to be patient with himself and everybody else needs to be really patient with him.",
      "\"He is in the same sort of area as Chido because of time lost. Different to Chido, Chido is fast progression. Because of time lost with Shea, he still has lots to come tactically, physically and mentally.",
      "\"Everybody can see - you have to be blind not to see - the talent he's got. He's got lots to do in his game and he knows. We're still managing him physically because if he can stay on the pitch and can train every day, I think everyone thinks he could be a top, top player.\"",

      "Michael Owen admits he was “embarrassed” by his performance levels at Manchester United compared to his prime years.",
      "The former England striker opened up to former Red Devils team-mate Rio Ferdinand on the Rio Presents podcast about struggling mentally with his decline during the second half of his career, which he admitted was “killing him inside”.",
      "Owen exploded onto the Premier League stage as a 17-year-old at Liverpool, swiftly making his mark with his blistering pace behind defences and ruthless finishing. He claimed the division's golden boot prize in his first two full seasons before making his mark on the international stage with a stunning strike against Argentina aged 18 at the World Cup 1998.",
      "Following his crucial contribution to Liverpool's historic Treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and League Cup in 2001, which saw him claim the Ballon d'Or, he secured a transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2004.",
      "Owen played in La Liga for just one season before his £16.8million move to Newcastle, where recurring muscular injuries meant he was absent for extended spells over the next four campaigns in the North East. His fitness woes persisted at Manchester United and later Stoke City, with the forward deciding to hang up his boots in 2013.",
      "The 45-year-old was recently asked by Ferdinand about the drop off from going from an elite environment to one that isn’t. But Owen instead chose to reflect on his own career, explaining that he sees it in two distinct halves: before and after his injury problems.",
      "Owen said: “Well, I've said before, I mean, I sort of split my career into two. Almost Liverpool and maybe Madrid. And then afterwards, because I just wasn't the same. Not that I didn't like it. I loved it at United. I love you and the lads and whatever.",
      "“But I'm not me. I'm not me. You know what I was when I was 18. And you know what I was when I was 30. It's like, I was half embarrassed. I'm coming out, they've been to these big stadiums, St James' Park, Old Trafford, with my name on my back.",
      "“It's like, can I not just change my name and just think of something, like call me something else? I don't want people to remember me like this. Still good, still scoring. But I'm not what I was. It's killing me. But it's like, what can you do?”",
      "During his time at Liverpool, Owen scored more than 20 goals in all competitions in every season except two. After netting 16 times in 45 appearances for Real Madrid, his numbers plummeted dramatically as injuries piled up and his once lightning-fast pace began to wane.",
      "Reflecting on his time at Newcastle, Man United and Stoke, he openly admitted: “I had it for eight years, when I'm thinking, ‘I don't like this.’ I was looking at the clock half of my career, thinking only 20 minutes. And I could still score. I could still play well.",
      "“I couldn't rip a team's heart out anymore. I could just finish if I get the opportunity. I'm relying on everyone else now. Whereas I used to be able to, I didn't need anyone else. Just give me the ball and I'll do it. And that change of mentality.",
      "“I didn't retire because of my body. I still played in a game the other day. I retired because my mind was about to explode. And I couldn't have it anymore that I was just a Premier League player.”",
      "Despite not living up to his own high standards, Owen's stint at Manchester United saw him finally win the Premier League trophy in the 2010/11 season, as well as another League Cup. He ended his career with an impressive tally of 222 goals in 482 matches, along with 40 goals in 89 England caps.",
      "Listen to the full Rio Meets Michael Owen interview on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.",

      "Former Arsenal star Theo Walcott has branded Manchester United icon Peter Schmeichel as \"sour\" for his damning comments on Arsenal's style of play in their defeat to Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side registered just one shot on target at Anfield last weekend as a stunning late Dominik Szoboszlai free-kick secured the three points for Arne Slot's reigning champions. Afterwards, the former United keeper, who has hit out at the Gunners previously, slammed Arsenal for playing an \"ugly brand of football\" with their risk-averse approach rattling some pundits.",
      "Walcott, who represented the Gunners from 2005-2018, claimed Arteta's conservative approach against Liverpool had actually worked in Arsenal's opening weekend encounter against Manchester United, where the Gunners won 1-0.",
      "Schmeichel's swipe was actually a result of sour grapes after United had lost that encounter against their rivals, in the eyes of Walcott.",
      "\"Well, it worked at Man United so maybe Schmeichel is a bit sour from that result,\" Walcott said referring to Arsenal's style of play on the It's Called Soccer! podcast. \"Because there are times when it works. But the plan in those games is to stay in the game and this is the dynamic, and where I feel Mikel Arteta is at this moment in time.\"",
      "Referring to the lucrative backing Arteta has had in the transfer market this summer, Walcott added: \"He's now equipped, the club have really backed him with investment and now he's got options everywhere but he likes to go back to his [mantra] of, 'We need to stay in the game.'",
      "\"I've played with managers, Arsene [Wenger] at times, when you're in the games and you're like, 'Just bring on another forward as this is where you can score more goals.'",
      "\"Managers are too afraid of losing and this is the problem, because now he's lost, everyone is going to look at this way and say, 'Well they lost, they weren't adventurous and playing with that freedom.' But it was working up to a certain point.\"",
      "Arsenal were missing Bukayo Saka, while captain Martin Odegaard was only fit enough for the bench. However, a reliance on set-pieces and corners saw Arsenal lag behind in possession and xG stakes against Liverpool, and Schmeichel was left angered by their approach to the game.",
      "\"I have never in my life ever wanted a team to win a game of football more than Liverpool today. Arsenal bring an ugly brand of football to our game,\" he said on Viaplay following Liverpool's 1-0 victory. \"I don't want to insult Arsenal but their brand of football is so annoying to watch, it's designed to exploit opponents while waiting for set pieces.\"",
      "Arsenal have been regarded as set piece specialists for well over a year, and that has helped them win several high-profile games. However, on multiple occasions they've been criticised for being unable to unlock teams with a brand of football that's pleasing on the eye.",
      "\"They've seen this before. They look comfortable in a big game, but at this moment in time haven't got that risk in their game, that courage to go and think they can win.\"",

      "Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott believes Ruben Amorim will have departed Manchester United before Christmas arrives.",
      "The Red Devils kicked off the new campaign with promise, despite suffering a 1-0 defeat by Arsenal. This loss showed character, and bolstered by new signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, the future appeared encouraging.",
      "A 1-1 stalemate with Fulham quickly dampened such optimism, while a Carabao Cup elimination by League Two outfit Grimsby Town marked a fresh nadir. A dramatic 3-2 triumph over Burnley ensued, though the victory lacked conviction, with an injury to newcomer Cunha serving as another blemish on a season still in its early stages.",
      "The penalty shootout defeat to a lower-league opponent sparked demands for the manager's dismissal. While such calls have slightly subsided, Lescott remains convinced that United will have appointed a new boss by January.",
      "Following the international interval, a challenging visit to the Etihad to face rivals City awaits Amorim. Pep Guardiola's team have also endured a stuttering start to the campaign, with Lescott maintaining both managers face mounting scrutiny, reports the Mirror.",
      "\"The pressure is on for both managers [Amorim and Guardiola],\" declared Lescott on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"Different types of pressure, though.",
      "ALL OUT FOOTBALL ON YOUTUBE: Subscribe now to be the first to watch the latest episodes of In The Mixer and other original shows, brought to you by Sky Bet. Follow All Out Football on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and X.",
      "\"Pep's job isn't under threat, but Amorim's is, yeah,\" continued Lescott. \"I'd be very surprised if he (Amorim) is still there by Christmas. If he is there in January 2026, they're just being stubborn. He looks lost.\"",
      "Lescott, who played at the Etihad between 2009 and 2014 and made 160 appearances, additionally believes that Amorim's Manchester rival, Guardiola, has seen his City departure telegraphed through fresh signings.",
      "When questioned whether City are planning for existence beyond Guardiola, Lescott replied: \"Yeah, maybe. You're going to have to. The standards may be different this season because it's a new era, you know.",
      "\"When you've got seasoned players who have been there for an extended period, they are the ones who guide you through difficult times. Whilst now, there's [Tijjani] Reijnders, [Rayan] Cherki. They're all experiencing negativity together for the first time. So who is going to get them out of it?",
      "\"I think, like prior to Pep, a lot of this summer's signings are post-Pep. Just like when they signed Kevin [De Bruyne], Delphy [Fabian Delph], Raheem [Sterling], they all signed before Pep arrived, but they were for Pep.\"",
      "Guardiola, who extended his tenure at Manchester City last year with a contract set to expire in 2027, told ESPN: \"After my contract with City, I'm going to stop. I'm sure. I don't know if I'm going to retire, but I'm going to take a break. How I want to be remembered, I don't know.",
      "\"All coaches want to win so we can have a memorable job, but I believe that the fans of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City had fun watching my teams play. I don't think we should ever live thinking about whether we're going to be remembered.\"",

      "Jeff Stelling believes that Manchester United have had a \"poor\" transfer window after failing to address two key issues.",
      "Ruben Amorim received the backing of the board this summer as he strived to improve the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag. And while spending more than £200million on the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko alone may seem fruitful on the face of things, Stelling believes the club have overlooked two pivotal areas of the pitch; the team's engine room and between the sticks.",
      "\"I thought it was absolutely essential and they haven’t done so. Yes, they’ve got Kobbie Mainoo but he hasn’t got the sort of legs required to drive that midfield forward.\"",
      "Mainoo's summer at Old Trafford has a controversial one, given that the English talent hoped to leave the club on loan after failing to get the nod over Bruno Fernandes in the starting XI. However, Amorim was not keen on the idea of the 20-year-old parting ways with his squad, telling reporters last month: \"I want Kobbie to stay and he needs to fight for his place.",
      "\"We need Kobbie. That is not going to change. The players not playing with be disappointed but everyone will have opportunities. You have to fight in the week.\"",
      "Mainoo was ultimately not allowed to leave, but the Red Devils did very little to strengthen their ageing midfield. Despite being linked with Carlos Baleba for large parts of the window, Brighton's £100m price tag of the star proved too hot to handle for the time being, especially considering Amorim had splurged a large portion of the club's kitty on a new attacking line.",
      "However, Stelling also criticised the club's choice to invest in 23-year-old goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, who joined United in an £18.2m move from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. While the Red Devils were linked with an unsettled Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa, they ultimately opted on Lammens, who is nine years the Argentine's junior and proves as a far cheaper option on the face of things.",
      "While he brings the benefit of youth to Amorim's squad, he lacks the vital Premier League experience that 32-year-old Martinez holds, given that he has impressed for Villa over the past five years and also has experience with Arsenal. And it's something that Stelling believes may have been incredibly beneficial going forward.",
      "He added: \"And, they’ve gone for the cheap goalkeeper option. Lammens might turn out to be a fantastic goalkeeper but it's a humungous step for him to go from playing for Royal Antwerp in front of 12,00 people in the Belgian league to huge crowds at Old Trafford. For me, Emi Martinez was the obvious choice for Manchester United.\"",
      "While Amorim insisted that he was happy with his goalkeeping set-up earlier in the window, the Portuguese tactician has seemingly since noticed holes in the games of both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana.",
      "Bayindir has featured in each of United's three Premier League games this season thus far, and came under fire for the Red Devils' 1-0 opening day loss to Arsenal. The 27-year-old botched a clearance from a corner, which allowed Riccardo Calafiori to sneak in at the back post and score the game-winning goal.",
      "Meanwhile, Onana was deployed during United's Carabao Club clash with Grimsby Town last month, where he was also lambasted for errors which led to the League Two side securing a 2-0 lead by half-time. Despite goals from Mbeumo and Harry Maguire squaring the clash, they were ultimately dumped out after a tense penalty shootout.",
      "It's been a mix-bag of results in the league for United thus far, with a win, a loss and a draw to their name from their opening three, and Amorim will undoubtedly be hoping for a more inspired performance when they return from the international break for the Manchester Derby come Sunday, September 14.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Barcelona also have the option to make his transfer to Catalonia permanent for £26million next summer. The Reds academy graduate has been called up to Thomas Tuchel's England squad - for World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia in September - as the Three Lions move closer to qualifying for next summer's tournament.",

      "Garnacho's time at United came to an end at the weekend when he completed a £40m move to Stamford Bridge. The Argentine was bought for a nominal fee from Atletico Madrid in 2020 and joined the academy structure at Carrington.",
      "Within two years he had made a name for himself and was drafted into the first-team, playing alongside one of his childhood idols Cristiano Ronaldo. However, after Erik ten Hag was sacked in October 2024, his time at United hurdled towards an end.",
      "In Ruben Amorim's new system, Garnacho failed to adapt and this led to him becoming a substitute. He was dropped for the Manchester derby in December alongside Marcus Rashford.",
      "After that he was ordered to buy a meal for all his teammates after storming off the field following his substitution. However, Amorim cut ties with the winger at the end of the season when he posted a petulant image of himself celebrating in the FA Cup final against Manchester City when he was dropped for the Europa League finale in Bilbao.",
      "He would then bemoan his lack of playing time in the final during a post-match interview. The opinion of United fans towards Garnacho soured further when, in June, he posted a picture of himself on holiday in Rashford's shirt from his stint at Aston Villa.",
      "When he returned from his holiday, Garnacho joined the so-called 'bomb squad' requesting his exit from Old Trafford which was granted at the very end of the window. Despite how his time at the club ended, the 21-year-old posted an emotional goodbye to the United fans on social media.",
      "As his new chapter begins in the capital, he has given a nod back to United by choosing the No.49 as his new shirt number. This number belonged to Garnacho before he was given the No.17 upgrade.",
      "At the time, it was seen as a slight against Garnacho that he was not given the No.7 shirt. Instead, that accolade was handed to new arrival Mason Mount.",
      "Garnacho may make a near instant return to Old Trafford after the international break when the Reds host the Blues on Saturday, September 20.",

      "O'Neil stabilised matters at Bournemouth for a campaign following Scott Parker's dismissal after a humiliating 9-0 thrashing by Liverpool in August 2022. However, when the Cherries chose to bring in Andoni Iraola rather than retain O'Neil at the conclusion of the 2022/23 season, the Englishman moved to Wolves.",

      "Manchester United are in the midst of the first international break of the season and while for many supporters this is a time to have a breather and take stock on the campaign so far, for Ruben Amorim his mind will be racing.",
      "While undoubtedly he will have been relieved to have picked up his first victory of the season at home to Burnley last Saturday, performances have been a mixed bag and the defeat to Grimsby Town, particularly in the first half, will have concerned him greatly. Not only that, but there are lingering concerns about injury issues at Old Trafford.",
      "Both Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are doubts for the return of the Premier League. A problem at any time but the fact that the derby against Manchester City is the first fixture back makes this the worst possible moment for this issue to arise.",
      "At this stage, there is still the possibility that both players are fit to travel to the Etihad Stadium. But should either man or - dare we say it - both, are unavailable, Amorim needs to have line-ups in mind to prepare for that.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at how the team could look against City should they be missing at least one of the starters from the victory against Burnley.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Should Mount be unavailable for the fixture, it could give United fans the opportunity to see all of their three new attacking signings start together in the Premier League. Cunha would drop into the second No.10 role alongside Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Then, as can be shown below, Benjamin Sesko would be given the nod up front. Spoiler alert here, Sesko receives the nod in all of these line-ups...",
      "This scenario is perhaps more likely as we know Cunha has dropped out of the upcoming Brazil squad which leaves some concern for the Reds. To keep things as stable as possible, we reckon that Amorim would look to make a straight swap with Sesko coming in for the ex-Wolves man.",
      "Perhaps the nuclear option and the one which Amorim is desperate to avoid would see both players out of the Manchester derby. Should this happen, it would require a more major rejig of the midfield and attack.",
      "Sesko, once again, shall come into the line-up but Mount and Cunha's absence would thrust Bruno Fernandes into a more prominent role as a No.10 alongside Mbeumo. This would, of course, leave a gap deeper in the midfield.",
      "United would need to fill that with either Kobbie Mainoo or Manuel Ugarte. In our view, the former would be the more comfortable replacement for the captain but Amorim may feel that two more defensively-minded midfielders would suit the team better against City.",

      "Former Manchester United assistant manager Steve McClaren has expressed his disappointment after Mason Greenwood chose not to join up with the Jamaica squad for this month's international break.",
      "Greenwood and McClaren worked together at Old Trafford when the latter assisted Erik ten Hag. However, their working relationship was mainly off the pitch as the winger was suspended by the Reds in January 2022 amid allegations of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour.",
      "All charges were later dropped and the winger would join Getafe on loan on deadline day in the summer of 2023. McClaren only rejoined United's coaching staff in July 2022.",
      "Upon the expiry of his loan in Spain, Greenwood returned to Manchester where he was informed by the coaching team that he would be sold. The winger signed for Marseille in 2024 and excelled leading to some brief speculation that the 23-year-old could resume his England career.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, he was not in the plans of either Gareth Southgate nor Thomas Tuchel which has led Greenwood to explore his international options. McClaren, realising that Greenwood could switch allegiances to Jamaica, has been making an effort to bring him to the Caribbean.",
      "This idea was first pitched last season but progress has been limited. Now, ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago, McClaren has shed more light on the situation.",
      "\"He has acquired a passport and we expected him to be coming to this camp but after a conversation with his family, he’s not going to commit at this time to anybody,\" the former England head coach explained. \"So, he’s taking his time over that.",
      "\"It’s a little bit disappointing. We probably have to be more patient.",
      "\"We will keep the contact. We’ll keep pursuing him because I know from my conversations with Mason, he loves Jamaica, respects Jamaica.",
      "\"He wants to concentrate on club football and not commit to an international team. At the present moment, we have to respect that however much we have worked hard to get him here for this camp.",
      "\"So, who knows in the future.\" Greenwood has started the new season with Marseille well, scoring once and assisting another two in the opening three fixtures.",
      "Should he switch allegiances to Jamaica, Greenwood could potentially represent the country at the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada next summer. The 23-year-old has narrowly avoided a return to England this season in the Champions League after the draw was made last week.",
      "Greenwood will come up against English opposition in the form of Newcastle and Liverpool during the league phase. The Premier League duo shall travel to France on November 25 and January 21, respectively.",

      "\"You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here,\" declared Senne Lammens after securing his move to Manchester United.",
      "The mood might not be so jovial among his fellow Old Trafford goalkeepers. Lammens completed his deadline day switch to United late on deadline day and will now bed in to his new surroundings over the international break.",
      "The arrival of the Belgian - not named in Roberto Martinez's squad for the September internationals - piles further pressure on beleaguered pair Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, who are both away on international duty this month.",
      "The pair have made costly errors already this season with the campaign only four games old. Onana was at fault for one if not both of Grimsby Town's goals in the embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat while Bayindir dropped clangers against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League having seemingly usurped Onana as Ruben Amorim's first choice.",
      "The arrival of Lammens clouds the picture further. The 23-year-old has been a regular in his homeland for Royal Antwerp and while United sources would not say if the new arrival was coming in as a potential first choice, the player himself will be ready to take a chance.",
      "\"I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years,\" he said on arrival. \"I cannot wait to get to know my teammates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.”",
      "Lammens would bring a calmness and confidence that Onana and Bayndir have failed to offer at United.",
      "\"As a goalkeeper you have to stay calm to instil confidence in your defenders and the rest of the team,\" Lammens said in a 2024 interview with Het Nieuwsblad.",
      "\"You're not supposed to be stressed out between the posts. As a youth player, that happened to me sometimes, but in recent years, it hasn't bothered me at all.",
      "\"They always say that I stay level emotionally. That I'm stable and never go up or down too quickly. I'm happy about that, by the way. I think that's a good quality for a goalkeeper.\"",
      "It's a quality United have lacked in recent years. The prospect of a calm keeper providing a foundation at the back and a confidence in his team-mates would offer the Reds a cornerstone on which to build.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson once said a great goalkeeper could be worth 15 points a season. This United are in no position to turn down a chance to improve their tally as they seek to challenge the top six following a dismal 2024-25 campaign and a stuttering start to the current season.",
      "Lammens is far from the finished article but is a decent distributor - something that United sought out when signing Onana - while the Belgian is a commanding presence in his penalty area and a capable shot stopper.",
      "According to Opta Analyst, he prevented 17.4 goals from being scored in the Belgian Pro League in 2024-25, which suggests a shot stopper capable of performing for his new club.",
      "But to do so he must be given an opportunity by Amorim. The United boss must recognise that pursuing with Onana or Bayindir just now will not provide the stability and security required.",
      "A new goalkeeper was not considered a priority by United this summer but Amorim's outlook changed amid the erratic form of Onana.",
      "Tom Heaton, 39, has not played since February 2023 and is unlikely to figure for United this season with the signing of Lammens and sparse schedule.",
      "If the Belgian is offered an opportunity, he could help unlock a new United.",

      "The EFL have confirmed that Grimsby Town will travel to Sheffield Wednesday in the Carabao Cup third round on Tuesday, September 16, ending Manchester United's mooted hopes of getting a potential reprieve.",
      "United crashed out of the competition after losing on penalties to the League Two side last Wednesday evening, following a dramatic 2-2 draw after 90 minutes. Grimsby went 2-0 up at Blundell Park, before Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire struck for the Reds to take the tie to a penalty shootout.",
      "The Mariners ended up holding their nerve to beat United 12-11 from 12 yards - with Mbeumo missing the decisive 26th spot-kick to send the plucky fourth-tier side through to the next round.",
      "However, it emerged on Tuesday morning that the EFL had fined Grimsby £20,000 for fielding an ineligible player during the match. Clarke Oduor, who was the only Grimsby player to miss his penalty, was not registered on time for the contest, with the Mariners then admitting the clerical error.",
      "They must now pay £10,000, with the remaining £10,000 suspended until the end of the season, with MEN Sport also under the impression that no replay or expulsion from the tournament is being considered.",
      "Now, the EFL have released fixtures for the third round of the Carabao Cup - and Grimsby are involved as part of the schedule - putting to an end any hope that United could be handed a second chance.",
      "The Mariners are due to meet Wednesday, who beat Leeds United on penalties in the last round, at Hillsborough Stadium on Tuesday, September 16, with kick-off at 7.45pm.",
      "After Grimsby were handed their fine by the EFL, the club said in a statement: \"Grimsby Town Football Club acknowledges today's decision by the EFL regarding an error in the registration of Clarke Oduor ahead of our Carabao Cup Round Two fixture against Manchester United,\" the announcement began.",
      "The registration of Oduor was submitted to the EFL at one minute past the deadline and the issue was not immediately identified by the club due to a computer problem being experienced at Grimsby.",
      "\"We accept the fine imposed and fully recognise the importance of adhering to competition rules and regulations. This mistake was not deliberate - and the club acted transparently by self-reporting that breach as soon as it came to light.",
      "\"Since this incident, we have undertaken a thorough review of our processes and implemented strengthened measures to ensure it cannot happen again. We thank the EFL board for recognising our co-operation and intent, and we remain fully committed to maintaining the highest professional and regulatory standards.",
      "\"The club won't make any further comment on the matter and now looks forward to focusing on preparations for our upcoming fixtures.\"",
      "Some have since called for United to get either a replay or a reprieve into the Carabao Cup, though it appears any lingering prospect of a U-turn has been ended.",

Oduor signed for Grimsby from Bradford City on a season-long deal a day before the game and the League Two club submitted his registration a minute late, which meant he was ineligible to feature against United.",

      "\"The club self-reported the breach upon discovery the day after the fixture had been completed.",
      "\"Following a comprehensive review of all the evidence and considering prior decisions taken in respect of offences in the League Cup, the board determined that the issuing of a fine followed precedent.",
      "\"The board further noted the club's non-compliance was not deliberate with no intention to deceive or mislead. The club has sinceimplemented several actions to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.",
      "\"The club will be liable for the suspended sum of £10,000, if they were to again field an ineligible player in any league competition between now and the end of Season 2025/26.\"",
      "United trailed Grimsby 2-0 at half-time at Blundell Park but forced a penalty shootout after goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire.",

      "\"I'm the manager. It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I'm really sorry for our fans. Let's focus on the next game. That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today.",
      "\"I would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I'm really sorry for our fans. It's too much sometimes.",

      "Phil Jones has called for Manchester United players who “don’t like” Ruben Amorim to “pull yourself out of your a***”, but the Red Devils boss is clearly “the problem” in Kobbie Mainoo’s case.",
      "“It’s our responsibility, we’re the ones on the pitch. Simple as that,” Diogo Dalot said when asked about speculation over Ruben Amorim’s future at Manchester United after the embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "It’s the only thing footballers say if they want to continue to play football under a manager at risk of the sack. What’s the alternative? Blast the philosophy and tactics? Under-fire managers will continue to have the full public support and backing of the players until the time comes when they’re no longer the manager. But as Phil Jones says, there are inevitably United players who “don’t like” Amorim.",
      "“Do I think there were players at United who didn’t like him? To be honest, that’s probably a ridiculous question because I’d say there are people in the United team now who don’t like the manager,” Jones told Ladbrokes.",
      "As there will be at Manchester City under Pep Guardiola and Liverpool under Arne Slot – we can’t imagine Federico Chiesa’s too enamoured with the Reds boss right now, for example.",
      "“Trust me, I’ve been there myself,” Jones continued. “I’ve been a young kid moaning about training being rubbish. But in reality, it’s not rubbish; you’re just hurt and you don’t know how to deal with it.",
      "“You have to realise what’s going on, pull yourself out of your a*** and get back to where you need to get back to. Nine times out of ten, that’s what the problem is.",
      "“That comes with experience, though. The more mature I got, the more games I played and the more managers I had, the more of an understanding I had about it all.",
      "“You know, it wasn’t the manager who was the problem, it was me. When I think of some players now, more often than not, they find it very easy to just pass the blame onto the manager.”",
      "And those sidelined players aren’t daft. Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee know full well that the only effect of breaking ranks to have a go at the manager will for them to be jettisoned from the first team and made to train away from the squad. What’s the use in picking up a spade when Amorim is doing such a stand-up job of digging his own Manchester United grave?",
      "It will be particularly difficult for Mainoo to accept that he’s “the problem” and not Amorim. He’s gone from being a Manchester United and England pin-up when Amorim arrived to a benchwarmer denied a loan exit in search of game time in a World Cup year.",
      "The combination of Amorim not playing him thanks to a system that doesn’t suit Mainoo, along with the majority of his teammates, and him (or maybe the club) refusing to let him leave must be incredibly frustrating.",
      "Amorim has insisted that Mainoo must “fight for his place”, but the 20-year-old will view that fight with captain and talisman Bruno Fernandes as one he can’t win.",
      "We can’t imagine Mainoo is the sort of footballer who will sulk and down tools. There are videos on social media of him doing extra training sessions this week having not been selected by Thomas Tuchel for England duty. We suspect he will continue to fight that losing battle.",
      "But upon hearing Jones’ call for United players to “pull yourself out of your a***”, Mainoo may be wondering what the point is, because in his case – that one in ten instance Jones referred to – he’s not “the problem”, Ruben Amorim is.",
      "Amorim may well look at the fate that’s befallen five of his six Manchester United predecessors this summer and think twice about resigning.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted to bring in Conor Gallagher before the transfer window shut but the Man Utd board insisted on keeping Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It’s claimed Amorim will be sacked if he doesn’t get into Europe, but he should also be wary of ‘bored players’ and a vibes-based ethos at Man Utd.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is safe for now but the Red Devils have decided what would ‘prove fatal’ for the head coach this season, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Man Utd received three ‘enquiries’ from Premier League clubs for Kobbie Mainoo after the midfielder asked to leave on loan.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been labelled an “absolute disgrace” with the Red Devils tipped to sack him over the international break."

      "The Red Devils have not properly challenged for a Premier League title since 2013, when they won the English top flight under Sir Alex Ferguson.",

      "Despite a mixed start to the new season under Amorim, Ferdinand is confident that the tide will turn when Man Utd start converting some of their big chances.",
      "Ferdinand said: “We’re miles ahead of anyone, so we’re functioning in a certain way, but we’re not being killers. We need time to understand what’s going on, and I hope the manager is conveying to the players that they have to keep believing.",
      "“They might not be getting results, or performing perfectly for 90 minutes, but … he should be telling them, ‘If we finish those chances, the dynamics and results of games change, so stay with me.’ I hope he’s having those conversations.”",

      "Ruben Amorim may well look at the fate that’s befallen five of his six Manchester United predecessors this summer and think twice about resigning. A post-Old Trafford future looks just as bleak.",
      "After a quite extraordinary week at the end of a depressing summer for former Manchester United managers, while we’re sure Ruben Amorim continues to picture his calm and stress free life away from Old Trafford, he may now be wondering if – for the sake of his managerial career – he has to make this work.",
      "As he rocked from side to side on the bench in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town he looked like a man who would rather be anywhere else, and the head shakes and frustration displayed against Burnley suggest this will be an international break of introspection for the United boss despite the breathing space that last-gasp victory has granted him.",
      "After he reportedly had to be talked down from the ledge in January following a 3-1 home defeat to Brighton, when he told United bosses he was ‘prepared to resign’, there is once again a ‘feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up’.",
      "Reports suggest Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS remain as staunchly wedded to their underperforming manager as Amorim is to his failing philosophy. It feels as though Amorim is closer to walking than being sacked, but we’re not convinced the nuance of his exit from Old Trafford will save him from a fate that has befallen five of his six predecessors.",
      "All of Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick, Erik ten Hag and Ruud van Nistelrooy are currently without clubs having been employed either last season, this season or both before being sacked this summer.",
      "The most notable and brutal of those dismissals was Ten Hag’s from Bayer Leverkusen. The Dutchman has hit out at his ‘unprecedented’ sacking just two games into the Bundesliga season, while reports in Germany claim that the ill feeling towards Ten Hag at the club meant that sporting director Simon Rolfes had, if anything, ‘waited too long’ to get rid of him.",
      "In a very familiar tale for United fans, Ten Hag ‘failed to convey ideas’ and ‘no-one knew what to do’, leading long-serving members of staff to mock him through open debates as to whether he was the worst manager in the club’s history.",
      "Mourinho was shown the Fenerbahce door after they failed to get through the Champions League play-offs, though it’s claimed his sacking had been coming thanks to his uninspiring football and his increasingly public clashes with the club hierarchy over transfers.",
      "Solskjaer steered Besiktas to fourth last season having taken charge in January but was dismissed after defeat to Swiss side Lausanne in the Conference League play-offs on Thursday meant the club would not be playing European football this season.",
      "Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough after the club failed to reach the Championship play-offs for the second consecutive season, with four wins from four games to start the new campaign under Rob Edwards making that look like a very good call. And Van Nistelrooy was sent packing by Leicester after winning just four of 25 Premier League games last term having taken the reins after his interim stint at United",
      "It offers Amorim an incredibly grim view of what his post-United career might be like and Ralf Rangnick being the only one out of the last six to have retained his job, as Austria head coach, suggests the Portuguese boss, praised for his honest appraisal of the basket case he’s in charge of, should go one step further and declare the need for “open-heart surgery”, as Rangnick famously insisted was a requirement to fix a football club which quite clearly remains broken.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted to bring in Conor Gallagher before the transfer window shut but the Man Utd board insisted on keeping Kobbie Mainoo.",

      "Jamie Carragher has argued that there is a one reason behind Manchester United’s decision to stick with head coach Ruben Amorim amid a “big clamour”.",

      "The boost of an all-new forward line signed during the transfer window has been offset by the failure to fix an enduring midfield problem felt by at least two managers before him, while a goalkeeper has been signed who will likely add to his No.1 conundrum rather than solve it, in the short-term at least.",
      "He reached a United nadir in defeat to League Two Grimsby Town and any significant increase on his 26 per cent Premier League win percentage feels unlikely despite him having a pre-season to bed in his ideas and a philosophy he remains staunchly wedded to despite it showing no signs of coming good.",
      "United continue to back him in the faint hope that a group of unsuitable players for his system will miraculously grasp the nettle, or be coached into grasping it, with the alternative an admission of either his botched appointment or more deeply-rooted problems in a football club that were supposed to have been fixed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team.",

      "‘The expectation is Champions League football. Falling short of that target may be tolerated if progress is evident, but missing out on European competition entirely would likely prove fatal to Amorim’s tenure.’",
      "But there are presumably alternative final straws which could trigger his sacking – if indeed he doesn’t walk before he’s pushed – and while his post-Sir Alex Ferguson predecessors all have being a bit sh*t as a commonality in their dismissals, we’ve picked out the key reason they were sent packing from Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "As crimes go, not being the most successful manager in Premier League history is barely worth a slap on the wrists. And in hindsight, even given Sir Alex Ferguson’s standing as Mr Manchester United by the summer of 2013, a football club allowing a sitting manager to select their replacement is a madness, especially when Fergie’s selection criteria appeared to be ‘a guy I like’, ‘quite old’ and ‘Scottish’.",
      "The passage of time and the shortcomings of those who have come after him have worked in Moyes’ favour. Feelings at the time that he wasn’t given a fair shot with Marouane Fellaini his sole summer signing to aid an ageing squad have only grown since since to a point where most feel sympathy for Moyes at taking a job he couldn’t turn down but was doomed to fail in.",
      "Unai Emery similarly endured the difficulties of replacing a legacy Premier League manager at Arsenal, while Arne Slot’s success at Liverpool is in large part down to the rebuilding work already done by honorary scouser Jurgen Klopp, who left him with a squad ready to win the title rather than a title-winning squad past the peak of its powers.",

      "United failed to score in 23 of the Dutchman’s 103 games in charge and drew 19 of their 76 in the Premier League, with the majority of Van Gaal-based entertainment emanating from the touchline or in press conferences.",
      "Responding to Scholes’ criticism, which by no means limited to the above, Van Gaal questioned whether his comments were for “the benefit of the club, or the benefit of himself?” He never got the United punditry cabal onside and the fans echoed their sentiments of apathy over the style of football, which led to third and fifth-placed finishes in the Premier League, with the FA Cup gong at the end of his second season not enough to save Van Gaal from a tide that had turned through weeks and months of stale football.",

      "A confrontational style of leadership, a public rift with Paul Pogba, slams of Luke Shaw among others and a general feeling among staff that he was a ‘high maintenance’ manager, meant that questions as to whether he was ‘the right fit’ started on day one and never got close to being dispelled despite that runner-up finish and the Europa League and League Cup wins.",
      "A public flirtation with PSG on the back of consistent claims by Mourinho that he was not being backed in the transfer market, including days after buying Fred for £50m, led to a feeling that by the end (let’s face it, probably throughout) he felt he was bigger than the club.",

      "The problem with Solskjaer was, the long and short of his footballing ethos appeared to be ‘you’re good footballers, go out there and play good football’. Now, while we by no means sign up to this mood-killing obsession with philosophy and strict guidelines, and would like nothing more than an unshackled team being successful, the reality of modern day football is that success can’t be powered by vibes.",
      "Solskjaer arrived armed with little more than his legendary status as a footballer at Old Trafford and it never felt as though he ever got past the point of being no more than a guy too old to be in the XIs he was selecting, with the respect he earned from his players based on him scoring a goal in 1999 rather than from any instruction on the training pitch or from the sidelines.",
      "",
      "His Manchester United tenure was defined by a clash between his build-from-the-back style and the ‘Manchester United DNA’ he obsessively referenced as something he had to adhere to, along with some heroically awful signings.",

      "“What I see is a collection of single passes where a player receives it and has to work out where the next player is, rather than knowing where the next player is,” Gary Neville said in March 2024, seven months before his sacking which was postponed by an FA Cup final performance and win over Manchester City which came out of nowhere and evidently wasn’t any sort of harbinger for success.",

      "For a while, short strikers were all the rage with Sergio Aguero being the gold standard amongst them. but in recent years, the 5ft 10″ No.9 has been traded for a man mountain, a trend reinforced this summer.",

      "Pep Guardiola was seen as the man who ushered in the era of the small and technically gifted player but what he utilised was a generation of Spanish, but in particular Barcelona-trained players who had been nurtured to work on their technical ability. Now, we are seeing that same technical ability being demanded across the world but not just of the smaller players.",
      "If in the past it was accepted that for what you lose in technical ability, tall players make up for it with their aerial supremacy; now we have players like Isak who can challenge in the air but also be great with the ball on the deck. Erling Haaland is another example and perhaps one of the most representative given that he plays for the man who popularised the short passing game.",
      "The role of a striker has also changed significantly. If in the past they were the main focal point of attack, they are now there to contribute and free up space for others as much as they are to score. The rise of goalscoring inside forwards like Mo Salah and Bukayo Saka demonstrates this.",
      "The fact that this has happened in the Premier League should not be a surprise either as it has always been one of the most physically demanding leagues.",

That’s an increase of 133 per cent on the £120,000-a-week salary he was trousering at Newcastle. Which is not unreasonable since his agent can point to Isak’s status as British football’s most-expensive player.",

Grealish has joined Everton on loan, with the Toffees liable for £225,000 a week, making him their highest-paid player by a margin of £100,000 a week, while City top up the rest.",

      "",
      "5) Raheem Sterling (Chelsea) – £325,000 a week\nArsenal copped for around 30% of Sterling’s salary when he was on loan at the Emirates last season but he’s all Chelsea’s problem now. The Blues are working to find a solution but you can’t blame Sterling for sitting tight until he’s paid what he is contractually owed.",

      "The transfer window is closed, but we’re not quite ready to give up on transfer features just yet. Not when the alternative is international break fixtures and having to think about how on earth we go about doing an England Ladder in a world where Ruben Loftus-Cheek is back in the mix.",
      "So we will continue milking the window for all its worth until the very last drop.",
      "Here we take a look at a few of the more obvious holes and gaps and in some cases meteorite-contact craters that were left unfilled in Premier League squads when the window slammed so dramatically shut and once again, despite it having been around for so very long, caught a lot of teams apparently by surprise.",
      "",
      "It’s a tricky balancing act, when you think about it, getting the right mix of goalkeepers in your squad.",
      "You obviously want good goalkeepers and one excellent one, ideally. Your second-choice needs to be someone who can come into the team without prompting mass panic. And then there’s the third-choice, who should in a perfect world be a cheerful veteran playing out his final days in the professional game and living his very best life.",
      "The key, really, lies in getting the right gap between your first and second-choice keepers. The second-choice keeper needs to be good enough to keep the first-choice honest, but without creating unnecessary confusion. Proper competition for places is good, generally, but keeper is a position where you really want a bit of reliability and certainty.",
      "Liverpool, of course, had got it perfect in recent years with the elite world-class number one in Alisson, and then a very good but clearly not quite as good back-up in Caoimhin Kelleher. And even Liverpool couldn’t sustain it forever as Kelleher’s understandable desire to be first-choice somewhere grew undeniable.",
      "Manchester United do not have it, and on deadline day they made it even more confusing. In Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and now Senne Lammens, United have three goalkeepers who will all believe they could or should be first choice. Even the bit they had right – cheerful veteran third-choice keeper – is blown apart because Tom Heaton is now fourth-choice. What a mess.",
      "United did not need to create further confusion in a vital position that has already cost them this season and did so frequently last season.",
      "Had they bought a Donnarumma or a Martinez, it could still have all gone wrong but there would at least have been clarity about who the first-choice keeper was.",
      "Lammens is highly-rated and may in time be the long-term solution. But expecting that to happen quickly is wing-and-a-prayer stuff. Not for the first time in recent years, the United brains trust has afforded itself the luxury of a transfer with an eye on the future when this is a club and team that needs real-time solutions right now.",
      "It’s nice to set yourself up to be judged on the future rather than the present, because the future never comes. But United are drowning in waters they’ve just needlessly muddied.",
      "We really do think that United and City would both benefit from a swap deal.",
      "",
      "Liverpool enjoyed one of the most outrageous transfer windows ever and it really does seem churlish to nitpick. But there remains a non-zero chance that devoting so much energy to the cherry-on-top signing of Alexander Isak to bolster an already absurdly overpowered Premier League champion attack while leaving a deal for Marc Guehi until the very last minute might appear an error in priorities.",
      "Liverpool have left themselves riskily short at the back, even if Ibrahima Konate was currently operating at the top of his game. Which he is not. Guehi was not just a squad option; he would have instantly improved Liverpool’s first XI.",
      "Joe Gomez is still there as a versatile utility option to fill in gaps where they may appear in the back four, but for all their dizzying quality across the pitch, now Liverpool do appear alarmingly reliant on a 34-year-old Virgil van Dijk being able to play pretty much all of the football – and there is so very much of that football – for at least the next four months.",
      "Given the outlay Liverpool have made elsewhere – and we’re not knocking any of that because we are giddily excited about watching what this team produces – that just seems a daftly unnecessary position to have put themselves in.",
      "And the argument that Liverpool had done what they needed to do to remedy it with Guehi just doesn’t really wash; if you leave such a vital deal until the very last minute you always leave yourself at the mercy of a transfer chain breaking down with a potentially devastating domino effect.",
      "",
      "Spurs’ centre-back hole is perhaps less immediately conspicuous than Liverpool’s because they have two unquestioned top-tier starters in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, as well as slightly less lofty ambitions for the season as a whole.",
      "What they don’t really have is anything much else if or far more realistically when either/both of those two is unavailable. And while both that pair are top-class performers on the pitch, neither has really proved themselves too reliable at getting on that pitch 50+ times a season.",
      "Romero is in his fifth season at Spurs and has only once managed more than 27 Premier League games. Last season he featured in less than half Spurs’ 38 games.",
      "Van de Ven and his rubber-band hamstrings have played in 43 of Spurs’ 79 Premier League games since joining in the summer of 2023.",
      "Kevin Danso is a perfectly capable third-choice centre-back, and when everybody’s fit also provides Thomas Frank with the back-three option he deployed against PSG.",
      "Beyond that, though, Spurs find themselves relying on Ben Davies. We love Ben Davies, but a Champions League club should not be relying on Ben Davies in big 2025. After that, it looks like poor Archie Gray getting thrown in at the deep end again.",
      "Easy to see why Spurs enquired about Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake at City; harder to see why they didn’t really seem to try much else when neither of those avenues proved productive.",
      "",
      "Hard to escape the notion that 49ers Enterprises have let Leeds and Daniel Farke down in the closing days of the window.",
      "There was a lot of promising early work after promotion, with a clear priority for signing some really big lads. A policy we can all get behind for any promoted team embarking on a survival mission.",
      "But even as that process was taking place there was a curious lack of attackers among that collection.",
      "Goalkeeper, defence and midfield were all strengthened really quite impressively, but it’s going to mean nothing if Leeds can’t put the ball in the net.",
      "Sure, having concerns about Patrick Bamford’s injury record and deciding to replace him with Dominic Calvert-Lewin is very funny and everyone likes funny, but this is serious business, lads. It’s no time for banter and whimsy.",
      "Leeds have left themselves dangerously short of creativity and attacking quality in a league where staying in games and frustrating opponents really can only take you so far.",
      "Farke and his team have shown across a challenging first three games that they can certainly compete – even against Arsenal they kept them at arm’s length pretty easily for over half-an-hour before a Classic Set-Piece Goal – but one goal from a contentious penalty in 270 minutes tells a story.",
      "One point against Newcastle was perfectly good, but it could so clearly have been three with just a bit more attacking oomph.",
      "And while Arsenal away is not a fixture upon which Leeds’ season stands or falls, what was alarming there was not really the unflattering final scoreline but the complete and total inability to get out and try to land any kind of punch of their own. The sight of a team with giants in defence and midfield launching the ball to Dan James, Willy Gnonto and Joel Piroe and watching it come straight back every time was borderline comical.",
      "Farke said he needed two attacking players in the closing days of the window and he was right. He got none. It might cost him and Leeds everything.",
      "",
      "Never ask a woman her age, a man his salary, or a Newcastle fan how Yoane Wissa engineered his deadline-day move to Tyneside.",
      "There’s a very decent case that Brentford’s most conspicuous and damaging black hole is to be found in the dugout where Keith Andrews (for now) occupies Thomas Frank’s big chair. But on the field they’ve been decimated with the two leaders of last year’s attack in Bryan Mbeumo and Wissa off to pastures new.",
      "The wide-forward positions have been addressed in numbers at least – although Brentford do seem to have ended up with a large collection of players who would by choice operate from the left.",
      "Igor Thiago has thus far stepped up gamely to his new first-choice role through the middle with two Premier League goals and another in the Carabao, but he is literally the only centre-forward left in Brentford’s squad, with none of their ragbag collection of wingers and wide forwards particularly compelling ‘Could do a job through the middle, at a push’ candidates.",
      "There could be worrying amounts of unconvincing Kevin Schade false-ninery ahead for the Bees.",
      "Former England striker Gary Lineker insists Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi was “used” during his failed move to Liverpool over the summer.",

      "MAILBOX: Liverpool beware: ‘humiliated’ Newcastle will ‘punish’ their ‘sickening entitlement’ over Isak",
      "But, rather than bringing in a new midfielder, Man Utd decided to splash £74m on Sesko, who scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Bundesliga side RB Leipzig.",
      "And now our friends at TEAMtalk claim that Man Utd have ‘locked in’ the signing of Brighton midfielder Baleba with transfer insider Dean Jones insisting it could be part of a ‘double midfield swoop’ in 2026.",
      "Man Utd were put off a move for Baleba this summer over the huge price tag with the Seagulls hoping to get a fee similar to the £115m received from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "TEAMtalk add that Man Utd enquired this summer in order to show Brighton they are serious about signing the Cameroon international and the Red Devils are ‘not deterred by the prospect of having to spend over £100million’.",
      "With the futures of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo seemingly uncertain, Man Utd are likely to add a second midfielder over the next couple of transfer windows.",
      "TEAMtalk names Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Atalanta’s Ederson and Sporting CP’s Morten Hjulmand as options Man Utd have ‘explored’ with the trio having a combined asking price of around £222m.",
      "Rio Ferdinand suggested Baleba as a target for Man Utd before their interest was revealed earlier this summer and he reiterated his desire to see a deal done.",
      "Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel in mid-August: “Baleba, he’s a young kid, he’s a wonderful talent, high ceiling. [But] what I would say is, it’s about managing expectations if someone like him does come in.",
      "“By no means am I saying that you buy him and he’s the absolute answer and he’s the key to everything being unlocked. He’s a young kid who will need to develop. He’ll need to be integrated into the squad, into the system.",
      "“He’ll have to learn and understand the responsibilities of being at Manchester United. Different requirements. Different pressure. All these things come into it when you sign for Manchester United. He’ll make mistakes, but that’s part of it.”",

      "According to reports, Manchester United received three ‘enquiries’ from Premier League clubs for Kobbie Mainoo after the midfielder asked to leave on loan.",
      "He then started against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup and came off the bench at half-time against Burnley on Saturday, helping Ruben Amorim’s side record their first win of the campaign.",
      "United fans were aghast at the prospect of Mainoo leaving, whether it was permanently or on loan, but the 20-year-old stayed put beyond Monday’s transfer deadline.",
      "There was plenty of interest in Mainoo from clubs in England and abroad, and the Daily Mail has revealed the six clubs that were in the race for his signature.",
      "Indeed, it’s claimed that Italian champions Napoli ‘were leading the chase’ ahead of Serie A rivals AS Roma and French giants Marseille.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Kobbie Mainoo to Real Madrid? How very convenient…",
      "In the Premier League, United reportedly received ‘enquiries’ from Everton, Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa.",
      "However, Amorim’s side ‘wanted him to stay and fight for his place’, as his chances of a departure were severely reduced after injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Burnley.",
      "Let’s have a look at the six clubs the England midfielder could have joined on deadline day, shall we?",
      "One of the biggest losers of the 2025 summer transfer window, Unai Emery did get his paws on Harvey Elliott on deadline day, but Mainoo would’ve been an outstanding addition, even if it was a straight loan.",
      "We like this a lot, considering Villa’s England contingent of Ollie Watkins, Morgan Rogers and Ezri Konsa, on top of Amadou Onana and Boubacar Kamara’s injury problems.",
      "Out of all three English clubs, this strikes us as the best fit for Mainoo. I guess we’ll never know.",
      "We love this. The best team in Serie A. Managed by Antonio Conte. In the Champions League. But mostly, there are some players in Naples that Mainoo is familiar with.",
      "Scott McTominay was named Serie A Most Valuable Player after leading Napoli to the title last term, proving that the grass is very much greener on the other side. McTominay was officially joined by Rasmus Hojlund on Monday, but that deal was agreed long before.",
      "In terms of midfield competition, Mainoo would be battling for game time with the Scot and his international team-mate Billy Gilmour, as well as Frank Anguissa and Stanislav Lobotka. And if Conte viewed him as a more advanced midfield option, he’d be competing with Kevin De Bruyne…",
      "Thomas Frank’s attacking is looking strong and the deadline day addition of Randal Kolo Muani has done him no harm in that department.",
      "But in midfield, there was room for more recruitment, especially if Yves Bissouma is to remain out in the cold. Champions League football is on offer at Spurs, who do feel like a good fit for Mainoo.",
      "Everton are becoming exciting to watch following the addition of Jack Grealish, who complements Iliman Ndiaye very well. His quick renaissance under David Moyes should be a positive sign for any player looking to get their career back on track, and while Mainoo’s too young to worry about his career falling by the wayside, it would’ve been in his thinking had the Toffees’ interest intensified.",
      "James Garner and Idrissa Gana Gueye are fine midfielders, but there’s no doubt that Mainoo would be an upgrade on both. We just couldn’t see him going for it, with European football on offer everywhere else.",
      "Again, Mainoo will be familiar with one player at Marseille, Mason Greenwood. But they signed Matt O’Riley from Brighton instead of pushing for the United man.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi is another head coach a player like Mainoo could benefit from working with. The Italian does have some solid Ligue 1 midfielders already, like Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Angel Gomes, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Arthur Vermeeren.",
      "Not as sure about Roma, but working under Gian Piero Gasperini is an exciting proposition. Their midfield is significantly thinner, though Manu Kone is a super player.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has every right to “not like” Ruben Amorim as the Man Utd manager is very clearly “the problem” in his case.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted to bring in Conor Gallagher before the transfer window shut but the Man Utd board insisted on keeping Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Real Madrid are now ‘one step away’ from completing the signing of Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo on deadline day, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will only allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford before the deadline if they can bring in a replacement first, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been dealt a significant blow as a £25m ‘offer’ is ‘withdrawn’ despite reports of an ‘agreement’, while Mainoo doubles down.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists he wants Kobbie Mainoo “to stay” at Old Trafford and “fight for his place” this season."

      "Aston Villa are reportedly ‘bitter’ after Manchester United won the race for Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, despite offering more money for the 23-year-old.",
      "Unai Emery’s side had targeted Lammens on deadline day amid uncertainty surrounding the future of first-choice goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Man United had registered interest in signing the Belgian shot-stopper earlier last month but didn’t agree a deal until the final hours of the summer transfer window.",
      "There was the possibility of Martinez ending up at Old Trafford and Villa replacing him with Lammens, but the former has stayed at Villa Park despite making it clear he wanted to leave back in May.",
      "He’s been left with egg on his face, while the Red Devils have improved their goalkeeper depth with the addition of Lammens, who’s not expected to come straight into Ruben Amorim’s starting XI.",
      "F365 SAYS: Man Utd and Man City are signing goalkeepers ill-suited to who and where they are",
      "Andre Onana has been the club’s first choice since the start of 2023/24, but Amorim has preferred Altay Bayindir at the start of the season, keeping faith in the Turkish international after a mistake led to the only goal of the game in their Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "Bayindir started at Fulham and then against Burnley on Saturday as United earned their first win of the season.",
      "It’s unclear who Amorim’s long-term No.1 will be, but the expectation is that Lammens will have to work for the shirt.",
      "He might not have to work that hard, though. Amorim clearly doesn’t rate Onana and Bayindir is worryingly error-prone.",
      "United’s first game after the international break is away to Manchester City, which does suggest he won’t be thrown straight in.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, are searching for their first goal and win of the season after drawing with Newcastle United and losing against Brentford and Crystal Palace.",
      "It’s been a miserable start to 2025/26 for them, and their transfer business hasn’t given the fans much to be excited about.",
      "The goalkeeper deadline day debacle rubbed salt in the wounds for the club’s supporters, with Lammens joining United for a fee below what the Villans offered Antwerp.",
      "That’s according to the Daily Mail, where it’s claimed that Lammens joined United for £18.2m plus £3.5m in add-ons, and pushed for his ‘dream move’ to Old Trafford that left Martinez in limbo and Villa feeling ‘bitter’ after making a ‘higher’ bid.",
      "It all comes down to ‘pulling power’, which still gives the Red Devils ‘a crucial advantage in the transfer window’, despite back-to-back all-time worst Premier League seasons.",
      "Other examples cited are Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, who both snubbed interest from elsewhere to move to Old Trafford.",
      "After joining the Red Devils, Lammens said: “In my team in Antwerp, there were some players who were also in England and, when I talked to them about Manchester United, you could directly see their face change. The club alone, the aura of the club, it’s massive, and being here today, seeing it, it’s a different level.”",

      "Alexander Isak joins new Liverpool team-mate Florian Wirtz in our top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "There are so many honourable mentions. We have many players we really like, but couldn’t find space for.",
      "Transfers like Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal, Gianluigi Donnarumma to Manchester City, Granit Xhaka to Sunderland, and Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool all miss out, but are all fantastic deals in our eyes. It’s just that these ten are a little bit better.",
      "Anyway, let’s get to it. Here are our top ten Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "We loved this move before Grealish registered two assists on his Everton debut against Brighton. And then another brace of assists away to Wolves, heavily contributing to two wins in a row for David Moyes’ side.",
      "Fans across the country will agree that it’s bloody fantastic to see Grealish playing regularly and enjoying his football again. After becoming a robotic player under Pep Guardiola, he can now express himself and be the player we all know and love. Moyes will give Grealish the platform to succeed and influence a side in need of more flair. Iliman Ndiaye can only do so much. Speaking of which, that’s one exciting duo.",
      "Signed on a season-long loan, the 29-year-old has given him the best chance of making Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for next summer’s World Cup. And if all goes to plan, Everton will view his £50million buy option as a no-brainer.",
      "",
      "One of the most promising wingers in the world, it’s a breath of fresh air to see a genuine Brazilian wonderkid make the jump to the Premier League, rather than Real Madrid or Barcelona. The hype might not be the same as it was for Neymar, but that’s probably because he hasn’t made the traditional move to one of La Liga’s juggernauts.",
      "A warm-up injury to Cole Palmer on matchday two saw Estevao come into the Chelsea starting XI against West Ham, and he looked very, very dangerous. The 18-year-old assisted compatriot and fellow new signing Joao Pedro and his scary pace, confidence and dribbling ability will make him a nightmare for full-backs. And he’s only going to get better.",
      "Bought from Palmeiras for under £30m, Estevao will prove to be one of the biggest bargains of a crazy 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Cunha is a great player who Manchester United might destroy. They’ve got previous. Lots of it.",
      "Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season, earning a move to the biggest club in England, to play as one of Ruben Amorim’s ‘wide 10s’, a position he seems perfectly suited for.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling at Old Trafford because he’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "Pedro’s brace against his boyhood club Fluminense at the Club World Cup left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed out £55m, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive philosophy with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves registered 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances for the Midlands side, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Will Liverpool signings Ekitike and Wirtz fall victim to the dreaded Bundesliga tax?\n👉 Emi Martinez takes the gloves in our post-transfer window Premier League Stuck Man XI\n👉 Liverpool extend lead as the world’s 10 biggest spenders of 2025 summer transfer window after Isak\n👉 Guehi ‘screwed’ by Palace and why Liverpool spending £400m is different to Chelsea and Man City",
      "",
      "Just like with Cunha, the fact that Mbeumo has joined Manchester United means we have reservations.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal for United.",
      "",
      "This is a big upgrade on Arsenal’s previous No.6, with Zubimendi bringing a calming presence and outstanding levels of consistency to Mikel Arteta’s midfield. He might not reach Rodri’s level, but he can reach Rodri levels of influence on this Gunners side.",
      "His first three games against Manchester United, Leeds and Liverpool have shown promise, and the fact Zubimendi will help Martin Odegaard get back to his best, while Declan Rice continues to be an attacking threat, makes him a priceless addition.",
      "",
      "A lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. It’s already started.",
      "Wirtz’s start hasn’t been the best, but he’s allowed a settling-in period, even if his transfer fee was a club-record signing.",
      "When the German does settle into his Liverpool role, we’re expecting him to be one of the best attacking midfielders in the league, if not the best. He’s one of the main reasons the Reds are the biggest winners of the window.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "",
      "Nico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality. He’s more of an Ilkay Gundogan successor.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside to this deal.",
      "",
      "The saga to end all sagas. We’re delighted it’s over, and pretty surprised it took until Deadline Day for it to be finalised.",
      "Isak cost Liverpool a British record £135m and while new team-mates surround him, the settling-in period is probably limited to one or two games, having broke that record, and come from another Premier League team. For Newcastle, the Swede scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances. He’s joined the champions and a team that wants to attack, attack, attack, so we can see Isak joining the 100 Club before or during 2027/28.",
      "There is a lot of pressure, especially considering how Isak manufactured his move to Anfield. We’re fairly confident he’ll be just fine, and his addition makes Arne Slot’s side the favourites for every competition they’re in this season.",
      "READ NEXT: The most expensive XI in Premier League history passes £1bn after Liverpool finally spend Coutinho money",

      "Did Florian Wirtz look like a British record transfer player as Liverpool played Newcastle? Plus, Unai Emery sack chat.",
      "Wirtz’s bow, the start of Chelsea’s title challenge and Sesko v Gyokeres before calls for Arteta’s sacking. The Premier League is back and we could not be more giddy…",
      "Arne Slot said Liverpool’s huge moves in the transfer window this summer have been justified by player sales, suggesting the club has done nothing new.",

      "Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “world-class” dream team at Manchester United are making mistakes as their “very poor” recruitment continues…",
      "",
      "Was the summer transfer window positive for Man Utd? It’s certainly debatable, but we’re leaning towards yes. Just about.",
      "Did United sign the wrong goalkeeper on deadline day? Probably, but at least the late arrival of Senne Lammens means the days of Andre Onana and/or Alter Bayindir starting regularly for the Premier League giants are over.",
      "They have also overhauled their attack with the additions of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for around £200m combined, with the early indications that the latter two should be relatively successful at Old Trafford, while we’re unsold on their £74m man.",
      "And perhaps most importantly, all but one member of the back seat on the school bus crew left the club, with only Tyrell Malacia remaining following the summer exits of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "So not too bad overall, though the continuation of last season’s misery under Ruben Amorim in the early weeks of this campaign suggests they are still miles off the leading pack and have no chance of meeting Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s set target of winning the Premier League by 2028.",
      "To put Man Utd on track to achieve this aim, Ratcliffe has been a busy man as he’s alienated himself to the point where he’s rivalling the Glaser family in terms of unpopularity at Old Trafford following several brutal and/or needless decisions, notably the so-called implementation of a “world-class” recruitment team after years of “very poor” transfer business.",
      "Ratcliffe is right in saying that Man Utd’s recruitment, overall, has been extremely dour post-Sir Alex-Ferguson, though he and his supposed dream team of experts, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, are far from perfect.",
      "This has been exposed in The Athletic‘s annual exposé of Man Utd’s business via their ‘inside the transfer window’, which has revealed a couple of gems from this summer.",
      "Firstly, we have Wilcox’s verdict on Man Utd’s top priority for the summer window.",
      "‘The choice at that stage was to go for a No 6 or a No 9. Some at the club believe a midfielder should have been the priority, but Wilcox advocated to sign a scorer, after United’s record of 44 Premier League goals last campaign, and Ratcliffe backed that call.’",
      "There is a semblance of logic to Wilcox’s stance, with the lack of goal threat needing to be addressed after Man Utd became especially toothless in attack following the implementation of Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "But as poor as Joshua Zirkzee and especially Rasmus Hojlund were last season, a contributing factor to their woes was the absence of a creative spark in Man Utd’s side to forge chances.",
      "The arrivals of Mbeumo and Cunha ease this issue, and while an upgrade in the No.9 position was needed, it was a mistake to spend £200m on attackers and completely ignore the No.6 department, which is equally in need of fixing.",
      "Carlos Baleba would have been the perfect solution and he could still prove to be that in January or next summer, though United’s period of punishment is to continue as long as they are without a selfless protector and well-rounded midfield partnership.",
      "Further forward, the return of a proven Premier League striker to take some of the pressure off Sesko, Hojlund and/or Zirkzee, but Ratcliffe wasn’t playing ball.",
      "‘Ratcliffe was known to feel United could not sanction a two-year deal for [Danny Welbeck], who is 35 in November, and instead a one plus one was discussed, but the offer was not formalised.’",
      "Sesko, like Hojlund, could easily end up faltering amid the overwhelming pressure of carrying Man Utd’s frontline from a young age, but his chances of succeeding would be greater if there were a Welbeck-type player for him to lean on for support.",
      "Welbeck would have been a cheap and risk-free signing as he’s been the model professional throughout his career, and his recent renaissance suggests he is still capable of delivering on and off the pitch for United.",

      "The right-back’s January arrival was somewhat overshadowed by Villa’s flashier winter loan moves, but with his path to the first team blocked by Matty Cash there was plenty of talk in the summer about some pretty eye-catching teams across the continent weighing up moves that never materialised for a man whose main chances of Villa action will likely be restricted to Europa League and domestic cup competitions.",
      "We don’t imagine he’s heartbroken to still be at Villa, but with Sevilla, Real Betis and top-flight clubs in both Germany and Italy interested it would be surprising if his head hadn’t been at least slightly turned by the prospect of more regular football in some of those places.",

And on Guehi’s part, the disappointment should be tempered by knowing he’s been a model pro who gave his all for Palace until the very end – something, ultimately, not even Eberechi Eze was prepared to do – and there will be no humiliating and difficult reintegration process to be completed here.",

      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund ‘considers himself better’ than summer signing Benjamin Sesko after signing for Napoli on loan, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils chose to sign a new striker over a midfielder in the final month of the transfer market with Sesko arriving from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m.",
      "Hojlund joined his boyhood club Man Utd in 2023 for £72m from Serie A side Atalanta but he failed to hit the ground running at Old Trafford.",
      "The Denmark international managed a very respectable 10 Premier League goals in 30 appearances in his first season but the 22-year-old could only manage four goals in 31 matches last term.",
      "Hojlund was linked all summer with a move away from Old Trafford and he pushed back on leaving during the transfer window as he looked to remain at Man Utd.",
      "He told reporters during pre-season: “My plan is very clear. That is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.",
      "READ: Villa and Newcastle among transfer window losers as idea of a Big Eight suffers fatal blow",
      "“Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I’m more than ready. I’m feeling sharp so I welcome everything that comes.”",
      "Hojlund added: “When I came, [Anthony] Martial was there as well but he had a lot of injuries, so I obviously had to take a lot of the game time",
      "“You’re not going to tell me I shouldn’t be playing because I want to play every game. But obviously I could have done with some help in terms of sharing the games a bit, especially in the beginning.”",
      "Hojlund continued to plead his case for staying at Man Utd, he said: “I’m still very young. People forget that sometimes. I’m only 22. Not every striker scores 100 goals by that age.",
      "“But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see it in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "“Last season was tough on us all. I should have done better, everybody knows.",
      "“But it’s also a team thing. We’re going to be better now. We are progressing in the right way and looking forward to what’s coming.”",
      "Napoli eventually agreed a loan move for Hojlund with the Danish striker staying until the end of the season and Man Utd included a  €44m buy option which will turn into an obligation if the Serie A side qualify for the Champions League.",
      "And now The Athletic have revealed that one of the reasons he was looking to stay and fight for his place was his belief that he is better than new signing Sesko.",
      "The Athletic wrote: ‘Part of Hojlund’s motivation, it can be revealed, was that he considers himself better than the centre-forward United have agreed to pay €85million for. He felt showing that in sessions might give Amorim pause for thought on his departure, despite Sesko’s arrival.’",
      "The potential end of his time at Old Trafford has been a sad time for Hojlund, the report added: ‘Hojlund was said to be heartbroken over the realisation his Old Trafford dream was over aged 22, especially when he started pre-season expecting to continue. The episode demonstrates how Ratcliffe, Berrada, Wilcox and Amorim are operating without sentiment.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United had a last-minute ‘approach’ for a former Chelsea star ‘rejected’ on deadline day for one key reason.",
      "Manchester United’s current woes are being left at the feet of pretty much everyone. Can this all be Ruben Amorim’s fault?",
      "Only Andre Onana was rated lower than the £74m signing who waited until the very end to take his penalty in the shootout.",
      "Manchester United losing to Grimsby has prompted all manner of responses, but most want Ruben Amorim out of the club.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund is likely to move to Serie A giants Napoli ‘within 48 hours’ in a loan with an option to buy, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, England international Kobbie Mainoo has made a decision on leaving Manchester United after being snubbed by Ruben Amorim."

      "Thursday 4 September 2025 08:37, UK",
      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on Deadline day.",
      "There were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",

      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",

      "Premier League clubs spent a record £3.19bn in the summer window; Liverpool and Chelsea broke spending and selling records; clubs targeted Premier League-ready signings; Sunderland had a net spend twice as high as European champions Paris Saint-Germain",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",

      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",

      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 16:02, UK",
      "",
      "Premier League clubs spent more than £3bn on new signings in total, shattering the previous record of £2.44bn set in 2023.",
      "Clubs also set a record for the amount of money recouped from player sales at £1.8bn. The buying and selling added up to an all-time-high net spend of £1.2bn.",
      "Liverpool spent the most at a record-breaking £446.5m but Arsenal had the highest net spend at £257m, followed by Liverpool at £218.4m, then Spurs and Manchester United.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Bournemouth emerged from the window £65.8m in the black after selling a raft of star players, including defenders Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Isak was the most expensive signing of the window at a British-record £125m, followed by Florian Wirtz at £116.5m, while Hugo Ekitike (£79m, Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool), Benjamin Sesko (£73.7m, RB Leipzig to Man Utd), and Bryan Mbeumo (£71m, Brentford to Man Utd) also made big-money moves.Adam Smith",
      "It seemed top-level football's evolution was leaving the traditional striker behind as recently as a few years ago. This summer's transfer window underlines how quickly the game can change. Reports of the death of the No 9 have been greatly exaggerated.",
      "In a record-breaking summer, spending by Premier League clubs on forwards vastly outweighed other positions. The rush to add firepower was led by the elite clubs. Manchester City were the only member of the so-called big six not to sign a striker having started the resurgence with Erling Haaland.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £200m on Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike. Chelsea invested £90m in Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. Arsenal and Manchester United went for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko at £63.5m and £73.7m respectively. Spurs struck a late loan deal to sign Randal Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Newcastle finally sanctioned the departure of Isak to Liverpool as they completed the £55m signing of Yoane Wissa from Brentford having already brought in Nick Woltemade for £69m from Stuttgart.",
      "Further down the league, Wolves kept Jorgen Strand Larsen and added another target man in Tolu Arokodare from Genk for £23.4m. Brighton spent £31.4m on Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos, while Nottingham Forest and Everton spent similar sums on Arnaud Kalimeundo and Thierno Barry.",
      "The No 9 is back in fashion.Nick Wright",
      "It was the summer of striker statements, Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both speaking out - one of them in the hope of leaving Newcastle United and the other in the hope of joining. Ultimately, both got their wish, reminding us all that player power still exists.",
      "\"I believe the club are unduly standing in my way,\" announced Wissa of Brentford's stance. \"When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship cannot continue,\" argued Isak. Newcastle were quick to respond that no promise had ever been made.",
      "There are those who would gladly have refused Isak his move to Liverpool and allowed the Swede to sit out his contract, effectively putting his career on hold. The logic goes that this would have sent out a strong message that Newcastle could not be bullied.",
      "Given the vast resources of the Saudi owners, this would have been an option. But profit and sustainability rules mean that while they could afford it, they could not afford to have their budgets slashed, damaging the ability of the club to compete as it might.",
      "And so, player power endures. With that in mind, spare a thought for Jorgen Strand Larsen, the Wolves striker wanted by Newcastle who was not able to get his move. \"I know him very well,\" said Vitor Pereira, the Wolves boss. \"He will never force [a move].\"",
      "The result is that while Strand Larsen faces what looks likely to be a relegation battle, Wissa is preparing to take on Barcelona in the Champions League. The actions of those players who withhold their labour might be distasteful. But they can certainly pay off.Adam Bate",
      "The Premier League clubs outside the traditional top six recognise they are unable to compete with the financial power of those in it. They know they have to be smart in their recruitment to find an edge.",
      "Brentford and Brighton are probably the most prominent examples of how to succeed in that respect - to punch above their weight and, later down the line, make a handsome profit.",
      "So-called bigger clubs had already cottoned on to this approach - but this summer, there have been major raids, from clubs both at home and abroad.",
      "Bournemouth's defence was gutted to the tune of almost £150m as Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi were poached by Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Brentford's dynamic duo of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa were sold for over £120m. Premier League clubs are increasingly buying from rivals.",
      "Brighton sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, Crystal Palace let Eberechi Eze go to Arsenal for £67.5m and Wolves made £95.8m selling Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively.",
      "The buying clubs have the financial clout to be able to be reactive, but many of these moves hardly came as a surprise to the selling clubs, so succession plans will have been in place, funds wisely reinvested.",
      "And as long as the smart recruitment continues, the cycle will go on.Dan Long",

      "Given that three Everton players were among the scorers at Molineux, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall picking up an assist to go along with his fine goal, some might be surprised to see Jack Grealish named player of the match again but he just stands out.",
      "He assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.",
      "But it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.",
      "Asked about Grealish's improvement, David Moyes said: \"Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.\" He added: \"The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.\"Adam Bate",
      "But Liam Delap's injury will undoubtedly sour the mood at Stamford Bridge in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against Fulham.",
      "Enzo Maresca confirmed the striker would be sidelined for weeks after limping off in the first half with a hamstring problem - and now they must navigate a difficult return to the squad for Nicolas Jackson.",
      "The player was in Germany to complete that move and will now need to come to terms with returning to west London, after his head coach had previously sanctioned his exit.",
      "The start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.",
      "Difficult games against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton are on the horizon in the Premier League. Not to mention the first Champions League game of the season against Bayern Munich on September 17, too.",
      "Jackson will likely be playing at the Allianz Arena in the near future - but he'll be wearing blue not red.Patrick Rowe",
      "Amid clear challenges for Manchester United, one name stands out as a potential beacon of light: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "He was consistently brilliant for Brentford and has wasted no time in slotting in perfectly in Ruben Amorim's formation. Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.",
      "For a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.",
      "His ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.",
      "United have been in search of a player who can bring more dynamic attacking options to the table and in Mbeumo they may just have found him.Lewis Jones",
      "This 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth was a reality check for Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank.",
      "After the highs of winning at Manchester City, Spurs put in a dreadful display against Bournemouth that has punctured the air of optimism under the Dane, with the full-time whistle met by boos.",
      "One fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.",
      "Those wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.",
      "On the day Spurs found out their fixture dates for the Champions League, you would have thought Bournemouth were the team to be facing Villarreal at home on September 16, such was the dominance and slickness in their display.",

      "How Frank could have done with his new £51m signing Xavi Simons on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Frank said of Simons at his post-match press conference: \"Sometimes you need a player that can do something a little bit out of nothing, go past a player, produce a cross, a shot, a pass, with that extra quality that you need on the day, and that's what I think he can bring.\"",
      "Spurs will desperately be hoping the Netherlands international can add some sparkle and guile, because the boos will only get louder if Tottenham put in more performances like this.Declan Olley",
      "It would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.",
      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
