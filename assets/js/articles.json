      "Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho has been told to shut his mouth and \"get on with it\" by England icon Chris Waddle. Garnacho has endured a turbulent period at United in recent times.",
      "A chequered pattern of behavioural issues with former boss Erik ten Hag has been swiftly followed by periods out of the team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Waddle has hinted that Garnacho, 20, might not yet be as good as he thinks he is, suggesting even a change of clubs may not iron out the issues plaguing the forward. The Newcastle United legend argued that despite his potential, Garnacho should put his head down and focus squarely on his football as rumours swirl about a possible departure from Old Trafford.",
      "\"I was surprised they left him out of the Europa League final because I think attacking Tottenham is the best way of getting results,\" Waddle, 64, told online-casinos.com.",
      "\"And it looked like they were a little bit cagey. The formation United played. It was lacking in the creativity and directness you want.",
      "\"And when Garnacho came on, he looked very lively. But I don't know, modern players, I don't know if they get ahead of themselves. Instead of playing their football and keeping their emotions in check, they set themselves up for problems. They ask in public why they aren't playing.\"",
      "He continued: \"Garnacho might look good in training, and maybe Ruben Amorim would want to pick him, but he doesn't. Garnacho talks like he's got a million games under his belt.",
      "\"We know he's a talented football player, but I think players at his age need to get their heads down, and if they're on the bench, well, that's a sign they need to improve to convince the manager. Just shut your mouth, get on with it.",
      "\"He's a young player with a lot of years ahead of him, and if a manager thinks you need pulling off, you accept it. He talks like he's a senior player in his late 20s, but right now he's still learning. There's talk of him going to Italy – let's see how that goes for him.\"",
      "Garnacho has been linked with Chelsea and Italian side Napoli, who made a bid for the player during the January transfer window. Saudi Pro League team Al-Nassr are also reportedly monitoring Garnacho as a potential alternative to Liverpool's Luis Diaz.",
      "However, the player himself has confirmed that he is currently in Italy. He posted a photo of himself outside the Colosseum in Rome, sparking rumours that he could be eyeing a move to Serie A.",
      "Garnacho has netted 26 goals in 144 appearances for United. Nonetheless, if he decides to part ways with United, he still has some time to secure his next move as the summer transfer window will briefly close on June 10, before reopening from June 16 until September 1."

      "Ex-Premier League referee Uriah Rennie is remembered not just for breaking racial barriers in English football, but for his presence, poise and occasional physical authority during high-stakes matches. The trailblazing official, who died aged 65 on Sunday, was once forced to step in to physically restrain Roy Keane during a heated clash between Manchester United and Sunderland in August 2002.",
      "The fixture turned volatile when Keane, under intense scrutiny following his explosive World Cup walk-out that summer, got into a fiery confrontation with Ireland team-mate Jason McAteer.",
      "Throughout the match, the pair had been dishing out tough tackles and verbal jabs, with Liverpool-born McAteer mocking Keane's newly released autobiography.",
      "Tempers flared quickly, and soon the situation threatened to spiral out of control. Spotting \"fury\" in Keane's eyes after a coming together between the players, Rennie stepped in to calm him down. A martial arts expert, the referee didn't hesitate, earning a degree of respect from the notoriously hard-to-please United skipper in the process.",
      "In his 2022 book Your Show, a novelisation of his refereeing career, Rennie recalled the tense moment with vivid detail. \"They both tumble onto the turf. Limbs flailing. Elbows and knees,\" he wrote. \"Roy's reacting now, fury in his eyes, head's gone. This feud has history... grab Roy, save Jason?\"",
      "Rennie's instincts then took over. \"Only a moment to think. You take matters in your own giant black hands with a cliff-edged ­fearlessness. You get in between the two. You do what you have to do, to stop it escalating, from turning into a 20-man mass brawl,\" he explained. \"You grab Roy, grip onto his shirt like you did a few ­seasons ago at White Hart Lane, but tighter.\"",
      "His intervention was effective. Keane, visibly seething, was separated from McAteer. Both players, in their own way, acknowledged the impact – McAteer later admitted that Keane would have \"ripped his head off\" if Rennie hadn't come between them. Keane, though never one to show deference, seemed to develop a level of respect for the referee's fearless handling of the moment.",
      "However, just minutes later, Keane lashed out again – this time catching McAteer with a sharp elbow to the back of the head. Rennie immediately issued a red card – a decision so clear-cut that even Sir Alex Ferguson didn't contest it.",
      "\"The referee had no choice but to send him off,\" the legendary United manager said after the game. \"Roy is the first United player to be sent off for this offence and I have said recently the use of the elbow is a growing problem in our game.\" He later confirmed that the club would not appeal the decision and had fined Keane £150,000.",
      "Rennie admitted his handling of the situation went beyond standard procedure: \"I didn't follow FA protocol,\" he wrote. \"You throw away the rule book and intervene early with action, words won’t do, stopping Keane from doing something he shouldn't.",
      "\"You stare Keane dead in the eyes, still clutching a fistful of his shirt... messy Irish ­history. Messy World Cup history. Keane is fiddling with his captain's armband as you ­reason with him. He's only half listening, facing you but eyeing up the Sunderland player who has retreated behind you to safety. Although he might not be showing it now, maybe in his own way, he respects you.\"",
      "Despite being sent off, Keane remained unapologetic. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast in 2023, he insisted McAteer \"deserved\" the elbow and that the two were \"absolutely not\" on speaking terms. \"He was one of those players who couldn't stop running their mouths,\" Keane said. \"I didn't mind lads kicking me or booting me but McAteer as usual had plenty to say for himself.\"",
      "McAteer, who had also played for Liverpool, Bolton, and Blackburn, later described their relationship as \"toxic.\" He didn't hold back in his own assessment, calling Keane a \"clown\" and telling him to \"bore off.\""

      "But it appears that a move to Serie A is no longer an option according to reports. According to suggestions in Italy, United’s demands of a permanent Deal have made a move very difficult.",
      "It is reported that United want to receive around £40m for the 22-year-old, a deal that the Italian sides would struggle to put together. They would only be able to sign him on loan as it stands.",
      "Hojlund has recently spoken out on his future at Old Trafford and confirmed that he was looking to stay with the club. He said: “I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.",

      "In all, Hojlund has made 95 appearances for United since his £72m move from Atalanta. In that time, he has scored just 26 goals. Former Red Devils star Phil Jones has suggested that a move away from the club might be best for his career.",
      "He said: \"It’s a difficult one, I feel really sorry for him (Hojlund). It's obviously been a difficult season for him, but I always find it's difficult for a No. 9 in a difficult season.",

Meanwhile, Donnarumma’s agent Enzo Raiola has already denied that talks have been held with Serie A champions Napoli, who were also credited with an interest.",

      "\"He has [Pablo] Zabaleta and [Aleksandar] Kolarov - two very good players but more than 30 years old. He wants to replace, he doesn't replace with two, he replaces with three.",
      "\"One from Tottenham (Kyle Walker), one from Monaco (Benjamin Mendy) and one from Real Madrid (Danilo) as an example. Can we buy six or seven players at the same time? Can we invest £600-700m? No. So, it's difficult.",
      "\"I think the last years, the market is going in such a direction or you belong to one of these clubs where there is no limit and you just buy what you want and there is no limit, there is no financial fair play, there is nothing, you do what you want - or it's hard.\"",
      "Now, clubs are bound by financial restrictions, which means expensive signings are generally coupled with sales. That is sure to be the case at United this summer. Still, it’s unlikely Mourinho, whose win ratio was only marginally lower than Sir Alex Ferguson’s when he was sacked in December 2018, would approve of United’s current transfer strategy."

      "Manchester United face the prospect of missing out on Victor Osimhen and Moise Kean as they look to land a new striker this summer, but still face several hurdles.",
      "Adding more firepower is a priority for Ruben Amorim, who has not been able to rely on Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund - who is on Inter Milan's radar. Osimhen has previously been linked with a switch to the Premier League and continued to score goals for Galatasaray last year.",
      "He moved to Turkey on loan with Napoli deeming him surplus to requirements. An exit from the Italian champions is expected and after rejecting Al-Hilal a move back to Turkish soil with Galatasaray had been seen as his likely destination - only for Osimhen to seemingly now decide he WILL take the Saudi money after all.",
      "As such, he's expected to link up with Simone Inzaghi and his new side imminently, making him eligible to play in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "It appears as if Kean, now at Fiorentina, also has reservations over a possible move to Manchester. Despite his future in Florence being unclear he's not sold on the idea of heading to United after proving himself with 25 goals last term. There is a release clause in his contract which means he could head elsewhere for €52million (£43.8m), but Fiorentina are in negotiations to retain him. Tuttomercatoweb claim that United are the team who have consistently shown an interest in Kean.",
      "However the Red Devils failed to qualify for any European competition whilst Fiorentina are in the Europa Conference League for the fourth season in a row. A switch to Manchester would also not guarantee him regular playing time, which has proved crucial this term after several underwhelming spells elsewhere, including Everton.",
      "United have already landed Matheus Cunha, who proved to be a big hit at Wolves. He set the club back £62.5m but is not a No 9 who can lead the line and Amorim has just missed out on Liam Delap, who opted for Chelsea.",
      "It means a move for Viktor Gyokeres could be back on. The Sporting Lisbon frontman had been linked with a Manchester move given his connection with Amorim but looked to be apprehensive after they missed out on the Champions League.",
      "That stance appears to have softened and the Swede would be open to the move. He is likely to cost £60m, which is less than his release clause. Gyokeres has proved that he can regularly supply goals and his signing would be a major coup for the Red Devils.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Jadon Sancho's goal in the Europa Conference League final was not enough to convince Chelsea he was worth £25million plus his not inconsiderable salary. Despite ending his time at Stamford Bridge with a European trophy, the 25-year-old was sent back to Manchester United by Enzo Maresca's side.",
      "When the Blues loaned Sancho from the Red Devils last summer, they did so on the premise that they would pay £25m to sign him permanently at the end of the campaign. When the deal was made, the only way Chelsea could renege on that deal was if they finished lower than 14th, or pay a £5m penalty clause to get out of the deal.",
      "After finishing fourth and winning the Conference League, Chelsea opted to pay the £5m to send Sancho back from whence he came. Now the Blues have been linked with other wide midfielders such as Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens, Nico Williams of Athletic Bilbao and, ironically, Sancho's United team-mate Alejandro Garnacho, who has seemingly been banished by Ruben Amorim in the same way as Sancho was by Erik ten Hag.",
      "After the Conference League triumph, Maresca appeared to state that he wanted the winger to remain at Stamford Bridge. He said: \"We are going to sit with the club and decide what happens for next year.",
      "\"He's come here and got his career back on track. I still think there is more to come from him; I really do.\"",
      "Chelsea backed out of the deal, as Sancho would not compromise on the £300,000 per-week salary he earns at United. Such a wage would see Sancho earn more than £250k-a-week Chelsea captain Reece James (£250,000 per-week) and more than twice as much as midfield talisman Cole Palmer, who is understood to be on around £130,000 per-week.",
      "When Sancho's exit was confirmed, the former England international took to social media and wrote: \"Grateful for the experience. Big love to everyone at Chelsea who made me feel at home - teammates, staff and the fans. Wishing the club all the best moving forward. Truly grateful.\"",
      "As long as Sancho insists on his £300,000 per-week salary, potential suitors will likely be hard to come by. United's £62.5m capture of Matheus Cunha and the potential £55m arrival of Bryan Mbeumo pushes Sancho even further down the pecking order.",
      "In May, Bundesliga giants Bayer Leverkusen were reportedly willing to make an offer to United for Sancho. Unfortunately for the ex-Borussia Dortmund ace, Ten Hag's arrival will surely all but block any route to the BayArena.",
      "Sancho's contract at Old Trafford expires June 30 2026. This summer represents United's best opportunity to cash in on his services, even though there is next to no chance that they will recoup the £73m they paid to Dortmund in the summer of 2021.",
      "If a permanent move maintaining his salary is not possible this year, Sancho's next best option could be another loan spell, having already spent six months at Dortmund and a year at Stamford Bridge.",
      "However, with United looking to bolster their forward line, they will surely prefer a permanent transfer which guarantees them a fee and gets rid of Sancho from their wage-bill. It's another difficult situation for the ex-Manchester City academy star, who was tipped for great things when he first started catching the eye at Dortmund as a teenager, but whose career arguably hasn't reached the heights that many thought it would.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "“I want to play, but Viktor is a really cool guy and I feel really good with him. Now he has to try something new too. He has already proved everything he has to prove in the league. He has proved that he needs to be at a higher level, so maybe it is time to do that.”",

      "United made a flying start to the window, confirming the signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha just 14 hours after the shutters had been lifted. He has agreed to sign a five-year deal subject to him obtaining a visa and registration.",
      "He is United's only new recruit so far this summer, but the club is working on a deal to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They saw an opening offer of £55million knocked back for the Cameroonian last week.",

      "Unless the situation develops at 100mph, United are highly unlikely to add Mbeumo to their ranks ahead of Tuesday night's 7pm deadline. However, the fact the window will open again as soon as next Monday (June 16) means that not too much time will be lost.",
      "As far as outgoings are concerned, United have confirmed Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and Christian Eriksen will leave Old Trafford when their contracts expire on June 30.",
      "United want to be proactive in the seller's market this summer and want to offload the likes of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony. It is important the club generates funds to bring in new arrivals.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has already outlined his preference of having a left-footed player in the right-sided No.10 position amid the club's pursuit of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United are determined to sign the Cameroon international to bolster their attack and they saw an opening offer worth £55million turned down last week. It is understood they will submit a new and improved offer for the 25-year-old.",
      "Mbeumo was one of the stars of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, netting 20 goals and registering seven assists. Only Liverpool ace Mohamed Salah (47) and Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak (29) were directly involved in more goals.",
      "Having already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves to strengthen their attacking options, United's pursuit of Mbeumo highlights their desire to recruit players who have a proven track record in the Premier League. Cunha scored 15 league goals himself this term.",
      "With Cunha expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position, Mbeumo, if signed, is expected to operate from the right-sided No.10 position. United still want a centre-forward to spearhead the attack and operate between them.",
      "Despite Amad's effectiveness from the right-sided No.10 position in the second half of the season, he has also demonstrated that he is effective from the right wing-back berth.",
      "However, Mbeumo, in terms of being a goalscorer, is an upgrade. He has scored 38 Premier League goals over the last three seasons, with this season's return of 20 his best in the top flight in a single campaign.",
      "Taking his goalscoring record and his profile as a left-footed player into account, he is perfect for Amorim, who admitted ahead of United's 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United at Old Trafford back in December that he wants to operate with a left-footed player on the right of the attack, after making the decision to move Amad further forward.",
      "\"I try to reinforce the team with the idea and try to use the characteristics of the players.\"",
      "With that in mind, Amorim's admission about Amad being a suitable fit for the right wing-back berth in the future could pave the way for him and Mbeumo to form a solid partnership down the right.",
      "Mbeumo is a multi-functional operator, capable of playing out wide or through the middle, meaning he would tick a lot of boxes for United. He could also be asked to operate as a No.9.",
      "Taking Amorim's admissions about wanting a left footer in the right-sided No.10 role and Amad being a long-term option for the right wing-back spot, it is highly likely they could join forces down United's right flank. It would be an exciting combination."

      "The summer transfer window has only been open for just over a week and already Manchester United have had to change course.",
      "After identifying Liam Delap as their top target to strengthen their attacking options, members of United's hierarchy must have breathed a collective sigh when they learnt of the England Under-21 international's decision to move to Chelsea.",
      "Delap, who scored 12 Premier League goals in his first and only season at Ipswich Town, was available via a £30million release clause, making him an attainable target. He held talks with a cluster of suitors, including United.",
      "As frustrating as it can be for a club to have their transfer blueprint shredded, the good news is that Delap has made his move to Stamford Bridge right at the very start of the summer, leaving United with plenty of time to explore alternative avenues.",
      "Furthermore, is missing out on Delap as big a 'blow' as some may claim it to be? He has just one season of top flight football under his belt and is still incredibly raw at the age of 22.",
      "After gambling on potential in 2023 with Rasmus Hojlund and again last summer with Joshua Zirkzee, United can ill-afford to take another risk on a striker this summer. They need a proven goalscorer who can come in and hit the ground running.",
      "Right now, a handful of names are frequently cropping up on repeat. The strikers in question are Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David.",
      "Of the Premier League's elite, United, Arsenal and Liverpool are the only three in desperate need of an out-and-out striker this summer now that Chelsea have signed Delap.",
      "Arsenal are prioritising a move for former United target and RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The Slovakian netted 21 goals in Germany this season and he has emerged as the Gunners' preferred target to bolster the tip of their attack.",
      "Liverpool have loosely been linked with a crop of forwards, but their current priorities are to wrap up the signings of Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez and Bayer Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz.",
      "Meanwhile, despite Osimhen's move to Al-Hilal being on, off, on again and then finally off, Galatasaray are set to try their luck to re-sign the striker permanently after his productive loan spell in Turkey this season.",
      "With Arsenal, who have also been heavily linked with Gyokeres, occupied chasing Sesko, Osimhen at the centre of a saga and David being eyed by the likes of Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, Gyokeres is shaping up to be the most accessible striker for United to chase.",
      "As soon as Ruben Amorim swapped Sporting for United last November, links connecting the Swede with Old Trafford were inevitable. Naturally, they have been persistent for months.",
      "But at a time where United desperately need a reliable goalscorer, there is a feeling developing that it may be inevitable the 27-year-old follows in in Amorim's footsteps.",
      "It is widely reported he will be available for a fee in the region of £60m this summer, which feels relatively respectable for a player that has plundered a whopping 97 goals in the last two seasons.",
      "He joined Sporting in July 2023 on the back of a prolific season with Coventry City. He was the best striker in England outside the Premier League in 2022/23 and he was linked with various Premier League clubs.",
      "However, after his agent had held talks with Amorim, it was decided Sporting was the best destination for Gyokeres to take the next step in his career. That theory has been reflected in his tally of 97 goals in 102 games.",
      "Fast, strong, aggressive and an excellent striker of the ball, Gyokeres ticks a lot of boxes. His goalscoring record in the last couple of years, for both club and country, has been astonishing and every striker ought to be judged on their record in front of goal.",
      "If United are to fulfil their mission of signing a prolific goalscorer this summer, they have no choice but to loosen the purse strings. They have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and a similar fee could soon be spent on Bryan Mbeumo, meaning sales will be key to funding any further new arrivals.",
      "However, failing to recruit a No.9 this summer is a non-negotiable. With Arsenal focusing on Sesko, Al-Hilal desperate to sign Osimhen and Liverpool currently focusing on other priorities, United might have a clear run at trying to attain a striker Amorim knows inside out."

      "Ruben Amorim is being backed by the club, with Matheus Cunha completing a £62.5 million move from Wolves to Old Trafford. United are also pushing to sign Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, having seen their first bid for the player knocked back by the Bees.",
      "There has been a lot of talk over several different names who could still arrive at United before the September 1 deadline. Viktor Gyokeres has been linked with a reunion with Amorim, with the two having worked together at Sporting.",
      "As well as incomings, there’s several players who could be on the move over the next few weeks. Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are just three players who could leave.",
      "It’s set to be a busy few weeks as United prepare for the new 2025/26 Premier League season. But what should United’s next priority be in the summer window? MEN Sport writers have had their say:",
      "Presuming the transfer for Mbeumo goes through, I think concentration should go on outgoings. Sorting the futures of the likes of Rashford, Garnacho and Antony will both raise funds for more incomings, but also give more certainty.",
      "In an ideal world, players who are likely to move on will be sold before the squad returns to pre-season, that way, players there know that they will be part of plans for the new campaign.",
      "Looking at incomings, one deal that I think United should look at doing is Jonathan David. Latest reports suggest that the striker is open to a move to the club. The 25-year-old scored 16 goals in 32 Ligue 1 appearances last season",
      "He is available on a free transfer with the expiry of his contract at the end of this month, meaning that funds could then be directed towards other areas of the squad.",
      "Should the proposed move for Mbeumo go through, United need to look at getting players out the door. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are the first three that must be sold to ensure United can further strengthen in the summer transfer window.",
      "In an ideal world, United could generate at least £100million, if not more, for the aforementioned trio. Although, at this stage, it could prove to be difficult to get a permanent transfer for each of them, just ensuring they are off the books to free up wage space would be the minimum.",
      "If United can do that, they should then target a No.9 to be their next incoming. It feels as though Ruben Amorim doesn't think Rasmus Hojlund is the long-term solution, meaning United are going to need to dip into the market for a centre forward. I think Viktor Gyokeres is the man United should get next.",
      "While he hasn't got the Premier League experience, he has the potential to be a prolific goalscorer in the top flight and I think United should take the £60m gamble on him.",
      "Inter considering moving for Rasmus Hojlund only means signing a striker is increasingly the priority for United this summer. After already missing out on Liam Delap and with Victor Osimhen seemingly joining the former Inter head coach, Simeone Inzaghi, at Al-Hilal, options available on the market are already depleting.",
      "Arsenal seemingly prioritise signing Benjamin Sesko, while Chelsea is also reputedly another centre-forward. Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres also appear on the move for the right price.",
      "However, after already committing to spending £62.5million on Matheus Cunha and potentially around as much on Bryan Mbeumo after already bidding £55million, it is hard to see United being able to afford another such significant outlay. Somebody like Aleksandar Mitrovic is an option I can see the club turning to.",
      "TalkSPORT have claimed United are considering a move, with Al-Hilal said to be willing to loan the player out this summer. Their prospective signing of Osimhen suggests Mitrovic has an uncertain future in Riyadh, and with the player reputedly willing to take a pay cut, a temporary move for the 31-year-old could suit all parties.",
      "There is yet more strife over United's hunt for attackers amid new uncertainty over Mbeumo. Reports elsewhere are beginning to say Tottenham Hotspur, if appointing Thomas Frank as their new manager, will be set for an attempt to reunite player and coach. They have Champions League football on offer, as we do not need reminding, and that could prove a deciding factor.",
      "If that situation were to develop in such a way then realistically, what can United do? It would be out of their control but what they can then sort is the arrival of a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is the dream in my eyes - he's tried and trusted in the Amorim system, he's also scored 97 goals in 102 Sporting appearances so there is no one deadlier right now. Questions may be asked over whether this can translate into the Premier League but I am confident.",
      "The club have received a big boost with Arsenal diverting their full attention to signing Benjamin Sesko instead, leaving Gyokeres' next club to be confirmed.",
      "If the Mbeumo deal is completed, United should be looking at raising some much-needed funds as their next port of call. The Reds have a host of wingers who they do not have use for and can drum up money for Amorim's rebuild.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford are arguably the priorities due to their high transfer values. However, Antony and Jadon Sancho could both be good players to move on next especially with the former's stock high.",
      "Once that is done, United can take stock and look at whether they can go all out for Viktor Gyokeres or Victor Osimhen. Arsenal's current focus on Benjamin Sesko could be their undoing if United can make their sales and take the lead in negotiations with Gyokeres but they will need to work quickly on outgoings first."

      "They are also targeting signings in the two attacking midfield roles of Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and have agreed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "United are also keen to wrap up the signing of Bryan Mbeumo too, with the pair scoring a combined 37 goals this season.",
      "The Reds are also said to be keen to sign a new midfielder and a new wing-back but there are many United fans who feel as if they should be looking to strengthen their goalkeeping department.",
      "Andre Onana has failed to convince during his first two seasons at United following his £47million move from Inter Milan in 2023.",
      "He made an unconvincing start, recovered to end last season and start this season well, but mistakes have crept back into his game in recent months.",
      "It is likely he will remain United's number one this summer but there is an argument to be made that after two seasons the jury should be out on whether he is good enough to keep goal for United.",
      "And if reports in Italy are to be believed and Chelsea are close to agreeing an £18million package to sign AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, there may be some who question why United aren't shopping in that market at that price.",
      "The 29-year-old has proven himself to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world since moving to Milan and has won league titles in both France and Italy.",
      "His mentality impressed his former team-mate and former United forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is ironically now a senior adviser to the Milan board.",
      "When Maignan was a teenage goalkeeper coming through the ranks at PSG, he stood up to Ibrahimovic during a shooting session on the training ground.",
      "\"Even if we’re not in touch today, I like him,\" Maignan told France Football. \"He’s honest. He says what he has to say to you to your face. But when you speak to him, you have to be careful, that you’re not too perfect.",
      "\"He had a go a me and I answered him. For some people, it was not normal because I was only 17, but for me it was the right thing to do.",
      "\"He was practising shooting and the ball was going past me at 400km an hour! Gianluigi Buffon, Julio Cesar, these guys wouldn’t have stopped those shots.",
      "\"He told me: ‘You’re a sh*t goalkeeper.’ For me, that wasn’t right. The next time, he came back but I stopped his shot. I had to respond: ‘You’re a sh*t attacker.’",
      "\"He just looked at me and didn’t say anything. Back in the changing room, he stopped me. He told me that it’s good, that he liked what I did and that he liked my personality.",
      "\"I loved him before but it made me like him even more.\"",
      "Fast forward to the present day and Maignan is France's number one and because he is out of contract at the San Siro at the end of next season, he is available at a discounted price this summer.",
      "Chelsea have identified they needed to strengthen their goalkeeping department and have spotted an opportunity to perhaps secure one of the biggest steals of this summer's transfer market.",
      "Many will feel it is an opportunity United should have explored, too."

I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.",

      "Having gone a couple of days longer without a playing in comparison to Fernandes, Dalot must have been surprised when he was left out of the starting XI for Portugal's semi-final victory over Germany. Fellow right-back Nelson Semedo must have also been surprised when he was not called upon to replace his teammate in the right-back berth.",
      "Instead, Portugal boss Roberto Martinez deployed Paris Saint-Germain midfielder and former United transfer target Joao Neves at right-back. Usually, the talented 20-year-old is found at the heart of either Paris Saint-Germain's or Portugal's midfield.",

      "Sancho's wages are expected to be the biggest stumbling block in United's attempt to shift him, but they will still be keen to bank a fee in the region of the £25m Chelsea were originally expected to pay. If United are successful in their efforts to offload him, Rashford and Antony for the valuations they have set, they could secure almost £100m, which would be an excellent return for three players they have no plans to keep.",
      "United turned down a £40m bid for Garnacho from Napoli in January and will understandably want a higher fee this summer. Somewhere between £50m and £60m feels like a fair market value for the talented Argentine.",
      "If United can secure a fee within that region, they could find themselves securing a windfall in the region of £150m from just four sales. It is not as easy as simply ploughing the money straight back into the squad, with other operational costs and the £89m owed in transfer fees from previous windows to be considered, but it will give them a helping hand in their quest to recruit players for other positions in need of attention.",
      "As well as wanting to offload Rashford, Sancho, Garnacho and Antony, other departures are expected from Old Trafford. Tyrell Malacia is expected to leave permanently after three seasons at the club, Rasmus Hojlund is the subject of interest from Inter Milan and Casemiro is not assured of his future after United failed to qualify for Europe.",
      "Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir could also be sold amid Ruben Amorim's eagerness to recruit a new goalkeeper, while Luke Shaw is another player United should be looking to try and offload, though his injury record may put suitors off.",
      "The transfer market is one of the most unpredictable elements in football, meaning not everything United hope to achieve between now and the start of September will come to fruition. However, their intentions cannot be criticised.",
      "If they successfully offload the nine aforementioned players, particularly the star-studded names on the list, it will give them the best possible chance of making the additions they want."

      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha last weekend, Manchester United have now set their sights on securing the signature of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Despite seeing an opening offer worth £55million turned down earlier this week, United are understood to remain in discussions with Brentford and an improved offer is expected to be submitted.",
      "The Cameroon international, who scored 20 Premier League goals this season, wants to move to Old Trafford despite being linked with the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle United, both of who have qualified for next season's Champions League.",
      "The prospect of United adding Mbeumo to the signing of Cunha will significantly strengthen their attacking options. Between them, the pair have scored 56 Premier League goals since the start of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Mbeumo would also provide United with a versatile profile. With that said, MEN Sport has looked at three ways the Reds could line up if they secure the 25-year-old's signature:",
      "The general consensus is that United are chasing Mbeumo's signature with the idea of deploying him as the right-sided No.10 in Ruben Amorim's trademark 3-4-2-1 formation. He has played predominantly as a right-winger throughout his time at Brentford, but he often drifts inside to take up threatening positions.",
      "Amid that trait and his goalscoring record, he is a suitable fit for the right-sided No.10 role. He is also left-footed, and Amorim has gone on record he saying he prefers a left-footed player operating in that position.",
      "Should Mbeumo sign and be deployed on the right of the attack, Amad will almost certainly start from right wing-back. As far as the attack is concerned, Cunha is expected to be a shoo-in as the left-sided No.10, meaning the central position should be filled by the addition of a new striker.",
      "United are yet to confirm in which direction their hunt for a striker will head in after missing out on Liam Delap, but they continue to be linked with Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres. Amorim knows him inside out and he would be a dream signing.",
      "It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Mbeumo could play through the middle and spearhead United's attack. According to data specialists Transfermarkt, he played six times as a centre-forward for Brentford in 2024/25, scoring four goals.",
      "His reliability in front of goal, reflected in his tally of 38 Premier League strikes over the last three seasons, proves he is capable of playing up front. United have needed a multi-functional forward for several seasons and Mbeumo ticks that particular box.",
      "If United found themselves needing to deploy Mbeumo up front, they would not be light on options to fill the right-sided No.10 position with the likes of Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad all capable of playing in that role.",
      "In games United are expected to dominate and dictate, Amorim may find himself feeling tempted to cram as many attack-minded players onto the pitch as possible, and could task Mbeumo with operating from right wing-back.",
      "Praised by Brentford boss Thomas Frank for his attitude and application and approach to defending, Mbeumo is unlikely to shy away from tracking back and contributing defensively. He is renowned for his commitment and willingness to give everything for the cause.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo operating out wide would allow Amad to play further forward and occupy the right-sided No.10 position. The Ivorian has flexed his muscles as both a wing-back and a No.10 since Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "If Amorim was sticking with the plan of trying to unleash as many attack-minded players as possible, and United do not sign the striker they crave, Cunha could be tasked with leading the line in this particular instance, such is his versatility, and Fernandes could play higher up the pitch."

      "Jose Mourinho wouldn't approve of Manchester United's current transfer strategy if the former Old Trafford boss' previous comments are anything to go by.",
      "It's evident that Ruben Amorim's squad requires a significant revamp after a spirit-crushing season, which suffered one last brutal blow with a loss to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final. United have already secured Matheus Cunha from Wolves and are in discussions with Brentford about acquiring Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Despite severe cost-cutting measures off the pitch, United could still make substantial investments on it, having been linked with Sporting CP forward Victor Gyokeres and Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, among numerous others.",
      "United are aiming to rectify the damage caused by a series of costly errors in the transfer market. If the right offers come in, the futures of players such as Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee, and Andre Onana could potentially lie away from the club.",
      "This strategy could be compared to the one Pep Guardiola used at Manchester City during Mourinho's tenure at United. Mourinho criticised Guardiola after City spent over £200million on defenders in the summer of 2017 as part of a broader spending spree at the Etihad.",
      "United splurged almost £150m during that summer window, yet Mourinho maintained that they were outgunned by City's capability to keep refreshing their squad with high-priced talents. Speaking to United's website, he said at the time: \"You think the club can put here now £600million and let's buy six players of £100m? The club cannot do that.",
      "\"I cannot expect the club to do that, so it's not critical and you can see how the market is, especially with the top teams. But, you know, without taking any credit away from Manchester City and Pep and his staff and the players, they obviously have lots of credit in what they are doing.",
      "\"But Pep arrives, he has the goalkeeper of England (Joe Hart), he doesn't like him so he buys the goalkeeper of Barcelona (Claudio Bravo), he doesn't like him so he buys another one (Ederson). Now he likes.",
      "\"He has [Pablo] Zabaleta and [Aleksandar] Kolarov - two very good players but more than 30 years old. He wants to replace, he doesn't replace with two, he replaces with three.",
      "\"One from Tottenham (Kyle Walker), one from Monaco (Benjamin Mendy) and one from Real Madrid (Danilo) as an example. Can we buy six or seven players at the same time? Can we invest £600-700m? No. So, it's difficult.",
      "\"I think the last years, the market is going in such a direction or you belong to one of these clubs where there is no limit and you just buy what you want and there is no limit, there is no financial fair play, there is nothing, you do what you want - or it's hard.\"",
      "Nowadays, clubs are constrained by financial limitations, which typically means that high-cost signings are paired with player sales. This is expected to be the case at United this summer. However, it's doubtful that Mourinho, now in charge of Turkish giants Fenerbahce, would endorse United's current transfer approach of replacing expensive signings with yet more expensive signings."

      "Ex-Manchester United player Angel Gomes is on the verge of a surprising move to Marseille, linking up with one-time teammate Mason Greenwood. The young English midfielder's contract was set to run out this coming summer.",
      "He had sparked rumours about a possible return to Old Trafford, and there was also interest from Premier League sides Tottenham and West Ham. But Gomes has decided to take his talents elsewhere.",
      "According to RMC Sport, he is on the brink of signing with the French giants, who have offered him a three-year deal at the Stade Velodrome. Gomes has been convinced by the appealing style of football under head coach Roberto De Zerbi and the lure of competing in the Champions League proved too strong to turn down.",
      "Gomes is set to reunite with Greenwood at Marseille; the ex-United forward moved to France the previous summer and impressed by scoring 22 goals in his first season. Despite speculation over a potential switch to Barcelona fuelled by their apparent interest, Greenwood has expressed a desire to remain at Marseille, particularly for the chance to compete in the Champions League in the upcoming year.",
      "In fact, earlier in the year, Greenwood stated his anticipation for the experience: \"I hope to be here next year for the Champions League.\", reports the Express.",

      "Spurs will have to part with £10m to secure first-choice Ange Postecoglou replacement Thomas Frank and challenge Chelsea’s manager compensation monopoly.",
      "While Spurs have ‘agreed a deal’ with Frank, the small matter remains of striking an arrangement with the Dane’s current employers Brentford to poach their head coach of almost seven years.",
      "The Bees are expected to hold out for the full £10m payout in Frank’s contract, which runs until 2027.",
      "While that figure would put the 51-year-old about 56th in a list of the club’s most expensive transfers ever – they once spent more on Clinton N’Jie – the usual reluctance from a club to countenance dropping such sums on a manager means talks may now slow down somewhat.",
      "Even in an age when transfer fees continue to escalate, it is rare for Premier League clubs to put much money aside to acquire the manager they feel best equipped to pull it all together. These are the most expensive coaches in English top-flight history.",
      "MORE FRANK APPOINTMENT REACTION\n👉 Thomas Frank sack incoming as Spurs and football are stupid, mate\n👉 Spurs tempted by these ridiculous records of Thomas Frank and Brentford\n👉 Frank ‘demands’ Tottenham rival Man Utd for Mbeumo as he tells Brentford ‘he wants to join’",
      "",
      "Brendan Rodgers – £6m\nSwansea felt £5m was “suitable compensation” for “such a talented, young British manager” and three members of his backroom staff when Liverpool came calling in 2012.",
      "Seven years later, Chris Davies and Glen Driscoll again jumped ship with Rodgers for Leicester, but the addition of first-team coach Kolo Toure understandably brought the overall package closer to £10m for a frustrated Celtic.",
      "The appointment of Rodgers alone cost the Foxes £6m as they quickly identified and secured their main target to replace the sacked Claude Puel in February 2019. It immediately felt like a potentially bounteous union and for a long while proved as such.",
      "Rodgers extended his contract before the year was out, with his first two full seasons culminating in almighty bottlings of Champions League qualification after vague threats of title challenges.",
      "There was silverware in the form of the FA Cup and consecutive European campaigns only look more impressive the further Leicester in their current guise spiral out of control.",
      "But it ultimately ended in relegation heartbreak, with Rodgers sacked shortly before a drop into the Championship. The manager was due a pay-off of around £10m but is thought to have foregone some of that payment. Being replaced by Dean Smith does that to a man.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim – £9.25m\nThere was a similar sense with Amorim that Manchester United might have found a perfect match; that feeling lasted about a fortnight.",
      "Amorim had been on the Old Trafford radar for months, including through the hilariously bungled backing and sacking of Erik ten Hag, but it was decided that one final summer transfer window of recruiting at great expense more players specifically wanted by the Dutchman and entirely incompatible with his eventual successor was the best and indeed only possible course of action for a club which believes free lunches, charity work and employing non-footballers to be the problem.",
      "Sporting paid about £8m to release Amorim from his Braga contract after just 13 games in charge in March 2020 and it was a masterstroke: he transformed the Lisbon club to the extent that they won two Primeira Liga crowns after an almost two-decade drought, while putting them on course for a third before his departure.",
      "Manchester United wasted £21.4m on replacing Ten Hag with Amorim in November 2024 after threatening/promising the Portuguese that the opportunity to manage them would not come around again.",
      "Having spent the first eight months of his reign explaining in unnecessarily public and painstaking detail precisely how incompetent he believes himself, his players and the club which has helped torch his burgeoning reputation to be, it is easy to imagine he might regret not calling their bluff.",
      "All manner of low bars were dragged towards the centre of the Earth in an atrocious season which concluded with an embarrassing Europa League final no-show. The manager who so thoroughly out-coached his rival to procure the trophy and Champions League qualification with it was obviously ruthlessly dispensed with soon after; Sunk-Cost Fallacy FC doubled down on failure and rewarded Amorim with a £62.5m signing 11 days later.",
      "",
      "Arne Slot – £9.4m\n“Everybody understands Feyenoord will want to receive as much money as they can get, but I get the feeling that they will not begrudge me this move,” said Slot when it became clear that, through the noise surrounding Amorim and Xabi Alonso, he would be handed the Jurgen Klopp dynasty.",
      "The Eredivisie runners-up were perfectly satisfied with a £7.7m fee and £1.7m in add-ons which might well have been triggered over the course of a Premier League-winning debut season. Liverpool, too, were content with a succession plan which convinced few outside the club.",
      "Among those might well have been Spurs, on whom the joke is contractually bound to always be. They considered the credentials of Slot in The Great Managerial Search of summer 2023, although when it was reported that Feyenoord wanted £15m or so in restitution, it does not requite a vivid imagination to envision Daniel Levy’s non-response.",
      "Slot parlayed that interest into a contract extension after playing Spurs like a fiddle. When it was an upwardly mobile Liverpool on the end of the phone less than a year later, negotiations inevitably went far smoother.",
      "",
      "Enzo Maresca – £10m\nLeicester were ‘disappointed’ when Maresca ‘decided at this stage that he no longer wants to be part of our vision,’ but they cannot possibly have been surprised.",
      "The Italian recognised that his stock was high after winning the Championship title; he understandably chose to cash in when Chelsea made an approach for a coach they felt would be more malleable to their unique operations and machinations.",
      "The wheels on the bandwagon felt loose for months after but Maresca and his team managed to stabilise themselves, qualify for the Champions League and win the Europa Conference.",
      "Nothing can be ruled out with Clearlake but the Italian seems likely to be the first manager of their stewardship to finish one season and start the next, making Maresca one of the biggest success stories in sporting history.",
      "",
      "Andre Villas-Boas – £13.3m\nWith Carlo Ancelotti handed one of the harsher sackings in Premier League history, Chelsea felt it necessary to conduct an absurdly expensive experiment to deduce whether lightning could indeed strike twice.",
      "The hypothesis was fair. The club’s greatest era was triggered in no small part by the prodigious brilliance of a young Portuguese manager who had just won the Treble with Porto. Jose Mourinho himself once referred to Villas-Boas as “my eyes and ears” so when the 33-year-old won the Primeira Liga, Europa League and Portuguese Cup, the comparison became unavoidably intoxicating.",
      "Roman Abramovich certainly agreed, sanctioning what was a world-record compensation package for a manager he would spend about as much to sack within eight months, at least partly because he tried to make John Terry sit in economy.",
      "‘Andre was the outstanding candidate for the job,’ the Blues said when appointing him. By the time he was dispensed with there was ‘disappointment that the relationship has ended so early’ – and presumably so expensively.",
      "",
      "Graham Potter – £21.5m\nIt was presumed that Chelsea’s financially incontinent revolving door managerial policy would end with Abramovich’s ownership, but Clearlake ensured to honour that proud history with their first appointment.",
      "Thomas Tuchel was soon shown the door Potter would be invited through thanks to his work at Brighton. As ever, the Seagulls were fully prepared for such an eventuality and guaranteed they would be reimbursed for their troubles.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi was already in place as Potter’s replacement when it was revealed that Chelsea’s latest direct debit payment to Brighton amounted to just over £21m for the manager and five of his backroom team.",
      "He was probably the best Chelsea manager that season but that only hilariously damns the Blues, who preferred to be dragged into the actual sea by Frank Lampard.",
      "One Liverpool star has hinted that he could leave the Premier League giants this summer as he does not want to “waste years” at Anfield.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made his decision on whether to sell Man Utd defender Lisandro Martinez this summer, according to reports.",
      "Arne Slot could reportedly oversee a ‘mass clear-out’ at Liverpool with the sales of 15 players speculated upon in a report given the Reds area nearing a pair of big ...",
      "Man Utd have ‘made contact’ with Sporting over a move for Viktor Gyokeres as Ruben Amorim is ‘poised to win the battle’ for the £59m striker.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Danny Higginbotham has warned Ruben Amorim he will be judged next season if results do not pick up.",
      "Liverpool winger Luis Diaz has ‘agreed’ to move to La Liga side Barcelona in the summer transfer window, according to reports."

      "Jacobs told The United Stand: “My understanding is that Viktor Gyokeres would be very keen on a move to Man United if they could pull that off, financially speaking.",
      "“I don’t think Gyokeres would be on £300,000 a week or more. So if Rashford and Sancho go they’ve got wage bill space to invest in these players, so that’s why if they bite the bullet on the transfer and agent fees, if they structure it in a way where they can start in the next financial year and get it on flexible instalments, it can be a way they can do that deal.”",
      "And now transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the latest on interest from Man Utd in Gyokeres with the Red Devils continuing talks over a deal.",

      "Manchester United no longer have the same leverage in their pursuit of a forward, while Chelsea and Manchester City hurry to get five deals over the line.",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Jadon Sancho 🆕 – Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund\nWhatever goes wrong for Sancho, he’ll always have Dortmund. Given Chelsea want Jamie Gittens to do the job he couldn’t last season, it seems a very convenient link between the United outcast and his former club. And it’s hard to envisage Dortmund committing to anything beyond a loan, at least to begin with.",
      "",
      "19) Nico Williams – Athletic Bilbao to Arsenal\nOwing to Williams’ not-prohibitive release clause, this should be relatively simple if Arsenal really want to do it. But their interest is complicated by other costs that might be involved in signing the winger, for whom a new deal in Bilbao is not out of the question. This one seems to be getting further away, not closer. And it’s hard to ignore the spectre of Barca here.",
      "",
      "18) Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nMartinez seems to have said his goodbyes to Villa and though he was linked with Barcelona, it seems the Catalans are pushing forward on a deal for Joan Garcia. There is renewed speculation of United’s intent to move for Martinez, for whom they made an offer in January, according to one report.",
      "👉 Martinez need not act the d*** if he’s Man Utd’s pick to replace oblivious Onana",
      "",
      "17) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Which may be a consequence of the queue at Sporting’s door being more sparse than many of us expected. But if United can get it done, it would be a step on the road to regaining some credibility.",
      "",
      "",
      "15) Joao Pedro 🔼 – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Fine, but he won’t get that at Newcastle while Alexander Isak is around. For how long will that be? That is the more pressing concern for Newcastle fans.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Wirtz next? The last five times every Premier League club broke transfer record",
      "",
      "14) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nApparently unmoved by the Champions League, Mbeumo stated his preference for United over Newcastle, Arsenal and Tottenham. But that was before Thomas Frank became red-hot favourite to take over at Spurs and the Dane wants Mbeumo to follow. So United perhaps aren’t negotiating with Brentford from the position of strength they were. That second bid needs to go in, and it has to be closer to £60million, however they structure it.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker has overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack. After much deliberation, it seems the Gunners favour a deal with RB Leipzig over whatever they could get out of Sporting. After talks at the back end of last week, the wheels seem to be in motion.",
      "",
      "11) Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea have made it clear to Milan they are keen on the France keeper, but they won’t pay the £25million the Rossoneri want for a player entering the final year of his contract. Chelsea are said to be offering £10million for now, so there is some talking to be done. But whatever they pay up, it will be worth it.",
      "",
      "10) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. Reports suggest there is no reason for Arsenal fans to panic, with agreements in place between all parties. We’ll see this week now his international duties are done.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Kevin De Bruyne – Manchester City to Napoli\nThere was a hitch around image rights last week but, apparently, that has been resolved and De Bruyne is set to sign a two-year contract to fulfil his dream of playing with Scott McTominay.",
      "",
      "8) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool have improved on their opening bid of £109million by returning with an extra £4million. Leverkusen, as they should, are still haggling but the Reds are close. They’re hardly likely to walk away over a few euros and leave Wirtz hanging. The player will be looking for progress this week now there’s no international distractions.",
      "👉 Five reasons why Florian Wirtz may not actually be a good signing for Liverpool",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nChelsea’s first offer of £30million was rejected, with Dortmund wanting £40million, and the Germans know the Blues can be squeezed as the pre-Club World Cup deadline looms. A seven-year contract is reportedly on the table for the winger.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Rayan Cherki – Lyon to Manchester City\nCity got the easy part – they have agreed personal terms with Cherki – done early and have reportedly struck a deal with Lyon. City are in a hurry, so expect this to be one of three deals confirmed this week.",
      "",
      "5) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord last week was it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here.",
      "",
      "4) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThis one is moving quick, apparently, with Arsenal aware that the world’s most expensive goalkeeper will cost them just £5million. Interesting one, this. Kepa recovered some credibility on loan at Bournemouth last season and won’t be going to Arsenal just to play second fiddle to David Raya. Bring on the Gunners goalie wars!",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Jobe Bellingham – Sunderland to Borussia Dortmund\nA very on-brand deal has been agreed to make Jude’s little bro the second-most expensive player in Dortmund’s history. Jobe is apparently in Germany to drop his trousers and cough for the Dortmund doc and, all being well, he’ll be unveiled in the coming days.",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders – AC Milan to Manchester City\nIt’s pretty much done, apparently. City have agreed a fee of £46million to sign the midfielder, with Milan hoping to net another £12.5million in add-ons. Reijnders and Rodri in midfield? City won’t be sh*t again next season.",
      "",
      "1) Rayan Ait-Nouri – Wolves to Manchester City \nEveryone seems to be going with the line that a deal is done for what looks like a knockdown £33.7million fee. City want it done before next week and a medical is said to have passed by without issue. Unveiling is surely imminent."

      "Liverpool and Man Utd do not have a proud history of spending big on midfielders all that well. Chelsea have thrown enough at the wall to make some stick.",
      "",
      "1) Enzo Fernandez – £106.8m/€121m (Benfica to Chelsea, January 2023)\nA €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June 2022; a €121m Chelsea signing and Argentina World Cup winner six months later. It was a lot of money to finish in the bottom half but then they sorted themselves out.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m/€117.4m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nRice could be a game-changer for Arsenal – for £100m and another £5m in add-ons, he ought to be. The double free-kick to sink Real Madrid will live long in the memory and basically helped pay back his fee.",
      "",
      "3) Moises Caicedo – £100m/€117.1m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThere is every chance Caicedo could jump to the top of this list soon, with around half of the £15m in add-ons a grovelling Chelsea had to offer described as easily achievable in some quarters. Liverpool had put together a £111m package but, much to some hilarious and entirely grown-up Proper Red fury, the Ecuadorean wasn’t interested.",
      "",
      "4) Paul Pogba – £93.2m/€110m (Juventus to Man Utd, August 2016)\nMan Utd never did figure out how to unlock Pogba, with the weary efforts of three different managers ultimately ending in frustration, viruses, haircuts and a second Old Trafford exit to join Juventus as a free agent.",
      "",
      "5) Jude Bellingham – £88.5m/€103m (Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid, June 2023)\nThe idea of a £100m bargain sounds particularly weird but Bellingham is as close as is possible. Real Madrid would be thrilled if add-ons taking the deal to £115m/€133.9m were activated over the course of a six-year contract for a 21-year-old with more than 300 senior career appearances who will probably break soon.",
      "",
      "6) Frenkie de Jong – £74.5m/€86m (Ajax to Barcelona, July 2019)\nGiven a choice also involving Paris Saint-Germain and both Manchester clubs, De Jong cashed in on his rising Ajax stock at the absolute peak to join Barcelona just as they started financially collapsing in on themselves. The Dutchman has been central to their revival.",
      "",
      "7) Aurelien Tchouameni – £68.3m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, June 2022)\nSimilar to Bellingham, Real Madrid would not mind paying an extra £17m/€20m if Tchouameni holds up his end of a quite stunningly executed midfield renovation.",
      "",
      "8) Arthur Melo – £66m/€72m (Barcelona to Juventus, June 2020)\nLiverpool did indeed borrow the world’s fourth most expensive midfielder ever at the time to solve problems which Arthur’s injuries only exacerbated.",
      "",
      "9) Rodri – £62.8m/€70m (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, July 2019)\nIt was not the most seamless transition to Pepball – it never is – but Rodri went from ropey to learning the ropes and then master of the tactical fouling rest defence rope-a-dope, all the way to Champions League final goalscorer.",
      "",
      "10) Casemiro – £60m/€70m (Real Madrid to Man Utd, August 2022)\nIn a mild panic induced by consecutive defeats to Brighton and Brentford, Man Utd chucked up to £70m on a 30-year-old and gave him a four-year contract. It has worked equal parts well and disastrously.",
      "",
      "11) Jorginho – £57m/€65m (Napoli to Chelsea, July 2018)\nManchester City could not force a deal over the line but the pull of London and Maurizio Sarri delivered Jorginho to a productive if never unanimously popular half-decade at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "12) Tanguy Ndombele – £55.4m/€62m (Lyon to Tottenham, July 2019)\nA club-record signing made so long ago that Mauricio Pochettino welcomed him to north London when Ange Postecoglou was busy winning titles with Yokohama F Marinos, Ndombele left for nothing nine games short of a century of Spurs appearances.",
      "",
      "13) Kevin de Bruyne – £55m/€75m (Wolfsburg to Manchester City, August 2015)\n“I thought it was lira,” said Paul Merson of the fee an English club had agreed to pay a German side for a Belgian player. “The world is going mad,” added Phil Thompson. That fee does look crazy for what Manchester City received in return over a decade, to be fair.",
      "",
      "14) Miralem Pjanic – £54.8m/€60m (Juventus to Barcelona, June 2020)\nRemember the Arthur entry? Well as part of a fudged pandemic transfer which seemed to point towards a future of big clubs swapping their wage-drainers because no-one had any money, Barcelona were able to press the Pjanic button for a couple of years.",
      "",
      "15) Romeo Lavia – £53m/€61.9m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThirty-six senior career appearances was enough for a Chelsea side gripped by their insatiable obsession with signing young midfielders. And indeed anyone. Manchester City even received £8m or so after sticking a sell-on clause into the deal which saw Lavia join Saints a year earlier.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Nunes – £53.2m/€62m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe Portugal international went on strike to force through a move to work with Pep Guardiola at City after Wolves refused the Treble winners’ first offer. The fee includes a 10 per cent sell-on clause when City are done with the 26-year-old.",
      "",
      "17) Naby Keita – £52.75m/€60m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2018)\nThat rare example of an expensive Liverpool transfer committee misstep. Keita seemed absolutely perfect for Klopp but 75 starts in five seasons tells a particular story which revolves around hamstrings.",
      "",
      "18) Sandro Tonali – £52m/€60m (Milan to Newcastle, July 2023)\nHelping knock new teammate Bruno Guimaraes (£40m/€50.1m) off this list, the most expensive Italian footballer in history has followed a similar path into the collective hearts of the Geordie nation.",
      "",
      "19) Fred – £52m/€58.9m (Shakhtar Donetsk to Man Utd, June 2018)\nManchester City tried to get a deal done for a little less the winter before but their exit from the race left the path clear for Man Utd to polarise their fanbase for years to come by signing a diligent, determined but ultimately limited midfielder.",
      "",
      "20) Manuel Ugarte – £51.2m/€60m (Sporting to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2023)\nA good month or so after Chelsea removed themselves from what remains a confusing equation surrounding wages and other payments, Ugarte’s move to PSG was finally confirmed by the French champions.",

      "Today under Thomas Tuchel we struggled to score 1 goal against Andorra and never looked like getting any more. So where’s this attacking football under Tuchel that we were promised?\nDan, London",
      "",
      "Gash England\nGood job we had Jordan Henderson on the field to bring us all that leadership experience. And I suppose at least we found out that lad Harry Kane can score goals. I loved Tommy T’s touchline and post match “WTF lads?”, but if you’re gonna pick the geriatric money grubbing water carrier, and start Kane in games like this, then my patience has already run out. It’s all academic anyway though, since France and/or Spain will absolutely ruin us even if every player manages to miraculously give a 10/10 performance for every game of a tournament.",
      "Oh, and can someone tell Bellingham to wind his fecking neck in and shut his gob too please? We know you’re at Madrid Jude, but it doesn’t mean you’re supposed to spend the entire game giving the ref grief instead of beating An-f**king-dorra.",

You’re welcome to think of him as ugly, whiny, or a weakling – fair play to you and the rest of the PFM gang. Maybe you’ve confused football with Vogue or Men’s Health Magazine.",
      "But to Derrick who wrote in to say ‘No united striker will score with Bruno in the team, he is supposed to be the creator but it’s something he simply can’t do…’ – would this be the same Bruno who last year was the 3rd highest chance creator in the top 5 leagues (and the #1 in the Premier League) according to Planet Football, and the #1 chance creator in the Premier League in the last 5 years?",

      "What I’ll not have is this irrational bashing of a player based on perception rather than reality. The reality is, over the last 5 seasons he is not just the outright greatest chance creator in all of Europe (source: statmuse) he leads second place by almost 30% more chances. He is 13th in goals + assists and is the only non striker/winger in the top 25. No one in Europe is more productive than Bruno at creating chances.",
      "Even in a season without a striker worthy of the title in a fully dysfunctional United team when compared to midfielders he is in the 97-99th percentile in Shots, Assists, Exp Goals, Exp Assists and Shot Creating Actions. 98th in progressive passses. His defensive actions are far more in line with a decent central midfielder than one tasked with creating. He runs more than almost anyone else. He has more tackles and blocks than plenty of defensive midfielders.",
      "He is terrible at running with the ball, can’t fend off strong challenges when he receives it in dangerous positions and is probably the last person who should be receiving a pass in traffic but he does a whole lot of football a whole lot better than just about every other player in the world.",

      "On Ange…\nThe contrast between ManU’s mistaken retention of Erik Ten Hag and Spurs’ sacking of Ange Postecoglou is obvious, but I don’t think it’s apt.",
      "Manchester United is used to winning cups (indeed, they’d won the Carabao and FA Cups in the seasons before his sacking). Spurs, on the other hand, hadn’t won anything is almost two decades; that Europa League win was far, far more impactful than United’s FA Cup and a far better justification for retaining Big Ange. In short,  ManU made the wrong call after the FA Cup, but it doesn’t follow that Spurs made the right one.",
      "I’m not positive that Spurs have made a mistake. That will depend on the replacement they secure and the reactions along the squad, some of which seem negative indeed. But it sure would have been interesting to watch Ange and Spurs next season. I’ll miss that weirdo.",
      "Also, I’m still troubled by the quiet transfer front at NUFC. I’d expected us to have at least Mbeumo wrapped up by now. And while the club is no doubt wise to protect its wage structure, he would’ve been prefect for us. 18 year-old Antonio Cordero looks promising, but isn’t yet a first-team contributor, and that transfer has probably been quietly agreed weeks or months ago. It’s already starting to feel like last summer.\nChris C, Toon Army DC",

      "Trophies are great, but we need to stop trying to pretend that winning ones that Arsenal have played too well over consecutive seasons to compete for should be seen as a greater level of success! A few lucky games to win a trophy don’t mask a season of underperforming – it’s like nobody learnt anything from Man Utd and Ten Hag.\nJames (Gooner exiled in the North East)",

      "But here’s the thing – I don’t care.  We did win a major trophy, we are in the champions league, we do have a young squad that can compete with some sensible additions and a more tactically astute manager, and we avoided the ETH trap of keeping the wrong guy for (understandable) emotional reasons.  Sonny came out and said that Ange ‘changed the trajectory of the club’ and by winning something that may well be true, and he’ll always be remembered fondly but this really is the best of both worlds.",
      "Now of course Daniel Levy is fully capable of clutching defeat from the jaws of victory by signing a another bunch of 18 year olds, but if we buy a proper 6 and at least one top notch forward plus a couple of depth pieces this really is an attractive squad to work with over the next few years.  If I was Frank or Poch I’d jump at the chance.\nPhil, London",

There was little interest in playing in the league.",

If the players haven’t got it, in their heart and in their heads, you can’t change that. If you look at last season, Man Utd shouldn’t be anywhere near that level again in my lifetime.”",

      "“I went through something similar when I was at Aberdeen – for a year I was absolutely horrendous and it really gets to you, you almost lose your power to run and you feel debilitated.",

      "“Do I think a loan move would help him? No – I think what’s best for him as a young man is moving somewhere else permanently. Everything seems to be too much for him and I think he’s in the mindset where he’s letting everyone down, which is a horrible place to be in.",

      "",
      "13 – Finley Burns (£250,000, Southend to Manchester City in January 2017)\nNow an ancient 21, Burns has done well to remain on the books of Manchester City since joining in his first teenage year in January 2017. The defender has even made his first-team debut in the League Cup, spent time on loan in the Championship and played for England age groups up to the U20s so far.",
      "",
      "14 – Sheyi Ojo (£2m, MK Dons to Liverpool in November 2011)\nAfter playing for the U18s and training with the first team, Ojo attracted intense interest from Chelsea and Liverpool but it was the latter who won out. He played 13 times for the Reds, was praised by Jurgen Klopp for his “big skills”, had seven spells on loan and eventually left in 2022. Maribor, to save you a Google.",
      "",
      "15 – Fran Merida (£2.2m, Barcelona to Arsenal in 2005)\n“An absolutely amazing player,” was the assessment Arsene Wenger once offered of Merida, who replaced fellow former Gunners prodigy Jermaine Pennant as the most expensive 15-year-old footballer in history. The Spaniard retired in 2024 in his mid-30s.",
      "",
      "16 – Pietro Pellegri (£17.5m, Genoa to Monaco in January 2018)\nThere is precious little separating Pellegri from fellow youthful Monaco recruit Willem Geubbels, who joined a few months later. Neither made an impact in the principality.",
      "",
      "17 – Jude Bellingham (£25m, Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund in July 2020)\nA total of 44 first-team appearances for Championship side Birmingham was enough to tempt Bundesliga giants and professional stepping stone Borussia Dortmund into signing Bellingham; none of the parties involved will have any regrets.",
      "",
      "18 – Leny Yoro (£52m, Lille to Man Utd in July 2024)\nMan Utd revelled in beating Real Madrid to “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”, even if it did largely come down to which side was willing to spend the most money.",
      "",
      "19 – Kylian Mbappe (£166m, Monaco to PSG in June 2018)\nThe most expensive teenager in the world and it is not particularly close; Joao Felix joined Atletico Madrid at the same age for £113m, while Bellingham’s move to Real Madrid could cost a couple million more than that with add-ons. The ridiculous Mbappe became PSG’s record scorer before leaving.",
      "",
      "20 – Ousmane Dembele (£135.5m, Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona in August 2017)\nBarcelona were right to sense there was a ridiculously good player there; how unfortunate the potential has only been realised at PSG.",
      "",
      "21 – Moises Caicedo (£100m, Brighton to Chelsea in August 2023)\nBrighton did what Brighton do and held out long enough for Liverpool and Chelsea to walk into a blindfolded blinking contest, with Caicedo ultimately making the decision by turning down a British record £111m move to the former in favour of a potential £115m switch to the latter.",
      "",
      "22 – Enzo Fernandez (£106.8m, Benfica to Chelsea in February 2023)\nThe £10m move from River Plate to Benfica in June 2022 did not make Fernandez the most expensive 22-year-old footballer in history, but his next transfer a few months later as a world champion certainly did.",
      "",
      "23 – Paul Pogba (£93.8m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2016)\nLeft for free at 19. Moved for world-record fee at 23. Left to join previous club – again for free – at 29. And only once did Pogba achieve what Graeme Souness “expected” of him.",
      "",
      "24 – Declan Rice (£100m, West Ham to Arsenal in July 2023)\nArsenal will not mind if Rice enjoys similar success to the last individual who proudly held the title of world’s most expensive 24-year-old footballer. Gareth Bale did just fine and the Gunners believe their new record signing could be one of the many jigsaw pieces.",
      "",
      "25 – Neymar (£198m, Barcelona to PSG in August 2017)\nOh look, it’s the transfer that broke football.",
      "",
      "26 – Harry Maguire (£80m, Leicester to Man Utd in August 2019)\nNot only did Maguire usurp Virgil van Dijk as the most expensive defender ever, he replaced him as the most expensive 26-year-old in history. That really does have to sting. The former Man Utd captain might consider himself to at least be in the same conversation now, if only just listening in the background and awkwardly laughing at all the in-jokes while being hawked around for about a quarter of what he was signed for.",
      "",
      "27 – Luis Suarez (£65m, Liverpool to Barcelona in July 2014)\nAfter arriving with a customary months-long ban for biting, Suarez really did crack on establishing a phenomenal Barcelona legacy. The only player not named Lionel or Cristiano to win the Pichichi Trophy for La Liga top scorer between 2010 and 2021, Suarez also claimed 13 trophies and a place at number three on the Blaugrana’s list of all-time top scorers. Then when they let the Uruguayan go for free he fired Atletico to the title while fuelled on pure thirst for revenge.",
      "",
      "28 – Eden Hazard (£143m, Chelsea to Real Madrid in July 2019)\nIf you had told Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 that Hazard would activate all the clauses in his Chelsea transfer to take it from an £88.5m deal to the full value of £143m, they would presumably have been chuffed at the success the Belgian must have enjoyed. But those add-ons were accidentally triggered across four seasons utterly ruined by injury, before being released with 12 months of his contract remaining and then retiring.",
      "",
      "29 – Diego Costa (£57m, Chelsea to Atletico Madrid in January 2018)\nZinedine Zidane was unmovable for almost two decades, but then Diego Costa won two Premier League titles in 20-goal seasons, was dumped by Antonio Conte over text, did not play for months and went AWOL, yet Chelsea still sold him back to Atletico for almost double what they initially paid, despite the striker turning 30 later that year and the Spanish side operating under a transfer ban. Todd Boehly could never.",
      "",
      "30 – Harry Kane (£100m, Spurs to Bayern Munich in August 2023)\nRaising the bar set by predecessor Casemiro by quite a way, Kane finally broke his Daniel Levy shackles with a 47-goal gap to Alan Shearer’s all-time Premier League record, so desperate was he to finally grab a couple of trophies.",
      "",
      "31 – Neymar (£86.3m, Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal in August 2023)\nFor more than 23 years, Gabriel Batistuta reigned as the most expensive 31-year-old in football history; it was a simpler time. Then Saudi Arabia came along, changed the game and rescued a load of superclubs from their financial burdens, including even mega-rich PSG.",
      "",
      "32 – Riyad Mahrez (£30m, Manchester City to Al-Ahli in July 2023)\nYep. Not that Manchester City were desperate to offload Mahrez, but the Algerian had won everything on offer in England and earned his jaunt in the Middle East.",
      "",
      "33 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£99m, Real Madrid to Juventus in July 2018)\nFive trophies, 101 goals in 134 games and consecutive Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, but still a failure of a signing after being picked up to win the Champions League – or at least to stop scoring against Juventus in the Champions League – yet not being able to take them beyond the quarter-finals after being knocked out by Ajax, Lyon and Porto.",
      "",
      "34 – Yann Sommer (£8.3m, Borussia Monchengladbach to Bayern Munich in January 2023)\nA Sommer signing completed in January, with Manuel Neuer injured and out for some time it was decided by Bayern that they would shop locally for a short-term replacement. And that he was, joining Inter that August after winning the Bundesliga.",
      "",
      "35 – Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£8.4m, Marseille to Al Qadsiah in July 2024)\nA 30-goal season with Marseille was slightly better than the campaign he spent playing irregularly and scoring even less often for Chelsea, with Aubameyang using that rediscovery of his goalscoring prowess to earn a Saudi pay day.",
      "",
      "36 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.9m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2021)\nManchester City lurked, Man Utd panicked, Sir Alex Ferguson was mobilised and Rio Ferdinand crowed. And for a while Ronaldo scored. But then a non-sycophantic grown-up was appointed as his manager and toys were expelled from prams with the toadying help of Piers Morgan as the Portuguese prompted a Saudi revolution.",

And it would probably take about a quarter of that to tempt them into selling now.",

      "",
      "3) Virgil van Dijk – £75m/€84m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nThe benchmark was set by Van Dijk, who claimed “I can’t do anything about the price” before doing everything to justify it, helping Liverpool reach a Champions League final within his first few months, winning the lot by his fourth year and raking in awards and acclaim in equal measure.",
      "",
      "4) Wesley Fofana – £70m/€80.4m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt took three rejected Chelsea bids – worth £50m, £60m and finally £70m with add-ons included – before Leicester finally caved and accepted up to £75m for a defender with 57 top-flight career league appearances. Even before Fofana’s serious knee issues, it wasn’t exactly going to plan.",
      "",
      "5) Lucas Hernandez – £68m/€80m (Atletico Madrid to Bayern Munich, July 2019)\nBayern Munich’s record signing was a bit of a dud, reaching just over 100 games in four years but watching the entire 2020 Champions League final win from the bench and being sold at a considerable loss to PSG.",

      "6) Matthijs de Ligt – £67.8m/€75m (Ajax to Juventus, July 2019)\nWhen the vultures picked at the carcass of Ajax in 2019, De Jong and De Ligt were the parts deemed most succulent. Man Utd might have had their ridiculous reasons for turning the latter down before signing him years later, but Juventus were not put off by his father’s weight; after three underwhelming years they might wish they had been.",

      "7) Ruben Dias – £65m/€71.6m (Benfica to Manchester City, September 2020)\nTwo days after Jamie Vardy scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 humbling of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola took his Etihad spending on defenders beyond £400m on one of the best of the lot.",
      "",
      "8) Matthijs de Ligt – £62m/€70m (Juventus to Bayern Munich, July 2022)\n“I was still really young. I went from a kid who did everything well at Ajax to a defender at Juventus, where every little thing I did wrong was seen by everybody,” De Ligt has said of his brief time in Turin, which he swapped for a role out of the spotlight as the “boss” of Bayern’s defence for a couple of years.",
      "",
      "9) Achraf Hakimi – £60m/€71m (Inter to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2021)\nAfter playing for Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Inter, Hakimi had enough of representing clubs with European pedigree and so rocked up in Paris to win a few domestic trophies and keep Kylian Mbappe company for a bit. Then Mbappe left and PSG won the sodding big one after Hakimi’s muted celebration kicked off a Champions League final dismantling of former club Inter.",

      "According to reports, a ‘decision’ has been made on Alejandro Garnacho as he ‘will leave’ Premier League giants Manchester United this summer.",
      "Garnacho has endured a rough six months at Man Utd as he has butted heads with head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The winger was omitted from United’s squad for December’s Manchester derby as Amorim argued that his and Marcus Rashford’s attitude and performance in training were not good enough.",
      "Garnacho appeared to respond better to this setback and swiftly returned to the first team, while Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January.",
      "However, Garnacho was a bit-part player during the run-in and he only had a brief cameo off the bench in United’s 1-0 Europa League final defeat against Spurs.",
      "READ: Fernandes butchered in the Mailbox as ‘crying little weakling’ with Ange given fond farewell",
      "Garnacho hit out at Amorim and United’s dire season in an angry outburst after this match and it was revealed ahead of the final day of the Premier League season that he’s been told by the head coach to ‘find a new club’.",
      "There has clearly been a clash of personalities between Garnacho and Amorim, with a summer transfer the right outcome for all parties.",
      "While Garnacho has a lot of potential, his performances were poor during the 2024/25 season and he does not fit into Amorim’s system as he’s struggled in the No.10 role.",
      "Man Utd opened the door to Garnacho leaving in January as they looked to raise funds and he was pursued by Serie A giants Napoli as they tried to replace Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.",
      "This transfer did not go through, but they remain a contender to sign Garnacho, who has also been linked with Bayer Leverkusen following their appointment of former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "Premier League clubs have also been linked with Garnacho, with Chelsea among the contenders to sign him and Spurs mentioned as a left-field option.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has not named the Premier League teams who have ‘called’ for Garnacho, but he insists ‘three’ English sides are ‘very keen’.",
      "He tweeted: ‘Alejandro Garnacho will leave Man United, decision confirmed on player and club side — set to part ways.",
      "‘Understand staying in Premier League serious option with 3 clubs already very keen… after Bayer Leverkusen and Italian clubs calling.’",
      "Romano has also provided an update on Man Utd’s pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo. He explained: “Manchester United and Brentford were back in club-to-club talks for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "“After the first meeting, £45m plus £10m was rejected by Brentford. The clubs have been in contact again,” Romano said.",
      "“Let’s see when the official bid will come, but it’ll be closer to what the Bees want. Brentford started at £70m, but as always with negotiations, they can drop to something like what Man Utd paid for Matheus Cunha, £62.5m. Let’s see how the conversation will go.",
      "“Mbeumo wants to go to Man Utd, despite approaches from Newcastle, Arsenal and more clubs. He’s got an agreement with the club.”",
      "According to reports, Arsenal are among the clubs interested in signing Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been linked with Chelsea.",
      "Chelsea reportedly ‘remain’ keen on the signing of a Manchester United forward, as they are looking to replace Jadon Sancho after deciding against signing him personally.",

      "The seemingly imminent exits of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Antony could boost United’s budget after co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe felt it was necessary to sanction a huge cost-cutting programme to balance the books after taking control at Old Trafford.",
      "Some Ratcliffe decisions have been deemed unnecessary, but this programme appears to have served its purpose as Gyokeres would add to United’s positive start to this window.",
      "Gyokeres’ fine form has fuelled speculation linking him with several elite Premier League and European clubs, but Man Utd and Arsenal have been leading the pursuit for his signature.",
      "For a while, Arsenal appeared to be his most likely destination, but they have also been targeting RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko and recent reports have indicated that they are leaning towards signing the Slovenia international.",

      "The dynamic midfield player left Old Trafford in 2020 with a handful of Premier League appearances under his belt, joining Ligue 1 side Lille before being immediately loaned to Boavista.",
      "Gomes, who was part of the England team that won the Under-21 European Championship two years ago, has not yet been selected by senior boss Thomas Tuchel, who takes charge of his third game when the Three Lions face Andorra in a World Cup qualifier in Barcelona on Saturday.",
      "The midfielder allowed his contract at Lille to expire and his search for a new club could soon be over, according to Sami Mokbel and BBC Sport. A move to Marseille appears to be on the cards.",
      "“Discussions are said to be progressing positively, with the Ligue 1 side hopeful they can seal his transfer in the coming days,” reports Mokbel.",
      "“The deal would see Gomes, who is yet to feature for England under Thomas Tuchel, link up with former Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi and remain playing in France.”",

      "Renowned for his controlled midfield play and an impact that belies his physical stature, Gomes was part of the team that took Lille from mid-table in 2021-22 back into the European places the following year.",
      "They finished in fourth place in 2023-24 and successfully negotiated the Champions League play-off rounds before qualifying in an impressive seventh from the new league phase.",
      "They were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund in the round of 16 but wins against Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Bologna, Sturm Graz and Feyenoord made it a campaign to remember. Gomes, whose last season with Lille was affected by injury, played in only two of those victories.",
      "Lille finished fifth in 2024-25 and had to settle for the Europa League next season but Gomes will continue in the Champions League if and when a switch to Marseille is finalised.",
      "The Londoner made his England debut from the bench against the Republic of Ireland in the Nations League in September and played the full 90 minutes in the next game against Finland at Wembley, Harry Kane’s 100th for his country.",

      "Before talks advanced with Marseille, Edmonton-born Gomes was linked with a possible return to Man Utd as well as with interest from Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United.",

      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",

      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",

      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"
