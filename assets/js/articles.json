      "And the ultra-confident France star also has his sights set on the Ballon d'Or, too. “When you see Rodri here, he won the Ballon d’Or — it’s clear tht with Manchester City it’s possible and I am here for this,” Cherki added.",

I spoke with Pep about my position on the pitch and we spoke about what I enjoy when I’m on the pitch. It’s very good for me. He told me he loves a No10, but now I play all the positions in the pitch - so it’s not complicated because I just want to play.",

      "In 2022, as part of the eye-opening BBC documentary 'The Real Mo Farah', the athlete revealed his name was not 'Mo Farah' and that he had been living under somebody else's identity.",
      "Farah, 42, revealed his real name was Hussein Abdi Kahin. When he was only four years old, Farah, who was originally from Somaliland, lost his father, who was killed while tending to his cattle by a piece of shrapnel from a bazooka blast during Somalia's civil war.",

      "He was instructed to come into the country under the name Mo Farah - who was a different child - and was handed illegal documents. This dangerous process went through while he was only nine years old. He realised he had taken someone else's place at the airport when he saw a man wondering why his child had not arrived.",

She said, 'If you ever wanna see your family again, don’t say anything.' Often I would just lock myself in the bathroom and cry.\"",
      "At the age of 11, Farah enrolled into Feltham Community College. Teachers and other staff at the school were told he was a refugee from Somalia. His form tutor Sarah Rennie said Farah was, \"unkempt and uncared for\" and \"emotionally and culturally alienated,\" largely due to the lack of English he spoke.",

      "From that point onwards, Farah developed as a person and an athlete, going on to become a four-time Olympic gold medallist and a six-time world champion. When Farah was sent away, he had to leave his mother Aisha and two brothers, who all live on a farm in Somaliland.",
      "Farah met his now-wife Tania Nell while at university in West London. Together they have four children, Rhianna, Hussein Mo, Amani and Aisha Farah.",
      "Incredibly, in the documentary, Farah also met the real Mohamed Farah over a video call. However, The Sun claimed the athlete had to break contact with him and change his phone number, after he was allegedly hounded for money by the man and around ten others who had got hold of his number.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has said that Manchester United should look to finish in the top six to eight of the Premier League next season. The Red Devils will be eager to quickly forget 2024/25, given they finished a dismal 15th in the league and failed to achieve silverware both domestically and in Europe.",
      "And while many managers may have had their future thrown into question given the lacklustre campaign, Ruben Amorim - who was only appointed in November following the sacking of Erik ten Hag - has seemingly been given the benefit of the doubt by the board.",
      "The Portuguese tactician was forced to work with a mismatched squad that he inherited when he entered Old Trafford. And, following Ten Hag's spending spree on the likes of Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Light inlast summer, limited funds were available in January for Amorim to start his own rebuilding project.",
      "There were also fears of failing PSR regulations if they continued to spend frivolously. As a result, Amorim was only able to bring in Patrick Dorgu from Lecce for £25.1million, as well as Arsenal youngster Ayden Heaven in a deal thought to be around the £1m mark.",
      "However, it appears as though Amorim will be backed by the board this summer to recruit suitable players for his system, with United already splurging £62.5m on Matheus Cunha from Wolves in the early transfer window.",
      "\"I don't think you should be looking outside of that. And that's from someone who only thought about winning the league at United. So it's a big come-down in that sense.\"",
      "Ferdinand also agreed that Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Project 150 plans were a little far-fetched at present. The INEOS chair and Red Devils minority shareholder had initially planned to see his club win the league by 2028 in line with its 150th anniversary, but the stark reality is that Amorim may need more time than that to work his magic and slowly but surely build United back to the Premier League giants they were under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "While an insider told the Mirror back in March that Amorim \"felt he could get more from the current squad when he came in,\" they added: \"There’s no getting away from the fact that overall it’s been a really tough watch - and that it’s going to take a lot of time and patience to get the team to where they should be. You’ve got to be brave or foolish to think winning the league by 2028 is doable from where United currently are.\"",
      "This, coupled with continually growing rivals in terms of talent, may force Ratcliffe to abandon his ambitious Project 150 plans altogether as United plan for a less turbulent future. It comes as Ferdinand recently launched his Career Transfer Hub with Talking Futures, with hopes of bridging the gap between teenagers and parents for planning their own futures.",
      "Speaking about the initiative, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents. I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time. So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch the Career Transfer Hub – giving parents access to information on their child’s education options just like football agents have transfer insiders, negotiation teams and career scouts. You can find out more here.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Aston Villa's Emi Martinez is keen on a move to Manchester United with talks reportedly ongoing over a move. The goalkeeper is facing an uncertain future with numerous parties interested in his services.",
      "The Argentine's career has flourished since he moved to Villa Park from Arsenal back in 2020. Martinez has helped Villa become a Champions League outfit whilst he's also earned a reputation as a penalty specialist.",
      "He was integral in Argentina's World Cup win back in 2022 and is viewed as one of Europe's elite goalkeepers. Now teams in the Saudi Pro League are interested in a move but a switch to Manchester could also be on the cards for the 32-year-old.",
      "According to ESPN Argentina United have now begun discussions with Martinez, who is open to joining Ruben Amorim's side. It is understood that a switch to Old Trafford is his favoured destination even if a move is not imminent.",
      "The Villa No 1 was sent-off in the final game of the Premier League season as his side were beaten by the Red Devils, which meant they ultimately missed out on a second successive year in the Champions League.",
      "Unai Emery remained non-committal over whether the player would remain. He said: “I don’t know. I don’t know. He has a contract with us. We are very happy and we will see how the summer goes.” Asked if there have been discussions over Martinez leaving, Emery added: “I don’t know. You can ask him.”",
      "Martinez stoked the rumour mill as he appeared to wave farewell to supporters in his final game at Villa Park. He cut an emotional figure as he cried during his lap around the pitch with his team-mates.",
      "United goalkeeper Andre Onana has been unable to convince during his two years at the club. He was signed as David de Gea's replacement by Erik ten Hag but has continued to make errors and was eventually dropped by Amorim after a poor performance at Lyon.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo lastyear revealed his wish to play in the '\"biggest competitions\" for \"the best clubs\" amid interest from Manchester United and Tottenham. The Brentford star looks set to make a switch this summer on the back of a 20-goal Premier League campaign.",
      "The 25-year-old enjoyed his most prolific campaign to date under Thomas Frank this season, having arrived in west London from French side Troyes six years ago for a then-club record fee of £5.8million. Fast forward to this transfer window, and he's the subject of bids exceeding £55m from both the Red Devils and Spurs.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side looked all set to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo earlier this month, with reports suggesting he had 'prioritised' a move to Old Trafford, and personal terms would be no issue. However, his former boss Frank's move from the west of the capital to the north threw a spanner in United's works.",
      "The Danish head coach has replaced Europa League-winning boss Ange Postecoglou at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and it seems he wishes to bring Mbeumo along with him.",
      "Spurs have now risen to the ascendency in securing Mbeumo's signature, tabling a £70m bid, £15m more than the £55m figure United had rejected, and reports suggest that the player is now 'more open' to staying in London. Comments made by the 25-year-old last May also give Frank's new side the edge.",
      "Interest from top sides in Mbeumo can be traced back to the summer of 2024, when, after a campaign that saw him muster a respectable nine league goals, Liverpool and Newcastle came sniffing.",
      "Mbeumo issued a response to rumours linking him with the Premier League's finest, and told L'Equipe: \"I have spent five years at Brentford, at a club that has allowed me to grow and pass a milestone but yes, I would like to play in the biggest competitions, at the best clubs. It is tantalising to see some big clubs interested in me.\"",
      "The winger ultimately stayed put at the Gtech Community Stadium last summer. However, his comments regarding playing in the biggest and best competitions arguably throw weight behind Tottenham's bid in the current battle for his signature.",
      "While Amorim's United will be without European football next term, having finished the season in a lowly 15th, Spurs will grace the Champions League.",
      "They bested the Red Devils 1-0 in the Europa League final, ending a 17-year wait for silverware and qualifying them for UEFA's elite club competition. Yet, while Mbeumo clarified that playing in a tournament like the Champions League is an aim, he added the caveat that he would like to do so for the 'best clubs.'",
      "Not only did United finish slightly higher than Spurs in the Premier League this season, but they are also historically superior, having lifted a joint record 20 top-flight league titles, among countless other accolades that Tottenham have not.",
      "Mbeumo himself has dropped few hints as to which side he would prefer, though a post on Instagram when it was announced that head coach Frank would be departing made for telling viewing.",
      "The 25-year-old uploaded pictures of himself and Frank, captioned only with two prayer emojis, perhaps alluding to a desire to reunite, or maybe just wishing his former boss good luck.",
      "Either way, it seems the pull of Champions League football and the prospect of playing under the coach who mentored him into stardom could give Tottenham the advantage in this bidding war, though United still cannot be ruled out.",

      "During JFK's presidency, a youthful Fergie was only in his early 20s, making a living playing part-time for St Johnstone and toiling away at his local shipyard.",
      "Despite being worlds apart from Kennedy's White House, Sir Alex felt a palpable connection to the US's youngest elected leader. \"I was fascinated with JFK when he was president,\" Ferguson told Insider.",

      "\"I got a letter from a lad who ran the JFK committee and he used to send me a lot of stuff and he sent me the autopsy report. I've actually got a brand new copy of the Warren Report (the official investigation into JFK's assassination) signed by (former President) Gerald Ford, its the only one of its kind.",

      "He scored an FA Cup hat-trick several months ago and has also contributed in the Premier League. One of those keen on McAtee are the Red Devils. Selling direct to the Old Trafford outfit would prove a hugely controversial move however.",

      "City have seen Cole Palmer flourish since leaving the Etihad. He headed to Chelsea where he knew he'd play regularly and saw his career blossom - which may factor in McAtee's thinking. Conversely, Phil Foden's patience in Manchester was richly rewarded.",

      "Arsenal may have a free run at landing Viktor Gyokeres after the striker told Manchester United he will not be joining them this summer - but Bayern Munich are now in the race for Benjamin Sesko's signature.",
      "The Gunners are in the market for a new No.9 and Gyokeres and Sesko are their top targets. Both are expected to leave their respective clubs in the summer transfer window after fine seasons and would likely be similar in terms of price.",
      "And after weeks of waiting to learn which striker Arsenal would go for, we seem to be getting closer to our answer.",
      "United's admiration for Gyokeres is well documented and the Red Devils even appointed his Sporting Lisbon boss, Ruben Amorim, as their manager earlier in the season.",
      "But Portuguese outlet Record has now claimed that Gyokeres' representatives have informed United that the 27-year-old will NOT be moving to Old Trafford.",
      "With United seemingly out of the frame for Gyokeres, Arsenal could proceed unchallenged. The report went on to add that the north London outfit were even 'preparing a second offer' for the Sweden star.",
      "The same cannot be said for Sesko, who was heavily linked with the Gunners last summer before signing a new contract with RB Leipzig.",
      "Bayern Munich are said to view Sesko, 22, as the ideal long-term successor to Harry Kane and could rival Arsenal for the striker's signature in the coming weeks.",
      "Bild have revealed that Bayern also tried to sign Sesko last summer and, like Arsenal, have not fully given up their pursuit of the Slovenia international, even if they have not held talks over a move like the Londoners.",
      "With Gyokeres wanting a move to The Emirates - and competition emerging for Sesko - a deal for the former Coventry City man could now look even more appealing for Arsenal.",
      "Although the summer transfer window doesn't officially reopen until Monday, the Gunners have already been busy at work behind the scenes with a move for Martin Zubimendi, the Real Sociedad playmaker, at an advanced stage pending the completion of a medical. The Spain international was also close to a Premier League move last summer, only to U-turn on a move to Liverpool at the eleventh hour.",
      "Kepa Arrizabalaga is also on Arsenal's radar in their search for a No.2 goalkeeper and is available for just £5million after spending last season on loan with Bournemouth.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "West Ham are weighing up a potential swoop for Gambian wonderkid Adama Bojang. The exciting 21-year-old forward previously caught the eye of Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea in 2023 before later joining French side Stade Reims.",
      "It's understood Chelsea were willing to pay up to £1million for his signature in a deal that would have seen Bojang land at Strasbourg, however, Blue Co did not wish to bid higher than that figure and Reims eventually wrapped up an agreement worth in the region of £3m.",
      "Bojang spent last season on loan in Switzerland with Grasshopper Club Zurich where he struck six goals and provided two assists in 27 appearances. In April, he struck a hat-trick against FC Luzern and also hit a brace against INEOS-owned FC Lausanne-Sport in February.",
      "The Gambia U20 international is widely regarded as one of the best African talents of his generation and was also courted by the likes of RB Leipzig, Eintracht Frankfurt and Hoffenheim before sealing his switch to France two years ago.",
      "Now he could be on the move again following Reims' relegation to Ligue 2 which means they will have no choice but to reluctantly listen to offers in a bid to raise funds.",
      "Earlier this week, West Ham, who have been tracking the player for some time, held talks over a move and according to sources, Bojang is expected to be available for a price in the region of £10m to £11m.",
      "But the Hammers are not the only Premier League club interested as Everton and Brentford have also made enquiries for the highly-rated attacker, who is being tipped to make an impact in one of Europe's top-five domestic leagues.",
      "West Ham are keen to strengthen their forward line and have also looked at 22-year-old Rangers star Hamza Igamane. The club's head of recruitment Kyle Macaulay has been tasked with identifying targets for Graham Potter as the duo look to make wholesale changes to West Ham's underperforming squad.",
      "Club Brugge midfielder Raphael Onyedika is another player of admiration while West Ham are also chasing the signing of a new goalkeeper following the departure of Lukasz Fabianski with Aaron Ramsdale among the names under consideration.",
      "They will also need to replace the likes of Aaron Cresswell, Vladimir Coufal, Danny Ings and Kurt Zouma who will officially depart the London Stadium at the end of the month as free agents.",
      "It's been a slow start to summer business as the West Ham hierarchy are looking to use sales to supplement their transfer budget but they have already rejected an informal approach from Chelsea for Mohammed Kudus which included the chance to sign multiple Blues stars as part of a potential swap deal.",
      "Kudus' West Ham release clause is only active from July 1 to July 10.",

      "Four second half goals from former Manchester United and Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez clinched an unlikely Soccer Aid crown for the World XI at Old Trafford on Sunday night.",
      "After trailing 2-0 at half-time and then 3-0 within ten minutes of the restart, the World XI produced an impressive comeback to win 5-4, inspired by Tevez's quartet of goals.",
      "Rapper Big Zuu, however, popped up with the winner in the closing stages, meaning an immensely popular figure turned out to be the match-winner.",
      "Here is how we rated the players out of ten:",
      "Joe Hart",
      "He was rarely troubled by a blunt World XI attack. He made one routine catch in a very quiet first half at his end of the pitch and was taken off at the break. 6",
      "Louis Tomlinson",
      "The One Direction star was the subject of cheers every time he got the ball. He started at right-back and regularly got forward on the overlap. 6",
      "Gary Neville",
      "The former United skipper started at centre-back and he didn't have much defending to do in the first half. 6",
      "Angry Ginge",
      "The United fan, who started at centre-back, produced an outstanding goal-line clearance to somehow keep out a chipped effort from Rivaldo in the first half. He also got the assist for Defoe's opener. 8",
      "Tom Grennan",
      "He started at left-back and went close to scoring England's second just minutes after Rooney's opener when he motored forward and bent a shot just over the bar. He regularly got forward and wanted to get on the ball. He also showed a willingness to win possession back. 7",
      "Jill Scott",
      "Captained England from the start and played with a trademark smile on her face. Carried the ball forward a few times from midfield before going off with just over 30 minutes on the clock. 6",
      "Michael Carrick",
      "Sat at the base of England's midfield, the former United midfielder bossed proceedings, picking out passes he so often did in his playing days. He played a superb pass to set Toni Duggan free to double England's lead. 7",
      "Jack Wilshere",
      "He started just behind Rooney and was awarded a free role. He delivered the cross that led to the opening goal and he enjoyed plenty of the ball after that. He popped up everywhere with possession and hit the post in the closing stages. 8",
      "James Nelson-Joyce",
      "Started on the right was arguably England's quietest player in the first half. He was replaced not long before half-time. 4",
      "Wayne Rooney",
      "The former United star opened the scoring with less than five minutes on the clock after finding himself in the right place at the right time to capitalise on a cross that wasn't dealt with. He linked up nicely with Wilshere throughout the opening half. 7",
      "Bella Ramsey",
      "Started on the left flank and huffed and puffed in the hope of getting on the ball and make something happen. Offered as much as energy as possible before going off after 21 minutes. 4",
      "Noteworthy subs:",
      "Toni Duggan",
      "Stepped off the bench and doubled England's lead on the stroke of half-time when she slotted a clinical finish past Edwin van der Sar. She timed her run to perfection to latch onto Carrick's pass. 7",
      "Paddy McGuinness",
      "After replacing Hart at the break, McGuinness was haunted by Tevez, who put four goals past him. He didn't cover himself in much glory. 4",
      "Jermain Defoe",
      "The former England striker scored twice after coming on at half-time, moving him level with Kem Cetinay at the top of the Soccer Aid scoring charts. His first goal was an emphatic finish and his second was a cool poke beyond Nicky Byrne. 8",
      "Aaron Lennon",
      "He rolled back the years by reminding everyone of his pace. The former Tottenham Hotspur man could have had two assists within minutes of coming on. 7",
      "Edwin van der Sar",
      "The legendary Dutchman was beaten twice in the first half, and he will not want to see the first goal back. He was unable to get his hands on Wilshere's cross after Nemanja Vidic tried to beat him to the same ball. He was taken off at half-time. 5",
      "Tony Bellew",
      "He was forced off with an apparent injury with just six minutes on the clock. N/A",
      "Nemanja Vidic",
      "Attempted to go for Wilshere's cross alongside Van der Sar and got caught out. However, he settled into the game and tried to help the World XI get up the pitch as much as he could. 5",
      "Richard Gadd",
      "The star of Baby Reindeer could not keep up with Duggan when she went scampering free to double England's lead. 4",
      "Harry Kewell",
      "The former Liverpool man's evening was over after just 15 minutes before being replaced by John O'Shea. He had a few touches of the ball but didn't do anything of note. 4",
      "Dermot Kennedy",
      "Tried a shot from distance five minutes before half-time that did not look all that far away from the top corner on second viewing. It was his only notable moment in the first half. 5",
      "Asim Chaudhry",
      "He was substituted after just over 20 minutes following a relatively low-key performance with few highlights. 4",
      "Kheira Hamraoui",
      "The former Paris Saint-Germain star tried to make things happen for the World XI and she had a couple of attempts at goal, the first of which was an inventive lob that required a comfortable save from Hart in the England goal. 6",
      "Diamond",
      "The Gladiators star lined up in attack that featured two former World Cup winners. She had a few touches of the ball, but her one foray forward was stopped by an excellent challenge from Angry Ginge. 5",
      "David Trezeguet",
      "A World Cup winner with France in 1998, the former striker had a fairly quiet first half, with England dominating. He flashed a shot wide not long before the break and went off not long after the break. 5",
      "Rivaldo",
      "One of the most famous names on the pitch, the Brazilian, now 53, lacked pace to make things happen as often as would have liked. However, he was unlucky not to make it 1-1. 6",
      "Noteworthy subs:",
      "Nicky Byrne",
      "Brought on at half-time and made a terrific double save less than two minutes in, denying Defoe and Bartlett when it looked easier for them both to score. He then got booked just moments later for handling the ball outside the box. 8",
      "Carlos Tevez",
      "The Argentine came on at half-time and helped himself to four goals in less than 15 second half minutes, inspiring an impressive second half comeback. His quartet of goals featured a cool finish at the end of a jinking run and a well-placed free-kick. 10",
      "Robbie Keane",
      "The former Tottenham man is a seasoned Soccer Aid star and the World XI benefitted from his experience up front. He provided the assist for Tevez's opener and was a real nuisance. 7",
      "Big Zuu",
      "An unlikely match-winner. He curled a smart finish past McGuinness, who made a theatrical attempt to keep it out of the net. 7"

      "It has become easy to understand why Manchester United identified Liam Delap as their top striker target for this summer's transfer window, hasn't it?",
      "Ahead of the transfer window reopening for business on Monday following a brief pause in proceedings, it already feels as though United's pursuit of a goal-getter has gone on for months. In reality, the window has only officially been open for ten days.",
      "Nevertheless, United's pursuit of a No.9 already feels as though it has taken countless twists and turns, despite the club not yet lodging an official bid for a striker as yet.",
      "After missing out on Delap to Chelsea, who signed him from Ipswich Town via a £30million release clause, United are being forced to look elsewhere. The England Under-21 international had scored a respectable 12 goals in his first full season in the Premier League and signing him would have been a relatively straightforward task.",
      "Instead, United's search for a goal-getter does not currently offer an obvious answer. They are being linked with a cluster of strikers, but they are yet to table a bid for any of them.",
      "Having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and being keen on signing Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for potentially a similar fee, funds raised from player sales will be key to United's hopes of signing the striker they so desperately crave.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference and failing to sign a striker this summer is a non-negotiable. But as they are quickly finding out, goalscorers are not easy to obtain.",
      "Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli are two of the most sought after strikers in Europe right now and both are expected to be on the move this summer. They have boasted impressive records in front of goal in recent seasons and either of them would be an excellent signing for United.",
      "However, Gyokeres reportedly prefers a move to Arsenal over Old Trafford, and Sporting president Frederico Varandas recently quashed suggestions the striker could leave for €70m (£59m) this summer. Osimhen, meanwhile, is understood to have eye-watering wage demands.",
      "It is no secret United, to land an elite-level striker this summer, will have to loosen their purse strings and splash the cash. However, there is a fine line between getting value for money and paying over the odds.",
      "United have had their pants pulled down on countless occasions in recent years, and improving their success rate in the transfer market is one of Ineos' leading priorities. United's recruitment strategy has improved for the better over the last 12 months or so.",
      "However, just as chief executive Omar Berrada warned following the conclusion of last summer's window, United cannot get back into the habit of paying over the odds for players.",
      "\"We were able to do it [the summer window] in a financially sustainable way,\" Berrada said last September.",
      "\"We were quite disciplined about the valuations we were giving to the players who were going to come in. We stuck to those valuations. I think [sporting director] Dan [Ashworth] and the team did a fantastic job in the negotiations process.",
      "\"The reason I mention that is if you make a mistake and if you overspend or get a player who can cost you too much, it can set you back. Which is why you need to be able to take those decisions and make the right ones consistently over time to be in a position to win consistently.\"",
      "After years worth of reckless spending, United can ill-afford to undo the progressive steps that have been made over the last 12 months through sheer desperation for a goalscorer. Of course, United would love to secure the services of a new No.9 as quickly as possible, but they cannot lose sight of the finances and being sensible.",
      "It is easy for any club to become frustrated in the pursuit of a player, particularly when their respective position is in such desperate need of fresh blood, but United have to remain disciplined in their approach for a goal-getter.",
      "It is not impossible that either Gyokeres or Osimhen could arrive at Old Trafford at some point this summer, but the chances of them doing so looks set to boil down to who can offer the best financial package.",
      "United do not have a bottomless pit this summer and they have already spent north of £60m on Cunha. It is obvious why Delap topped their wish list."

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United transfer news, views and rumours on Sunday, June 15.",
      "Even though the transfer window is closed until Monday, 16 June, The Reds are still actively pursuing targets ahead of the start of pre-season. Matheus Cunha has already arrived and there is optimism he could be followed by Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The Brentford star is another attacker wanted by Ruben Amorim but United have already failed with an offer worth £55m. Tottenham are now thought to have joined the race.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is a trending name with United, but they have been dealt a blow in that pursuit. Reports claim that the former Brighton & Hove Albion and Coventry striker would prefer a move to Arsenal.",
      "There also remains speculation about the futures of Antony, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford following their loans last season. Bruno Fernandes, meanwhile, ended rumours regarding his time at Old Trafford by turning down a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Follow the latest United transfer news:",
      "That's all for tonight.",
      "Join us tomorrow for more transfer news as the transfer window OFFICIALLY OPENS!",
      "The updates regarding Viktor Gyokeres never seem to end.",
      "According to Portuguese outlet Record, Arsenal have 'frozen' their pursuit of the striker due to Sporting CP's asking price. It's claimed that a bid worth £47m plus £8.5m in add-ons has already been turned down.",
      "Another offer from the Gunners worth £60m was then rebuffed with Sporting wanting £85m - Gyokeres' release clause.",
      "Real Betis and Man United met to discuss Antony in England recently, according to Spanish outlet ABC.",
      "The paper has suggested that both teams have acknowledged that a deal could take a number of weeks to finalise but it's thought Betis are 'growing optimistic' about bringing Antony back to the club.",
      "Now then, a positive update coming out of Germany regarding Hugo Ekitike.",
      "BILD have claimed that the Eintracht Frankfurt striker is open to joining United with it understood that they are the only club to contact Frankfurt so far.",
      "It's said his brother and United have been in contact.",
      "Mundo Deportivo have claimed that Aston Villa are considering selling their women's team in an attempt to sign Marcus Rashford.",
      "Financial expert Dan Plumley has revealed that offsetting their women's team could help them bring Rashford in. Plumley has claimed Villa could look to exploit a legal loophole to free up resources to sign him.",
      "Man United's hopes of landing an audacious move for Victor Osimhen have taken a hit.",
      "According to Valentin Furlan and Rudy Galetti, the striker wants Champions League football after playing in the Europa League with Galatasaray season.",
      "The journalists claim that United and AC Milan aren't thought to be the frontrunners.",
      "Porto have joined the race to land Southampton star Tyler Dibling, according to reports in Portugal.",
      "Record have claimed that the Portuguese side are exploring a way to make a deal happen. Dibling caught the eye from United and a number of teams in recent seasons with Chelsea, Tottenham and Bayern Munich all keen.",
      "The report adds that Porto are exploring possible swap deals or a possible loan.",
      "The sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Casemiro could save Man United a sensational £90m.",
      "That's according to former Manchester City financial advisor Stefan Borson, who claims the four exits could help United significantly balance their books. “It will make an enormous difference to Manchester United if they can remove Sancho, Antony, Casemiro and Rashford from the wage bill,\" he told Football Insider.",
      "“Those players don’t play very much. Casemiro did play in the second half of the season, but generally he’s going to play less given his age. If they can remove all of those players, the total cost of those players for next season could be £80million, maybe £90million.",
      "“That’s a huge part of their wage bill just on those four players. So, if they can get those players out the door, then the financial side of things will continue to improve.\"",
      "Man United were reportedly offered Douglas Luiz in a swap deal for outcast forward Antony.",
      "According to GIVEMESPORT, Juventus put Luiz on a table for United when former director of football, Cristiano Guintoli, was at the club. The Italian left less than a fortnight ago but it was suggested Antony was of interest.",
      "The report claims that initial talks were held to consider the possibility of a move.",
      "Manchester United face their most pivotal transfer window in recent memory after a disastrous campaign.",
      "Losing the Europa League final and finishing 15th spot in the Premier League means that there will be no European football at Old Trafford for the first time in over a decade. It means United's task of rebuilding under Ruben Amorim has become that little bit harder, for multiple reasons.",
      "And with the transfer window reopening in a couple of days, I've taken a look here at what a best-case summer would look like for Amorim and the Reds.",
      "Former Chelsea star Florent Malouda has had his say on Jadon Sancho's struggles since moving to the Premier League.",
      "\"If you look at Jadon Sancho’s history in the Premier League, he has never really been able to express his talent as much as he did in Germany,\" he said via Bet365.",
      "\"In Germany, the best club for him was Dortmund, they gave him the platform to express his talent. I think the challenge for him is to be able to accommodate himself with talented players around him and see how he can develop his game, creating connections with other players.",
      "\"If he manages to do that, I think he can succeed with Manchester United. There are not so many clubs bigger than United. I'm not talking about where they stand in the league, but in terms of expectations and platform, it's one of the best clubs in the world.",
      "\"What we need to see is some type of leadership – that is a personal mindset that he needs to develop. I can’t see Sancho on another loan, I think he needs to show resilience. I think he needs to overcome his situation because he has the potential.",
      "\"Leaving is a way to escape your responsibilities. We expect more from him and he should be the one to demand more from himself.\"",
      "Manchester United have reportedly initiated talks with Victor Osimhen regarding a potential move to Old Trafford, only to learn subsequently that Viktor Gyokeres has declined the chance to link-up with Ruben Amorim at the club.",
      "United are on the hunt for attacking options and have been evaluating several strikers due to their impressive form in recent seasons. Osimhen and Gyokeres were, according to reports, being closely watched by scouts.",
      "Footmercato reported that the Premier League team have begun negotiations with Osimhen, with an expectation to still chase Gyokeres' signature from Sporting CP. However, reports from Portugal now indicate that the Sweden international spurned the offer to join United, and his representatives have relayed this decision to club higher-ups.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho's career at Manchester United has been anything but uneventful.",
      "For all the winger's obvious talent, disciplinary issues have threatened to derail his time at the club on a number of occasions. That threat has now become a reality.",
      "Perhaps the biggest shame in all of this is that Ruben Amorim and Garnacho tried to make it work. After Amorim dropped Garnacho and Marcus Rashford from the Manchester derby squad in December, the latter didn't make another appearance for United and was soon shipped out on loan to Aston Villa. Garnacho went the opposite way, playing a part in every game after the derby victory bar the final day win over Villa.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "For all the poor decisions and mismanagement at Manchester United, perhaps one of the club's biggest problems is something they can do very little about.",
      "Countless players have arrived at Old Trafford and been swallowed up by the pressure of playing for one of the world's biggest clubs. And when said players ultimately leave United and thrive elsewhere, little consideration is given to the fact their upturn in form may well be down to the reduced pressure levels at clubs where the spotlight isn't quite so intense.",
      "Of course, United might not be able to do anything about the pressure that comes with representing the club, but they can ensure the players they sign are ready to cope with the demands that come with pulling on that famous red shirt.",

      "According to ESPN Argentina, Manchester United have began talks with Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez over a summer move.",

      "It feels a long time ago that the Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United began with a bang at Portman Road.",
      "Barley two minutes in and Marcus Rashford had scored for the Reds at Ipswich and prompted plenty to wonder whether he might prove the striker beneficiary in the central role in Amorim's set-up.",
      "Within a matter of months, Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa and he has no future at United. The decision to cast him aside is ultimately one for Amorim and it will likely still provoke debate while United continue to struggle in front of goal.",

      "Matheus Cunha arrived in Switzerland as a teenager, not speaking the language and taking on the 5,600-mile move solo.",
      "It was a daunting career step to swap Brazil for Sion but for Cunha, this was the right move at the right time. It turned him from South American prospect into a performer on the European stage and set him on a path that this month saw him join Manchester United.",

      "Victor Osimhen remains a real option for the Reds, according to claims by United in Focus.",
      "“We’ve known about United and Osimhen for months, and it is genuine interest,\" claims reporter Graeme Bailey.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly been dealt a blow by Viktor Gyokeres after the Sweden international signalled his intention to sign for Premier League rivals Arsenal. Ruben Amorim brought the forward to Sporting CP with the talisman steering the Portuguese club to back-to-back league titles and a double last term.",
      "The 27-year-old faces a transfer saga this summer with reports suggesting that United, Arsenal and Chelsea are among the clubs vying for Gyokeres' signature. During the first stage of the transfer window, the Old Trafford side welcomed Matheus Cunha as their first signing through the door before expressing an interest in Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Read more here",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has added fuel to the transfer fire on social media, following reports that Tottenham Hotspur want to intercept his proposed move to Manchester United. The Brentford forward is rumoured to be swayed after Spurs announced head coach Thomas Frank as Ange Postecoglou's successor on Thursday.",
      "Earlier this summer, Mbeumo reportedly selected United as his preferred club despite competing interest from Arsenal, Newcastle United and Tottenham. However, this decision was made before Frank left Brentford for North London, and it's suggested that the Dane wants his star player to follow him.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United transfer news.",
      "The window may currently be closed but United will still be busy behind the scenes, trying to wrap up several deals after a terrible season.",
      "Stay tuned throughout the day for all the latest from Old Trafford!",
      "Gary Pallister has tipped United to sign Liam Delap despite missing out on the Chelsea striker this summer. The former Reds defender said: \"Liam Delap is still young.",
      "\"He is a prospect but Manchester United need something more ready made in the Premier League. I would have liked to have seen him at Old Trafford, but he is still a name for the future and not yet ready to lead the line for a team like United.",
      "\"He’s decided on Chelsea and United have to accept that at the moment the club is not as alluring as it once was given there is no Champions League football, finishing fifth bottom in the Premier League.",
      "\"We are now relying on the name alone to attract players...\"",
      "Andre Onana has cast doubt over his future at United. The 29-year-old goalkeeper was recently asked if he plans to leave Old Trafford this summer after Ruben Amorim's side missed out on Europe.",
      "He sees his contract expire in June 2028. When quizzed on his future by a reporter from AllezLesLions during the off-season, Onana replied: \"Will I leave? I don't know, we'll see!\"",
      "During an interview with Viaplay back in May, Thomas Frank was quizzed on Bryan Mbeumo's future. As quoted by the Evening Standard, the former Brentford boss said: \"It's clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount.",
      "\"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. \"hen it's clear that it's impossible to replace him one-for-one. It cannot be done. There is a reason why he costs X number of million pounds, and we do not have X number of million pounds to buy for.",
      "\"I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club?",
      "\"And then with seven assists plus his work-ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\"",
      "According to the Mirror, United have already started looking at alternatives to Viktor Gyokeres. The report claims that the Reds are ready to ramp up interest in Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt, who has been heavily linked with a move to Liverpool this summer.",
      "It's said that the Bundesliga outfit wants £80m for the 22-year-old striker. The Mirror reckon that United won't make a bid until the valuation is 'significantly' reduced.",
      "According to The Times, Viktor Gyokeres would prefer a move to Arsenal over United. The report claims the Sporting striker decided he'd rather join Mikel Arteta's side following exploratory talks with the Europa League finalists.",
      "That said, The Times claims that Arsenal are yet to make a decision, with Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig also on their shortlist. As it stands, it remains to be seen whether the Gunners push ahead with their bid to sign Gyokeres."

      "The summer transfer window has officially reopened for business, meaning Manchester United have between now and 7pm on September 1 to get all of their shopping done.",
      "After opening earlier than usual due to an exceptional registration period for the Club World Cup, the window temporarily closed last Tuesday evening, marking a six-day pause in transfer activity. However, it will now remain open without any further interruptions.",
      "Despite a temporary pause, that did not stop United from officially announcing the arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million last Thursday. United had announced they had reached an agreement with their Premier League counterparts to sign him on June 1.",
      "Cunha had been a long-term target for United, meaning they are delighted to have secured his signature nice and early. He should be the first of a handful of new recruits at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "In securing Cunha's signature so early, United made their mark on the window quickly, highlighting just how keen they are to show some ambition.",
      "As well as getting a deal in place to sign Cunha prior to the temporary closure, they also made their first move for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They saw an opening offer of £55m turned down just under a fortnight ago but talks between the two clubs remain ongoing.",
      "Mbeumo has informed Brentford's hierarchy that Old Trafford is his preferred destination this summer. However, United are yet to table a second bid for the Cameroon international.",
      "However, since the window temporarily closed last Tuesday, Tottenham Hotspur have also been credited with interest in Mbeumo. That was almost inevitable after Spurs recently appointed Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach.",
      "Despite having an excellent relationship with Frank, Mbeumo is understood to be determined to move to Old Trafford. United want to strengthen their attacking options this summer and adding the versatile attacker to the addition of Cunha would be a real statement of intent.",
      "It is believed Brentford are holding out for a fee similar to what United paid for Cunha, although the Brazilian was signed via a release clause. United would like to sign Mbeumo ahead of pre-season starting in July.",
      "Elsewhere, United remain determined to sign a striker this summer. After missing out on Liam Delap earlier this month, they have been linked with a crop of alternative options, including the likes of Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and most recently Eintracht Frankfurt ace Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Whoever United plan to try and make their first-choice No.9 will be dependent on outgoings. The prospect of signing Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m will take their spending past the £120m mark before sanctioning any sales.",
      "United are also keen to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer. Head coach Ruben Amorim wants a new shot-stopper who can challenge and compete with Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. The addition of a specialist right wing-back is also possible.",
      "Much of what United will be able to do on the incoming front will rest on outgoings. Preparing to oversee up to ten departures, United have a collection of players they would like to offload this summer.",
      "The Reds have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales. Each of them spent time out on loan in 2024/25 and United want to offload them permanently ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "Rashford is valued at £40m, Antony is available at £32.5m and Sancho could command a fee of somewhere in the region of £20m-£25m after Chelsea paid a £5m penalty clause to break their obligation to sign him permanently.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave Old Trafford for the right price. Napoli had a £40m bid turned down for him back in January, meaning United are expected to ask for a fee north of £50m.",
      "The former is attracting interest from Inter Milan and it remains to be seen if they will submit a formal offer for the Denmark international. He scored just ten goals for United in 2024/25."

      "United submitted an opening offer of £45million with a further £10million in add-ons for Mbeumo, but it fell short of Brentford’s valuation and talks are continuing between the clubs.",

      "Using DataMB's player similarity generator tool to bring up players with similar characteristics to Mbeumo, one of the five names to emerge was Sporting star Francisco Trincao.",
      "The Portuguese international was considered one of the brightest young talents in world football when he made the switch from Braga to Barcelona in the summer of 2020.",
      "However, he never really managed to break into the first team and after a loan spell with Wolves, he returned to Portugal to sign for Sporting in the summer of 2022.",
      "There he worked under Amorim for the first time and the United boss managed to tap into the potential that saw Barcelona make their move for the 25-year-old.",
      "Rui Santos, former youth academy co-ordinator at Braga, worked with Trincao at the Portuguese club and explained how Amorim managed to rekindle Trincao's talents in the Portuguese capital.",
      "“We know that Ruben Amorim is a great coach and a great trainer of athletes who have excelled at Sporting. At a time when Francisco Trincão was being criticised, the coach never stopped believing in him. He always supported him,” Santos said.",
      "“In this case, Ruben Amorim was one of the pillars of Trincão’s success. In the past, many people had doubts and now everyone is certain.",
      "“Their rivals in Manchester, and obviously Sporting being a big club, are two of the great giants of football. Furthermore, United has one of Trincão’s ‘fathers’, Ruben Amorim, who has always believed in him. When an athlete is going to take on new projects, he cannot leave aside the financial aspect, but he also has to think about the next step.",

      "“At Sporting he is having a fabulous return, but here everything is aligned because, in addition to the financial aspect, we have a very important part: working with someone who believed in him when everyone else doubted him.",
      "“Manchester United, Premier League… The Theatre of Dreams came together with the technical team that always believed in him.”",
      "This season saw Trincao score nine goals and register 11 assists in all competitions as Sporting won a domestic double of the league and cup in Portugal.",
      "Trincao is said to have a £50million release clause in his contract, which has two years left to run at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, and shares an agent with United stars Leny Yoro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "United have done business with his people before and given Amorim's relationship with the player, as well as his impressive goal contribution statistics, they could do far worse than target a move for him as an alternative to Mbeumo."

While Spurs' increasing interest is a factor, it is claimed that CEO Omar Berrada is determined not to pay the 'United Tax' and overspend on the forward.",
      "Last week, there were reports that Tottenham were willing to splash £70m on Mbeumo.",
      "What MEN Sport says: \"It is refreshing to see United not being taken for chumps in the transfer window so far. They have been guilty of splashing obscene amounts of money on mediocrity before and while there is no suggestion that Mbeumo is that, there is still a ceiling to what United are willing to pay.",
      "\"As for alternatives, Eze already has the seal of approval from one United legend. Paul Scholes is a fan of the Palace man and it is easy to see why. He was arguably their star man last season, he is direct, quick and unlike Mbeumo is a natural in the more central position. The Reds would be on to a good thing if they were to target the Englishman.\"",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport understands that Inter Milan are pressing ahead with a move for Rasmus Hojlund this summer. They claim that while the Dane has openly admitted to expecting to be at Old Trafford next season, he is 'unhappy' with how his time at United has unfolded.",
      "It is claimed Inter want to bring him to the San Siro and that Hojlund would be open to the move. This week, it is expected that further talks will be held between all parties to discuss the 'formula' of the deal.",
      "What MEN Sport says: \"At the end of the 2024/25 season, this transfer looked unlikely at best. And yet, here we are looking at this deal advancing a step closer with talks about the finances regarding the deal. Letting Hojlund leave this summer would guarantee that United need to add another two strikers to their squad this summer.",
      "\"This perhaps puts further pressure on United to get a deal done for Viktor Gyokeres amid the drama happening with him in Sporting. Portuguese reports on Sunday reckon that Arsenal are taking a step back so perhaps the time is now for the Reds to strike and finance that move by letting Hojlund go."

      "Manchester United are heading into the second part of the summer transfer window desperate to complete some big deals to help overhaul their squad in Ruben Amorim's image.",
      "Thanks to the exceptional early transfer window, United have already completed one major signing to improve their team. Matheus Cunha arrived from Wolverhampton Wanderers after his £62.5 million release clause was met by the Reds. However, he is not expected to be the last new addition to this squad before the pre-season begins.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at four deals that United could complete this week to set themselves up for a busy summer.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Perhaps the most likely new addition this week is the Brentford forward. Reports before the weekend suggested that Tottenham Hotspur were keen to add the winger to their squad after appointing his old boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Not only that but Mbeumo was intrigued by the prospect of joining Spurs. However, the Cameroonian's stance for the time being is that he favours a move to United over other teams and that should hopefully give the Reds the edge.",
      "Mbeumo is seen as the club's top target at present and there will be a desire to get that deal done this week before moving on to other priorities.",
      "Marcus Rashford",
      "Should United get the Mbeumo deal over the line, the next priority will be sales to help boost Amorim's transfer pot. Rashford is one of those likely to exit this summer having fallen out with Amorim last winter.",
      "He spent the remainder of the campaign on loan at Aston Villa and while a move to Villa Park permanently appears unlikely, Barcelona have already spoken about their interest in him. Since then, Rashford has been putting in the hard yards to rebuild his fitness following injury and he appears to be in a position again to undergo a medical.",
      "With this being the case, perhaps an exit for Rashford could be sealed this week.",
      "Antony",
      "While Antony has not fallen out with Amorim in the same way that Rashford has, he is still as likely to exit the club. Out of all of those who United are looking to sell, Antony arguably has the highest stock at present.",
      "The Brazilian impressed at Real Betis and reports have claimed that the Seville club are trying to negotiate another deal for the winger this summer. The priority for United will be to sell Antony to reclaim some funds and it will be intriguing to see if this advances further this week.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund",
      "The Danish striker has insisted that he expects to be part of the plans at Old Trafford next season but after such a difficult second season in the Premier League, rumours persist that he could be on the way out of the club. Inter Milan are reportedly the team pushing hard to sign Hojlund and a move to the San Siro could be good for all parties.",
      "It is thought, according to the Italian media, that United want no less than £38m for Hojlund this summer to avoid a PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) loss. Whether Inter are willing to reach that mark remains to be seen but they are thought to be very keen on the centre-forward so this deal could accelerate in the next seven days."

      "Bayer Leverkusen striker Patrick Schick has 'received multiple enquiries' from clubs in the Premier League and Serie A, according to a report by Sky Germany.",
      "The 29-year-old's stock is currently high after he scored 27 goals in 45 appearances for Leverkusen during the 2024/25 campaign. It marked his best season in front of goal since joining the German club from AS Roma in January 2020.",
      "Of his 27 goals, 21 were plundered in the Bundesliga, meaning only Harry Kane scored more goals in the German top flight in the most recent campaign.",
      "Schick has been a fairly reliable source of goals in recent seasons, scoring 81 times in 168 games for Leverkusen. He scored 13 times in 33 games in 2023/24.",
      "With two years remaining on his Leverkusen contract, the Bundesliga outfit, who recently appointed former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag as their new boss, will not feel pressured into selling the Czech Republic international this summer. It has been claimed that if he does not leave the BayArena, he could be offered a contract extension.",
      "Although the report has not stated which clubs have enquired about signing the striker, who will turn 30 next January, he could be a realistic option for United to try and strengthen the tip of their attack this summer.",
      "The Reds are desperate to recruit a new No.9 and their search currently offers no obvious answer. They are being linked with a catalogue of strikers and the latest to have joined the list is Eintracht Frankfurt ace Hugo Ekitike, who scored 15 Bundesliga goals in 2024/25.",
      "United are also continuing to be heavily linked with Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli. However, none of the aforementioned players will come cheaply.",
      "However, despite his impressive record in 2024/25, Schick is unlikely to find himself categorised in the same bracket as Ekitike, Gyokeres and Osimhen, not least because he is slightly older and his record in front of goal has not been as prolific in comparison to Gyokeres' and Osimhen's.",
      "Despite scoring 40 goals since the start of the 2023/24 campaign, the 2022/23 season saw him score just four goals in 23 games, although his campaign was ravaged by injury issues. The season prior, though, he scored 24 times in 27 Bundesliga outings.",
      "United, despite signing Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and wanting to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal that could be worth a similar fee, do not have a bottomless pit to rely on this summer, meaning their hopes of landing a new No.9 are set to rely on raising funds via player sales.",
      "However, Schick is unlikely to command a fee as extravagant as what the likes of Gyokeres, Osimhen or Ekitike would. On the flip side, though, the Leverkusen striker is not held as high esteem as the aforementioned trio and will turn 30 next year."

Or will he be a back-up further forward. That looks his natural habitat but he has the capabilities and the intelligence to play deeper.",
      "Amad surely must be in the team but is that now be at right wing back? He was a brilliant performer last season and a role must be found for him.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo made his England breakthrough in the middle of midfield, but can play as an attack minded role and even filled in up front last term. He is now one of several options in a crowded position.",
      "The youngster might benefit from his ability to play multiple positions but you get the sense that for his career to kick on, a natural home is needed.",

      "For all the poor decisions and mismanagement at Manchester United, perhaps one of the club's biggest problems is something they can do very little about.",
      "Countless players have arrived at Old Trafford and been swallowed up by the pressure of playing for one of the world's biggest clubs. And when said players ultimately leave United and thrive elsewhere, little consideration is given to the fact their upturn in form may well be down to the reduced pressure levels at clubs where the spotlight isn't quite so intense.",
      "Of course, United might not be able to do anything about the pressure that comes with representing the club, but they can ensure the players they sign are ready to cope with the demands that come with pulling on that famous red shirt.",
      "In Matheus Cunha, they have signed a player who is all too used to being under the spotlight.",
      "While Wolves may not be the biggest team in England, two-and-a-half years spent in the Premier League after a stint in La Liga with Atletico Madrid along with 15 caps for Brazil mean he is ready for what's about to come his way.",
      "\"I'm so free for that (the pressure that comes with playing for United), honestly. I think I'm grateful to be part of the biggest national team in the world, the pressure there is also huge,\" he told MUTV. \"And I learned a lot. I learned a lot, I think in the beginning it was a little bit different in parts for me.",
      "\"To be honest, sometimes I don't think I managed well and I think I learned from the mistakes. I don't think it's mistakes, it's normal, it's learning. To come here now is the best moment in my life to also feel open for these kind of details.\"",
      "The final part of that answer is also telling. One of the reservations some fans have had over Cunha is his disciplinary record. He was suspended for a combined six matches last season following a full-time scuffle with an Ipswich Town security guard and a red card at Bournemouth. He admits he's learnt a lot in his career so far and is ready for the challenge.",
      "At 26, Cunha is coming into his prime and his 15 Premier League goals last season suggest United have got themselves a real quality player.",
      "With experience of playing in the Premier League, experience of playing in some of Europe's other top leagues and a relatively modest fee of £62.5m for a player who should fit seamlessly into Ruben Amorim's system, it really does feel like the only thing that could get in Cunha's way is the pressure of playing for United.",

      "Manchester United could have potentially moved back ahead of Arsenal in their mooted pursuit of Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres as the Gunners reportedly get ready to \"freeze\" their interest.",
      "Earlier this week, the Swede's seemingly drama-free exit from the Portuguese team took a twist when Sporting's president Frederico Varandas denied that he agreed to let Gyokeres leave for £51million, plus £8.5million in add-ons. Gyokeres' camp hit back that they had this gentleman's agreement in writing, but Sporting have been holding firm that he will only leave for the release clause of £68million in his contract.",
      "While this has been going on, Arsenal have reportedly been looking to force through a deal for less than that fee. However, despite the striker appearing to be unhappy with the situation, the Lisbon club have stuck to their guns.",
      "Now, reports in Portugal suggest Arsenal have reached their breaking point and are now freezing their pursuit of the striker. Record understands that the Gunners are now looking at different options to strengthen their forward line for Mikel Arteta next season.",
      "RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is currently at the top of Arsenal's list, while Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins is also thought to be an option if Gyokeres can't be purchased. In the meantime, this is all good news for United, who are eager to add a centre-forward to their attack.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly still regards Gyokeres as his \"top target\" for this summer after the pair enjoyed a fruitful relationship at Sporting before United swooped in for the head coach. The 27-year-old would arguably be ideal for United considering he knows the system Amorim wants to play, plus his goal-scoring record in Portugal is fantastic.",

As Arsenal also keeps tabs on the Sporting sensation, it's clear that neither Osimhen nor Gyokeres would be let go without commanding substantial transfer fees.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly decided on their transfer alternative to Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres, who has his heart set on a move to Arsenal.",
      "The Swedish forward believes he needs to join a club competing in the Champions League next season and vying for the Premier League title.",
      "United insiders have declined to comment on Portuguese reports suggesting the 27 year-old has expressed disinterest in reuniting with his ex-Sporting coach Ruben Amorim in Manchester, reports the Mirror.",
      "However, it is believed that the Reds have already begun scouting for alternative targets - and are prepared to intensify their pursuit of Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Ekitike, a 22 year-old France Under-21 international, has also caught Liverpool's eye after netting 22 goals for the German side last season.",
      "However, Frankfurt's £80 million asking price for the former Paris St Germain forward would need to be significantly reduced before United make an offer.",
      "United have already been told that they will have to come up with an acceptable offer for Frankfurt, with the club's sporting director Markus Krosche telling Wiesbadener Kurier: \"If the price isn't right, then he'll simply stay with us. We don't have to sell Hugo.\"",
      "As for Gyokeres, the transfer saga around the Sweden striker has taken many twists and turns this week. On Thursday he took to the social media platform Instagram to break his silence on mounting speculation on his future, saying: \"There is a lot of talk at the moment, most of it is false.",
      "\"I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "His comments came after Sporting president Frederico Varandas gave his understanding of the situation around a supposed 'gentleman's agreement' for the player to leave for around £60m instead of his £84m release clause.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" Varandas said. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\""

      "Transfer insider Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Alejandro Garnacho leaving Manchester United to reunite with a former boss will be “complicated.”",
      "Garnacho’s future is almost certain to be away from United. He caused a stir when he complained about having a small role in the Europa League final – which United lost – and then called the season sh*t.",
      "Following that, on the Red Devils’ post-season tour of Southeast Asia, Ruben Amorim reportedly told him: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "It has since been reported that the United boss has weakened the club’s negotiating position, as sides are aware he wants rid of Garnacho, so won’t pay the asking price, aware the Manchester outfit will probably accept less than they’d initially hoped for.",
      "One of the sides interested in Garnacho are Bayer Leverkusen, with Erik ten Hag – who managed the winger at Old Trafford – recently becoming their boss.",
      "According to transfer insider Romano, that move to reunite the pair will not be an easy one to be pulled off.",
      "He said on X that Garnacho’s ‘priority is to remain in the Premier League,’ while he’s expected to leave United. Despite Leverkusen’s ‘interest and and Ten Hag’s appreciation, the deal looks complicated’.",
      "It has previously been suggested that Chelsea is the United man’s preferred destination. Indeed, he has reportedly told his agent to make it clear that he’d like to land at Stamford Bridge this summer.",
      "But Romano has reported there’s not a massively high chance that move goes through. He recently stated there is a ’35 per cent chance’ that Garnacho does move to the Blues.",
      "In the same report, he suggested the United man ‘could stay in the Premier League’.",
      "Indeed, that is his preference, but if no clubs in England make an offer, but sides elsewhere offer United what they want, it seems they will waste no time in getting Garnacho off the books.",
      "Whether that is Leverkusen remains to be seen, as the likes of Napoli, AC Milan and Atletico Madrid have all been linked with the Argentine, too.",
      "A rant from Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘weakened’ the negotiating position of Manchester United for one of their players, meaning his value might have dropped by £20million.",
      "Man Utd have to get busy with new signings but confidence in their ability to raise money through sales seems as woefully misplaced as ever.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed the precise chances that a Manchester United man joins Chelsea, as he has reiterated that the star ‘will leave’ the club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City star Jack Grealish is being ‘lined up’ for a move overseas and could impact one Liverpool transfer this summer.",
      "Man Utd legend Cristiano Ronaldo ‘demanded’ that Al-Nassr signed Alejandro Garnacho this summer during his contract negotiations, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal are among the clubs interested in signing Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been linked with Chelsea."

      "The Red Devils are reeling from a dour 2024/25 campaign as they failed to win a trophy and finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "Man Utd‘s poor performances reached a new low after Amorim replaced former head coach Erik ten Hag and he struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Amorim has a massive job in the coming months as he looks to build a team capable of competing for Europe as they were miles away from achieving this feat in 24/25.",
      "Man Utd are already active in the transfer market and it would boost their prospects if they land their standout targets, but Ferdinand has set a “finish” target for Amorim to pursue next season with Champions League qualification already ruled out.",
      "“I think if you finish 15th this year, United have got to be looking to finish in at least the top eight, top six,” Ferdinand told The Mirror.",

      "Most of United’s summer budget will likely go on a new striker and they are linked with several potential targets. Ferdinand has explained why he thinks they should snub Viktor Gyokeres for an alternative.",
      "“[Man United need] a centre-forward with experience. That’s it. I think United can go and get a lot of players and get loads of stuff,” Ferdinand said.",
      "“But I think it’s been evident that [Rasmus] Hojlund came in for huge money and hasn’t hit the ground running, has struggled really. [Joshua] Zirkzee hasn’t done much better than him, really.",
      "“So, I think you need someone in all the good teams you see. They normally have at least one of the attacking players, normally the number nine. And you go, actually, yeah, I can pin my hat on him. I can rely on him.",
      "“And I think Hojlund’s lack of experience has been a big factor. So, a striker, I don’t want any striker. I think I’ve said it on my podcast many times. I think a striker with experience, knows his right way around the football field, who the young ones they’ve invested in, like Hojlund and Zirkzee and Chido [Obi] can learn from.”",
      "On Gyokeres, he added: “I think Gyokeres, everyone’s talking about him. Again, I think if I’m looking at the market now and I had to pick him or [Victor] Osimhen, I’d probably pick Osimhen because of that experience.",
      "“And he’s shown he’s done it in multiple leagues now. And he’s done it internationally as well. I think he’s a top-class number nine who, again, the young players will be able to learn from. I’m not saying that Gyokeres would fail. I’m just saying that if I had a preference, I would go there.”",
      "A rant from Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘weakened’ the negotiating position of Manchester United for one of their players, meaning his value might have dropped by £20million.",

      "A shock Liverpool exit is gathering pace rather quickly, while the Premier League champions are reportedly back in for a Newcastle United star…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Tino Livramento – Newcastle to Manchester City\nIt’s been reported that City are preparing a bid for Livramento. He’d be a superb signing but this is a pretty unrealistic link and Newcastle have no intention to sell. Moving on…",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Anthony Gordon – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seems we’re back in summer ’24 as the Reds are plotting a ‘shock move’ to sign Gordon as they consider replacements for Barcelona-linked Luis Diaz. It’s hard to see this deal happening as Liverpool surely won’t pay £100m+ twice in the same window. Next…",

      "",
      "17) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all, though the latest suggests that isn’t the case. Sporting say they haven’t received any offers and they also insist that reports of a gentleman’s agreement for him to leave for £59million are b*llocks. Which Gyokeres disputes. It’s getting messy.",
      "",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Kyle Walker – Manchester City to Fenerbahce\nA contract has reportedly been offered to Walker, but if he’s not open to moving to Saudi Arabia, will he be open to playing in the Turkish Super Lig?",
      "",
      "14) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nWord is that Newcastle and Burnley are haggling over the price of a deal that Eddie Howe wanted to do a year ago, with the intention of Trafford and Nick Pope slugging it out for the No.1 spot. Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered. So Pope might be happy to hear that the two clubs are some way off an agreement with Burnley said to be asking for £40million.",
      "",
      "13) Antoine Semenyo – Bournemouth to Tottenham Hotspur\nThe Cherries reportedly want £70m, which feels unrealistic. A transfer still feels inevitable and Man United, Liverpool and Spurs have all been linked and Londoners are the favourites.",
      "",
      "12) Oleksandr Zinchenko – Arsenal to AC Milan\nZinchenko has been surplus to requirements for some time and with a year remaining on his contract, Arsenal are motivated to sell. One problem: his fat salary is too rich for Milan’s taste. If they can overcome that obstacle, this definitely fits.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nA very random one, but this appears to be gathering pace rather quickly. Atletico Madrid have made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing.",
      "",
      "10) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack. There is plenty of noise coming from Barca, but nothing Liverpool can take to the bank.",

      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus…",

      "8) 🔽 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nThis feels pretty likely but Arsenal are reportedly trying to hijack the transfer after Dortmund rejected a couple of Chelsea bids before the Club World Cup window closed.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo is giving mixed signals. At first he only had eyes for United but Thomas Frank’s appointment has given Spurs renewed hope. If nothing else, it should prompt United into decisive action in the form of a second offer, though they would ‘abandon’ a move on one condition.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nThe rumours around Saudi interest remain but Napoli are now eyeing the Kop’s Captain Chaos. Will they pay the £60million-plus Liverpool apparently want? Only if they’re still p*ssed from their title celebrations. Saudi still seems the Reds’ best hope of recouping as much of their £85million outlay as possible, but Nunez will have a say. Ambition, or his very own Scrooge McDuck money pit?",

      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein says it’s done.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord last week was it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder.",

      "The cheeky little early transfer window door creaked shut but the transfer window proper is set to open on Monday as we split our focus between Premier League comings and goings, and the inaugural all-new Club World Cup.",
      "The scouts will be out in force in the USA for FIFA’s pocket-lining competition to cast beady eyes on possible reinforcements and we reckon these ten players will be very much on display in the CWC shop window.",
      "",
      "Rodrigo Mora (Porto)\nRuben Amorim supposedly wanted Sporting to sign Mora as the teenager was coming up through the Porto academy and unsurprisingly retains an interest in signing him for Manchester United on the back of ten goals and four assists in his first senior senior season.",
      "That haul came despite Mora starting just 16 Liga Portugal games for Porto, largely in the left-sided attacking midfield role in a 3-4-3 formation that’s become infamous at Old Trafford since Amorim took charge.",
      "The Red Devils could do a lot worse than Mora as they scour the market for alternatives to top target Bryan Mbeumo amid interest from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham, but will have to pay a similar fee for the 18-year-old, with Porto inserting a €70m [£59m] release clause into his new contract.",
      "",
      "Goncalo Ramos (PSG)\nLiverpool are reportedly considering Ramos as a fall-back option should they fail to land any of their top targets – we’ve ranked ten of them – and PSG have also ‘offered’ him to United for £50m, which can’t have felt good for a striker with a more than reasonable goalscoring record for the Ligue 1 giants.",
      "And we wonder whether United should climb down from a high horse which has seen them make a failed attempt for Viktor Gyokeres ahead of various other doomed bids for elite strikers and consider a move for a guy whose 32 goals for PSG have come at a rate of one every 109 minutes when they’re current leading No.9 has scored 26 at a significantly reduced lick of one every 246 minutes.",
      "",
      "Randal Kolo Muani (Juventus)\n“I’m very happy at Juventus, I hope to continue there,” Kolo Muani said. “They welcomed me well, and I’m enjoying it.”",
      "Juventus are also thought to be keen on retaining the France international’s services after his eight Serie A goals for them since his January move, but it remains to be seen whether they can meet PSG’s demands. They wanted €75m [£64m] for his permanent transfer in January but that asking price is now thought to have dropped to around £42m as the Champions League winners look to cash in.",
      "United were also interested in January and are still being linked with the 26-year-old, while the majority of the Premier League big boys are keeping tabs.",
      "",
      "Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nHe could have moved to Arsenal for £70m-odd in January 2022 but opted for Juventus and is now available for just £25m after 56 goals in 142 appearances for the Old Lady.",
      "Here’s hoping a path from Benjamin Sesko, past Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and the other top strikers on Andrea Berta’s wishlist leads to a man they used to really want but now absolutely don’t.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund)\n“Let’s see how things develop in the future,” said Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl after revealing the “very, very respectful” talks with Chelsea over a move for Gittens before the CWC came to nothing.",
      "“We have different ideas about the player’s current value,” Kehl explained, in the process revealing that the Bundesliga club are at least open to his sale for the right price.",
      "They may well see the tournament as an opportunity to bring more clubs to a bidding war party for the Englishman, while Noni Madueke – who looked set to be the big loser had the deal been reached – should be looking at the CWC as a way to prove Chelsea don’t need to add further competition for his spot on the wing as Estevao will be hoping to impress through his displays for Palmeiras ahead of his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "",
      "Oscar Gloukh (RB Salzburg)\nGloukh’s performances at the European U19 Championships in 2022, including a stunning goal against England in the final, alerted the world to his potential. Interest from Barcelona was eschewed in favour of a move to Red Bull Salzburg, but he has since been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and, most recently, Aston Villa.",
      "“It makes more sense for my development,” Gloukh said when asked to explain why he opted for RB Salzburg, aware as we all now are that the Austrian club is one of the best springboards to bigger and better things in Europe.",
      "On the back of 11 goals and eight assists this season, the No.10 is now looking to follow Erling Haaland, Dominik Szoboszlai, Karim Adeyemi, Benjamin Sesko and other esteemed Salzburg alumni in taking the next step.",
      "",
      "Milton Delgado (Boca Juniors)\nBoca Juniors have put a timely €20m [£17m] release clause in the defensive midfielder’s contract ahead of a summer in which the 19-year-old is expected to turn plenty of heads in Europe.",
      "Inter have already been credited with interest in Delgado, who describes himself as a dynamic, tactically minded player, who loves to steal the ball from the opposition, which sounds like precisely what Manchester United hoped they were signing in Manuel Ugarte and explains why they too have been linked with the teenager with Ugarte failing to meet that expectation.",
      "",
      "Obed Vargas (Seattle Sounders)\n“At this point, what I’d say is I don’t know if there’s a club in the world that doesn’t know who he is,” Sounders general manager and chief soccer officer Craig Waibel told reporters of Vargas after a recent training session. “I mean, anyone who’s got analytics, he’s triggered and kind of set off the red alarms.”",
      "A come and get him plea if ever we heard one, and we can say with some degree of certainty that the 19-year-old central midfielder would be the first player hailing from Anchorage, Alaska to play in one of Europe’s top five leagues should he attract enough attention in Group B games against Atletico Madrid and PSG.",
      "",
      "Samu Aghehowa (Porto)\nHe came very close to a move to Chelsea in what would essentially have been a straight swap for Conor Gallagher, but the deal broke down over what Aghehowa saw as a ‘disrespectful’ attempt from the Blues to buy 50 per cent of his image rights.",
      "The 21-year-old went to Porto instead and has enhanced his reputation with 25 goals in all competitions. A €100m release clause makes a move this summer unlikely, but we suspect there will be feelers put out from the raft of Premier League clubs looking for a new No.9 if Aghehowa impresses.",
      "",
      "Richard Rios (Palmeiras)\nThe 25-year-old, who’s got 21 caps for Colombia, was linked with a move to Wolves in January as a replacement for Mario Lemina, while Nottingham Forest have also been credited with interest along with – you guessed it – Manchester United. Palmeiras reportedly want £20m for him.",
      "Manchester United will reportedly ‘reignite’ their interest in two strikers after losing out to Chelsea on the signing of Ipswich striker Liam Delap.",
      "With the end of season in sight, the race for Champions League qualification could be huge for Newcastle United in the fates of two strikers."

      "Chelsea blinked when given the chance to sign one of Europe’s top goalkeepers. If the Blues don’t get a second chance, there are other options.",
      "A number of big clubs are on the lookout for a new No.1 and there are some very good goalkeepers available – to varying degrees – this summer.",
      "Here are 10 top stoppers we think might be gettable…",
      "",
      "10) Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG)\nDonnarumma’s agent will have you believe the Italy keeper is available because he needs more leverage on contract talks with PSG, who want to keep their current custodian, but not at any cost.",
      "Of course, Manchester United’s name has been mentioned because that’s the oldest trick in the agents’ book, but Donnarumma himself said his priority is to renew with PSG. But only if he gets paid.",
      "",
      "9) Nick Pope (Newcastle)\nEddie Howe clearly isn’t entirely convinced by Pope given he’s trying again to sign James Trafford from Burnley. Newcastle want us to believe that Trafford would be arriving to compete for the No.1 position, but the new boy is not likely to make that move at this point in his career without a certain level of assurance. Which suggests Pope’s days as first choice are numbered; there would be considerable interest from other Premier League clubs in need of an experienced England international.",
      "",
      "8) Mads Hermansen (Leicester)\nThe 25-year-old keeper was one of very few to emerge with a smidgen of credit from a miserable season at the King Power. At least the Dane had ample opportunity to show what he can do – only Ipswich and Southampton allowed more shots on their goal.",
      "Before demonstrating that he could stay at the highest level while Leicester return to the Championship, Hermansen played a big role in the Foxes’ promotion to the Premier League. Brentford were linked before they found a bargain in Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "",
      "7) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton)\nRamsdale’s move to Southampton last summer made you wonder if the England keeper actually enjoys being relegated. Were there really no other better offers? Perhaps not, given the daft sod once openly admitted to struggling with concentration, but when his mind is on the job, Ramsdale remains a very good keeper. West Ham were sniffing and he feels like a good fit for Leeds.",
      "💷 The 20 most expensive goalkeepers ever: Chelsea shamed but Arsenal evolution clear",
      "",
      "6) Marcin Bulka (Nice)\nThe Nice no.1 has told the French club he fancies a move this summer, which they will be keen to facilitate since the Pole has only a year remaining on a contract he almost certainly won’t renew.",
      "The 6ft 6in giant, who began his career at Chelsea and went via PSG to Nice, has been catching eyes across Europe, and obviously Manchester United have been linked. But the Red Devils will have to wait until January since UEFA banned them doing any business with INEOS stable mate Nice until after this summer window.",
      "",
      "5) Vanja Milinkovic-Savic (Torino)\nThe Serbian stopper began his career as a youth player at Manchester United and he has been linked with a move to Old Trafford – maybe we should just assume that to be the case for all these keepers unless stated – after three solid seasons in Torino’s sticks. AC Milan, though, seem to be the frontrunners, with an agreement in place to pay the 28-year-old’s £17million release clause if they lose Mike Maignan.",
      "Only two keepers in Europe’s top five leagues performed better in relation to their expected goals against than Milinkovic-Savic, who conceded 11.4 goals fewer than the algorithms expected him to.",
      "",
      "4) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nWidely proclaimed as the best goalkeeper in the world but, more accurately in our view, he was the goalkeeper for the best team in the world. Argentina, that is, not Villa. That doesn’t mean he isn’t very, very good, and he would be an asset to any team looking for a stopper this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been linked, and he’d certainly be an upgrade, but Villa don’t have to give him away, even if they are the club in most PSR peril.",
      "",
      "3) Lucas Chevalier (Lille)\nIf Villa sell Martinez, then Chevalier is said to be high on their list of potential replacements. Though that plan could be scuppered by PSG if they can’t reach an agreement with Donnarumma and sell the Italy keeper to a club more willing to meet his massive wage demands.",
      "At 23, Chevalier conceded 7.3 goals fewer than xG suggests he should last season, with Manchester City said to be keen on the France call-up.",
      "",
      "2) Andriy Lunin (Real Madrid)\nIt seems Lunin is open to exploring his options away from Real’s bench because we have to assume he’s given up on ever replacing Thibaut Courtois as No.1. The penny should have dropped when Courtous returned from injury for the 2024 Champions League final when Lunin had played most of the season.",
      "Apparently, Real are open to selling the Ukraine stopper for £20m-25million, with the 26-year-old said to be on the radar of a host of top clubs.",
      "",
      "1) Mike Maignan (AC Milan)\nThe France No.1 is a year from the end of his contract and seemingly intent on leaving AC Milan after growing tired of the lack of progress in negotiations over a new deal. All of which presented a great opportunity for Chelsea to upgrade their goalkeeping option, none of which Enzo Maresca is happy with, but the Blues refused to take their opportunity.",
      "Milan apparently want around £21million but Chelsea were prepared to go no higher than £12million. Chelsea blew a clear run at Maignan, which should alert a number of big clubs. But here is the one keeper Manchester United haven’t been linked with, when they really should be.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United are ‘in talks’ over signing Burnley star James Trafford but they face competition from rivals Chelsea.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea have missed out on a key transfer target before the Club World Cup, with Fabrizio Romano confirming a deal is ‘off’.",
      "The ‘exceptional’ Club World Cup transfer window closes at 7pm on Tuesday, with a series of eye-catching possible signings including some Liverpool sales.",
      "Chelsea are expected to return with an improved bid for Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens after reaching a contract agreement, according to reports.",
      "If Chelsea secure the bargain signing of an AC Milan star, it could reportedly ‘spell doom’ for two of their players, with an ‘immediate exit’ suggested.",
      "It’s now a ‘matter of time’ before Man Utd sign AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan to replace Andre Onana, according to reports."

      "",
      "GK: Kepa Arrizabalaga (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, £71.6m)\nGianluigi Buffon was the world’s most expensive goalkeeper for 5,820 days. Ederson reigned for just over 13 months. Alisson only managed three weeks.",
      "Kepa retains that mantle seven years on, despite spending much of the intervening time not even his own club’s best shot-stopper, nor even at his own club.",
      "Chelsea continue to stumble and muddle through imperfect goalkeeping solutions despite otherwise spending literal billions assembling their squad, with Kepa deemed entirely surplus to requirements and ready to board the Arsenal train for a fair whack less than Chelsea paid.",
      "",
      "CB: Harry Maguire (Leicester to Manchester United, £80m)\nAnother whose stock has fluctuated wildly between most expensive player ever in his position and saviour of the future, to poster boy for financial incompetence, Maguire is on his latest successful quest to win over a manager who tried to phase him out.",
      "For his myriad faults and foibles, the England centre-half is as committed to the cause as they come and, as Ruben Amorim has taken barely any time to discover, can be useful if chucked up front while chasing a late goal.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United definitely just tried to copy Liverpool’s homework but missed most of the working out, figuring that simply spending a world-record sum on a defender makes them an unbeatable leader of men for the best part of the next decade.",
      "But across six years at Old Trafford, Maguire has given far more to the club than he has taken away. And if that sounds like a remarkably low bar for an £80m signing, he’s one of a handful who can say the same in that same timeframe.",
      "",
      "CB: Josko Gvardiol (Leipzig to Manchester City, £77m)\nThe Premier League always seemed to beckon for Gvardiol. Leeds almost signed the Croatian in the season after their top-flight promotion, while the centre-half publicly discussed his dream of playing for Liverpool for years.",
      "Try as they might, Chelsea simply could not extract Gvardiol from Leipzig in summer 2022, when Boehly was throwing money in every direction.",
      "A £77.4m bid was not enough to persuade Leipzig to sell then, but Manchester City found their breakthrough with a similar figure 12 months later.",
      "Gvardiol might not take immense pride in being named the club’s Player of the Season in what was a trophyless and often quite miserable campaign, but he has already collected a few winner’s medals in a brief spell at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "CB: Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool, £75m)\nBefore Liverpool signed Van Dijk on New Year’s Day 2018, the most expensive centre-half in history was David Luiz (£50m), the great man removing new teammate Thiago Silva (£32m) from that particular throne in 2014.",
      "One further step back from Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian connection takes the lineage of the world’s most expensive central defender all the way back to Rio Ferdinand, who joined Manchester United for £30m in 2002.",
      "The obvious importance of the position was appreciated, but not in transfer fee terms until Van Dijk. Liverpool laying £75m down on the Dutchman seemed to break the dam: there have been ten different moves worth at least £50m involving centre-halves in the subsequent seven-and-a-half years.",
      "Each have been chasing that transformative impact Van Dijk had on Liverpool, turning them from exciting but porous entertainers into stable, brilliant winners. They reached consecutive Champions League finals upon his arrival and dropped just 32 points in his first two full Premier League campaigns.",
      "The Dutchman has won the lot at Anfield, not missing a single minute of a title win and being named PFA Player of the Year in 2019, once again blazing a trail as the first defensive holder of that honour in 15 years.",
      "Even now, with the 33-year-old slowing down and past his imperious, perhaps peerless physical peak, there are few better overall. The sums were astronomical but pound-for-pound, Liverpool have rarely spent more wisely.",
      "",
      "RW: Antony (Ajax to Manchester United, £82m)\nDoubts were expressed long before Manchester United completed the second most expensive signing in their history, and the only 180s conducted since have been by Antony himself.",
      "Ten Hag vouched for and personally requested the purchase of his former Ajax colleague, which was a pitfall the Dutchman kept walking into until he was sacked.",
      "Antony never has lacked the appropriate work ethic and his attitude has rarely been in question either, but a lack of pace and general one-dimensional style did not translate at all well to the Premier League beyond the first few weeks.",
      "The years since his arrival have been defined by those involved in his signing trying their utmost to absolve themselves of blame. Antony has scored or assisted a goal every 319 minutes at Manchester United, compared to one every 152 minutes during that prodigious loan at Real Betis which has nevertheless not done quite enough to inflate his value to a point Old Trafford executives can sell without dying of PSR-related shame.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Brighton to Chelsea, £100m)\nFor about £4.5m, Brighton signed Caicedo from Independiente del Valle on deadline day of the 2021 winter transfer window. Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",
      "Caicedo long seemed destined to join Chelsea in the summer of 2023, but some painful attempts at bargaining with actual professional poker player Tony Bloom saw their bids fall predictably short at £80m.",
      "Then Liverpool crashed in with an offer of £111m, accepted by Brighton but certainly not by Caicedo himself, who had agreed personal terms with the Blues and was in no mood to renege.",
      "That prompted Chelsea to eventually find a breakthrough in talks with Brighton, paying a premium for the inconvenience caused and leaving Liverpool with a small amount of egg on their faces.",
      "If enough of the £15m in clauses are activated, Caicedo will become the most expensive player in Premier League history. He is already the biggest transfer step down.",
      "",
      "CM: Declan Rice (West Ham to Arsenal, £100m)\nIt took two rejected bids, a rubbish Manchester City hijack attempt, more chat about payment structure than anyone would care to admit and a torturous wait for The Paperwork to be filed, but Arsenal finally inserted what they hoped to be the final piece of their jigsaw before jetting off on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies. But two years in he has been unable to drag them over the line, although little of that is down to the shortcomings of Rice himself.",
      "",
      "CM: Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThere were precious few positives to glean from Chelsea’s miserable first season without their Roman Abramovich stabilisers. Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",
      "It took a while and some managerial change for things to properly click but Fernandez and Chelsea are finally on the right track.",
      "",
      "LW: Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m)\nA year is a long old time in football. While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",
      "It turns out that there aren’t many clubs out there willing to either match the sort of wage Manchester City offer, or the kind of fee they need to tick enough PSR boxes. And Pep Guardiola couldn’t care less.",
      "",
      "AM: Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United, £73m)\nAs far back as August 2017, Sancho has been on the Manchester United radar. Borussia Dortmund’s ability to grant the ambitious young forward a clear first-team pathway meant they secured the Manchester City academy talent but his immediate burst onto the Bundesliga scene only crystallised interest from back home.",
      "For each of the subsequent years until he finally arrived at Old Trafford in 2021, Sancho was frequently linked to a club hoping to build around a youthful British core; Manchester United even ‘forced the Germans’ into selling the England forward 12 months before he actually moved.",
      "But Sancho has been nothing close to the wait. Even during his “freedom” from 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for Manchester United, Chelsea paid £5m to specifically not sign him permanently.",
      "This place will belong to Florian Wirtz soon enough.",

      "The German’s price of £116m will make him the record arrival into British football but what of the current top 10?",
      "Here’s a look at the most expensive players in Premier League history and whether they sank or swam at their new clubs.",
      "10. Josko Gvardiol – £78 million\nThe £77m paid out by Manchester City for Josko Gvardiol made him the second most expensive defender in the world but already the Croatian has gone some way to proving he was worth the money.",
      "In a season of underwhelming performances, Gvardiol was a rare bright spark and was even playing out of position at left back.",
      "He featured in all but one league game, scoring five goals in that time, and has emerged as one of the best defenders in the league.",
      "City look to be in the market for a left-back, meaning Gvardiol should be able to move into his more comfortable centre-half position next season.",
      "Verdict: Hit",
      "9. Harry Maguire – £80 million\nIn United’s ‘banter era’, Maguire has become the unwitting face but look beyond the memes and the defender has been a rare consistent performer at Old Trafford.",
      "Joining in 2019, he has made 247 appearances for the club and as managers have come and gone, he still remained in the side.",
      "Maguire was at his best in the tail end of United’s 2024-25 campaign and even if it ended in a Europa League final defeat and 15th-place finish, Maguire was one of the few to come away with his reputation not broken beyond repair.",
      "Was he worth the £80m United stumped up? Probably not but there are plenty of worse signings in this list.",
      "Verdict: Hit",
      "8. Antony – £86 million\nSpeaking of…",
      "Manchester United’s signing of Antony has turned out so poorly that almost everyone involved is trying to claim it was not their idea.",
      "After a good but not spectacular season at Ajax in 2021-22, United opted to fork out up to £86m for the Brazilian but the wheels soon began to fall off.",
      "It started promisingly with a goal against Arsenal in his debut but his scoring soon dried up. The Brazilian ended his first year with eight goals in 44 appearances.",
      "Forever remembered for a roulette spin that went nowhere, Antony scored just one league goal in his second season at Old Trafford and after making only eight appearances in the 2024-25 Premier League season, he was shipped out on loan to Real Betis.",
      "It was in Spain where Antony recovered his form, earning a nomination for La Liga Player of the Month and helping Betis reach the Conference League final as he became the latest United player to flourish away from Old Trafford.",
      "His Betis performances were a small consolation for United who may be able to claw back some of his transfer fee but regardless of where he goes, the Old Trafford side are certain for a big loss.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "",
      "7. Mykhailo Mudryk – £89 million\nIf the logic behind United’s move for Antony seems shaky, the thought process Chelsea followed to sign Mudryk now seems outright absurd.",
      "After the war in Ukraine suspended football in the region, Mudryk made played 19 times in the 2021-22 season but his performances convinced Chelsea to part with £89m to bring him to Stamford Bridge in a move that represents peak Boehly transfer strategy.",
      "Since then, Mudryk has struggled to break into the team, playing 15 league games in his first season without scoring. He did at least play 41 times in the 2023-24 campaign, ending it with just 11 goal involvements.",
      "As a result, Chelsea looked to strengthen in that position, pushing Mudryk to the bench before he was hit with a provisional suspension for failing a doping test. But even as he waits for the result of the second test, Chelsea’s view on him was made clear when they gave his number 10 shirt to Cole Palmer.",
      "The good news for Chelsea is there are only another six years on his contract to go.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "",
      "6. Paul Pogba – £89million\n#Pogback did not turn into the homecoming that either player or club was expecting.",
      "Paul Pogba’s unveiling as a United player in a video backed by Stromzy seems a fever dream now and the Frenchman became the biggest figure of frustration during the Mourinho era.",
      "Aside from pushing Graeme Souness to an early grave, Pogba’s very brief moments of brilliance only made his time at Old Trafford even more exasperating as for every game he was good in, he would spend 10 as a passenger.",
      "Eventually, United cut their losses – allowing his contract to expire and Pogba moved back to Juventus again.",
      "In February 2024, Pogab was hit with a four-year ban for doping but it was reduced on appeal. Now able to play again, the Frenchman has been unable to find a club as of yet.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "5. Romelu Lukaku – £97million\nIf the other names on this list disappointed on the pitch, at least they did not take to the media to openly criticise the club and beg for a move away.",
      "Lukaku returned to Chelsea in 2021 on the back of an incredible season with Inter but the Belgian soon found himself a square peg in a round hole given Thomas Tuchel’s system.",
      "He went nuclear in his response, taking to the media in December to criticise Tuchel before saying he wanted to return to Inter “in the near future.” He was unsurprisingly dropped from the squad as a result.",
      "Peace talks between him and the now-England manager were held, culminating in a public apology from the player but a few months later and he was sent back out on loan to Inter.",
      "The following season, he stayed in Italy this time with Roma before joining Napoli permanently in 2024.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "4. Jack Grealish – £100million\nBefore heading to the Etihad, Grealish was one of the most reactive and expressive players in the league but he would not be the first, or last, to find himself just a part of Pep Guardiola’s system.",
      "The Catalan manager tends to leave new signings to it in their early days, meaning Grealish’s numbers were quite good, but as more was asked of him, the former Villa player’s performances took a nose dive.",
      "A great season in the Treble-winning campaign was followed by a stop-start season in 2023-24 and he ended the year with just six goal involvements in 36 games.",
      "Last season he was relegated to the bench, playing just 715 minutes in the league and now looking destined for the exit door.",
      "Summing up his City career then is a difficult task as he was a big part of the Treble success but has been limited since then and you don’t pay £100m for a bit-part player.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "3. Declan Rice – £105million\nIt seems odd to call someone who cost more than £100m a bargain but Rice is looking increasingly like that.",
      "Already a talent at West Ham, Rice has improved to be one of the best midfielders in the world and when the likes of Martin Odegaard have gone missing, he has stepped up to the big occasion.",
      "A duo of stunning free-kicks saw Arsenal ease past Real Madrid in the Champions League – the highlight of their season – and you get the feeling that if the Gunners are to break their league title drought, Rice will be key to that.",

      "2. Enzo Fernandez – £106.8million\nIf Rice has been money well spent, Chelsea’s version has yet to fully justify his price tag.",
      "Coming off a World Cup win, the fee Chelsea were going to have to pay Benfica was always going to be high but £106.8m looked particularly costly.",

      "The Cameroonian international has just one year left on his contract, although Brentford hold the option of a further year.",

      "Tottenham’s offer is worth £65million up front, with a further £5million in add-ons – £10million more than Manchester United’s most recent bid, according to the Mirror.",
      "The report says new Spurs boss Frank is keen to bring Mbeumo to north London after working with the forward at Brentford since 2019 and that the club have ‘launched a £70m bid to hijack United’s move’.",
      "Chairman Daniel Levy views Mbeumo as a statement signing for Frank’s first summer in charge following Ange Postecoglou’s departure.",
      "United, however, remain the forward’s preferred destination despite Tottenham’s higher bid and promise of Champions League football.",
      "Brentford have already rejected two bids from United, the latest worth £60million in total, leaving the door open for Spurs to swoop in with an improved offer – which they have now done.",
      "While United are unlikely to go higher than their current bid, they could still hold an advantage in terms of wages.",

      "Monday 16 June 2025 00:18, UK",
      "The second part of the summer transfer window has reopened again - and there is still more business to be done before it closes on September 1.",
      "Few knew what to expect from the special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it delivered 10 days of transfer drama and has now set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer.",
      "Manchester City were the big spenders after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on the first window's Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of AC Milan goalkeeper Maignan and ran out of time to conclude a deal for Dortmund forward Gittens.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he left Dortmund's training ground as Deadline Day drew to a close.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Other deals were announced in between windows, with Mathys Tel completing a £30m permanent move to Spurs and Leeds signing Lukas Nmecha from Wolfsburg on an initial two-year deal.",
      "Premier League clubs splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "City were the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side looked to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, having spent a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides have yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to United has been the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Dortmund for £32m and City also sold Yan Couto to the Bundesliga club for £25m.",
      "Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old was one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the US. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the tournament - and he could face Chelsea there while turning out for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as an option for Saudi Pro-League club Al Hilal as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup, but the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left winger is another priority, with Real's Rodrygo among the list of targets. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the Spaniard's £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool now agreeing a British-record transfer fee of £116.5m to sign Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after the Germany playmaker turned down a move to Bayern Munich.",
      "The Reds have, though, lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit, with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong.",

      "Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Andy Robertson.",

      "Diaz is one of two targets Barca have for the forward position, along with United's Marcus Rashford, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "United were unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. The Bees have turned down their opening £55m bid, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the Cameroon forward, valued at more than £60m.",
      "However, Tottenham have now held initial discussions with Brentford about a deal for Mbeumo, who is more intrigued in a Spurs move now that Thomas Frank has been appointed head coach, although the player is still understood to be leaning towards United, who are expected to go back in with a fresh offer for the for the 25-year-old.",
      "Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker. Gyokeres is one of their targets up front and approaches have been made for the Sporting frontman through intermediaries, although recent reports in Portugal claim the player would prefer a move to Arsenal.",
      "United have also entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike - who is also interesting Liverpool and Chelsea - according to Sky in Germany. However, it will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan, but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "United's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad having appointed Thomas Frank to replace the sacked Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south-coast club.",

      "With Hugo Ekitike linked with a summer transfer to the Premier League, Adam Bate speaks to Oscar Garcia, who coached Ekitike at Stade Reims, to find out more about the Eintracht Frankfurt forward and what he could bring to the Premier League",
      "Friday 13 June 2025 10:31, UK",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",

      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool as proposed landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is summer target for both Manchester United and Arsenal; Utd have made approaches through intermediaries to explore the conditions of potential deal; Sporting president says club has received 'no offers', but striker will be allowed to leave for less than release clause",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Man Utd have made an initial approach for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres through intermediaries, with Ruben Amorim a big admirer of his former striker; Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games last season; United also expected to bid again for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 09:42, UK",
      "United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for the 27-year-old. Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Man City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",
      "Man Utd saw their opening bid of £55m rejected. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",
