      "Martin Tyler has responded to accusations that he holds a bias towards Manchester United. The iconic commentator was the voice of the Premier League for over 30 years.",
      "The 80-year-old left Sky in 2023 after his contract wound down, but he has now addressed these claims that he is a United fan while revealing who he truly supports.",
      "Speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, Tyler recalled an incident involving ex-England striker Rickie Lambert as he opened up about accusations of favouritism.",
      "\"Ricky Lambert, first game of the 2012/13 season, Southampton at home against Man City,\" began Tyler. \"Ricky comes on as a substitute and he's come from the fourth tier and non-league and everything.",
      "\"And I've been to, as commentators do their prep, I've been down to see Southampton and I had met Ricky a few times before. I said, 'Oh, maybe I'll get to be the commentator for your first Premier League goal.'",
      "ALL OUT FOOTBALL ON YOUTUBE: Subscribe now to be the first to watch the latest episodes of In The Mixer and other original shows, brought to you by Sky Bet. Follow All Out Football on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and X.",
      "\"He said, 'I'm only sub.' So that was the backstory. He was the sub and he comes on and he scores. There was an accusation of a bit of personal bias, but it was for somebody who'd made a long journey to that moment!",
      "\"[Being accused of bias] happens to all commentators, especially with social media. People have their opinions. I did the League Cup final when Manchester United played Southampton.",
      "\"And the Daily Telegraph, I think it was, published two tweets the next day, one saying I was the most biased commentator in favour of Man Utd, and the other one saying I was most biased in favour of Southampton.",
      "\"So I did the whole profession a favour really because, yeah, you accept that, but I'm a Woking fan. I've never been anything else but a Woking fan. And so I know in my own skin that there's not a bias.\"",
      "Tyler, who admits he is a supporter of National League side Woking FC, also opened up about being accused of bias by Manchester City fans, notably when Jamie Mackie scored against them during their infamous 3-2 title-winning victory against QPR in 2012.",
      "\"Jamie Mackie's goal in 2012. I'm accused by Manchester City fans of being too excited,\" he added. \"QPR go two and up, they're trying to stay in the league and I gave it 'too much.' It was only one person to be fair.",
      "\"It was quite a surprise. I was at a reunion for the match where they were playing it and it hadn't come up yet, so the game was going through and Jamie Mackie scores on the video. They said, 'There you go, you're shouting!'",
      "\"But everybody's entitled to their opinion. We're all football fans and we've all got one vote in that respect and I don't have any problem with people thinking what they think.",
      "\"As long as you know in yourself that you're not doing something. Yeah, that is a bit of a confession about Ricky, but it was very personal and they even lost the game.\"",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim went into the international in a slightly more upbeat mood following a much-needed win over Sunderland. The head coach has come under intense pressure this season following a torrid start to the campaign, which has seen a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby and poor league form.",
      "There was speculation that Amorim could be sacked if he failed to beat the Black Cats, but a 2-0 win eased the pressure a little. The Portuguese then received more good news when he received a vote of confidence from minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has insisted he will give the head coach more time to prove himself, possibly as many as three years.",
      "As United fans await the trip to bitter rivals Liverpool following the international break, here’s a round-up of the major news surrounding the Red Devils...",
      "Saudi Arabian sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh has raised the prospect of a fresh takeover bid. The club's majority owners, the Glazer family, rejected a takeover by Sheikh Jassim Al-Thani’s Qatari consortium when they sold 27.7 per cent of the club to Ratcliffe for £1.25billion, but would consider offers of more than £5billion for their stake.",
      "The Glazers, whose controversial ownership of the club dates back to 2005, granted Ratcliffe’s Ineos group control of football operations. The American billionaires are deeply unpopular with the United fanbase, who would presumably welcome a full sale of the club.",
      "Al-Sheikh, who as the chairman of Saudi’s General Entertainment Authority is the key mover in the country’s growing influence in sport, has caused intrigue with a cryptic message on social media about a potential takeover of the club. He posted: “The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he’s better than the previous owners.”",
      "United have not publicly reacted to Al-Sheikh’s claim but there is believed to be surprise and bemusement behind the scenes at Old Trafford, given there has been no recent talk of any takeover.",
      "Despite Ratcliffe’s vote of confidence, it would be hard to see United sticking with Amorim if they become mired in the bottom half of the table, as they were last season, especially having spent more than £200million on new signings in the summer.",
      "If United do pull the trigger, United legends Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane have made it clear who they would like at the helm. Both Neville and Keane would go for long-serving Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane lavished praise on the fiery Argentine, who has led Atletico to the La Liga title and Champions League finals.",
      "The Irishman said: “I’ve said it for years, I’d like Atletico Madrid’s Simeone to go in there. I’d like to see him go there. I know his mate has gone to Arsenal [Andrea Berta, the Gunners’ sporting director who recently left Atletico].",
      "“I think he would just create havoc, but good havoc. He'd rock up to that place. No guarantees, but I'd just like to see his personality, his track record.",
      "“People might think styles of football, [but] they scored five against Real Madrid [winning 5-2] last weekend. He doesn't like his teams giving up too many goals or chances, but they can play a bit and fight.",
      "“At Liverpool [where Atletico lost 3-2 in the Champions League] a few weeks ago… the team aren’t as great as few years ago, but they still had fighting spirit. He’s on the sideline, he got sent off that night, I’d like a big personality.”",
      "However, Keane isn’t pushing for Amorim to be sacked just yet. He joked: “I’d still say give the man a chance, absolutely. Another week.” Neville agreed with Keane, adding: “I think I’d go with that. I’d go with Simeone.”",
      "However, Scholes went for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, although he had reservations about his long-time assistant, Jason Tindall, joining him. He said: “I’m not sure about his mate [Tindall], but definitely him.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has been on a goal-scoring spree since leaving Manchester United in the summer transfer window. The 22-year-old returned to Italy for the 2025/26 season, signing for Napoli on a season-long loan with a £38.3million buy-obligation clause included in the deal.",
      "After netting for Denmark during the September international break in his first competitive outing, Hojlund marked his Napoli debut with a goal against Fiorentina. Despite failing to score in his next three appearances, he bounced back in style with a stunning brace against Sporting CP in the Champions League.",
      "Just days later, Hojlund bagged the winning goal in a 2-1 triumph over Genoa and with his confidence soaring, it's no shock that he's been finding the back of the net while on international duty.",
      "His first goal in the World Cup qualifier against Belarus on Thursday evening came just 19 minutes into the match when he slotted home from close-range. Right on the stroke of half-time, Hojlund doubled his tally, instinctively tapping the ball into an empty net from just a few yards out.",
      "The initial shot that was saved into his path came from Patrick Dorgu, with the United wing-back finding the target just minutes later.",
      "Hojlund turned provider when he unselfishly squared the ball to Dorgu after a pass in behind, showcasing what could have been for Ruben Amorim.",
      "The latter played the entirety of the second half while Hojlund was subbed off in the 77th minute with Denmark going on to thrash their opponents 6-0.",
      "Despite Amorim bringing him to United, Dorgu has found it tough to secure a regular starting berth and often finds himself on the bench against supposedly inferior opposition, particularly when Amad gets the nod on the opposite wing with Diogo Dalot slotting into his preferred role.",
      "Three goal contributions from Hojlund will certainly catch United's attention given his battles at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, it's worth highlighting that his replacement Benjamin Sesko is enjoying a purple patch in front of goal.",
      "Following a difficult beginning, the Slovenia striker netted his maiden goal for the club during the 3-1 loss to Brentford before finding the back of the net again in last weekend's triumph over Sunderland, an achievement he branded a \"dream come true\".",
      "\"This [scoring at Old Trafford] has been the moment I've dreamed about as a kid, because the atmosphere here is unbelievable,\" he said.",
      "\"Not just after the goal, but after every tackle as well. It's a dream come true, I'm happy we won.\"",

      "Turki Al-Sheikh has sparked Manchester United takeover talk back into life. The Saudi Arabian billionaire set tongues wagging earlier this week with a mysterious social media post.",
      "On Wednesday night, Al-Sheikh claimed that the Reds were in the 'advanced stages' of agreeing a deal with a new investor. Given that Sir Jim Ratcliffe only recently acquired a minority stake, many speculated that the Glazer family could be discussing terms for their shares.",
      "On X, previously known as Twitter, the Saudi government official wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "Al-Sheikh, who was the owner of Almeria from 2019 until earlier this year when they failed to secure promotion to the Spanish top-flight, shared the post with his seven million followers. His cryptic message spread like wildfire, racking up five million views, 12,000 likes, 3,500 shares, and nearly 2,000 replies.",
      "The Saudi sports chief insisted he had shared the post as 'a fan who wishes the deal to happen'. He wrote: \"My yesterday's post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "\"Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "Predictably, Al-Sheikh's follow-up post also generated a staggering amount of engagement, racking up a million views at the time of writing. Within mere hours, the tweet had chalked up 900,000 views, 7,000 likes, 1,000 shares and nearly 500 replies.",
      "While the Saudi Arabian businessman may not be holding discussions with the United hierarchy over a possible takeover at Old Trafford, the influence he wields on social media is undeniable and will have certainly reached Ratcliffe's radar. Speaking on The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, Ratcliffe insisted that he retains authority over football operations at the club.",
      "When questioned about what would happen if the Glazers instructed him to dismiss Ruben Amorim, Ratcliffe replied: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss, who has owned just under 30 per cent of United since February 2024, continued: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rep... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe also hinted that he'll be at the helm of football operations for a while longer. The 72-year-old outlined his long-term vision, adding: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "When questioned if the United manager will be given three years, Ratcliffe said: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years.",
      "\"You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "Denmark boss Brian Riemer has expressed his delight that Rasmus Hojlund is now 'on a well-functioning team' after joining Napoli on loan from Manchester United. The forward endured a difficult two years at Old Trafford and is unlikely to return.",
      "Hojlund completed a deal that included a £5million loan fee, with the Italian giants said to be obligated to make the move permanent for £38m, should they secure Champions League qualification for next season.",
      "Last term, the 22-year-old scored just four goals in 32 Premier League outings and is already halfway to that mark with Napoli in just four Serie A outings. Hojlund has previously found success in Italy, while at Atalanta, where his form earned a £72m move to the Red Devils in 2023.",
      "The forward's international manager believes that Hojlund is capable of success in any division, including in England, however. Instead, he pointed towards the forward having a more accomplished side to benefit from as the reason behind his change in fortune.",
      "Riemer said, via TipsBladet: \"I think Rasmus has the quality for both leagues, without discussion. Does he fit in Italian football? Yes. There was no doubt about that, because he had already proven that. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t fit in English football. On the contrary, I would almost say.\"",
      "He added: \"The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced. It is more important than which league you play in.\"",
      "And Hojlund continued his promising form in international colours. The Dane scored twice in the opening period of a 6-0 victory over Belarus. The forward even found time to assist Manchester United team-mate Patrick Dorgu in the sixth minute of stoppage time of the first half.",
      "Hojlund appears to be enjoying his new environment too. After netting for Napoli against Sporting CP, the sharpshooter gestured towards the Champions League badge on his sleeve — a tournament he is only playing in due to leaving United.",
      "The loanee is not alone in finding more success away from his parent club. Marcus Rashford is performing well for Barcelona, while the likes of Antony hit the ground running on his loan to Real Betis last term.",

      "Manchester United are exploring the controversial idea of selling seat licences for the club’s proposed brand-new stadium. Plans for a state of the art arena were unveiled by the Red Devils in March.",
      "If those plans come to fruition, the new ground would take United’s capacity to around 100,000, with the project estimated to cost around £2billion. And in an effort to recoup some of that, Ratcliffe and fellow Man United chiefs have explored a radical plan.",
      "According to The Athletic, the club are exploring the option of selling seat licences. The club have sent a survey to match-going fans that would see supporters pay for the right to buy a specific seat. It is suggested that the licenses will be optional and will be targeted towards those in premium areas of the stadium. The plan is already in place in a number of stadiums in the United States but has yet to be adopted by clubs in Europe.",
      "Ratcliffe has been desperately attempting to rectify the club’s poor financial outlook since he arrived at Old Trafford. Despite record revenues, United lost around £33m in the past financial year.",
      "Ratcliffe has attempted to change the tide by enforcing two rounds of redundancies at the club - decisions that have not gone down well at all. But he believes that they were necessary for the future of the club.",
      "\"The costs were just too high,” Ratcliffe explained after featuring on The Business Podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times. “There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one has ever given me a free lunch. The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor, is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",

      "Meanwhile, Ratcliffe has predicted the situation to improve dramatically once the new stadium is completed in the future. He added: \"Those numbers will get better.",

Since Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos acquired a minority stake in the club in early 2024, there have not been too many further updates about a potential takeover or outside investment from elsewhere.",
      "Protests against the Glazer family, who are the majority owners of United, have taken place over the last two decades but it certainly looks as though they have no plans to complete an outright sale unless an offer exceeding a sensational £5 billion arrives.",
      "Talk around Ruben Amorim's future has been the dominant topic on United with Ratcliffe addressing exactly that on on The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, where he stated the club sacking Amorim if the Glazer's asked him to \"would not happen\". He also spoke more directly about the Glazers in that interview.",

The bid will be completely debt free, via Sheikh Jassim's Nine Two Foundation, which will look to invest in the football teams, the training centre, the stadium and wider infrastructure, the fan experience and the communities the club supports.",

Speculation has been sparked by a social media post from Saudi Arabian businessman Turki Al-Sheikh, who has hinted at possible new ownership for Old Trafford.",
      "Ratcliffe has since publicly discussed his plans, expressing his intention to give head coach Amorim more time but talk of new ownership is back in the headlines aagin.",

      "Saudi Billionaire Turki Al-Sheikh has reignited takeover rumours with a social media post stating: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",

      "\"Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "If the Glazers were to consider selling, it would require a bid starting at around £5.2 billion.",
      "As previously reported the club's current valuation stands at approximately £2bn, but the family would demand a significant premium reflecting potential future increases in value.",
      "This would also take into account the potential worth given the plans to build a new stadium. Back in March, plans were announced for a new 100,000 seater arena with an estimated cost of around £2bn.",
      "Last month, Al-Sheikh broke his silence on claims he he was rumoured to be considering a takeover of Championship club Bristol City.",
      "However, he took to X to simply write: \"It is not true that I will buy Bristol City FC (thumbs up).\"",
      "Al-Sheikh himself has not been linked with a move for United, but there has been considerable interest in the finances of the 44 year-old since his post on social media regarding the club overnight.",
      "The latest talk about a possible takeover comes just hours after a fresh interview was released with co-owner Ratcliffe. In the conversation, he hinted at his intention to stay put.",
      "Discussing the club's recent cuts on The Times' The Business podcast, he said: \"The more cash you've got, the better squad you can build.",

      "Frenkie de Jong has revealed that he's 'very close' to signing a new contract with Barcelona, finally putting to bed years of speculation over a move to Manchester United. De Jong, 28, was the Red Devils' top transfer target in the summer of 2022, with Erik ten Hag - who'd just been appointed - desperate to reunite with him following their success at Ajax.",
      "Richard Arnold and John Murtough, United's CEO and football director respectively at the time, flew to Catalunya to strike a deal. The two clubs landed on an initial fee of £56million - but De Jong blocked the move.",
      "Despite the Barca hierarchy trying to force him out, the Dutchman - who earns more than £300,000 per week - didn't want to give up on playing for his dream club. So, after weeks of attempting to persuade him to join Ten Hag's United, the Premier League giants had to give up, pivoting to Casemiro and signing the then-Real Madrid star in a deal worth up to £70m.",
      "Three years later, De Jong has entered the final 12 months of his lucrative deal and his future has been in the headlines once again. It's been reported in Spain that United have rekindled their interest, with midfield expected to be a priority position to recruit for in 2026.",
      "But De Jong won't be coming to Old Trafford. Asked about his contract situation while on international duty with the Netherlands, the midfielder confirmed that he's on the verge of putting pen to paper on a renewal.",
      "\"We are very close,\" De Jong told reporters ahead of the Netherlands' trip to Malta on Thursday. \"If there's real news, you'll hear about it, but I can't say anything for now.\"",
      "The 28-year-old also reiterated that he'd like to retire at Barcelona. The La Liga champions have had a mixed start to their second season under Hansi Flick, with injuries, financial issues and their delayed return to the Camp Nou diluting the feel-good factor.",
      "\"I hope to stay at Barcelona for the rest of my career,\" De Jong affirmed. \"This is the place I wanted to be as a child. Now we have a team with a great future, I want to win the big trophies here.\"",
      "Which midfielder should Manchester United sign in 2026? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "Barca will reportedly hand him a three-year extension, keeping him at the club until 2029. In a recent interview with Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona sporting director Deco, explained: \"We are talking. Frenkie is really enjoying being here. He has matured on all levels, with his family, in the team.",
      "\"If you are a player with character, you don't just want to stay because you are in Barcelona, but because you want to compete for titles, and he sees that he can compete for titles.",
      "\"He sees this and wants to stay here. At the club, we see him as a key player for the current project and the coming years, so I think we'll get him to continue.\"",

      "Manchester United DID strike a deal with Sporting CP for Viktor Gyokeres this summer - but an agreement was reached behind the star striker's back.",
      "The Swedish forward's entourage claim to have been kept out of the loop as the Red Devils offered a transfer fee higher than the sum Arsenal paid. Gyokeres ultimately moved to the Emirates in a £63.7million deal but experienced considerable conflict with his former club. The 27-year-old went on strike before the Gunners were able to agree a deal with the Portuguese side.",
      "Arsenal's No.14 was widely expected to leave Lisbon after two hugely prolific seasons in Portugal and failed to report for pre-season training as he attempted to force through a move that his camp believed had already been agreed. The north London side made Gyokeres their top target after moving on from Benjamin Sesko when the RB Leipzig striker's wage demands became an issue.",
      "Sesko eventually signed for United as the Red Devils splashed £74m on the Slovenia international. But Jonathan Chalkias, an assistant to Gyokeres' agent Hasan Cetinkaya, has suggested Sporting were trying to push his client in that direction.",
      "Chalkias explained that a move to Arsenal brought Gyokeres more than the lavish sums offered by Saudi Arabian sides, and that the transfer was of greater interest than a reunion with Ruben Amorim. \"There were crazy amounts offered from Saudi Arabia. We're supposed to act in our best interest,\" Chalkias told the Studio Allsvenskan podcast via the Daily Mail.",
      "\"Do we have also have a percentage (of any fee)? Of course. It's a lot of money. Maybe Viktor should respond to that some day.",
      "\"I don't think we pressured him once to accept the offer. At the end of the day, money comes and goes and this move to Arsenal brings us a lot of marketing.",
      "\"They (Sporting) had concluded a deal with Manchester United behind our backs, that was a problem. United offered a higher transfer fee.\"",
      "Chalkias also hit back at Sporting chief Frederico Varandas' criticism of Gyokeres. The executive released a stunning statement saying he would not be blackmailed when Gyokeres went on strike.",
      "There was conflict over what had been agreed upon Gyokeres' exit and the forward's representatives believe the club went back on their word following Hugo Viana's departure for Manchester City.",
      "\"If (Hugo) Viana were still at Sporting, the deal would have been done within an hour. Everything was written but we didn't have time to start a legal battle,\" Chalkias explained.",
      "\"I don't understand how a player who scored so many goals and won three trophies didn't deserve more respect. The industry is about trusting people. The sacrifices we made were probably the turning point in getting the deal done.",
      "\"They offered him to Real Madrid, made headlines with Madrid and even United, but from day one there was a commitment to Arsenal.\"",

But Edin Dzeko's late equaliser laid the foundations for Sergio Aguero's late strike - arguably the most iconic goal in Premier League history.",
      "QPR went into the final day of the season with their own top-flight status under threat, but knew they would be safe before the final whistle was blown. That has led to scepticism, voiced by Rooney, that the Hoops were happy to let their hosts stage their miraculous comeback.",

      "\"We could have let them win 4–0 or 5–0 and gone home. But we played a strong team, the manager wanted to win that game. It wasn’t our reserve team.\"",
      "Rooney reignited the debate earlier this year, when he shared his feelings during an episode of the Overlap Fan Debate. Asked about that day, he said: \"Obviously that was a tough one that...But again didn't Paddy Kenny turn the ball in for two goals? QPR knew they were safe and City get it to 2-2, then they just boot the ball back to them.",

      "There was speculation that Amorim could be sacked if he failed to beat Sunderland on Saturday, but a 2-0 win over the Black Cats has eased the pressure somewhat. Minority owner Sir Jim Radcliffe has insisted he will give Amorim time, although it is hard to see United sticking with the Portuguese coach if they become mired in the bottom half of the table, as they were last season, especially having spent more than £200million on new signings in the summer.",
      "If United do pull the trigger, United legends Neville, Scholes and Keane have made it clear who they would like at the helm. Both Neville and Keane would go for long-serving Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane spoke of his admiration for the fiery Argentine, who has led Atletico to the La Liga title and Champions League finals.",
      "The Irishman said: “I’ve said it for years, I’d like Atletico Madrid’s Simeone to go in there. I’d like to see him go there. I know his mate has gone to Arsenal [Andrea Berta, who left Atletico to join the Gunners as sporting director].",
      "“I think he would just create havoc, but good havoc. He'd rock up to that place. No guarantees, but I'd just like to see his personality, his track record.",
      "“People might think styles of football, [but] they scored five against Real Madrid [winning 5-2] last weekend. He doesn't like his teams giving up too many goals or chances, but they can play a bit and fight.",
      "“At Liverpool [where Atletico lost 3-2 in the Champions League] a few weeks ago… the team aren’t as great as few years ago, but they still had fighting spirit. He’s on the sideline, he got sent off that night, I’d like a big personality.”",
      "However, Keane isn’t pushing for Amorim to be sacked just yet. He joked: “I’d still say give the man a chance, absolutely. Another week.” Neville agreed with Keane, adding: “I think I’d go with that. I’d go with Simeone.”",
      "However, Scholes went for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, although he had reservations about his long-time assistant, Jason Tindall, joining him. He said: “I’m not sure about his mate [Tindall], but definitely him.”",
      "However, Amorim looks set to be given more time, judging by Ratcliffe’s recent comments on The Times’ The Business podcast. He said: “He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be.",
      "“The press, sometimes I don’t understand. They want overnight success. They think it’s a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it’s all going to be roses tomorrow. You can’t run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

He provides expert coverage on Manchester United and Manchester City, the Premier League as a whole, and the England football team. Jeremy has covered football, rugby and cricket World Cups, as well as Wimbledon, the golf majors and the Olympics.",
      "The Glazers have treated Manchester United like a cash-cow. For two decades, the Floridian billionaires, who own a 48.9 percent stake in the club, have been making hay while the sun shines.",
      "They have done so having loaded the club up to its eyeballs with debt. Since their 2005 takeover, around £1.2billion has been spent on debt interest, repayments, dividends and fees to the Glazers. They have sat back and milked a club they view as a business, more than a footballing institution for as much as they possibly could.",
      "Despite not winning the Champions League since 2008 or the Premier League title since 2013, United continue to boast record revenues. Never mind losses of £33m, the latest figures in June showed United generated revenues of almost £670m. And this is despite the team not even being in the Champions League.",
      "They are largely reviled by United fans. But they don't care. And when you've got the cash coming in like they have, who would want to give up such a good thing?",
      "Certainly, not the Glazers.",
      "You'd have to be 'filthy rich' to even get them to the table to persuade them to sell a piece of their United pie. But on thing that Turki Al-Sheikh most definitely is, is 'filthy rich'.",
      "A billionaire worth in excess of £2billion, he's the head of the sporting division of the Saudi Arabian government. And the man masterminding a sportwashing campaign aimed at improving his nation's atrocious reputation when it comes to human rights, the treatment of women and political controversies.",
      "The Saudis have the keys to the kingdom when it comes to LIV Golf, while Formula One has succumbed to the Middle East kingdom's vast wealth too. So has snooker, with darts poised to follow. In 2034, the World Cup heads there too.",
      "Publicly, Al-Sheikh - better known as Turki - has his claws into boxing. You'll have seen him calling up Eddie Hearn and making the Matchroom Boxing supremo jump into action whenever he fancied in the Hearn's Netflix documentary. Turki's £1bn collaboration with DAZN, via Matchroom, has seen the biggest fights head to Saudi.",
      "Now speculation is mounting that he wants a stake in United.",
      "For starters, INEOS, who own a 27.7 per cent share of United, are not in the conversation. Sir Jim Ratcliffe remains committed to the English giants, and has no interest in selling what he spent a lifetime striving to get his hands on.",
      "On the other hand however, the Glazers would be willing to sit round a table if the price was right.",
      "Yet, it would stretch even Turki's cavernous pockets. United's current value is around £2billion, but the Glazers would want a 'premium' based on potential future values. They've seen what Chelsea went for a few years back, not to mention the valuation of US sports teams, most notably those in NFL.",
      "United are refusing to comment, and claim to have no knowledge of any negotiations taking place with the Saudis. But the Glazers could be plotting a sale in secret back in the United States. Who knows?",
      "But there is one thing that we do now. One thing that remains as true as it has always been: Money talks.",
      "And nowhere is that more true, nowhere does money speak louder, than in football.",
      "The rest of sport is succumbing to Saudi. If Turki wants United, why would it be any different?",

      "Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner refused to be drawn into the topic of potentially becoming the next Manchester United manager as pressure continues to surround Ruben Amorim. Before the international break, Amorim was under extreme pressure after losing away at Brentford.",
      "However, a 2-0 victory over Sunderland alleviated some of the immediate concerns, albeit plenty more is expected of him. Among the bookmakers, Glasner is one of the names mentioned to potentially replace Amorim.",
      "The Austrian guided Palace to the FA Cup last season, and if not for a UEFA ruling, the Eagles would be playing in the Europa League this season. Up until last weekend, Palace were the only remaining unbeaten side in the division, but defeat to Everton scuppered that.",
      "This week, Glasner was awarded the Coach of the Year award at Austria’s Sporthilfe Gala for his achievements at Palace. After receiving the award, the 51-year-old was coy about being linked to other jobs, including United, making it clear that he is blocking out the noise and focusing on Palace for the time being.",
      "\"As I said, I try to keep it at bay, whether I’m successful or unsuccessful, partly for self-protection,\" he said when asked about the links. \"A few years ago, I got into the habit of living in the here and now and enjoying it.",
      "\"It’s simply better when you don’t lose 19 games than when you don’t win 19. Then the atmosphere at the training ground in the morning is simply better; everything is easier.",
      "\"I’m no less ambitious, no less demanding, and just as annoyed when we lose, like now. Even if it was the first defeat in six months: I’m one of the worst losers in the world, and I’m still annoyed about it today.\"",
      "Glasner's response is indicative of the man that he is, even though his position at Palace is up in the air entirely. The manager's contract runs out at the end of this season, and his star midfielder, Adam Wharton, suggested he is waiting to see if his head coach will extend his deal.",
      "Should Glasner become a free agent, there is no suggestion that United would be on the lookout for a replacement for Amorim. Speaking on The Business Podcast this week, Ratcliffe stated that he wished to give Amorim three years to prove himself at the club.",
      "Next month will mark one year since Amorim started work at Old Trafford following the sacking of Erik ten Hag at the end of October. During that time, the Portuguese head coach has led United to the Europa League final, but this came at the cost of finishing 16th in the Premier League.",

      "Barcelona's impressive financial figures could prove positive news for Manchester United concerning loaned-out Marcus Rashford. The Catalan club posted revenue of nearly £1billion and clinched record sponsorship agreements this financial year.",
      "Following his fall from grace under Ruben Amorim at his boyhood club, Rashford was sent out on loan to Aston Villa for the remainder of last season before leaving Old Trafford once more this summer. He touched down in Barcelona in July on a 12-month loan arrangement, though this deal features an option to purchase the 27-year-old.",
      "Rashford has been relishing his stint in Spain, notching three goals and five assists thus far this campaign. Should Barcelona desire to make his switch permanent, it would set them back a reported £26million and if United seek to recoup a fee for the forward, the Catalan club's economic figures spell encouraging news.",
      "In a statement issued this week, Barcelona disclosed that their 2024/25 financial year proved relatively triumphant. The club has endured economic upheaval previously, but this year delivered positive outcomes and a substantial sponsorship transformation.",
      "The club statement read: \"For the second consecutive year, the club has ended with positive ordinary results consolidating its economic recovery and operational efficiency across all areas. Ordinary revenue has reached £863m.",
      "\"In the area of sponsors, the club has reached a new all-time high of £225m, driven by the new contract with Nike and other strategic agreements. Another highlight is the performance in the area of merchandising, generating £147m.",
      "\"For the 2025/26 season, the club predicts a budget of £870m in ordinary revenue, driven by the gradual return to the Spotify Camp Nou, which is expected to increase stadium income by approximately £43m.",
      "\"This can continue the positive trend in sponsorships and set a new merchandising revenue record, with the aim of getting close to £175m.",
      "\"The club presents, for the second consecutive year, positive ordinary results and an overall improvement across all revenue areas. Sponsorships and merchandising have reached record figures, consolidating the club's international projection, as demonstrated by the growth of Barça's YouTube channel, which is now the sports organisation with the most subscribers globally, over 24 million.",
      "\"The reduction in debt and wage control place Barça in a strong position to face the new season, with a budget exceeding £870m in ordinary revenue and a forecast to maintain positive results for the third consecutive year.\"",

      "The Glazers would consider offers of more than £5billion for their stake in Manchester United. Which is more than double what the English giants are worth on the stock market.",
      "Speculation is mounting that Saudi billionaire Turki Al-Sheikh is launching a takeover bid for United - despite what United say. But Turki would have to start the bidding at around £5.2billion, to stand a realistic chance of persuading the Glazers to sell up.",
      "The Floridian businessmen took control of United two decades ago in a £790m deal. United's current value stands at £2b. But the Glazers would demand a huge premium, which reflects a possible increase in the value of United in the future.",
      "This would take into account how much United might be worth if the club completes plans to build a new state-of-the-art stadium.",
      "And one option open to the Glazers is to sell part of their 48.9 per cent stake in United, in return for some significant investment from Saudi to help fund the building of the new stadium.",
      "United bosses announced plans in March to build a 100,000-seater stadium costing around £2billion, that would regenerate the surrounding area and be one of the best on the planet.",
      "But it's understood United are nowhere near securing the finance required for the ambitious project. The Glazers rejected a takeover by Sheikh Jassim Al-Thani's Qatari consortium in 2024, selling 27.7 per cent of the club to Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS empire instead.",
      "Ratcliffe paid £1.25billion and was allowed to take charge of football operations at Old Trafford. United announced record revenues of almost £670m in June, but have been forced to make significant staff redundancies and remain desperate for a cash injection.",
      "United have refused to comment on a possible deal with the Suadis, while Ratcliffe insists he remains fully committed to the club.",

      "The post, which he shared with his seven million followers, went viral. It quickly eclipsed five million views, 12,000 likes, 3,500 shares and nearly 2,000 replies.",

I think it was just unfortunate that when they came into the cycling team, it was, you know, towards the end of our reign, so to speak. Because, in sport it's hard to stay at the top for forever. You know, it always comes in cycles, and they came in just as [Tadej] Pogacar came on the scene. And, you know, we won our first tour with Ineos. But then after that, well, we didn't.",

The report claims that talks with the United playmaker in the summer were positive, and that he'd have gladly accepted a loan.",
      "Even though a deal failed to materialise, it's said that Napoli are still in the market for a midfielder. Gazzetta dello Sport suggests that United could let Mainoo leave on loan in January if there's no obligation to buy clause inserted into the deal.",
      "Brian Riemer believes Rasmus Hojlund has what it takes to still be successful in the Premier League. Speaking to reporters, as quoted by TipsBladet, the Denmark boss said: \"I think Rasmus has the quality for both leagues, without discussion.",
      "\"Does he fit in Italian football? Yes. There was no doubt about that, because he had already proven that. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t fit in English football. On the contrary, I would almost say.\"",
      "Riemer added: \"The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced.",
      "\"It is more important than which league you play in...\"",
      "Turki Al-Sheikh has clarified that he is not in talks with Manchester United regarding a potential takeover.

The better your squad, the better your football should be. So a lot of what we've done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing. If you look at our results for last year, we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of results, and we weren't in the Champions League. Those numbers will get better.

      "Manchester United invited club correspondents into the Old Trafford boardroom last season.",
      "Omar Berrada and Dan Ashworth spoke on record during a wide-ranging question-and-answer session before the Liverpool game, touching on Erik ten Hag, transfers and much more.",
      "The most interesting quotes were about the controversial decision to keep Ten Hag in charge.",
      "When asked about Ten Hag's contract extension after he lifted the FA Cup, Berrada said: \"Again, so in terms of the contract, that was a decision that was taken prior to both of our arrivals.",
      "\"But as I said before, we're very happy with that decision. Erik has our full backing and we have worked very closely together, as Dan said before, in this transfer window. We're going to continue working very closely with him to help him get the best results out of the team.\"",
      "Berrada was asked whether Ten Hag would still be backed if there was a bad run of results and said: \"Do we still believe in Erik? Absolutely. We think Erik is the right coach for us and we’re fully backing him.\"",
      "Responding to a question about inheriting a coach, Ashworth said: \"Well, it happened at Newcastle with Eddie Howe [during his time there], it happened at West Brom, Tony Mowbray was in place. Very rarely do you go into a job as a sporting director and there's no manager in place.",
      "\"I didn't start until July 1, so none whatsoever [say in keeping Ten Hag]. All I can do is reiterate what I remember saying, I've really enjoyed working with Erik for the last eight weeks.\"",
      "In no uncertain terms, Berrada and Ashworth made it clear that Ten Hag retained the backing of the board - but the Dutchman was sacked 57 days later following a defeat to West Ham.",
      "Those comments are relevant because Sir Jim Ratcliffe has publicly backed Ruben Amorim, saying on The Business podcast: \"He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "Asked if the Glazers have told him to sack his head coach, Ratcliffe replied: “It’s not going to happen.”",
      "He added: \"The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Some consider Ratcliffe's comments as a cast-iron guarantee of giving three years to Amorim, but you only need to look at what Berrada and Ashworth said about Ten Hag to show that his assurances are worthless. The winds change quickly in football and Amorim needs results to survive.",
      "Amorim is thought to have a good relationship with Ratcliffe. During this summer's pre-season tour, he revealed that Ratcliffe sends him GIFs after matches, but he will be sent a P45 if results don't improve.",
      "Sunderland felt like a must-win for Amorim ahead of the October international break, following another setback against Brentford which saw the pressure increase on his shoulders again.",
      "Amorim's failure to win back-to-back Premier League games during his tenure is concerning and he must dispose of that unwanted record sooner rather than later. The performance against Sunderland was a step in the right direction, but it's fair to say Amorim is not out of the woods.",
      "It's also worth noting that Ratcliffe said the only thing he can say. Imagine the uproar if Ratcliffe came out and questioned Amorim, suggesting that he could be on borrowed time?",
      "The meaningful conversations about Amorim are held in private. Ratcliffe would not reveal he was having second thoughts about United's manager during a conversation on a podcast.",
      "United will play Liverpool and Brighton before the anniversary of Ten Hag's sacking on October 28, and it feels like a decision on Amorim's future will be made at a similar time of the season.",
      "Ineos sacked their previous manager shortly after backing him - could history repeat itself?",

      "Henrikh Mkhitaryan had a damaging relationship with Jose Mourinho during his time at Manchester United, and their falling out eventually led Mkhitaryan to join Arsenal.",
      "The Armenian arrived at Old Trafford from Borussia Dortmund in 2016, and even though Mourinho wanted him at the club, Mkhitaryan's underwhelming stint led to an explosive argument. In his first season, he scored 11 goals in 41 games.",
      "Their relationship quickly deteriorated, leading Mourinho to make it clear that he wanted the midfielder to leave. The 'Special One' even revealed his desire to bring in Alexis Sanchez as his replacement.",
      "Writing in his new book 'My Life Always at the Centre', Mkhitaryan disclosed: \"I told him, you've been criticising me for a year-and-a-half now, ever since I arrived at Manchester United.",
      "\"Mourinho told me I was 's***' and I just lost my temper. 'You are the s***. An enormous one.' Mou replied: 'Get out of here, I never want to see you again.'",
      "\"During the training sessions, the coach said nothing to me, he remained at a religious level of silence, but every evening he'd send me a message via WhatsApp. 'Miki, leave, please.'",
      "\"The situation had become grotesque. I'd reply every time with the same copy and paste response. I will leave if I find the right team, otherwise I'll wait for the summer. Towards the middle of January, the text changed slightly. 'Miki, please leave, that way I can get Alexis Sanchez.'",
      "He added: \"Mino Raiola was working on this exchange with Arsenal. So my response mutated too. 'I am not leaving just to do you a favour, and please stop writing to me. If you want, talk to Mino.' And everyone lived happily ever after.\"",
      "In January 2018, Mkhitaryan moved to Arsenal in a swap deal involving Sanchez and enjoyed a more successful spell in north London. He went on to score nine goals in 58 appearances for the Gunners, playing a key role in their run to the 2019 Europa League final.",
      "But he was later reunited with Mourinho at AS Roma, where the pair enjoyed some success together.",
      "During the 2021/22 season, Mkhitaryan featured in 44 games across all competitions at Roma under Mourinho's management, and lifted the Europa Conference League trophy.",

      "Ruben Amorim's preparation for Manchester United's visit to arch rivals Liverpool a week on Sunday will no doubt have been boosted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's endorsement of his head coach.",
      "While Amorim claims to have a close relationship with Ratcliffe – to the extent they send each other GIFs and tell each other to f***off – to have the public backing of your boss, in the midst of a crisis on the pitch, will have been welcomed by the United manager.",
      "Ratcliffe's insistence that Amorim must be given time – the three-year length of his contract, according to United's co-owner – to prove he is a “great coach” is laudable, but the 40-year-old Portuguese head coach knows the caveat to that is that results must pick up.",
      "So Amorim cannot afford to get distracted by Ratcliffe's vote of confidence in him, as he assesses his in-tray ahead of the huge trip to Anfield, where he will be seeking back-to-back Premier League wins at the 11th time of asking since taking charge of United almost a year ago.",
      "United's players who are not on international duty trained Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this week, but have been given a few days off before returning on Monday for the return to Premier League action.",
      "So what is in Amorim's in-tray ahead of the trip to reigning champions and arch rivals Liverpool? Let's take a look:",
      "DECIDE ON HIS No.1 GOALKEEPER",
      "This would appear to be the easiest issue facing Amorim and a no-brainer – stick with Senne Lammens in goal. The 23-year-old deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp made an assured debut in United's 2-0 win over Sunderland before the international break and the No.1 spot would now appear to be his, ahead of Altay Bayindir. Although Amorim stated the pair would fight it out to be first-choice, the solid performance of Lammens, allied to the positive feedback in training from goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital, means the Belgian gets the nod.",
      "KEEP A SETTLED DEFENCE",
      "Amorim is fond of making in-game changes to his back three, mainly because he is petrified of losing any of his centre-backs to injury, according to those who know him. That would explain the reason behind his decision to hook at least one of his defenders during the second-half of matches, although Matthijs de Ligt has played every minute of every Premier League game so far. Amorim has chopped and changed his personnel at the back, but must now settle on a stable back three for consistency of performance, with De Ligt, Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw arguably his strongest trio.",
      "IMPROVDE DORGU'S WRETCHED FINAL BALL",
      "Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system requires his wing-backs to be masters of all trades – possessing the ability to defend, attack and get up and down their respective flanks throughout games. It is a role that demands a lot from those entrusted with it and while Patrick Dorgu's defending is questionable at times, his final ball is without doubt lamentable. For a player who manages to find himself in so many dangerous positions, Dorgu's crossing is woeful and something Amorim and his coaching staff need to work on with the Denmark international.",
      "HELP AMAD REDISCOVER HIS BEST FORM",
      "Amad has emerged as Amorim's preferred choice for the right-wing back role, but has started the season sluggishly and then missed the 3-1 defeat at Brentford because of a family bereavement. There were glimpses of the Ivory Coast winger getting back to his best in the win over Sunderland and Amorim must help Amad build on that encouraging display. Amad is likely to get the nod over Diogo Dalot to face Liverpool, given he offers more up and down the right side, certainly attacking-wise, and it would be a timely moment to rediscover his best form.",
      "REASSURE MAINOO OVER HIS FUTURE",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has yet to start a Premier League game this season and with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes Amorim's go-to central midfield pairing, that situation does not look like changing any time soon. Mainoo wanted to go out on loan before deadline day, due to his lack of game time, but United rejected that request. With Mainoo's plight unlikely to change, Amorim must take steps to reassure the 20-year-old that he retains faith in him and he has a role to play, even if that does not translate to selecting him in his starting line-up.",

      "The prospect of United returning to Saudi in January comes on the back of the club being linked with a fresh takeover bid from a Saudi consortium.",
      "Saudi sports supremo Turki Al-Sheikh, who is understood to be in talks with United over the staging of the friendly in Riyadh, has publicly suggested United are ready to sell to a new investor.",
      "Al-Sheikh, the head of the General Entertainment Authority responsible for bringing some of the world’s highest-profile sports events to Saudi Arabia, raised the prospect of a takeover bid with a social media post on X.",
      "Al-Sheikh wrote: “The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he’s better than the previous owners.” But his claim has been branded \"baseless\" by United sources.",
      "Seventeen years ago, with United chasing a second Treble, Sir Alex Ferguson and his players embarked on the five-day trip to play a testimonial for Saudi legend Sami Al-Jaber – a round trip of 6,500 miles – and I was one of the accompanying media pack to join them on the unique experience.",
      "United were accused of putting money before the welfare of their players, by shoe-horning in another game in an already congested fixture calendar, but Ferguson defended the warm-weather break as providing a tonic for his squad, away from the freezing winter weather in Manchester.",
      "There were the usual PR obligations and photo opportunity demands for United and their players, including a visit to the royal palace of HRH Prince Abdullah bin Mosa'ad bin Abdullaziz, as well as camel rides for players brave enough to clamber aboard the animals.",
      "More than 65,000 male fans – women were forbidden from attending such public events under draconian laws which have since been changed – filled the King Fahd Stadium, a vast Bedouin tent-style structure an hour's drive from the capital Riyadh.",
      "Getting to the stadium was mayhem, with frenzied fans setting off firecrackers all around the routes to the stadium and drivers disregarding the road structures in place, weaving their vehicles up, down and trough the desert scrubland to beat the traffic and make kick-off.",
      "On the stadium concourse before kick-off, Islamic fans knelt in prayer, a laser show lit up the sky, bullets were fired into the sky and thousands of blue and white balloons - the colours of Al-Hilal, United's opponents - were released.",
      "United's team read like a who's who of modern-day club legends and included Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Darren Fletcher, Patrice Evra and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "Ronaldo did his best to get the party started, playing to the crowd by indulging in his signature step-overs inside the first three minutes, much to the delight of the fervent supporters. With the score 2-2, Rooney, on as a second-half sub, ran the entire length of the pitch to remonstrate with the referee over the awarding of a penalty to the hosts, which was subsequently missed.",
      "Al-Hilal restored their lead with a spectacular overhead kick and a 17-year-old Danny Welbeck had the chance to level in the final minute after winning a penalty but sent the ball over the bar.",
      "Ferguson gave his players the following day off, with some taking to the golf course and others relaxing by the hotel pool, ahead of their return home to face Tottenham in the FA Cup fourth round, a tie they won 3-1. United would go on to win the Premier League title that season, as well as the Champions League, beating Chelsea on penalties in Moscow in the first all-English final.",
      "Their hopes of another Treble were ended by a controversial FA Cup quarter-final defeat at home to eventual winners Portsmouth, but Ferguson and United looked back on the Saudi trip as a successful venture.",
      "United today find themselves in a vastly different place, their anticipated trip to Saudi more of a financial necessity than an opportunity to give their players a sunshine break from the rigours of domestic and European competition.",

      "Turki Al-Sheikh may well have given Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers food for thought about the future of Manchester United. Earlier this week, the Saudi Arabian billionaire sparked talk of a takeover with a cryptic post on social media.",
      "On Wednesday night, Al-Sheikh claimed the Reds were in the 'advanced stages' of agreeing a deal with a new investor. With Sir Jim Ratcliffe having only recently acquired a minority stake, many speculated that the Glazer family could be negotiating terms over their shares.",
      "On X, formerly known as Twitter, the Saudi government official wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor... I hope he’s better than the previous owners.\"",
      "Al-Sheikh, who owned Spanish side Almeria from 2019 until earlier this year after failing to secure promotion to the Spanish top-flight, shared the post to his seven million followers. His cryptic message quickly went viral, garnering five million views, 12,000 likes, 3,500 shares, and nearly 2,000 replies.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Saudi sports chief claimed he had uploaded the post as 'a fan who wishes the deal to happen'. He wrote: \"My yesterday’s post about Manchester United's potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "\"Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I'm posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, Al-Sheikh's second post was also enaged with on a phenonemal scale and has a million views at the time of writing. In just a couple of hours, the tweet eclipsed 800,000 views, 7,000 likes, 1,000 shares and nearly 500 replies.",
      "The Saudi Arabian businessman may not be in talks with the United hierarchy regarding a potential takeover at Old Trafford, but the platform he has on social media is clear for all to see.",
      "Speaking on The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, the British billionaire claimed that he remains in control of football operations at the club. When asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Ruben Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss, who has owned just under 30 per cent of United since February 2024, added: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rep... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe also suggested that he'll remain in charge of football operations for some time. Pointing to his long-term plan, the 72-year-old said: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "Asked if the United boss is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years.",
      "\"You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week...\"",

      "In 2023, Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe were in talks with The Raine Group, who oversaw the sale of the club on behalf of the Glazers, and both camps briefed confidence throughout the process.",
      "However, Ratcliffe won the battle and acquired a minority stake. Sheikh Jassim made an offer of around £5.5billion to gain full control of the club, but the Qatari failed to provide proof of funds during talks.",
      "Sheikh Jassim's offer included a promise to clear all of United's debt and included a separate fund directed solely for the club and the surrounding community, but his legitimacy was doubtful throughout the process.",
      "There has been no indication that Sheikh Jassim will return to make a fresh offer for United.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has continued firing in the goals after departing Manchester United during the summer transfer window. The 22-year-old ended up returning to Italy for the 2025/26 campaign as he signed for Napoli on a season-long loan with a £38.3million buy-obligation clause included in the switch.",
      "After scoring for Denmark during the September international break in his first competitive appearance, Hojlund marked his Napoli debut with a goal against Fiorentina. Hojlund failed to score in his next three appearances, but he returned to finding the back of the net in style with a superb brace against Sporting CP in the Champions League.",
      "Just a few days later, Hojlund scored the winning goal in a 2-1 victory over Genoa and with his confidence levels at an all-time high, it is no surprise at all that Hojlund has bagged while on international duty.",
      "His first strike in the World Cup qualifier against Belarus on Thursday evening came after just 19 minutes when he guided an effort home from close-range. Right on half-time, Hojlund doubled his tally as he again reacted instinctively to tap the ball into an empty net from just a few yards out.",
      "The initial shot that was saved into his path came from Patrick Dorgu with the United wing-back on target just minutes later.",
      "Hojlund turned provider this time when he unselfishly squared the ball to Dorgu after a pass in behind with the partnership showing what could have been for Ruben Amorim. Denmark went on to win the game 6-0.",
      "Despite Amorim's first United, Dorgu has struggled to tie down a spot in the starting XI and he is often left on the bench against arguably weaker opponents and particularly when Amad starts on the opposite flank with Diogo Dalot deployed in his favoured position.",
      "Three goal contributions for Hojlund is certainly interesting for United considering his struggles at Old Trafford. However, it is worth noting that his replacement Benjamin Sesko is on a scoring run himself.",
      "After a challenging start, the Slovenia international scored his first goal for the club in the 3-1 defeat to Brentford and followed that up by scoring in the victory over Sunderland last weekend, which he described as a \"dream come true\".",
      "“This [scoring at Old Trafford] has been the moment I've dreamed about as a kid, because the atmosphere here is unbelievable,\" he said. \"Not just after the goal, but after every tackle as well. It's a dream come true, I'm happy we won.”",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Barca boss Hansi Flick said: \"The first half was not good for us, they played one against one and very aggressive.",
      "\"We had no solutions, that's not a good thing. But in the second half I really appreciate the team's reaction.",
      "\"I don't want to talk about the two goals, we don't want excuses. We have to focus on the first half, but the most important thing is the reaction. This defeat is important and after the break we will fight for all the titles. That's what we want, we are a good team.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United players delivered for their boss to spare him another uneasy inquest and potentially the sack.",
      "Amorim admitted ahead of the game that it would be impossible for him to carry on if results did not improve – with this game billed as make-or-break for the embattled United boss.",
      "Amorim will hope he can now head into the international break without worrying about getting a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his time in charge.",
      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has brought the head coach more time.",
      "Read the full report here.",

      "Amorim is wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline today and Dalot's long throw-in created the chance for Sesko to score. Tony Pulis would be proud of this proper Barclays football.",
      "Sesko makes it 2-0, reacting quickest to the loose ball following a throw-in from Dalot, which was flicked on by Sunderland’s Nordi Mukiele. Sekso showed quick reactions to turn the ball in from close range.",

      "But United need to turn their dominance into the hard currency of a second goal to give themselves some breathing space in terms of the scoreline.",
      "Amorim cannot believe United haven't extended their advantage. Roefs did brilliantly to deny Fernandes' effort and Amad headed the follow up wide of the post.",

      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I’m still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more.",
      "\"I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.\" This admission should excite fans as few can argue that Sesko, when given the opportunity, hasn't looked like an improvement on last season's options at centre-forward.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Ruben Amorim must have hoped that an international break after back-to-back home victories meant he was spared a few days of speculation about his future, but Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s insistence on being the most outspoken owner in the Premier League has once again brought his job security into question.",
      "Ratcliffe, appearing on The Times’ Business podcast, said the Portuguese boss needs to demonstrate he is a “great coach over three years” even if he “has not had the best of seasons” and while patience shown by an owner is a welcome change in the world of modern football, there has been little to suggest Amorim warrants such loyalty.",
      "To put it into context, if Amorim had now been at United for three years, it would make him the fifth-longest-serving manager in the Premier League, just ahead of Unai Emery. And the current Aston Villa boss is a sign that in the modern game, you simply don’t get to three years without real progress.",
      "Emery took Aston Villa to Europe after Steven Gerrard looked like he may take them down. Eddie Howe did similar at Newcastle. Marco Silva has guided Fulham up from the Championship and made them a steady Premier League side.",

      "Ratcliffe described Arteta’s opening years at Arsenal as “miserable”, no doubt ‘informed’ by their back-to-back eighth-placed finishes, but crucially, there were signs of progress even in the early days.",
      "Emery’s stint at Arsenal was characterised by throwing away leads and gifting opposition goals; Arteta’s 18 clean sheets in his first 50 games demonstrate where he improved Arsenal the most.",
      "When Jurgen Klopp arrived at Liverpool, they too had a leaking defence. When Brendan Rodgers was sacked following a 1-1 draw at Goodison, Liverpool had a -2 goal difference, conceding 1.25 goals every game. In Klopp’s first 50 games, he brought that down to 1.02 and kept it there for his whole Liverpool tenure.",
      "For both Arsenal and Liverpool, there were clear signs of progress from a playing style aspect, and soon the results began to follow. Arteta may have finished eighth in both of his opening seasons, but he achieved five more points in his second campaign and Ratcliffe’s “miserable” assessment ignores their FA Cup win in 2020.",
      "In 2021/22, the Gunners rose to fifth and their big leap came in 2022/23 when they reached second in Arteta’s third full season in charge. Liverpool also came in eighth in Klopp’s first season and in the following year, they were up to fourth.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United have shown very little signs of any progress, either from a points or playing style perspective.",
      "Amorim’s predecessor Erik ten Hag averaged 1.84 points per game with 1.83 goals scored per game and 1.41 conceded. Amorim meanwhile may have a better scoring record at 1.94 per game, but they also concede a lot more at 1.9 per game. His points per game is also 1.38, 0.46 less than Ten Hag. And that was ‘miserable’.",
      "The former Sporting boss may not have had the full season with the squad but Amorim took a side that was 14th and pushed them one spot lower to 15th.",
      "Then there is the tactical reluctance. His devotion to 3-4-2-1 is unbreakable, so much so that not even the Pope could convince him otherwise, and in his 50 games for United, on only five occasions have the team not lined up like that. And even then it was a 3-4-3.",
      "A devotion to a philosophy is nothing new and not inherently bad for a football manager, but you need only look at the way Pep Guardiola has changed his system over the years to keep up with changing trends.",
      "When he arrived at City in 2016, only three players were taller than 1.9m, two of them goalkeepers. Now, that number is at six. Over the years we have seen changes like inverting full-backs, a move away from 4-3-3 towards a 4-2-2-2 when in possession and more from Guardiola. His first season had many saying he could not cope with English football after a couple of hammerings, but mid-season tweaks meant they went unbeaten in the last eight games of the year.",
      "Guardiola was of course helped by City’s spending, but it is not as if United have not splashed the cash either. The key difference is that City’s signings fixed obvious holes in the team, while United have still been left with gaping chasms, mainly in midfield.",
      "Amorim has dug his own grave and Ratcliffe has pinned his colours to the mast of what may well be a sinking ship.",
      "The man in charge of United’s football operations often likes to portray himself as a fan, one that used to stand on the terraces, more than your typical Premier League owner, and this desire for patience may be him harking back to days of yore, but if you’re backing a dead horse for 11 months or three years, it is still not going to be winning any races.",
      "Amorim may well come good and United may well start winning titles again, but there has been very little evidence to suggest that, and Ratcliffe’s dedication for now seems more based on hope than it is on the reality playing out in front of him.",

      "According to reports, the Glazer family have already set a Manchester United ‘sale’ price amid interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "At the start of 2024, INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe purchased a 25% stake in Man Utd to become a co-owner. As part of this deal, he took control of footballing operations at Old Trafford.",
      "Ratcliffe has since increased his stake to around 29% by injecting further cash into the Premier League giants, but he is still far from being their majority stakeholder.",
      "His arrival was initially met with huge positivity as it reduced the Glazer family’s control at Old Trafford, though his popularity has swiftly declined as he’s made enemies by sanctioning a brutal cost-cutting programme to balance the books.",
      "Ratcliffe has alienated himself by treating staff and fans poorly, while he has also been criticised over his terrible decision-making regarding Ruben Amorim, Erik ten Hag and Dan Ashworth.",

      "A new report from The Mirror has revealed ‘how much the Glazers would want to sell to Saudi Arabia’, with ‘offers of more than £5bn’ to be ‘considered’.",
      "Man Utd’s value on the stock market is only £2bn, but Al-Sheikh ‘would have to start the bidding at around £5.2billion to stand a realistic chance of persuading the Glazers to sell up’.",
      "The report adds.",
      "‘The Glazers would demand a huge premium, which reflects a possible increase in the value of United in the future. This would take into account how much United might be worth if the club completes plans to build a new state-of-the-art stadium.",
      "‘And one option open to the Glazers is to sell part of their 48.9 per cent stake in United, in return for some significant investment from Saudi to help fund the building of the new stadium.’",
      "Football Insider, meanwhile, have claimed that an ‘insider’ reckons ‘any potential new Man Utd investor is unlikely to be based in the Middle Eastern country’.",

      "A representative of Viktor Gyokeres has revealed how close Manchester United came to signing the Arsenal star in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "Arsenal‘s top priority in the summer was to sign an elite striker as they have been short in this department in recent seasons and Gyokeres was eventually preferred to Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, Arsenal’s pursuit of Gyokeres was far from simple as Sporting Lisbon went back on a gentleman’s agreement, while they faced competition from Man Utd and the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Man Utd also identified Gyokeres as a leading target, though they missed out on the 27-year-old, who was intent on a move to Arsenal.",
      "Arsenal’s patience eventually paid off as they paid around £64m to sign Gyokeres, who has three goals in his seven Premier League appearances this season.",
      "Now, Jonathan Chalkias, who is assistant to agent Hasan Cetinkaya, has provided details on Gyokeres’ move to the Premier League, claiming Man Utd and Sporting Lisbon “finalised a deal behind their back”.",
      "“It was such a lot of money [from the Saudi Pro League], it was well over 400 million net per year,” Chalkias said on the Studio Allsvenskan podcast.",
      "READ: Premier League CRISIS Rankings: Forest 2nd, West Ham 3rd, but what of Liverpool and Man Utd?",
      "“It’s a ridiculous amount of money. It’s better Viktor answers that question some day, we didn’t once push him in that way.",
      "“I think at the end of the day, money comes and money goes. Making this move to Arsenal gives us good marketing, too. He was actually never even that way, he didn’t think about it.",
      "“But there was also the problem with Sporting that they had finalised the deal with United behind our backs.",
      "“They [Sporting] had agreed because United paid a much higher transfer fee, but they didn’t get any attention. Every time they called it was, ‘no, no, no’, because he wanted to go to Arsenal.”",
      "Chalkias has also revealed why Gyokeres was in favour of a move to Arsenal.",
      "“It’s just that they haven’t had a new one [striker] in the last two years, Arteta spoke with him, to go to a club that hasn’t won in a few years,” Chalkias added.",
      "“Getting to do it on the biggest stage, living in London, playing for Arsenal, it doesn’t get much bigger.",
      "“And this is a club that can not only win the Premier League, they can win the Champions League, they are an incredible team. And there’s a lot of talk about their defensive and midfield play and that they need a striker to score those goals.”",
      "On the Arsenal newbie’s start at the Emirates, he added: “Really good, I think not above expectations but good.",
      "“I think everything will be better when he settles down but he has started every game and they are leading the Premier League and they have faced City, United away, Newcastle away and Liverpool away, not that bad.",
      "“I think if he just does what he’s good at he’ll score many goals there.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand has reacted to claims that Liverpool are “on their knees” after a couple of losses, as he describe one summer signing as doing “alright.”",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Unlikely. Kylian Mbappe is 15 ahead of the Arsenal man.",
      "Arsenal still aren’t ‘100% the best in Europe’ but Arteta’s 2025 nonsense could come true in 2026 if one Gunners star pulls their finger out.",
      "It’s only September and we’ve all already got so much wrong about this season; silly us, we did not expect Liverpool to run away with it.",
      "Liverpool, Man United and Arsenal all appear to have made striker blunders. Here are eight summer signing fears being realised in the Premier League.",

      "There’s also no shortage of pundits giving their opinion on who should be next and kicking us off is Paul Scholes, who recently picked incumbent Newcastle boss Eddie Howe for the United gig.",
      "Scholes did not elaborate on his choice but it is not the worst shout in the world – more of that later – with Howe having done well at Bournemouth and now Newcastle.",
      "He also won silverware with their League Cup victory last season but the question is whether he would be able to replicate that success at Old Trafford.",

      "And if Howe can be criticised for no experience at a top European club, that is not an accusation that can be made of Roy Keane’s suggestion.",
      "“I’ve said it for years,” Keane said on The Overlap’s Stick to Football podcast.",
      "“I’d like to see Atletico Madrid, [Diego] Simeone. I’d like to see him go in there.",

      "“No guarantee, but I’d just like to see his personality, even his track record.”",
      "That track record includes a now 14-year stint at Atleti and it is not an exaggeration to say he has revolutionised the club in that time. While they were once one of Real Madrid’s biggest sources of joy, Simeone turned them into a thorn in both Madrid and Barcelona’s sides.",
      "And while plenty of managers like Mikel Arteta and Gareth Southgate can be praised for reforming a team, Simeone crucially delivered trophies including two league titles.",
      "The question would be whether Simeone can deliver that success elsewhere as he enjoyed enormous freedom at the Wanda Metropolitano, not to mention the biggest paycheque of any manager in the world.",

      "“I’m amazed that no one has phoned Roy Keane and said, ‘Can you come in at Man Utd and be part of what we’re doing here?’ because he is arguably Man Utd’s greatest captain,” O’Hara said.",
      "“He is a leader. He’s unbelievable. When you watch him, he’s ferocious, you listen to him, when he walks into a dressing room, you’re going to listen.",
      "“He’s going to lead by example. He’s not going to allow poor standards. I can’t believe Manchester United have not phoned Roy Keane.",
      "“Maybe it’s because he can’t be the manager.",

      "Keane’s managerial record is not quite as glittering as his playing days. While he did guide Sunderland to the Premier League, he did not do the same at his next club Ipswich and went 14 games without a win in his first full year in charge.",
      "By the time he was sacked, Ipswich were 21st in the league in what was Keane’s last managerial role. He has since been an assistant boss to Martin O’Neill at Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and the Irish national team.",
      "Another pundit to put his two cents in is Charlie Austin who put forward two candidates – Zinedine Zidane and, um, Sean Dyche?",
      "Other than being follically challenged, it is hard to see too many similarities between Dyche and the three-time Champions League-winning manager Zidane but Austin believes his former coach could do a job.",
      "“Ultimately, there are a different set of managers that you’ve got to be looking at, because the situation Manchester United are in, I would take Zidane but is he the right man for the job and how we see them, probably not.”",
      "“In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton. For me, he stabilised the club, at least he’s going to put structure in there.",
      "“Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have. I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, ‘he said Sean Dyche’, no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.”",
      "If Dyche is on the more extreme end of the scale, the suggestion put forward by former assistant boss Rene Meulensteen may be more realistic.",
      "“Michael Carrick might be the obvious option if Ruben Amorim is to go,” he told BetVictor.",
      "“Obviously Michael Carrick still knows quite a few players that were there when he was there. So he’s still got some good inside information. He obviously knows the club. He knows what’s expected from the club.",
      "“But the key is that you need to have a guy that obviously has got a clear idea but puts some kind of a structure in place that the players buy into and that you get a spark from the players. Because they’re not bad players, there’s plenty of good players there.",
      "“I’m sure that if they would play in a system that suits them, they really play at their best. I think you could see a fantastic Manchester United. Maybe Michael could well be the guy.",

      "“He is very assured of his way, where he wants to go, and his communication skills in communicating with the people around him and the players. He’s very clear in that, and yeah, he gives young players opportunities.",
      "“He’s not afraid to give young players opportunities, and that’s what Man United stands for.”",
      "Hasselbaink is not the only one to suggest Southgate with Peter Crouch backing the man who took England to two European finals.",

      "We’ve done mood rankings. We’ve done manager rankings. But we see now that was only ever building up to this moment. Everything has been leading to this. The Crisis Rankings. Or CRISIS Rankings, because it does feel like this important and serious work merits a tiny bit of panicked ALL CAPS headloss.",
      "It is certainly crisis (CRISIS) season in the Premier League, anyway. That’s not our fault. Nothing we can do about that.",
      "Sure we could do our usual thing of affecting a lofty superiority and pretending it’s all silly tish and daft fipsy. But really we love it. We love clicks just as much as Reach.",
      "And we therefore will proceed to both have our cake by chuckling at the transparency of the collective media attempt to plunge absolutely every team up to and including Arsenal into crisis (and if you don’t believe us, just a reminder that this was the response to them winning a Champions League game 2-0) as the barren wasteland of a dreary international break stretches out endlessly before us all, and also eat said cake by leaning directly into the assorted deliciously stupid and stupidly delicious cracked-badge crisis narratives currently knocking about.",
      "Here, then, are the inaugural F365 Crisis Rankings, ranked from least to most crisis-ridden (which we’re pretty sure you could have worked out for yourselves).",
      "",
      "There absolutely are clubs for whom crisis talk can and does begin when a 19-match, trophy-winning unbeaten run comes to an end via a scrappy late goal at Everton. Crystal Palace are not one of those clubs.",
      "They probably aren’t going to do a Leicester after all. We’ll tell the children etc. but while a bit of a shame it is no crisis.",
      "Still if anything just about as far from crisis as it’s possible to be, at least until they lose two defenders to injury and/or a Glasner-enraging January transfer.",
      "READ: Everton spare Liverpool blushes but not Wirtz’s as huge Crystal Palace weakness laid bare",
      "",
      "A club all too familiar with crisis in recent years but currently well above all that kind of thing, thank you very much. They’ve got themselves a perfect new hero in Jack Grealish and have thus far made the awkward jump to a new ground and new surroundings look pretty straightforward indeed.",
      "Don’t look at all like they’re liable to get themselves into any real bother at all this season. Look far more likely to actually be proper good fun. Long-suffering Everton fans will still have the automatic defence response of expecting the worst at any moment, but honestly guys it’s all absolutely fine here isn’t it? Just enjoy it, would be our advice.",
      "There’s even a decent chance you might get to laugh at Liverpool quite a bit. And that’s been a while.",
      "",
      "Seems deeply quaint now, given the sheer depth and breadth of the assorted CRISIS levels now beleaguering other clubs up and down the country, but if you cast your mind back into the deep, distant past of about a fortnight ago you’ll remember that Arsenal were themselves quite deep in crisis. Because of the handbrake.",
      "Specifically, the handbrake that silly old Mikel Arteta refused to release in games against Liverpool and Manchester City.",
      "Said handbrake has since been released in games against Newcastle and West Ham which, coupled with Liverpool’s own seven-stages-of-crisis descent, has allowed Arsenal to go top of the table.",
      "And now they have every chance of opening up a really tidy lead from some kindly fixtures between the October and November interlulls having had to wade through some distinctly unpleasant games in August and September.",
      "Obviously Arsenal are Arsenal and thus can never be entirely crisis-free. There are two main pillars in the current attempts to paint the current favourites to the win the Premier League and Champions League as still mired in some kind of crisis.",
      "One was the really quite insane response to Arsenal maintaining their 100% Champions League record this season with a 2-0 win over Olympiacos, an event that was covered by our brave press with the kind of gravity normally reserved for the passing of a minor royal.",
      "The other crisis pillar for Arsenal – and this is one that only the winning of actual trophies will quell – is the Arsenally factor. They have a great opportunity here, but what if they just Arsenal it up?",
      "Related to this – a sub-pillar, if you will – is the fact they also really don’t like being called favourites. Because it inevitably invites subsequent accusations of bottling.",
      "And there really is no way out of this maze for Arsenal until, like their near neighbours, they manage to shut the talk down with an actual trophy. Because until then, the ridiculous reality of the noise around this most noise-generating of modern clubs is that the two things that can lead them to crisis town are a) good football results and b) bad football results. And celebrating wrong, obviously. Always with the celebrating wrong.",
      "",
      "We thought there would be a crisis. By rights there should have been a crisis. When you sell four of your back five to assorted big buggers, a crisis seems inevitable.",
      "But Andoni Iraola and Antoine Semenyo have had other ideas. Accepting the inevitable for the defence but holding firm on Semenyo is already looking like inspired pragmatic real-world transfer market realism from the Cherries. There’s a real skill for clubs in their situation in knowing when and where to fold and when to hold.",
      "Iraola still feels like the real genius behind all this, though. Thanking Gary O’Neil for his sterling work in keeping Bournemouth in the Premier League after they’d been Scott Parkered and moving him on to bring in Iraola must now go down as one of the biggest and most significant upgrades made by a member of the ‘Small 14’.",
      "As long as he remains in place, Bournemouth will be fine. Which does invite us to ponder the inevitable problem somewhere down the line. As wiser football minds than ours have opined: it is what it is.",
      "",
      "We are very, very suspicious of this Tottenham start. We’re not actually at all convinced they’re really any good at all, but we also have a sneaking feeling that they may get away with it far more often than not and end up very much in and around the top-four picture despite themselves.",
      "Also wouldn’t really be shocked at all if they’re 11th by the New Year. We’re keeping our options very much open here.",
      "We do think that a summer of upheaval could have ended up much, much worse for Spurs. For all the banterous nature of the Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze pursuits and their humiliating conclusions, Spurs have ended up…okay.",
      "They’ve strengthened the areas they needed to strengthen and without yet being entirely convincing are already reaping the benefits. That Leeds game was an absolutely perfect example of precisely the sort of game they would have wilted and lost last season in the face of a physical and psychological test.",
      "The simple fact that Spurs have won every game in which they’ve led this season is immensely encouraging given how p*ss-poor they were by that metric last year, and while it’s reasonable to ask questions about how precisely they got themselves into the pickles they did against Brighton or Wolves or Bodo/Glimt it must also be acknowledged that they found a way to at least get some of the way back out of them. That is not a trait one immediately associates with Spurs.",
      "Joao Palhinha may provoke grumbling among some Spurs purists for his no-nonsense game but he is exactly the player for which they have been crying out to have in their midfield for some time now. There’s a fight and steel about Spurs now, a willingness and acceptance that sometimes in this league you are going to have to earn your right to play.",
      "That Thomas Frank is also managing to get some decent output from encouraging Palhinha into more forward positions is also good news, suggesting a flexibility and thoughtfulness to both coach and player that is welcome at a club where things can get very dogmatic. We’re still very hopeful that Xavi Simons will eventually get up to the speed of things when given a run of games in a more settled role, and Mohammed Kudus is already looking far more like the season-one West Ham version than season-two.",
      "We’re not quite sure exactly how Spurs have only lost one game this season, but they have, and they’ve got themselves into a tidy position in three competitions. They are still Spurs, they will always be Spurs and they can always go fully and entirely Spurs, but right now there is no crisis here.",
      "",
      "Sunderland will be disappointed not to have come away from Manchester United with something. The very fact this is a sentence you can write with an entirely straight face tells you things are going pretty well for the Black Cats on the back of what looked for all the world like a dangerously premature promotion back to the big league.",
      "But an expert summer of recruitment from a transfer net cast far and wide has given them every chance. At the very, very least they won’t be getting relegated without a damn good fight and that is all one can reasonably ask of unexpected play-off winners when coming into the Premier League, really.",
      "Notable too that all their points have come against the established and settled Premier League set. There is nothing artificial or obviously deceptive about a set of results including wins over West Ham, Brentford and Forest alongside points against Palace and Villa. Those are results that indicate Sunderland are precisely what they currently appear to be: a perfectly capable mid-table Premier League side.",
      "Still a genuinely incredible effort if they can keep that up for another seven months, but now no reason really to think otherwise.",
      "",
      "Not currently in crisis, but definitely still on a crisis watchlist. The summer was hard and unpleasant for Newcastle, dominated as it was in the end by the Isak Saga and the great and at one time potentially never-ending quest for a replacement.",
      "They spent an awful lot of money on Nick Woltemade and it did have about it a whiff of desperation, but Newcastle was a club desperate for a new hero and he already has the look and air and most importantly goals of a man heading for beloved cult status at a place that loves its big number nines. We think everyone loves big number nines, really, but Newcastle definitely love big number nines.",
      "Results are on a general upward trend despite the late p*sser against Arsenal, and the fixture list for the month between October and November interlulls doesn’t look too bad at all either domestically or in the Champions League.",
      "Late November and into December look like potentially choppier waters, though, where keen crisis watchers might just need a close eye on Eddie Howe and the lads.",
      "",
      "We’re old enough to remember when everything was definitely going all 2024/25 after back-to-back defeats against Tottenham and Brighton plunged a new-look Manchester City and their manager into clear crisis territory.",
      "They’ve since escaped that talk for now by not losing any more games, and winning most of them thanks to Erling Haaland scoring quite simply all the goals. We’ve even seen the team and manager that has won six of the last eight Premier League titles described as ‘dark horses’ to make that seven out of nine, which is quite funny given all the information in that sentence and the fact they are currently trailing by three whole points.",
      "Perhaps the speed with which City have proved that all the talk of crisis after a couple of bad results might have been a bit much, and maybe we should learn something from that about the whole idea of deciding who is and isn’t in crisis at such an early stage of the season.",
      "Reader, my friend, we haven’t learned a thing.",
      "",
      "Impressively not in crisis despite losing so much in the summer and taking the high-risk continuity option of entrusting their precious yet deceptively precarious Premier League status to a novice in Keith Andrews.",
      "So far, it’s okay. Better, even. The high points have been very high. Victories over Villa in both league and Carabao, with the best of the lot clearly a thoroughly deserved win over Manchester United. Even managed to get the defeat to Nottingham Forest out of the way early enough for people not to realise how embarrassing that now is.",
      "And, in general, the bad moments – defeats at Fulham and Sunderland as well as Forest have been sufficiently spread out that they don’t command attention. There’s always been another good day round the corner soon enough.",
      "When you’re Brentford, that’s enough. They’re like a Reverse Man United. There, under the spotlight, it takes multiple good results to wash away the effect of the bad, while for Brentford it takes a proper run of bad results for people to forget taking four points off Chelsea and Man United, just as a for instance.",
      "What we still fear is that such a run of bad results really could be just around the corner. It still feels very precarious; they’ve coped admirably with losing the guiding hand of Thomas Frank but it still feels like a club where a minor wobble could become worrying and before you know it, you fear for them, you really do.",
      "December feels like it’s the key month for Brentford given the spread of games they’ve got during that always crucial and busy time. They play Spurs both home and away that month in obviously narrative-heavy games as well as Arsenal away and Bournemouth at home. Throw in a couple of potential six-pointers against Leeds and Wolves and you’ve got the perfect lab conditions for a crisis.",
      "Or you take the optimistic alternative, where the perfect conditions to create a crisis must by definition offer the opportunity to thoroughly dispel the notion altogether.",
      "",
      "A reminder of how restorative a bit of Thursday night Europaball can be for a troubled club. Doesn’t always work and can definitely make things even worse (see Forest, Nottingham) but Villa aren’t the first team who’ve managed to inject a bit of life into a season turning toward the dreary thanks to some Thursday evening respite.",
      "Having failed to win any of their first five Premier League games – failing even to score in the first four of them – and gone out of the Carabao on penalties to Brentford, Villa have now got themselves into a four-match winning run thanks to home league results against Fulham and Burnley to go with a pair of Euro victories.",
      "It’s all feeling much better now than it did a few weeks ago, when it really did feel like we were approaching the end of a bold, often brilliant, but ultimately doomed attempt to re-insert Villa into the elite of English and European football.",
      "We’re still quite a long way from last season’s Icarus-like highs as they soared so close to the sun on wings fashioned from unsustainable wages, but it’s a lot better than it was after failing to hold on to a lead against 10-man Sunderland.",
      "We also very much reserve the right to reassess this reassessing of Villa’s Crisis Levels at the next international break, because they have perhaps the most troubling run of intra-interlull games of anyone. Their four league games in that time are all against teams currently in the top five: Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "Already shaping up to be their magnificent scampish big-boy-bothering selves this season. They’ve taken seven points from three games against Man City, Tottenham and Chelsea, and two points from four games against Fulham, Everton, Bournemouth and Wolves.",
      "That remains in the ‘irritating’ rather than ‘crisis’ territory for now, but isn’t a trend you want to deepen too carelessly in what looks like being a particularly competitive season for those who’ve grown accustomed to easy and comfortable survival in the last couple of straight up, straight down seasons for promoted clubs.",
      "We would very much like to see them continue their policy of winning Carabao games 6-0 away from home when they travel to Arsenal in the next round. Sure, some people might contend that winning 6-0 at Arsenal is harder than doing so at Oxford or Barnsley but as far as we’re concerned that’s loser talk. Aim high, always. Especially when you’re Brighton and as a general rule apparently prefer playing good teams.",
      "",
      "Feels like Leeds were very close to serious crisis levels after botching the last days and hours of the transfer window, leaving themselves pretty short of attacking weaponry and prompting plenty of chat that a decent shot at survival had been squandered.",
      "They’re doing perfectly well, though, and have even started scoring goals. Since being ultimately outclassed at Arsenal – which is fair enough – they’ve been competitive with everyone and while their games against Newcastle, Bournemouth and Spurs may only have yielded two points in total they all showed that Leeds are perfectly capable of mixing it with decent teams.",
      "It certainly doesn’t feel particularly crisis-y right now, even if Bournemouth’s last-gasp equaliser and the lack of reward for a very decent performance against Spurs are a bit annoying.",
      "There is, though, perhaps no club outside the Big Six that faces a more defining period between these two upcoming international breaks. Leeds already occupy an unusual space in that their size as a club doesn’t quite tally with their status as a newly-promoted team, but it’s a fascinating run of games they’ve got coming up over the next five weeks or so.",
      "Before we all take another unwanted rest for the November break, Leeds will face Burnley, West Ham, Brighton and Nottingham Forest. That is a set of fixtures to conjure with. It screams crisitunity. These are all games that should sit pretty high on target fixtures in Leeds’ survival roadmap, given what we’ve seen from all of them so far.",
      "But at the same time three of those games are away from Elland Road. A month from now we could be looking at Leeds sitting loftily and confidently clear of the squabbling and bickering down at the bottom. Or if things haven’t gone quite to plan they could be right in there getting filthy with the rest of them.",
      "",
      "Almost impressive to be a London club and attract as little attention as Fulham. It can work both way but currently means that the only real response to successive 3-1 defeats at Aston Villa and Bournemouth has been to note that Marco Silva looked magnificent standing in the south-coast rain.",
      "No crisis. Might just be the beginnings of one after they’ve played Arsenal and Newcastle, though.",
      "",
      "A keen example of how finely balanced the see-saw can be between crisis and not-crisis. There’s no doubt that, overall, Chelsea’s results have been inadequate given all that talk in the summer – mainly from us, sure – that they ought to be title contenders now.",
      "But also… they absolutely should be title contenders, shouldn’t they? Enzo Maresca can’t keep playing the “Little old us? Title challengers, aw shucks!” when they’ve spent the GDP of a small nation on wingers and Brighton players over the last few years.",
      "Chelsea’s defeats have been eye-catchingly bad. Outclassed by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, mugged off again by Brighton late on in the Premier League and – most shaming of all – managing out-stupid Manchester United at Old Trafford. A feat of such crisis-inducing magnitude it’s almost impressive.",
      "They also made uncomfortably hard work of negotiating Lincoln in the Carabao. They also did all those things in the space of four consecutive games.",
      "They are, in short, neither the first nor surely last Big Six club to find themselves grateful that whatever daft things they might be getting up to are being overshadowed to some degree by the dafter things Manchester United are getting up to.",
      "And the response to that run of a win that felt like a defeat and three defeats that felt like… even worse defeats has been undeniably impressive. Survived a meeting with the Special One in the Champions League and then of course lessened their own crisis ratings while deepening Liverpool’s on Saturday evening.",
      "They’ve nudged clear of the deepest crisis alerts but certainly aren’t out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "It is perhaps an indicator of just how low the bar has become for promoted teams now that four points from seven games, with the only win against another promoted club, isn’t drawing more attention towards Scott Parker and his team.",
      "In fairness, it’s also because Burnley did have an undeniably horrible start. Four of those seven games have been against members of the Big Six. And while all have been lost and two of them – against Spurs and City – heavily, there were huge reasons for encouragement amidst the agony of going down to late, late penalties against both Man United and Liverpool.",
      "So no crisis yet, but if they don’t register a win in one of their next two games against Leeds and Wolves it will be an uncomfortably antsy and potentially bottom-three-marooned team that welcomes Arsenal to Turf Moor early next month.",
      "",
      "Looks a lot like a crisis right now, sure, but we’re not worried. Wolves do this a lot. It’s a crisis for Vitor Pereira, definitely, because he might have to be sacrificed, but Wolves making a terrible start to the season and then ending up 14th in May after taking 30 points in the second half of the season and saying ‘What were you worried about?’",
      "They’ll be fine, but Pereira might unfortunately have to play his part by being unceremoniously sacked when they’re six points adrift of safety in mid-December.",
      "Sergio Conceicao, if you’re interested, is our pick as the man to steer Wolves to safety in impressive style, prompting confidence of a much better campaign in 25/26, only to sit 19th after losing eight of their first 10 games and having to be replaced by someone else to continue a perpetual cycle that will outlast us all.",
      "",
      "What a crash course in Barclays that is for Arne Slot, by the way. Hailed as a calm and quiet genius for delivering the title with a settled squad in his first season. Pretty much handed a second title after winning five games on the trot at the start of his second season.",
      "And now, after an admittedly quite ropey fortnight that has seen Liverpool plummet from the very summit of the Premier League all the way down to second place and one whole point behind the new leaders, he is as bald and fraudulent as any Premier League manager has ever been. And those are some high levels of bald fraudulence.",
      "His tactics are being questioned. His selections, his signings – even though they aren’t really his signings – his substitutions. Everything.",
      "The man who delivered only Liverpool’s second league title since the invention of football, and who was pretty much being handed a second by a league apparently collectively bending the knee just two weeks ago, now finds himself level with Scott Parker in the Sack Race.",
      "Of course the CRISIS talk around Liverpool is completely insane. But perhaps only Arsenal can rival Liverpool when it comes to a completely unhinged, overwrought and overplayed narrative. The good times are always the very best ever, but that means the lows are met with the same levels of wild overreaction.",
      "Still, though. Definitely feels true that something’s not quite right here, doesn’t it? Definitely not a Liverpool – or Slot – with the same quiet unfussed equilibrium that steered them so calmly through last season. We’re perhaps all already guilty of forgetting both how easily Liverpool won the title and how unexpected that actually was at the start of the season and based on the club’s Premier League history.",
      "They were so good, so quickly under Slot that it became normalised and perhaps even underappreciated.",
      "But that calm authority hasn’t been there this season. There’s been a madcap, desperate nature to Liverpool’s performances that was every bit as much present in their late wins as it has been in their late defeats.",
      "The late goals that have swung so many Liverpool games all bore the Hallmark of Champions™ when going in at the right end, so it’s only fair to ask what they have now they’ve started going in at the other.",
      "Of course, once again, we’re in territory where both are overplayed.",
      "But we nevertheless find ourselves already building up for what suddenly looks like an epic Liverpool-Man United clash on the other side of the international break, one where the loser will be unavoidably and inevitably plunged into a deep and lasting crisis.",
      "Is it accurate, fair, funny or clever to call that game El Crisico? Absolutely not. Is there even the slightest chance that will stop us? Absolutely not.",
      "",
      "Things will, one suspects, eventually calm down a bit under Nuno Espirito Santo but it’s a smaller, quieter, reduced West Ham now, ambition and joy squeezed and squashed into a grim fight for perpetual Premier League survival where there is no greater or larger long-term purpose.",
      "Maybe they’ll have the odd cup run. Maybe another season in Europe here or there. But it all just feels colourless and drab. They’re still in crisis, but it’s a boring and bland crisis. West Ham don’t even get entertaining crises now.",
      "Just all very dispiriting. And worst of all, ceding everything they stand for in the name of drab, colourless survival and the growing apathy of the fans inside their drab, colourless bowl of a stadium might not even work.",
      "The crisis might yet become very colourful indeed.",
      "",
      "You better believe that’s a crisis. It’s been an absolute masterclass in crisis creation, an almost entirely self-created and self-inflicted crisis full of dick-swinging and egos and very stupid men doing very stupid things for very stupid reasons.",
      "Even if you accept the shaky premise that Nuno was developing ideas above his station and getting too argumentative with the all-powerful transfer guru Edu, then deciding to replace him during the season with about the single most philosophically diverging manager imaginable was and remains a choice.",
      "It has now reached a point where sacking that manager after seven winless games might actually be less of a mad piece of behaviour than appointing him in the first place.",
      "And while the sheer speed and scale of the unravelling might be graver than expected, it can’t really be claimed with any real credibility by anyone involved that this sort of outcome was not just possible but probable. Sure, maybe seven months felt more likely than seven weeks, but it just never looked like it could or should work.",
      "If it didn’t work at Spurs with the squad profile they possessed – and in the Premier League, for about a year and a half, it very much did not work – how was it ever going to succeed for Forest’s squad with no time to adapt or adjust.",
      "To their credit, the players really seem to have bought into it. There are no tools being downed here, and it’s further evidence of just how beguiling and inspiring a speaker Ange Postecoglou is. We remain entirely convinced that he can propel people to achieve things they never thought possible. He got Spurs players to win a f*cking trophy, for crying out loud.",
      "But we’re just not at all convinced he can be a consistently successful Premier League football manager, and a club without the insulating protection provided by Big Six status – which still might not have been enough for Spurs in a more routine Premier League season without three catastrophically ill-equipped promoted sides – taking a gamble on him was just thoroughly reckless.",
      "What might save him for a while is a truly joyless and uninspiring list of potential replacements, but that’s of no use to Forest fans right now. Graham Potter being the latest name linked provokes a very different reaction now than it would have a few years ago. Brutal game, football.",
      "",
      "Of course they are in crisis. They have been pretty much permanently in crisis since Sir Alex Ferguson left, and he is, in his own way, one of the men most responsible for the fact that nobody else can match the impossible standards that became the norm across two ludicrous decades.",
      "The question with United, one that most clubs don’t need to ask but that even those who do can concoct a plausible answer, is not “Are Man United in crisis?” But “How do Man United get out of their crisis?”",
      "We genuinely don’t know what that would even look like any more. A non-crisis Manchester United. They’ve tried new players. They’ve tried new managers. They’ve tried new owners. If anything, it always just somehow gets worse. Despite that often appearing to be literally impossible.",
      "It’s still less than a year, for instance, since Erik Ten Hag’s embarrassing banter reign that was saved by outplaying and beating a peak Man City side to win the FA Cup after an eighth-place finish was seen as the lowest United could possibly, imaginably sink. By the time of his long-inevitable departure it was widely agreed that this was surely United’s nadir.",
      "Roll on 11 months and they’re ‘turning a corner’ by beating Sunderland at home to climb to 10th.",
      "It might be an impossible task to ever get Manchester United back to those outrageous levels of dominance and success they enjoyed during the 90s and 00s, but with every attempt to relocate that spark they just drift further and further from it.",
      "So you end up with a situation where United become the perfect storm. As the biggest club in the country it already takes far less for them to be in crisis than it does for Joe Mid-Table-Battler or Johnny Yo-Yo-Club, yet they have also contrived to be actually bad enough to constitute crisis at any of those clubs as well.",
      "In essence they are deeper down the crisis well than any other club you care to name, yet because TIMUFCWTA they also have much further to climb to escape it any way. We don’t know what a solution might even look like.",
      "But what we can say with some confidence is that it doesn’t look like Ruben Amorim. We really did think it might for a while there. He has the requisite charm and charisma to pull off the performance aspect of being Manchester United Manager. But while you can’t succeed in this job without that, it still isn’t enough on its own.",
      "It’s far more symptom than cause of Manchester United’s ongoing crisis status, but this continued inability to string two wins together is a great bit. It was a running joke during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s time that every month or so United would turn a corner down yet another cul-de-sac, but Amorim has perfected.",
      "The list of terrible Premier League managers who have managed to win two games in a row at least once is a hilarious one, and the fact Amorim talked openly about it before the botched chance at Brentford is revealing in itself.",
      "While the record is specifically around league games, it also highlights just how damaging United’s failure to a) qualify for Europe and then b) avoid total Carabao catastrophe at Grimsby has been.",
      "Because their near total lack of midweek football just gives no chance for any forward momentum to develop while allowing whatever the latest setback might be to moulder and fester for an entire week. United are definitely in their own heads to an uncomfortable degree on this ‘two wins’ thing.",
      "And it also means less chance of some easier games to help things along. You only have to look at Villa right now to see how even a bit of Thursday night Euroball can help change the mood.",
      "United don’t have that option. They don’t have any option. For this once-mighty club, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no end to the tunnel.",
      "There have been plenty of indications but the straw that breaks the Manchester United camel back is here.",
      "The man in charge of United’s football operations wants to give Amorim three years but there has been little to show he deserves that.",
      "We’re not having any of this “can’t we just enjoy all of them?” nonsense here at F365. We’ve decided who the best midfielder is. Or rather which two are the ...",
      "Arsenal are title favourites because they are top of the actual table, but also because of a huge improvement in another Spurs and Bournemouth are leading.",
      "Only three points off the top four but just one ahead of Manchester United, are Chelsea actually any good this season?",
      "Jude Bellingham and Co. face a fight to get back into this England side as Thomas Tuchel’s “team” justified his bold decision and silenced Roy Keane…"

      "If Ruben Amorim was expecting to hear from Sir Jim Ratcliffe during the current international break, he would have feared something rather bleaker than this…",
      "“Ruben is a good guy.” the United part-owner told The Business podcast. “He has not had the best of seasons. But he needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.”",
      "Compared to what Amorim might have expected post-Brentford, that’s a hug and squeeze. But the United boss will recognise lip-service by now. Three weeks, not three years, is the worry that will deprive him of yet more sleep while many of his players are doing their national service.",
      "Amorim is living international break to international break right now. He spared himself prior to the last one with a 97th-minute home win over Burnley in the wake of Grimsby-gate. In this latest three-week audition for his own job, Amorim won two, lost two, the odd signs of encouragement mixed with some familiar failings.",
      "United disproved little of what we already know of them, swaying no-one from the firmly entrenched positions they already held, leaving Amorim and Ratcliffe to kick the can down Sir Matt Busby Way a little longer until the one-year anniversary of his appointment draws nearer.",
      "That milestone is more of worry for Amorim than a cause for celebration. Reports suggest United will be liable for a much smaller pay-off if they wait 12 months before sacking another manager. Amid Ratcliffe’s quest to make United the most profitable circus football club in the world, every million quid counts.",
      "For Amorim, there is little respite to be found in the fixture list. Like the last four-game block, United will face two of the big six, Liverpool and Tottenham away, with Brighton at Old Trafford and a possible El Sackico at Forest in between. Three away trips is hardly ideal when United’s form on the road is so poor.",
      "Where is the bar for Amorim? Will six points keep him in a job again?",
      "Liverpool have been poor – are they the crisis club? – but surely not so sloppy as to let United win at Anfield for the first time in almost a decade. As Paul Scholes said, a point would be very nice, ta.",
      "Brighton at home. Sheesh. The Seagulls have had United on strings in recent seasons. The Red Devils might have won their last three at Old Trafford but so have Brighton. United have lost seven of the last eight meetings. Three points will be the expectation of Amorim at the Amex North, but none of us could be surprised if United are left looking to make up points elsewhere.",
      "Maybe at Forest? A year to the day since he was appointed, Amorim will go to the City Ground to face a manager for whom beating United in a European final was not enough to keep his job at Tottenham. Forest, perhaps breezier for also sacking Ange Postecoglou by then, could inflict a third defeat on Amorim on the very day it becomes cheaper to sack him.",
      "Should Amorim reach Tottenham before the next international break, there Ratcliffe could see for himself the positive impact of replacing a dogmatic manager with a pragmatist.",
      "MORE: Man Utd isn’t just a CRISIS club – it’s a CRISIS club in CRISIS purgatory with no means of escape",
      "If there is a dour tinge to the context above, that’s because pessimism prevails at Old Trafford these days. That six points might be seen as a creditable haul when This Is Manchester United Football Club We Are Talking About tells its own story. Whether half the available points will be enough to save him once more, only Ratcliffe and his cronies can decide.",
      "Whatever verdict they reach, it ought to be with a view beyond the next convenient sacking window. There are many reasons why the mess United find themselves in is not Amorim’s fault, just as there are plenty that make it true that, so far, he has not done enough to turn the Reds around. Ratcliffe, Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada; if they see a clearer picture than the “knee jerk reactions of journalists who go off on one every week”, then enlighten us and be decisive.",

      "“The costs were just too high,” Ratcliffe told The Business podcast. “There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one’s ever given me a free lunch.",

      "The Glazers, who took control of United in 2005, have been blamed by the fans for United’s demise since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club in 2013, but Ratcliffe insisted “they get a bad rap… but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.”",
      "Amorim’s most significant on-pitch decision was to sack Erik ten Hag last November and replace him with Ruben Amorim, who has won just 37 points in 34 games and has been under pressure of the sack pretty much since he arrived at the club.",

Spurs remained in a theoretical race for Champions League qualification but they limped out of the same competition to AC Milan in the last 16 and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Championship side Sheffield United in the build-up to the Southampton game.",
      "They led 3-1 at St Mary’s by the 76th minute but drew after a stunning collapse culminated in James Ward-Prowse scoring a stoppage-time penalty. Their form was disastrous, the relationship was broken and the international break offered a chance to reset.",
      "It also provided an opportunity to appoint Conte’s assistant as his replacement; Cristian Stellini lasted four games as interim manager before himself being shown the door following a 6-1 defeat at Newcastle. But at least he managed to leave without offering every past, present and future club employee outside.",

      "",
      "In the antepenultimate post of a glittering managerial career, Ranieri’s 16-week, 14-game reign at Vicarage Road was an all-timer for ridiculousness.",
      "They failed to keep a clean sheet and conceded four goals or more in four games. The Italian’s first match against Liverpool was very possibly the single worst team performance ever committed to Premier League history. His last game was a 3-0 defeat to Norwich.",
      "But his two wins were remarkable: 5-2 against Everton and 4-1 against Man Utd to maintain at least mathematical hope of a survival which was never realistically going to be achieved.",
      "Ranieri was, at the very least, more popular than his successor – and possibly even his predecessor.",
      "",
      "Not 24 hours after a 1-0 defeat to Leeds described by goalkeeper and captain Ben Foster as “a battering”, Watford dispensed with Munoz 10 months into his reign after sensing “a negative trend at a time when team cohesion should be visibly improving”.",
      "The Hornets were 14th with seven points from as many games, having beaten Aston Villa; how many managers would they would sack to return to such “a negative trend” four years later?",
      "More. The answer is always more.",
      "Munoz’s longest coaching stint ever remains the 41 games he managed with Slovakian top-flight side Dunajska Streda, with spells at Huesca, Anorthosis, Sheffield Wednesday and ohor Darul Ta’zim hardly suggesting Watford made a glaring error in parting with the manager who had secured automatic promotion so recently.",
      "Ranieri was soon installed, himself only lasting until January before handing over to Roy Hodgson, who barely muddled through until May as Watford suffered a Premier League relegation from which they are yet to recover.",
      "",
      "One of the precious few Premier League managers to be sacked after winning their final game, Farke’s fate was sealed long before Norwich earned their first victory of the season 11 games in. A matter of minutes after conducting post-match media duties having beaten Brentford, the Canaries told the manager that he would be left in the coalmine.",
      "The decision to part with Farke had apparently been made on the morning of the game, regardless of the result. Norwich were bottom after a run of two draws, three goals scored and eight defeats in their first ten matches; they remained rooted to the foot of the table even after the Brentford win.",
      "But the timing was curious. While the international break was an in-built momentum killer anyway, Norwich seemed desperate to crush even the pretence of an hour’s worth of overdue positivity.",
      "It took them another nine days to unsuccessfully pursue Frank Lampard and bring in Dean Smith, who won his first game but only three of the subsequent 26 as Norwich finished precisely where they were when Farke was forced out.",
      "",
      "Norwich’s delay can be explained at least in part by the fact the manager they eventually settled on was busy himself being sacked in the interim.",
      "Smith was regrettably shown the Aston Villa door after five consecutive defeats, the last of which came against Southampton. He remains the only manager to face the same opponent in consecutive Premier League games in the same season, but with different clubs; Norwich beat Saints a fortnight later and Smith went on to force three separate sackings later in the campaign.",
      "It was an undoubted gamble on Villa’s part and many felt Smith had been dealt with harshly, particularly considering Jack Grealish had been sold the summer before. But it seemed as though they nailed the call when Steven Gerrard was brought in from Rangers and immediately oversaw an improvement in results and performances.",
      "Those wheels soon came off and Gerrard did not last a year. In all fairness to Villa, they did alright with their next appointment.",
      "",
      "Levy tends to let things stew before bringing them to the boil. In the official statement announcing a parting of the ways with Pochettino after five-and-a-half years together, the chairman said “it is not a decision the board have taken lightly, nor in haste”.",
      "More than a week after Spurs broke up for international duty following a 1-1 home draw with Sheffield United, the speculation had been that Pochettino faced a ‘make-or-break’ meeting with West Ham on their return. That was instead the dug-out debut of Jose Mourinho in a thrilling win which teased a generational manager-player link-up with Dele.",
      "",
      "The law of averages dictate that most international break Premier League manager sackings would have been meted out by Watford. The proof is in the P45-based pudding served to a succession of coaches at Vicarage Road.",
      "Gracia had taken the Hornets to an 11th-placed finish and the FA Cup final in 2019, but there was a falsity about those seemingly strong foundations: Watford ended the Premier League season losing seven of their last 11 games before being absolutely hammered by Manchester City at Wembley.",
      "It was a warning they failed to heed in the summer, with Gracia authorised to oversee an opening month in which Watford lost three games and drew one before the international break allowed time for pause.",
      "Watford sacked Gracia, brought in Quique Sanchez Flores, sacked Sanchez Flores, brought in Nigel Pearson, sacked Pearson and accepted relegation with Hayden Mullins at the helm.",
      "Fast forward to the October 2025 international break and Watford have reappointed Gracia because they are a ludicrous institution.",
      "",
      "One win and nine defeats in 12 games after promotion through the play-offs did for Jokanovic, whose longest spell in management by about a year was brought to an abrupt end as Fulham tried to prevent a relentless slide back to the Championship.",
      "The Cottagers spent a small fortune in the summer, including £15m invested on Alfie Mawson for as many Premier League appearances in four years. A powder keg partnership with the club was always liable to explode and a 2-0 defeat to title-chasing Liverpool at Anfield just happened to light a fuse which would have burned eventually.",
      "In a wonderful show of ambition, relegation-bound Fulham chased Arsene Wenger before quickly admitting defeat. In the same statement announcing Jokanovic’s sacking, they unveiled Ranieri as his replacement. A call from Manchester United would probably reverse his latest retirement.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has made a lot of middle-aged white men angry by making a fair point about division in the UK and beyond.",
      "Neville has come in for a lot of stick over the last week with the Daily Mail’s reporting of his comments particularly concerning as they described them as a ‘racist’ outburst.",
      "Despite the former Man Utd and England defender making a wider point condemning “hate speech in any form and abuse in any form” and urging everyone to unite “to get back to a country of love, of peace, of harmony”, they have predictably been dragged out of context in certain quarters.",
      "Here we have put together nine of the best, worst, and honestly most terrifying views on Neville’s comments this week…",
      "",
      "“In his, obviously, isolated world he lives in, he’s in the kind of ivory tower position of being shuttled into a Sky studio, back behind a wall in whatever sprawling estate he’s got, they’re saying he’s worth between £50m and £70m. People are telling me that Overlap earns all them £20,000 a pop, they’re sponsored by ARNE now so surely ARNE’s going to be delighted with Gary saying that because I would imagine their target audience is white, middle-class men. It’s definitely not fella’s called Jihad, white, middle-class men called Jihad. I can’t imagine there being that many of them around.",
      "“But Gary’s got himself into this virtue signalling nonsense. We have this pillock, Neville, and he’s crossed over with me because as I said to him and Rio last night, I’m more than welcome to debate both of you. Let’s roll for two hours, discuss any topic. Gary sat in a room with me when we did The Edge podcast, you don’t need to be scared of me, but intellectually I think you’ve got a lot to answer for here.",
      "“I don’t think Gary Neville has thought about who are his audience. Because I’m looking at it going, you’ve just said people who like the Union Jack, people who are patriotic to show their country’s flag in, in this instance, the country he’s from and represented 85 times at international level…just factor in if he said somebody with brown skin or somebody with black skin, there’d be an absolute outrage about it.”",
      "The delightful Barton added: “People like this, gaslighting you all the time, saying to you: ‘no, no you’re a racist for thinking that. You’re far right for thinking that.’ There’s a synagogue attacked and we get a f*****g d***head footballer, absolute idiot, whose ar**hole is for rent to the highest bidder.",
      "“If that’s the Qataris, he’ll forget anything to do with human rights to go and take the Qatari money. He is a whore who is open for exploitation as he has shown this weekend with his stupid comments.",
      "“Now, if he was a man of the people, like he says he was, and if he was really in touch with his fanbase or the people that support his shows or his football club or some of his businesses, then he would know middle-aged white men in this country aren’t the problem.",
      "“Sticking a few flags up and being petrified that your daughters or your granddaughters or your wife are going to be accosted in a changing room by an illegal invader is not a f*****g far right position.”",
      "READ: Neville a ‘traitor’ and Postecoglou sack imminent to bafflement of Daily Mail",
      "",
      "“I think it’s astonishing in the wake of an Islamist terror attack that he decides to have a go at middle-aged white men.",
      "“Maybe the middle-aged white men are the ones who worked on minimum wage inside his hotel, I don’t know. I think he’s a champagne socialist and a coward. It’s a dreadful thing to have said.”",
      "Pushed on why Neville is a coward, Jordan went on: “I think the real issue is about radical Islamist extremism and he doesn’t have the balls to call it out for what it is, rather than suggest that challenging our country about what’s happening, he’s insulated from these things.",
      "“He lives in a very rarefied world where his money and privilege has allowed him to live in a gated environment, not have to worry about NHS appointments, doesn’t have to worry about people being attacked in the streets by immigrants that shouldn’t be here in the first place.",
      "“He doesn’t have to worry about these things, so he has the ability to sit there and observe in such a way that insulates himself from it. I think it’s an appalling stance to have taken.",
      "“He’s entitled to his view, he’s entitled to a view. We are quite happy to wave any other flag in this country, whether it’s Palestinian flags, Ukraine flags or any other flag that we feel we’re able to wave.",
      "“But when you’re talking about people in this country that have legitimate concerns and want to have a legitimate value set and push back against what they’re having forced upon them, for Gary Neville to say what he said is the exact embodiment of being a champagne socialist, insulated from the real world and a coward because the real issue is some of the extremism going on in this country.”",
      "",
      "Le Tissier told students at Southampton Solent University: “He’s basically attacked the demographic of people that are paying his wages, which is a bit strange.",
      "“I think it depends on what side of the argument you fall on and whether your side of the argument suits the agenda of the current media.",
      "“Which I think, you know, for the large part is very left leaning, so if you’re slightly right leaning you won’t be given the good graces to make mistakes other people will be given.”",
      "The Southampton legend added: “Yeah, I think they’ll stand by him and support him, yeah",
      "“I mean, they stood by Jamie Carragher when he spat at a young girl out of the back of his car.",
      "“It is not quite as bad as that, so I think Gary’s got a pretty fair argument there if they try and get rid of him.”",
      "",
      "“He’s blaming them for all the division, not some evil, crazed, mad Islamist who went out to kill innocent people.”",
      "Farage added: “I will tell you what, this Gary Neville is so detached from reality, so detached from the average football fan, it is not true.",
      "",
      "“I’m sorry — I know I tell you every week I’m gonna come here and I’m gonna be calm. We’re being told that we’re being turned against each other mainly by angry middle-aged white men who deem it OK to put up flags.",
      "“I’m not gonna sit here and say stick to football, everybody’s entitled to their opinion, but why am I surrounded by people like Neville who have made millions on the back of working-class people — people they’re supposed to represent, people they’re supposed to respect?”",
      "Kyle added: “Does he actually believe that middle-aged white men raising flags is causing division in this country?",
      "“Three hours after those poor, poor Jewish people on Yom Kippur were murdered by that terrorist called Jihad… a protest march not three hours later, not a mile away, with people waving Palestinian flags and shouting obscenities — but Gary Neville wouldn’t mention that, would he?",
      "“But if you stood up and said it’s disgraceful that these people are marching and inciting violence, people like Neville would say, ‘Oh but it’s unfair.’ But it’s alright to attack middle-aged white men.”",
      "Kyle continued: “I tell you what Gary Neville, do two things: take your fortune and give it to every immigrant and every group that you think isn’t treated well in this country — do that, but you won’t, will you?",
      "“Or go and live somewhere, you numpty, where there are immigrants on the streets and where your teenage daughters might not feel safe, rather than behind the gates of your massive mansion in Chester.”",
      "",
      "‘We need to check ourselves, start to bring ourselves back to a neutral point,” he says, playing the great healer. After all, nothing says neutrality quite like blaming the toxicity exclusively on “angry middle-aged white men”.",
      "‘Neville is the classic case of a celebrity so feted within his own sport that he appears oblivious to anything or anybody who might challenge his world view. Gary Lineker fell into the same trap…",
      "‘Neville is discovering the hard way that views that resonate inside his self-congratulatory pundit bubble often collapse on first contact with reality. Hence why his latest video has provoked less applause than derision and contempt, with increasing threats from viewers to stop paying for Sky in protest. Perhaps now he realises that if you are going to posture as the voice of balance and reason, you cannot savage the flying of the Union Flag as divisive and then fail even to mention the Palestine Action protests that took place directly after the Manchester outrage, in defiance of calls to show respect to the Jewish community.",
      "‘It is doubly bizarre that Neville invokes his patriotism with the old “I’ve played 85 times for my country” line. These honours, earned from 1995 to 2007, were achieved purely on the strength of his sporting talent, not because of his undying devotion to Queen and country. So why does he now feel an entitlement to define patriotic allegiance for everyone else? The answer, quite simply, is hubris. Neville acts as if his position as the country’s most prominent football analyst also confers the right to be its conscience.",
      "‘His response to the atrocity in his home city might be his most dangerous lapse into self-parody yet. The problem is not just the hopelessly mangled logic, with Neville drawing a line from the act of an Islamist terrorist to enthusiasm for the Union Flag, but that he is biting the hand that feeds. Why is he belittling his own audience? Why does he not pause to consider that he has strayed so far out of his lane that he is practically in the ditch? The problem, hardly for the first time, is not angry middle-aged white men, but multimillionaires called Gary deluded into presuming that their football credentials give them a monopoly on moral virtue.’",
      "",
      "‘THERE was a time, presumably, when Gary Neville wasn’t quite so offended by the sight of our national flags as he now appears to be.",
      "‘When he was playing his 85 games for England I don’t remember him storming up into the stands to rip down St George’s Crosses or Union Jacks waved by enthusiastic fans, nor objecting to men, women and children who joined in the fun by painting red crosses on their faces.’",
      "Clark added: ‘In a video he posted online he boasted of how he had ordered a Union Flag put up by construction workers at a block of flats his company is building in ­Manchester to be taken down.",
      "‘To justify his actions, he claimed that the flag is being used by “angry middle-aged white men” in a “negative fashion”.",
      "‘Quite how you fly a Union Flag ­negatively I am not sure.’",
      "Clark continued: ‘So, no, we have no reason to be ashamed of our flag.",
      "‘On the contrary, we have every reason to fly it proudly from our homes and workplaces — if only the likes of Gary Neville will let us.’",
      "",
      "‘It seems it’s now open season on middle-aged white blokes, all year round. We are the opposite of a protected species. Scape-gammon, if you will. No one will call Neville out on his bigotry, or indeed hypocrisy, as he forgets who paid for the lifestyle he’s enjoyed since the Major years.",
      "‘Neville didn’t just raise a few questions – he also took a wild leap into scape-squirrel territory. He blamed flag-waving middle-aged white men for murders committed by a terrorist literally called Jihad.’",
      "",
      "‘It seems that in modern Britain you can be anything but the dreaded “middle-aged white man” (a description which, it should be noted, also applies to Neville).’",
      "READ NEXT: Neville claims Amorim ‘not off hook’ as Man Utd owners ‘won’t be kidded’ by ‘hopeless’ stars",
      "Roy Keane has named a manager who would “create havoc” as his preferred option replace under-fire Ruben Amorim at Man Utd.",
      "Gary Neville’s comments have inevitably brought division to a Mailbox that includes talk of ‘delusion’ among us ‘sissy left-wing’ types.",
      "We cannot yet, unfortunately, move on from the Gary Neville moral panic because the Daily Mail are still being entirely ridiculous about it.",
      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",
      "There are some silly Liverpool messages and agreements but the big problem is the MailOnline’s atrocious reporting of that Gary Neville ‘outburst’."

      "A bad defeat against arch-rivals Liverpool will potentially be enough to spell an end to his sorry time at Old Trafford.",
      "There were flickers of positivity to take from the win over Sunderland as Senne Lammens had a positive debut, while Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo continue to find their feet, but Man Utd are still miles away from where they want to be, and there is little evidence of the club ending their prolonged era of misery.",

      "And while Amorim’s stubbornness is one of Man Utd’s biggest issues, the weak character of the squad is arguably even more concerning.",
      "Over at the F365 tables, some damning findings can be found on Man Utd’s start to this season.",
      "Firstly, Man Utd are bottom of our second half table, having only picked up four points after the break from their seven games.",
      "It is a different story with the first half table as United are in a far more respectable position of eighth, as all three of their wins this season were earned via their play in the opening 45 minutes.",
      "There is a similar theme with our conceding first table as Man Utd are 19th in those standings, while they are sixth in the table when scoring first.",
      "Also, Man Utd are joint-bottom of the Premier League on points gained from losing positions, with Amorim’s side yet to pick up a single point after going behind this season.",
      "And the main takeaway from these findings is that their glaring weakness is clear: this Man Utd squad has no backbone and their fragile players wilt at the earliest sign of adversity.",

      "READ: Man United isn’t just a CRISIS club – it’s a CRISIS club in CRISIS purgatory with no means of escape",

      "We are entering a drab October international break and also, by sheer coincidence, Crisis Season in the Premier League. Nothing we can do about that.",
      "Sure, we can do our usual thing of affecting a lofty superiority and pretending it’s all silly tish and daft fipsy.",
      "But really we love it. We love clicks just as much as Reach do, at the end of the day.",
      "And we therefore will proceed to both have our cake by chuckling at the transparency of the collective media attempt to plunge absolutely every team up to and including Arsenal into crisis (and if you don’t believe us, just a reminder that this was the response to them winning a Champions League game 2-0) just before the barren wasteland of a dreary international break, and also eat said cake by leaning directly into the assorted deliciously stupid and stupidly delicious cracked-badge crisis narratives currently knocking about.",
      "Of course, there will always be those clubs where there is no need for manufactured CRISIS storylines. Those clubs who, out of the sheer kindness of their content-generating hearts, find themselves in some state of actual crisis.",
      "And of those clubs, none has been more reliable over recent years than Manchester United. They are putting our kids through college.",
      "It helps, of course it does, that This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. This is a club that sat astride an entire generation of English football at a specifically crucial period for English football.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson remains, in a twisted way, one of the key villains in the story of where Manchester United now find themselves. Looking back, everything he did just made things impossible for absolutely anyone else who came after him.",
      "He not only set impossibly high standards for an impossibly long and successful time, but in doing so allowed everything else at the club to become lazy and complacent, something most visibly obvious in Old Trafford itself and its continuing damp decay. With Fergie at the helm, United literally could not fail. That final title he won before retirement is an almost sarcastic display of achievement despite a club drifting blithely and obliviously towards disaster.",
      "Ferguson left a United playing staff that absolutely nobody else could succeed with, because he might just be the best football manager of all time and nobody else is that.",
      "Unlike, say, Jurgen Klopp and his succession planning at Liverpool, Ferguson did almost nothing to set the next manager up to succeed beyond declaring poor old David Moyes the Chosen One. Even Ferguson’s continued Old Trafford presence in his retirement years feels like it just makes an impossible job even more impossibly hard for whichever poor bastard is currently attempting it.",
      "And some very good and even great managers have tried and failed to lift this giant club from its post-Ferg funk.",
      "Which all rather leaves us pondering something more existential. The question with United, one that most clubs don’t need to ask but that even those who do can provide a plausible answer, is not “Are United in crisis?” But “How do Man United get out of their crisis?”",
      "We genuinely don’t know what that would even look like any more. A non-crisis Manchester United. Can you even imagine such a thing? They’ve tried new players. They’ve tried new managers. They’ve tried new owners. If anything, it always just somehow gets worse. Despite that often appearing to be literally impossible.",
      "It’s still less than a year, for instance, since Erik Ten Hag’s embarrassing banter reign that was saved by outplaying and beating a peak Man City side to win the FA Cup after an eighth-place finish was seen as the lowest United could possibly, feasibly sink. By the time of his long-inevitable departure it was widely agreed that this was surely United’s nadir.",
      "Roll on 11 months and they’re ‘turning a corner’ by beating Sunderland at home to climb to 10th.",
      "It might be an impossible task to ever get Manchester United back to the absurd levels of dominance and success they enjoyed during the ’90s and ’00s, but with every attempt to relocate that spark they drift further and further from even basic big-club competence.",
      "So you end up with a situation where United become the perfect storm. As the biggest club in the country it already takes far less for them to be in crisis than it does for Joe Mid-Table-Battler or Johnny Yo-Yo-Club, yet they have also contrived to be actually bad enough to constitute crisis at any of those clubs as well.",
      "In essence they are deeper down the crisis well than any other club you care to name, yet because TIMUFCWTA they also have much further to climb to escape it any way. We don’t know what a solution might even look like.",
      "But what we can say with some confidence is that it doesn’t look like Ruben Amorim. We really did think it might for a while there. He has the requisite charm and charisma to pull off the performance aspect of being Manchester United Manager. But while you can’t succeed in this job without that, it still isn’t enough on its own.",
      "Because, again, his record isn’t just ‘Bad for Manchester United’ bad; it’s ‘Bad for any Premier League club’ bad. It is relegation-form bad. The only other Premier League clubs with records anywhere near as bad as Amorim’s since he took over have all changed managers because of it, including one who did so out of sheer embarrassment at only beating United 1-0 in a European final.",
      "It’s far more symptom than cause of Manchester United’s ongoing crisis status, but the continued inability to string two wins together is a great bit. It was a running joke during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s time that every month or so United would turn a corner down yet another cul-de-sac, but Amorim has perfected it.",
      "The list of terrible Premier League managers who have at least managed to win two games in a row is a hilarious one, and the fact Amorim talked openly about it before the botched chance at Brentford is revealing in itself.",
      "While the record is specifically around league games, it also highlights just how damaging United’s failure to a) qualify for Europe and then b) avoid total Carabao catastrophe at Grimsby has been.",
      "Because their near total lack of midweek football just gives no chance for any forward momentum to develop while allowing whatever the latest setback might be to moulder and fester for an entire week. United are definitely in their own heads to an uncomfortable degree on this ‘two wins’ thing.",
      "And it also means less chance of some easier games to help things along. You only have to look at Villa right now to see how even a bit of gentle Thursday night Euroball can help change the mood.",
      "United don’t have that option. They don’t have any option. For this once-mighty club, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no end to the tunnel.",
      "There have been plenty of indications but the straw that breaks the Manchester United camel back is here.",
      "The man in charge of United’s football operations wants to give Amorim three years but there has been little to show he deserves that.",
      "We’re not having any of this “can’t we just enjoy all of them?” nonsense here at F365. We’ve decided who the best midfielder is. Or rather which two are the ...",
      "Arsenal are title favourites because they are top of the actual table, but also because of a huge improvement in another Spurs and Bournemouth are leading.",
      "Only three points off the top four but just one ahead of Manchester United, are Chelsea actually any good this season?",
      "Jude Bellingham and Co. face a fight to get back into this England side as Thomas Tuchel’s “team” justified his bold decision and silenced Roy Keane…"

      "The Red Devils had a terrible 2024/25 season with Ruben Amorim’s side finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to qualify for European competition.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund criticised for scoring just seven league goals between them.",
      "Hojlund left on loan for Serie A champions Napoli over the summer, which will probably turn into a permanent transfer, while Zirkzee stayed at Man Utd as back-up.",
      "The Red Devils spent around £200m on attackers in the summer transfer window with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arriving.",

      "And no the Daily Mail claim that Zirkzee is ‘deeply frustrated at his situation, and a move in the January transfer window is seen as absolutely crucial if he is to force his way back into the reckoning for the Netherlands’ World Cup squad next summer’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Chido Obi’s return to the academy setup after he played eight times for the first team last season may see United dig in to keep Zirkzee as back-up, in case anything happens to first-choice striker and £74m summer signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "‘But there is no doubt that Zirkzee’s frustration has escalated significantly in recent weeks, and now his only chance to salvage a season that could cost him a spot at the World Cup appears to be by trying to secure a move away in January.’",
      "Football Insider have a similar report claiming that Zirkzee is set for a ‘surprise exit in January’ with Serie A sides Inter Milan, Juventus and Como ‘looking at the Dutchman’, while West Ham have also joined the race.",
      "Zirkzee has once again been left out of Ronald Koeman’s Netherlands squad for the October international break and the Dutch head coach said back in March that his performances had not been “good enough” to warrant a place in the setup.",
      "Ronald Koeman said: “He wasn’t in the preliminary selection because I don’t think he’s good enough at the moment.",
      "“Especially scanning when turning or passing often goes wrong.",
      "“Yes, in principle form and fitness are always leading, but that is not always possible.",
      "“We have a lot of central defenders and midfielders, but we are somewhat limited up front.",

      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Ah yes. When it’s saying the most hateful, racist and bigoted stuff about minorities such as black people, immigrants and trans women it’s just free speech but when it’s mean comments about white people and men it’s OH MY GOD THIS IS AN OUTRAGE THIS BIGOT SHOULD BE SACKED NOW!",

      "",
      "Absolutely loved your evisceration of the right wing sh*trags and their latest nonsense.",
      "But let’s be honest, it is no surprise is it.",
      "These are the same people – Oliver Brown chief among them – who went after Gary Lineker for years, stamping their feet and having tantrums until they finally got what they wanted.",
      "The nature of these people is such that they always have to have some fresh meat to satisfy their bloodlust. They are truly warped and damaged individuals who either genuinely believe in the ill informed weapons-grade bollocks they spout, or worse, they spout it because they don’t want to upset the people who write their pay cheques.",
      "Like Lineker, Neville has a big platform. He has millions of people who listen to his views on a variety of topics. Some of those views terrify these people because the old media ecosystems of a select number of newspapers and 5 TV channels died a long time ago. Whereas back in the day they could just isolate anyone with a centre or centre left view, they can’t anymore. Social media scares them because they can’t control it. It’s sheer terror, raging against the dying of the light.",
      "If Neville posted a video from his back garden erecting a flag of Yaxley-Lennon’s boat race on a pole, they’d be lauding him as a man of the people, a good old sort. But speak a few home truths they don’t like? Then look out.",
      "The really disturbing thing? They won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast. And that will happen. Because he’s their new burning effigy.",

      "Good mail from Dave in Manchester. Likewise, I wasn’t expecting anything great this season. However, the one thing I was hoping for was the beginnings of a side to build at least the next few years around. One involving Mainoo, Heaven, Yoro, Fredricson, Collyer, Amad, Amass – maybe even some of the next generation – with players like De Ligt, Bruno, Mount and Mazraoui to keep up quality, plus Dorgu and whoever we had as striker.",
      "Sadly, instead of trust in and development of youth, they’ve been used as a scapegoat while the core of the team is the oldest and worst, the players we cannot get rid of – players far worse than the “bomb squad”; the likes of Dalot, Shaw, Casemiro, Maguire.",
      "I don’t care who the manager is, whether they smile in press conferences or what system they play. I don’t even mind a few losses on the journey, but what I do care about is building a side for the future, and that work has to start now.",
      "Continuing to pick Bruno at CM is misguided at best, but a central partnership with Casemiro rather than letting Mainoo, Ugarte or Collyer develop into the role is the definition of short-term thinking and a suicide note and should be considered as much.",
      "Maybe he’ll finally change his ways. But just like every defence of Amorim, it’s entirely based on hypotheticals, and after nearly a year, that’s not enough.\nBadwolf",
      "",
      "So I keep hearing how other clubs need to click. Man City are transitioning. When Liverpool’s attack clicks, the league will feel it. So Arsenal’s attack will not click? or Chelsea’s attack? Basically, if you look at Man City 1st XI, basically the same team, bar Tejinders and Donnarumma. When you look at Liverpool’s 1st XI, same team, bar Wirtz, Isak, and Kerkez (I do not rate Frimpong, because whoever decided to buy a wing back who can’t cross or defend as a full back should be queried), and if you look at Arsenal’s 1st XI, basically the same team bar Zubimendi, Gyokeres, and Eze.",
      "One of the managers has never won a league title, but I hear stuff like when Liverpool attack clicks, Man City are transitioning, someone even wrote in today, and I quote, “more familiarity in selection. Arsenal got in 8 new players !!!!!!. We need to click too. We need our medical team to sort itself out so we get our players back. We are a work in Progress. Remember, we have never won the league",
      "As an aside, Wirtz was brought in to mitigate Trent’s deep-lying creativity;  most teams will get a deep-lying playmaker. its the logical thing to do as pure No. 10s are a dying breed, but Not Slot, he opted for a No. 10 who played his best and most productive football in his career in a team that had a deep-lying line-breaking playmaker (Xhaka), and did not get any DM with DLP characteristics, although Endo is not really fit for purpose. Secondly, Luiz Diaz left; he was marginally superior to Gakpo. Was he replaced? No. Slot decided Chiesa and Rio will step in, that way Gakpo isn’t challenged anymore, and I remember Elliot coming on for a tired Salah in Paris against PSG, that was also not replaced. I keep wondering why he did not get quality alternatives to his countrymen.",
      "So in summary, about half of $1b spent on an EPL winning squad, leaving it short of a CB, a DM, and a wing forward of reasonable quality.\nKufre, Nigeria, mail so long, I actually got bored",
      "",
      "The reaction to Arsenal vs other teams is just amazing.  I’ve written emails into f365 this past year or two, only to just delete and think, nah, can’t be bothered to get involved.",
      "As soon Arsenal win a penalty someone pipes up in the mailbox saying it started outside the box and we should never complain again.\nThe foul continued into the box and that’s why it was given. The initial contact outside the box wasn’t enough… and you should also know, it was Michael Oliver on VAR, so it had to be Stonewall to qualify.",
      "No fuss regarding Paulinha at spurs celebrating a last minute equalizer with his shirty off vs wolves who had lost their first five. If that was an Arsenal player…",
      "Same goes for Maresca going full Mourinho with a winner vs Liverpool like he’d won the league. If that was Arteta…",
      "Last week we had the absolute gems from Newcastle fans saying Gabriel should have been sent off for some handbags with Woltermade and completely ignoring LaScelles going full Nic Cage/John Travolta and trying to swap faces with Gyokeres.",
      "The list is endless. I actually dont have any issue with over exuberant celebrations,  or the tribal ignorance. I get it, go mental, defend your club, you’ve won a game and show you care, but the absolute double standard is amazing to see.",
      "Also, one last unrelated point. Im pretty sure Will Ford and Stewie Griffin are the same person.\nStrevs, AFC,  Canada",
      "",
      "Heard a bod called Gilbert Enoka on t’wireless today. World class coach who worked with the All Blacks for years no less. In his humble opinion, after being shown Ickle Mikel’s light bulb speech, he politely eviscerated it (after stifling a chuckle). He cited the example of the All Blacks’ manager being asked if the team talks he used to do were more for himself than the team. The team, when asked whether they were even paying attention, told him they weren’t taking the slightest bit of notice. So they stopped, because the manager had enough humility to do so, and because it wasn’t adding anything to the overall objective: Win (not the dog Mikel).",
      "The underlying theory being that if you need to cosplay David Brent in the moments before the players go out for kick off, then something is wrong in your match prep. Obviously most managers do some sort of brief team talk, but very few that I am aware of do the kind of cringe whiteboard work that Legohead loves so much.\nRHT/TS x",
      "",
      "Of course pointing at Arsenal when you are dropping points is not the game and that mailbox contributor should wind it in. But I wouldn’t say that you can lose a 5 point lead in gameweek 7. Teams play each other at different times in the season and earn their points at different times. I am of course very much looking forward to playing a promoted team, an Ange Postecoglou team and West Ham at home.",
      "Whilst it is a Rafa fact that Liverpool are playing badly, when did a visit to Stamford Bridge become a 3 point banker? Even if Liverpool were playing very well, there is no reason to expect 3 points from there. Same for Glasner’s Palace away. Galatasaray was what it was. A one nil loss to a weak pen in Turkey in a phase of the Champions League where the prize for coming top of the league is playing PSG. Its just about getting to the next phase. The team with the most points in the group, now league phase, rarely win the tournament.",
      "But Liverpool are playing badly. There’s very little coaching time this time of the season. Its 2 games a week, international break, 2 games a week and now another international week. Although Slot won’t be with his players, hopefully he and his brain trust can work something out otherwise City are starting to look dangerous and we could be looking at third! (It wasn’t that long ago that we would be celebrating third)",

      "The Man Utd outcast was ineffective in his first couple of games for Barcelona, but he has been one of their best players in recent weeks, grabbing three goals and five assists in ten appearances in all competitions.",
      "Therefore, a permanent transfer to Barcelona is looking increasingly likely and Romano claims he is “very happy” with five things at Barcelona.",
      "“For Marcus Rashford, there’s no obligation to buy, it’s a loan with a buy option for €30 million. This is the fee in case Barcelona decide to sign Rashford in the summer of 2026,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Liverpool dominating PL, Wirtz POTY, new Hojlund among ten PL knee-jerk reactions already wrong",
      "“So Rashford is doing very well, a very good impact, and it’s still the beginning. It’s just two months into his new chapter at Barcelona. So Rashford is very happy with the situation.",
      "“I can tell you that Rashford is very happy with the city, with the league, with the club, with the manager, and with the teammates.",
      "“Rashford loves his new life at Barcelona. And so Rashford is fully focused on Barca, not even thinking about the Manchester United return from the loan and maybe make it again at United one day. The full focus is on Barcelona.”",
      "A report from The Boot Room‘s Graeme Bailey, meanwhile, claims the ‘truth’ on Man Utd’s ‘stance’ is that they have ‘little intention of handing Rashford a surprise lifeline despite his impressive form for Barcelona’.",
      "“Marcus Rashford is thoroughly enjoying his time at Barcelona, he made it clear more than 12 months before that he wanted to move to the Nou Camp,” Bailey told The Boot Room.",
      "“Now in Catalunya, there is no way he wants to return to Old Trafford. United still have him under contract to 2028, but Barca have the option on him and they intend to use it, although they want to talk terms.",
      "“United, in theory, know they could keep him but as it stands the club have little intention of doing so.”",
      "On fellow loanee Rasmus Hojlund, Bailey added: “Hojlund was a case that he had to go; they had signed Benjamin Sesko for huge money – he knew his time was up and the Ruben Amorim system wasn’t working for him.",
      "“Hojlund had such a huge expectation on his shoulders and that is a tough thing to deal with, and it just didn’t work out. But United always believed there was a player there, and they always appreciated his professionalism and the hard work.",
      "“Again, it was no surprise to them that a club like Napoli came in for him, and they are happy to see him performing – obviously, there is no way back as the deal for him is an obligation.”",
      "We all love to laugh at Man Utd players thriving away from Old Trafford, but Liverpool have more players in the top ten Premier League defectors of the season.",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck in landing Marcus Rashford from Man Utd over the summer, according to reports.",
      "It has been claimed that Marcus Rashford has given Manchester United a “big issue”, with the Premier League giants “boxed in”.",

      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",
      "Paul Scholes has received criticism for admitting he ‘struggles to feel happy’ for Marcus Rashford in Barcelona. But why should he?"

      "They look like they have a potential emerging No 1 in Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko had by far his best game for United so far, his pressing and ability to bring others into play were particularly impressive.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe mentioned Arsenal's faith in Mikel Arteta when saying he would like to give Ruben Amorim three years at Man Utd, but how does his record in his first 50 games in charge compare? Have your say in our poll",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",

      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",

      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",

He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me.

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."
