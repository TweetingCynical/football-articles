      "Arsenal considered a move for Manchester United outcast Alejandro Garnacho before opting against a move, it has been claimed. The winger has been left out of United's pre-season tour, with Chelsea closing in on a cut-price deal, but their London rivals turned to other targets after exploring a shock deal.",
      "The Gunners ended up turning their attentions to Noni Madueke, who joined from Chelsea in a £48millon deal. And they weren't the only ones to move on from Garnacho.",
      "Those teams also ultimately looked elsewhere. Spurs paid £55m to sign Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, while Atleti added both Alex Baena and Thiago Almada.",
      "Chelsea are understood to have agreed personal terms with Garnacho, with negotiations over a fee ongoing. They have until September 1 to get a deal done, with United already dropping their asking price since the Blues' January interest.",
      "Garnacho featured in all but two of United's Premier League matches last season, scoring six goals. He didn't start any of the final three games, though, and the writing appeared to be on the wall after he was left out of the starting line-up for the Europa League final.",
      "\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" he said after the defeat against Spurs. \"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "In early August, United boss Ruben Amorim made his feelings clear when it came to Garnacho's future. \"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” the boss said.",
      "\"But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that.",
      "\"So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection. Other times you want a new challenge. So we try to make everything OK for all parties. To the club, to the coach and to the player. It's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "Trossard, 30, missed Arsenal's final two friendlies with a muscle injury while 26-year-old Zubimendi wasn't seen in any images from the club's media day ahead of the 2025-26 campaign. Spain international Zubimendi has been signed to take Arsenal to the next level and improve their midfield.",
      "The playmaker cost £55.8million from Real Sociedad, making him the Gunners' second-most expensive signing of the summer transfer window. And it's good news for fans wanting to see him in competitive action for the first time, having shown glimpses of his quality in pre-season.",
      "\"Yes, he had a great integration,\" Arteta told reporters when asked if Zubimendi would be available. \"As everybody can see this immediately, he's had a very big impact on the team. I'm really happy and he will be fit.",
      "Trossard, who's been linked with a move away this summer, is expected to join him in Arsenal's matchday squad. \"Yeah, I think he's much better,\" Arteta added. \"I think he will be able to train again tomorrow (Saturday) and if that's the case, he will be fit.\"",
      "The Gunners manager will have numerous difficult decisions to make when he selects his starting XI. The most noteworthy is who'll get the nod up front?",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has arrived in a deal which could rise to £63.7m but Kai Havertz is back in contention after missing most of the second half of last term through injury. Asked whether it's a fight between Gyokeres and Havertz for the No.9 position, Arteta replied: \"It's always good.",
      "\"I play with 11 players, there are going to be some players on the bench that are going to be used, some others that cannot be used, some players that we're going to have to leave in the stands. That's the next level that we're going to face, something that we probably haven't faced before.",
      "How should Arsenal line up against Manchester United? Let us know your starting XI in the comments section.",
      "\"I've heard a lot that you have two players per position, well we have three and four because there are players that can play in different positions as well. It's going to be about earning the right to play, to compete and when you don't have the chance to do that, to cooperate in the right way with any teammate to improve the level.",
      "\"It's going to happen to all of them because the season is going to be so demanding that the first week is going to be a little bit different. But the moment we start to play three times a week, it's going to flow in a really natural way.\"",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has faced a barrage of questions about Manchester United's interest in Carlos Baleba. However, he remains confident that the £100million-rated youngster will stay put this summer.",
      "United already splashed out over £200m to strengthen Ruben Amorim's attack with the likes of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko, following a lengthy saga, and Bryan Mbeumo all recruited. The Red Devils are now keen to bolster their midfield and some United stars are believed to have even reached out to Baleba in order to convince him to move to Old Trafford.",
      "The Seagulls' young Cameroonian star is top of United's wish list, and it's reported that contact was made last week, although United do have alternatives in mind. Ahead of Brighton's season opener against Fulham on Saturday, head coach Hurzeler fielded numerous queries about Baleba, with the German showing a defiant stance on his young star.",
      "It's now believed that United have decided to postpone a move for the 21-year-old due to his hefty £100m plus price tag. Interest is set to be reignited next year, and while all hope isn't lost, senior figures at the club think a deal in this transfer window before 1 September is unlikely.",
      "Nevertheless, in Hurzeler's view, any potential move for the costly Baleba will definitely have to wait until this current Premier League campaign concludes. Here's what he revealed about the United target on Friday as three crucial questions were addressed.",
      "Hurzeler: \"Very, very, very confident [that he will not leave]. Yes. This is just my belief.\"",
      "Hurzeler: \"I didn't see any change in him. He only changed his hair, so I think that was the only change he made in the last two weeks! But overall, he seems to be in a really good place.",
      "\"He's enjoying it with his team-mates. He's enjoying being a Brighton player. He's very grateful to have the progress he made in the last season. So I didn't see any big change.\"",
      "Hurzeler: \"He is an option to start tomorrow, yes. Now I only have to mention two names [out injured]. It's a big change compared to last season. So a big thank you to my medical staff, to my physios.",
      "\"They did a great job during the summer, so the only players are not available are Adam Webster and Solly March, they are the long-term ones.",
      "\"I don't know the clear schedule about them but all the other players are available. So it's a big change and a positive change, and hopefully it stays like this.\"",

      "Adam Wharton could have saved his grandparents a lot of worry by signing for Manchester United back in 2024 - but it was Crystal Palace who took the gamble on him instead. Fast forward 18 months and the Eagles can now command a huge fee for the England international thanks to his impressive displays in south London.",
      "Wharton's career has been on a meteoric rise since his days at Ewood Park, where he made 44 appearances and scored four goals from midfield. Last year, it was reported that United scouts were among those keeping tabs on the promising 21-year-old.",
      "Despite interest from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, it was Palace who secured the youngster's signature in a deal worth up to £22m. With 36 Premier League appearances already to his name – not to mention victories in the FA Cup and Community Shield – Wharton has been turning heads at both club and international level.",
      "The talented midfielder was also called up to the England senior team for Euro 2024, just days after making his international debut for the Three Lions in June.",
      "All of that combines to make Wharton an extremely valuable asset for Palace, with some fans rating him as a £100m player. However, it is understood that the Eagles value Wharton a slightly more modest £60m, which still represents a marked uptick on the price the Red Devils could have signed him for in 2024.",
      "A move up north would have also been a preference for his family life, as his dad revealed last year that his grandmothers were \"worried sick\" about him relocating to south London to play for Palace – although father John insists he hasn't regretted the move since.",
      "The English star is one of two players that Ruben Amorim is pondering over adding to his midfield this summer, with Carlos Baleba being the more likely choice. However, United may have repeated their error with the Brighton ace, as he was up for grabs for a mere £23m back in 2023.",
      "While playing for Lille, the 21-year-old caught the eye of the Old Trafford club, but the Seagulls snapped him up on a five-year contract instead. Now, they value Baleba at over £100m – meaning Amorim's squad would be shelling out £81m more than necessary if they decide to swoop for the Cameroonian.",
      "With Wharton as a possible alternative, supporters might be hoping that this transfer could be slightly less complicated; but that's not the case. The sale of the England midfielder could hinge entirely on Palace's ability to keep hold of other star players in their team, specifically Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze.",
      "Liverpool have shown serious interest in luring Guehi away from the club he leads, tabling an offer potentially worth £35m. While the Eagles have no intention of allowing their star defender to depart, the 25-year-old's deal runs out next summer - and Guehi appears content to run down his existing contract.",
      "Eze is similarly drawing attention this summer, with both north London clubs keen on securing the talented midfielder's services. Arsenal and Tottenham are potentially planning to wait out the England international's £68m release clause, which expires at the end of this week.",
      "Wharton's potential departure may hinge entirely on whether one or both of his teammates seek fresh challenges elsewhere. With Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all in the building ahead of United's league opener against the Gunners on Sunday, Amorim is eager to kickstart his vision at Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking about his \"selection headache\" before the Premier League curtain-raiser earlier this week, the manager told MUTV: \"That [a selection headache] is a good thing, it is supposed to be like that, not like last season that we have to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch.",
      "\"This is the normal thing so I need to think and they [the players] need to fight during the week, so they can change my mind, I have an idea but they will change my mind during the week.",
      "\"It is going to be tough because we try to arrange a full week of training, so we will have two really strong sessions with time to work and then we are going to break a little bit and then two days to really think about the strategy for the game and we will be ready.\"",

      "The Red Devils have had a fruitful summer both on and off the pitch, welcoming four new signings and maintaining an unbeaten streak in pre-season. Consequently, there's a renewed sense of optimism swirling around Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim enters his first full season at the helm.",
      "In anticipation of the Gunners' visit, the Premier League has confirmed seasoned ref Hooper will be in charge of the match. And he'll be as eager as anyone else to avoid major incident at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "The 43-year-old has officiated more than 120 games in England's top flight during his career. But Hooper found himself at the heart of controversy when United edged out Wolves 1-0 at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the 2023/24 season.",
      "It was his decision not to award Wolves a penalty in the dying moments of that match. All eyes turned to Hooper when United debutant Andre Onana collided with striker Sasa Kalajdzic while attempting to intercept a cross.",
      "But the Cameroon international got his timing wrong and clattered into the Wolves frontman while aiming for the ball. The result was widespread furore, with then-Wolves boss Gary O'Neil among the most incensed.",
      "O'Neil revealed after the match that the visiting team had received an apology from Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). This was of course in relation to Hooper's failure to award a penalty, frustrating the team that they had been deprived a potential equaliser.",
      "Hooper was subsequently dropped from the refereeing roster for the following weekend's fixtures, as he was taken out of the firing line.",
      "As if the apology wasn't enough acknowledgement that he had got the call wrong, his omission from the next round of games only added to Wolves' frustration.",
      "Hooper will be supported by Adrian Holmes and Simon Long at Old Trafford this Sunday, with Jarred Gillett acting as the fourth official. Paul Tierney will be handling VAR duties, assisted by Steven Meredith.",
      "United haven't won a league fixture against the Gunners since September 2022, though they did knock them out of last term's FA Cup third round on penalties.",
      "Despite rumours linking United with a move for PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma, Onana could still start between the posts at Old Trafford on Sunday after missing pre-season through injury.",

      "Ian Wright reckons Viktor Gyokeres will be on another level to Benjamin Sesko in the Premier League this season. The former Arsenal striker hit back at double standards from Gary Neville over what would constitute a positive season for the division's newest forwards.",
      "The Gunners were in the market for both players before opting to sign Gyokeres in a deal worth close to £64million. The Swede arrives from Sporting CP after averaging more than a goal per game last season.",
      "Sesko meanwhile, despite interest from Newcastle United, ultimately chose to join Manchester United in a deal worth up to £74m. Both goalscorers could feature as the two historied rivals meet in their opening fixture.",
      "But former Manchester United captain Gary Neville caught Wright's ire when establishing targets for the Red Devils' new frontline. The Salford City owner wants to see Sesko, along with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, combine to hit 35 goals, of which the Slovenia international could be content with ten.",
      "Wright was incredulous at Neville's suggestion after the pundit had disregarded the same figure being enough for Gyokeres. “You look at Sesko and he scored 13 goals in 38 games in the German league (sic), Marmoush left in December (23 January) and had 15,” Wright said on the Overlap.",
      "“That says to me as a striker that he should be scoring more at that level, so you’re coming to United… I think Gyökeres… he’s got such great ability and physical, I think he’s going to be another [level]. He’ll get 15 [goals].",
      "“But that is a worry, 13 for a whole season, that would be a worry for me… what if he [Sesko] got 10 goals [in the Premier League ]? What if he got 10? Because you just turned your nose up at me when I mentioned Gyökeres and 10 [goals], and now you’re thinking about Šeško and 10 [goals].\"",
      "\"I don’t care [that Gyökeres is further in his career],\" he added. \"It’s Man United and you have to expect it… am I hearing this right?! Why can’t I have [10 goals] for Gyökeres? When I said 10 you turned your nose up like I was smelling poo.”",
      "Sesko's agent recent gave his interpretation of why a move to Arsenal did not materialise despite the Gunners making the early progress for a transfer. \"It's hard to say exactly,\" Elvis Basanovic said.",
      "\"Whenever a deal doesn't go through, there are always several factors. In the end, everything has to align for it to happen.",
      "\"What's important here is that Benjamin's wish, for years now, has always been United. And for United, he was even willing to take a pay cut to make the move happen. As his agent, I wanted to make that wish come true.\"",

      "There has been plenty of speculation that goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez could move on from B6 this summer, and Unai Emery will get a glimpse of life without the World Cup winner this weekend. Martinez is on the sidelines through suspension after he was sent off in their agonising final-day defeat at Old Trafford which cost them the Champions League.",
      "Andoni Iraola is already looking at fielding at a very different Cherries XI on Friday night with the majority of their back five from last season moving on. Kepa - who spent last season on loan from Chelsea - is now with Arsenal, Dean Huijsen has joined Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi has signed for PSG, while Milos Kerkez will be lining up against them at Anfield.",

It's too early for him to play as he hasn't done any pre-season. He hasn't done a lot of things for a lot of weeks, so it's too early - but it's good to have him back on the pitch with the group.\"",

      "\"There's been interest in Yoane and I've been very clear on the situation. As a head coach, I want Yoane in the building and I want him to be a part of the first-team squad.

      "The Seagulls will be without Solly March, Adam Webster and Julio Enciso when they host Fulham on Saturday, with the trio all currently dealing with knee injuries. Jack Hinshelwood and new signing Charalampos Kostoulas are also doubts.",

      "Levi Colwill could miss the entire season after he underwent ACL surgery earlier this month, while Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia and Omari Kellyman are also out with injuries. Mykhailo Mudryk is currently suspended after he was charged by the FA over Anti-Doping Rule Violations.",
      "Nicolas Jackson will miss Chelsea's opener after being sent off against Newcastle last season, while Wesley Fofana's involvement against Crystal Palace is doubtful. \"Fofana could be available - we will see,\" manager Enzo Maresca said.",

      "Dalchi Kamada will also miss the trip across the capital after being forced off with an injury during their Community Shield win over Liverpool last weekend.",
      "Jarrad Branthwaite will miss the start of the new season with a hamstring injury, while it appears Everton can call on Vitalii Mykolenko, Nathan Patterson and Harrison Armstrong for their first game against Leeds.",
      "Jack Grealish is also in line to make his Toffees bow, despite arriving on loan from Manchester City just a matter of days ago.",
      "Antonee Robinson will miss Fulham's opener against Brighton after undergoing knee surgery, while Ryan Gravenberch is a doubt after picking up a knock during their final pre-season game against Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Defenders Jayden Bogle and Sebastiaan Bornauw are doubts for Leeds' clash with Everton on Monday, while new signing Jaka Bijol is suspended after he was sent off in his final Serie A game for Udinese last season.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin is also set to become a Leeds player, though it remains to be seen whether he has been registered in time to play for his new club this weekend.",
      "Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez are both injury doubts after missing the Community Shield, with Liverpool boss Arne Slot saying of Gomez: \"I have to make a decision on that. I think he only trained twice now, missed quite a lot in pre-season.",
      "\"But if you looked at our bench against Palace, I think there were three players that were 20 years old or younger. So, there is a possibility that Joe might be on the bench but I have to look at the numbers and who we’re going to take.\"",
      "Ryan Gravenberch will miss the opening game against Bournemouth through suspension, having been sent off against Crystal Palace on the final day of last season.",
      "Mateo Kovacic and Claudio Echeverri will both miss Manchester City's opener against Wolves, while Rodri is likely out until September after picking up an injury at the Club World Cup. Jokso Gvardiol and Savinho will also miss the trip to the Midlands with injuries.",
      "Most intriguingly though, Ederson is also set to be absent from their matchday squad. The Brazilian has been linked with an exit, with reports Gianluigi Donnarumma is waiting in the wings to replace him. For this Saturday at least, James Trafford is in line for his chance.",
      "Lisandro Martinez remains sidelined after suffering a serious knee injury last season, while Noussair Mazraoui is also out of action. Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee remain injury doubts, but the pair were back training with the rest of the squad earlier this week.",
      "Ruben Amorim said: \"No, Licha [Martinez] and Mazraoui are out, they cannot play this game. Josh and Andre are recovering and are options. We'll see.\"",
      "New signing Benjamin Sesko could start on his debut, with Amorim confirming the £74m star is physically ready.",
      "Joe Willock remains out of action with a calf injury, while Alexander Isak will not be involved amid ongoing uncertainty about his future. \"Alex's situation has been unchanged for a while, and that will continue to be the case,\" Newcastle boss Eddie Howe said ahead of their opener against Aston Villa.",
      "\"I've had a great relationship with Alex. You need that with every player. I take my part in that relationship really importantly. I have to work really closely with the player to his benefit.\"",
      "Nicolas Dominguez is the only absentee for Nuno Espirito Santo, with the Nottingham Forest star sidelined with a serious knee injury. Reports claimed in May that Dominguez would be sidelined for at least four months.",
      "Sunderland have a number of injury problems ahead of their opener against West Ham, with Romaine Mundle, Aljibola Alese, Leo Hjelde and Dennis Cirkin all sidelined. Manager Regis Le Bris has also admitted new signing Omar Alderete is \"probably not really ready to start a game\".",
      "Fellow new signings Marc Guiu and Arthur Masuaku are also doubts, with Le Bris adding: \"I think with Marc, Arthur and Omar, we are going to have the opportunity to select them. I think it might be a little bit tough to start because of their fitness levels and because they have not had much time with their teammates, but that is a decision we will make on Friday morning.\"",
      "James Maddison could miss the entire season after suffering an ACL injury in pre-season, while Radu Dragusin, Dejan Kulusevski, Destiny Udgoie, Bryan Gil and Kota Takai will also miss their opener through injury.",
      "Manor Solomon is a doubt with a \"minor calf injury\", but Yves Bissouma is available for the game against Burnley after missing the Super Cup defeat to Paris Saint-Germain due to disciplinary reasons.",
      "\"Every player who was available [on Wednesday] is available for the team,\" Thomas Frank said. \"Destiny [Udogie] is progressing but it's too early for him to be involved in the squad. Bissouma was a situation. I addressed it, there was a consequence. He will be in the squad tomorrow.\"",
      "Crysencio Summerville and George Earthy are set to miss West Ham's opening game against Sunderland on Saturday with thigh and ankle injuries respectively.",
      "Yerson Mosquera is likely to be on the bench as he continues to recover from a serious knee injury. Fabio Silva is unlikely to be involved while his future remains up in the air, while Leon Chiwone will also miss Wolves' first game of the season against Manchester City on Saturday.",

      "At the other end of the table he has the three promoted sides - Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland all dropping. But in between that, the selections get a little funky.",
      "Ferdinand took to TikTok ahead of the new season to forecast where every side would finish, and did so using a filter that randomly selected a team. He would then place sides on a blank table continuously until complete, leaving room for some blunders.",

      "Those in Manchester, after spending £200million on their frontline, are now looking to bolster their midfield. The finances of the deal could yet prove beyond them with Brighton looking for around £100m before they consider letting Baleba leave the club.",
      "United are prepared to delay a move for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba until next year due to the difficulties involved, but the MEN claims that the 21-year-old would keen on making the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Hurzeler is heading into his second season in charge and has had Baleba as part of his pre-season preparations. Despite talk of a move away the manager insists he's seen no change in the player's demeanour and believes he's committed to the cause. He said: \"I didn't see any change, he only changed his hair! He is enjoying being a Brighton player.\"",
      "Already this summer Brighton have sold Joao Pedro, who left for Chelsea in a deal worth £60m, which has lessened their need to part with their top talent. The Seagulls have previously been willing to let their star men go, but only once they've landed huge profits.",

We hope he'll be here for years to come - but its subject to the dynamics of the football world, which isn't always predictable.\"",
      "United could turn their attention to Sporting Lisbon star Morten Hjulmand if they feel as though they Baleba is out of reach and they need reinforcements. The Dane would be available for £50m, which is notably less than his £68m release clause.

      "Newcastle United could solve Alexander Isak's transfer standoff by agreeing to sell him next summer once they've found a replacement, says former Premier League defender Chris Powell. The Swedish striker made his intentions to quit Tyneside known back in July and has since attracted a jaw-dropping £110million offer from reigning champions Liverpool.",
      "But the Magpies rate their star man much higher, leaving negotiations at a complete deadlock at St. James' Park. Isak has made it abundantly clear he won't pull on a Newcastle shirt this season as he pushes for his dream switch to Anfield, though with no improved offer on the table, the situation is becoming increasingly toxic.",
      "Powell, who featured in the top flight for Derby County, Charlton and Watford before moving into management, thinks there's still a way forward and believes the club could throw Isak a lifeline by promising to cash in on him in 12 months once they've lined up a proper replacement.",
      "\"There is a way back for Newcastle if they say to Isak, 'Give us a year,'\" said Powell, Footy Accumulators No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, in partnership with BOYLE Sports.",
      "\"We've seen it before with (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Sir Alex Ferguson) Fergie, give him a year and he can go next summer. That gives them time to get a replacement.",
      "\"At the moment, they've missed out on (Benjamin) Sesko, (Bryan) Mbeumo, one or two others, they can't get a replacement now. All of a sudden, they might panic and get players they don't necessarily want.\"",
      "Newcastle have had two record-breaking bids for strikers rejected this summer, including a £70m offer for Hugo Ekitike that was turned down, reports Chronicle Live.",
      "Liverpool managed to secure the signing of Frankfurt's French striker in a £79m deal, and shortly after, another target, Benjamin Sesko, also eluded them.",
      "The Magpies made two offers for RB Leipzig forward, with the second bid escalating to £75m. Despite Newcastle's more lucrative offer, Manchester United ended up securing his services.",
      "Howe's side missed yet another opportunity to replace the 25-year-old, leaving Isak in a state of uncertainty. He is currently training separately from his Newcastle colleagues.",
      "Powell has suggested that the club should reach a compromise with Isak, convincing him to stay for another year before guaranteeing his departure next summer when a new striker can be signed without any rush. However, the 55-year-old concedes that Isak's move to Liverpool in the future is inevitable, despite the club's insistence that he is not for sale.",
      "\"I think Isak's going to Liverpool. For him to do that and express his desire to leave, he's going,\" continued Powell, who last coached Sheffield Wednesday, a position he left in July.",

      "It was Amorim who bought Hjulmand to the Portuguese capital and he's known to be a fan of his leadership qualities. The midfielder is also fully embedded in how to play in the 3-4-3 system that the United manager has been implementing.",
      "Baleba remains the first choice target in Manchester but Brighton want more than £100m before they part with their player, making Hjulmand a far cheaper alternative at a time when cash is not freely available for the Premier League side.",
      "Hjulmand played 65 times during his spell together with Amorim at Sporting - winning two Primeira Liga titles and a Taca de Portugal. The Dane scored his first goal of the season as he helped Sporting secure a 2-0 league opening win over Casa Pia on Friday.",

      "Steve McManaman believes Marcus Rashford has no place at Barcelona despite his sensational loan move. The Manchester United forward finally sealed a move away from Old Trafford last month as he moved to Catalonia for the forthcoming season.",
      "The switch sees him move on loan, albeit Barcelona have an option to make the move permanent next summer for around £30m. But Rashford has had a slow start to life in Spain.",
      "Barcelona are still struggling to register him for this season’s La Liga opener due to their uncertain financial situation. And Liverpool icon McManaman struggles to see Rashford getting an opportunity given the options that the club already have.",
      "“It's certainly important that he hits the ground running,” he said at an event with ESPN. “I thought it was an incredible move for him, to be very honest.",
      "“The last couple of seasons at Manchester United, the way Manchester United performed - for him to leave and go to arguably one of the most exciting teams in Europe, I thought: 'He's got an amazing agent.'",
      "“Where's he going to fit in? The answer is, I don't know. Because Raphinha, Robert [Lewandowski] and Lamine [Yamal], they had the most incredible season.",
      "“So you think that is set in stone. You've got Ferran [Torres] behind them. They've moved a couple of players out - if anything, when you look at Barcelona's team, they need a couple of more defenders... but they go and bring in yet another forward. So we'll wait and see.”",
      "McManaman added: “I hope he's a huge success, and I hope he does play. Because it will benefit everybody if he does play.”",
      "Barcelona are just a day from starting their latest La Liga season as they travel to Mallorca on Saturday evening. As it stands, Rashford’s registration has still not been approved.",
      "But it appears that the Spanish giants are set to take emergency action to ensure that he can play sooner rather than later. According to The Athletic, Barcelona executives would be willing to put their own personal wealth at risk to secure a bank guarantee worth around €7million (£6m).",
      "Rashford is not the only player who is not eligible to play though. Goalkeepers Joan Garcia and Wojciech Szczesny, as well as young defender Gerard Martin, are still not registered.",
      "Rashford will certainly be keen to get back on the pitch sooner rather than later having scored four goals in 17 appearances on loan at Aston Villa last season, albeit the Premier League side chose not to sign him permanently.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes admits it \"doesn't fill me with pride\" that he gets lauded whilst playing in a failing Manchester United side - and would much rather play a lesser role to see the team succeed.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker enjoyed another stellar campaign on an individual basis, but did so whilst the Red Devils endured their lowest ever Premier League finish. Their dire campaign was their worst since the mid 1970s and saw them end up in 15th.",
      "Fernandes' solo stats still made for impressive reading and he was often left to carry the struggling outfit. He scored 19 goals in all competitions and was nominated for the PFA Player of the Year award alongside the likes of Mohamed Salah and Cole Palmer.",
      "The 30-year-old's influence was such that Jeff Stelling remarked that they'd be fighting to remain a top flight team minus him. “Without Bruno Fernandes this season, Manchester United would be battling to stay out of the bottom three,” he said in April.",
      "Despite being hailed for his individual contributions Fernandes takes no solace from those reviews and would rather see his role and importance reduce if it meant the team were on the up.",
      "He told ESPN Brazil: \"I hope you'll hear less about Bruno this year, but a lot more about United. That's my main objective because my name being spoken, let's say vaguely alone, It doesn't fill me with pride or anything.",
      "\"United being talked about, being positive, that's the most important thing and that's what I want for this season. If it happens that Bruno has to score fewer goals, provide less assists or do another type of provision of what is necessary for the games, I would be very happy.\"",
      "There is likely to be less of a reliance on Fernandes to contribute in the final third. The playmaker has been joined by more than £200million worth of talent in Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and is confident that the right moves are being taken.",
      "He added: \"Now people have joined the club, not just the players, but also staff and management, who have a different vision. I hope that all these changes and everything that we have done can bring the club back to the place where it really deserves to be.\"",

      "If history is anything to go by don't necessarily expect the Premier League's first weekend to produce the results you expect - in fact the first set of fixtures are littered with shock results.",
      "Some of those have been a sign of things to come, others may involve a new manager or a new look team just getting to grips with each other and on some occasions it is an early speed bump, but nothing that matters come crunch time in May.",
      "The opening set of games can be unkind - just ask Manchester United and Arsenal as they prepare to square off on Sunday. For others, like Liverpool at home to Bournemouth, there's an expectation they should get the job done with minimal fuss.",
      "Manchester City head to Wolves, which has not always been a happy hunting ground, whilst Chelsea host the Community Shield winners Crystal Palace. Tottenham's game with newly promoted Burnley is also one the north Londoners are expected to negotiate.",
      "But the early weeks of the season, often involving new players and new systems, can mean the status quo is thrown out. They can lead to knee jerk reactions, especially if transfer windows have not gone to plan.",
      "We take a look back at some of the opening weekend results that raised serious eyebrows - some situations that were recoverable and others that were the beginning of the end.",
      "The Erik ten Hag era did not begin well as Brighton, then led by Graham Potter, rocked up at Old Trafford and found themselves ahead by the half hour mark. By half-time it was 2-0 and the home fans were shell shocked as their new manager was being outclassed. United pulled a goal back to set up a nervy finish, but it wasn't to be as Cristiano Ronaldo was bought off the bench to try and be the saviour.",
      "Remember the name Reece Oxford? He produced the one and only standout game of his career as he bossed the midfield to give the Slaven Bilic era the perfect start. It was also the match where the Hammers realised they had a potential star in Dimitri Payet. Arsenal thought they'd got the missing piece of the jigsaw when they signed Petr Cech, only for him to make a notable error for one of the goals.",
      "Another forgettable afternoon at the Emirates to begin the season. Boos rang out at full-time as Arsene Wenger saw his side beaten with Antonio Luna among the scorers. Arsenal would react by signing Mesut Ozil and rebuilding their season impressively, but before the German arrived it was looking like a bleak season in north London.",
      "Like the aforementioned Ten Hag, this was another new era that did not begin as planned. One this occasion it was Louis van Gaal, the Champions League-winning manager, who was outdone by Garry Monk. Wayne Rooney cancelled out Swansea's opening goal and it was set-up for the Red Devils to come from behind and pick up the three points - but Gylfi Sigurdsson had other ideas will the game's winner.",
      "The Blues hoped to build on a record-breaking title success under Antonio Conte, but that summer was marred by the club consistently failing to get the Italian's targets over the line. So come the first game of the season, against Sean Dyche's Burnley, the feeling was not positive and when the Clarets raced into a 3-0 lead the clouds were gathering over Stamford Bridge. A late fightback made the result look better, but it was not the start anyone wanted.",
      "An iconic scene as Premier League matches welcomed back full stadiums for the Bees' top flight debut. Their stadium was bouncing with Arsenal coming to town and the newly promoted side produced a streetwise performance to down Mikel Arteta's side - who would embark on a forgettable opening few weeks before they mounted a recovery. But not before there was calls for the manager to be axed.",
      "On the face of it, not an outstanding shock. But on paper this was a newly promoted side, who had just seen their manager leave his role, downing the Premier League champions. Leicester were out to prove that their 5,000/1 miracle was no fluke, but their difficult season began in Hull with a late defeat.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Peter Crouch is backing Benjamin Sesko to hit the ground running in the Premier League. Sesko has joined Manchester United in a £74m deal from RB Leipzig and will play alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a new-look £200m attack.",
      "“But out of the new faces, Sesko is the one that I like watching. I’m excited by him. There’s still the fact that he hasn’t played in the Premier League and that is something that you have to look at.",
      "“Can he settle straight away? But he’s the player that excites me the most out of the new signings.”",
      "Sesko has landed at Old Trafford after Arsenal opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon instead. The Gunners paid £64m for the ex-Coventry man, who netted a staggering 54 times in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "Gyokeres was considered by Ruben Amorim for a reunion at United, but will instead work under Mikel Arteta this season. Arsenal scouted Sesko heavily over the past few seasons before going for Gyokeres, yet Crouch is more excited by the Slovenia international.",
      "“Obviously he’s a proven goal scorer. I know someone who worked with him when he was in England previously,” the ex-Liverpool striker said of Gyokeres ahead of United vs Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "“It was strange that he was let go. He went out to Sporting and banged in loads of goals and I’m sure he can do the same for Arsenal. But how quickly will he settle?",
      "“It strikes me that Sesko is the man to hit the ground running. You just never know. If he gets a couple of goals then he’ll be full of confidence, he could go on a mad run because he’s more than capable of it.”",
      "United have invested heavily at the top end of the pitch after managing a measly 44 goals in 38 games as they finished 15th last season. Alongside Sesko, they have gone for proven Premier League quality in the form of Cunha, who scored 15 times in the league for Wolves in 2024/25, and Mbeumo, who bagged 20 goals for Brentford.",
      "Crouch thinks that their new firepower can propel United well up the table this season. “There are some great signings,” he said. “But the forward line needed work, didn't it? It was misfiring all last season and Bruno Fernandes got them out of a real hole at times.",
      "“Cunha and Mbeumo – it’s not like they haven’t played in the Premier League, they were both brilliant and scored a lot of goals last season. And Sesko is a top player.",
      "“I think they will be a force. It was an awful year for them last year. I think there will be a huge improvement and they will finish in and around the top six.”",
      "Peter Crouch was speaking ahead of Paddy Power’s most generous start to a season ever. With Super Sub your bet carries on – even if the player you’ve bet on comes off, meaning even more chances to win. With more FREE Bet Builders than ever before, there’s nowhere better to place your punt.",

      "Fulham are ready to enter the race for Rasmus Hojlund but want assurances that the Manchester United striker has an interest in joining them with the Dane previously expressing a desire to remain where he is.",
      "The west Londoners are weighing up a move for the forward as Rodrigo Muniz is the subject of bids from Atalanta, which could leave them light in the final third. Those at Old Trafford are open to Hojlund's exit and are currently looking for a suitor.",
      "AC Milan have been in talks with United regarding the striker and have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m. That was seen as the most favourable option before Fulham expressed their interest, but they want to know about the player's state of mind, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "United want to move on Hojlund, especially after landing Benjamin Sesko for more than £70m. The ex-Atalanta man has been unable to deliver consistently during his two years in Manchester, leading to them dipping into the market once again.",
      "The player though has expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place, even if Sesko's arrival will push him further down the pecking order.",
      "It is unlikely that Fulham will want a player who was forced out of Manchester and moved to them against his will, as a result they have enquired about his willingness to make the move.",
      "Hojlund was adamant that he relished the competition when he was quizzed on his future during United's pre-season tour of the United States. He said: “I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim though gave no guarantees that Hojlund would still be a United player come the end of the summer transfer window. The club will be conscious that they would like to add a midfielder and a goalkeeper - with sales helping raise funds and balance the books.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Amorim said of Hojlund: “He's one more option. We will see.",
      "“We are focused on this game and Rasmus is still an option.",
      "Manchester City youngster Sverre Nypan is set to join Middlesbrough on a season-long loan, per the Athletic.",
      "The 18-year-old joined City this summer from Rosenborg this summer in a £12.5m as Pep Guardiola's side beat their rivals to the star's signature.",
      "Liverpool's Ben Doak could be on the way to Bournemouth. The Guardian reports that the 19-year-old is viewed as a potential replacement for Dango Ouattara, who is expected to join Brentford.",
      "The deal for Doak could be worth £25m.",
      "Man City have reportedly rejected a £60.3m bid from Tottenham for Savinho - their second offer for the Brazilian.",
      "That is according to Spanish outlet Diario AS, who claim that Real Madrid forward Rodrygo is on City's radar if they do need to go into the market for a new recruit.",
      "It is understood that the Manchester club want around £67m for the player they signed 12 months ago from Troyes for £30m.",
      "Nottingham Forest have reached total agreement with Ipswich to sign Omari Hutchinson.",
      "The deal for the 22-year-old is worth £37.5m and comes after the Tractor Boys had rejected several offers.",
      "The Athletic reports that the England U21 international will undergo medical today ahead of completing the move.",
      "Man United will turn their attention to Sporting Lisbon star Morten Hjulmand if they cannot secure a deal for Brighton's Carlos Baleba - who remains their top target.",
      "The Seagulls are playing hardball over their Cameroon midfielder - which has led to United's interest in Hjulmand. The Dane would be available for £50m, which is notably less than his £68m release clause. The Portuguese side would be willing to accept a lower fee if the necessary add-ons were met, reports The Sun.",
      "It was Amorim who bought Hjulmand to the Portuguese capital and he's known to be a fan of his leadership qualities. The midfielder is also fully embedded in how to play in the 3-4-3 system that the United manager has been implementing."

I want Bruno near the ball, which is really important for our team. Now we have players with different characteristics who can cope with that, so we will try to manage the game by game, the players for the best positions.\"",

      "\"I can't claim to have an incredible knowledge on EVERY player so I must admit I have seen less of United's new striker Benjamin Sesko, but he seems a player with a lot of potential and his arrival surely spells the end for Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford.",

      "The Football Association and Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) faced significant criticism last season, with contentious decisions frequently making headlines. As such, Taylor has been tasked with enforcing the key law amendments.",
      "The referee, who hasn't taken charge of the opening match of a new English top-flight season since 2022, will face pressure to ensure the campaign begins smoothly. With that in mind, we take a look all the new rule changes, what they entail, and how they'll all affect all the Premier League sides including Manchester United and Manchester City this weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "This season, only team captains will be permitted to approach the referee during the 90 minutes of play. Yellow cards will be issued to those who do not have permission to speak to the referee or players who act disrespectfully.",
      "If the goalkeeper is wearing the armband, one outfield player can be nominated to liaise with the referee. It is a clear push to have minimal players communicating directly with the officials this season.",
      "This season, all Premier League goalkeepers, including Allison, will face penalties if they hold onto the ball for more than eight seconds. If a goalkeeper exceeds this time limit, with the on-field referee counting down the final five seconds of the eight-second restriction, a corner will be awarded to the opposing team.",
      "This rule has been implemented to curb time-wasting. A similar regulation concerning the length of time goalkeepers could handle the ball was previously in place, but it was not strictly enforced.",
      "The Premier League now has the option to instruct the on-field referee to make an announcement following a VAR 'review' or a lengthy VAR 'check'.

A drop ball will be given to the team that did not touch the ball last before the game was stopped, so long as the referee believes said team would've retrieved possession.",
      "Regarding offsides, this season, when the goalkeeper throws the ball, the last point of contact should be used for the purpose of determining an offside position. So, if Alisson were to start a counter-attack with a long throw, the officials – and VAR, if called upon – will review the pass from the moment it leaves his glove.",

      "United signed Sancho from Borussia Dortmund for £72.8million in the summer of 2021 and former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer suggested he could become an elite player at Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho was an England international and one of the most exciting players in Europe when he arrived at United.",
      "However, Sancho contributed 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for United before his fallout with Erik ten Hag. He missed four months of competitive football due to that disagreement and re-signed for Dortmund on loan for the second half of 2023/2024 in an attempt to rediscover form.",
      "Chelsea subsequently signed Sancho on loan at the eleventh hour of last summer's transfer deadline day.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Over the past couple of weeks, speculation has been rife over Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba leaving the south coast to join Manchester United.",
      "On the surface, it almost felt too good to be true for United considering how much they have already spent this summer. And, as it turns out, that appears to be exactly the case.",
      "MEN Sport understands that while Baleba is believed to be keen on a move to United this summer, a deal being agreed before the end of the transfer window is unlikely. Instead, the Reds are happy to wait until next year and return for the player then when, hopefully, their finances look stronger too.",
      "In truth, this decision has probably been made due to the feeling coming out of Baleba's camp on his feelings towards staying with the Seagulls. His manager, Fabian Hurzeler, shed some light on that in his pre-match press conference on Friday.",
      "\"Very, very, very confident (he will stay),\" the head coach said. \"It's just my belief.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I didn't see any change in him. He only changed his hair, that was the only change he made in the last two weeks.",
      "\"But overall, he seems to be in a really good place. He's enjoying it with his team-mates.",
      "\"He's enjoying being a Brighton player. He's very grateful to have the progress he made in the last season.",
      "\"I didn't see any big change. He is an option to start for tomorrow.\"",
      "Hurzeler's comments suggest that there was never likely to be a situation which Newcastle are currently finding with Alexander Isak, where he is refusing to play to push through a move elsewhere. And, actually, that is not a bad thing.",
      "Baleba is showing the sort of person that he is by choosing not to let the speculation bother him and getting on with the job that he is paid to do.",
      "Plus, United can now take the long approach and spend the next year negotiating a fee for the midfielder in order to get that business done early for the 2026/27 campaign.",
      "In the meantime, Baleba's stock rises, and everyone ends up winning. The only issue for United in the short term is that they will need to find an alternative this summer.",
      "The midfield still needs reinforcements, but perhaps the Reds will look towards a player like Morten Hjulmand from Sporting, who Ruben Amorim knows will fit straight into his system.",
      "But, in terms of Baleba, this slow and steady approach could be United's best bet of signing him.",

      "It's been a pretty good transfer window for Manchester United, on paper at the very least. This weekend's clash with Arsenal will be the first real acid test of Ruben Amorim's new look attack, having signed Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Despite spending around £200million to bring the trio to Old Trafford, there are still a few positions that need strengthening. Carlos Baleba of Brighton has been repeatedly linked with a move to United, which will bolster Amorim's options in midfield.",
      "The club are missing a holding midfield player who can protect the defence and cut out counter attacks and opposition transitions. Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are the current players who fit that mould, but both have struggled in recent seasons.",
      "However, Brighton have slapped a reported £100m price tag on the Cameroonian for his services this summer. There's no doubt the 21-year-old has made a positive impression since arriving at the Seagulls in August 2023.",
      "Baleba has made 77 appearances for Brighton, scoring four goals, though only 61 of those appearances have been in the Premier League. United legend Keane has questioned whether it would be right for the club to spend such an eye-watering fee.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap podcast, Keane said: \"I'd be surprised if it happened. Because I still think that kid, he's got to do a bit more.",
      "\"You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",
      "There's no doubting that Baleba is a quality player and you need only look at Moises Caicedo's transfer from Brighton to Chelsea to see how well a transfer could pan out. Could being the operative word.",
      "There's no doubting that Baleba is a quality player, and you need only look at Moises Caicedo's transfer from Brighton to Chelsea to see how well a transfer could pan out. 'Could' being the operative word.",
      "As we've seen throughout recent history, clubs are left to measure up whether potential and current ability are near the player's ceiling and their future market value. £100million for someone who has made just 66 English top-flight appearances is ludicrous money, and it's something United themselves have fallen foul of in the past.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Take Antony, for example, who arrived from Ajax for £82 million in 2022, one year older than Baleba but struggled to make an impact at United. However, it's worth caveating that the Cameroon international has experience in the top flight and will hopefully only get better.",
      "The midfielder's current contract expires in August 2028, and United don't have the luxury of spending millions of pounds on a player who may not hit the levels expected of him. Of course, on the other side of the coin, this is the way modern football is going.",
      "At some point in the future – and it's ridiculous to say - £100million for Baleba may be viewed as a bargain, but that in itself is a silly statement given that as time on his contract dwindles, so too will his market value. There are other cheaper alternatives, and as Brighton have shown with the purchase of Baleba in the first place, these young talents are out there and can adapt in the right environments.",
      "United was once able to hoover up all the young talents, like Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, yet now, their transfer tactic is focusing on the here and now. Keane is right to baulk at such a fee.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Manchester United kickstart their new Premier League campaign when they host Arsenal on Sunday. Ruben Amorim's side had a mixed pre-season, winning two and drawing three of their five fixtures, finishing off with a 1-1 stalemate against Fiorentina last Saturday.",
      "But now United's full focus turns to competitive action, with Mikel Arteta's Arsenal first up at Old Trafford. The Reds could have a number of new faces on show, with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha poised to start after arriving from Brentford and Wolves this summer.",
      "Meanwhile, Benjamin Sesko is expected to be involved in the United squad following his blockbuster move from RB Leipzig. The 22-year-old might have to settle for a place on the bench after having limited time with the rest of his teammates, but Amorim may throw him into the XI.",
      "While United's immediate attention is on the return of the Premier League, the Reds still have work to do in the transfer market. Several players are expected to leave United before the end of the summer, while one or two may still arrive to strengthen the squad.",
      "Roma have submitted an official bid to United to sign Jadon Sancho, according to Fabrizio Romano. The Serie A side have offered £20million to United for the 25-year-old's services.",
      "Roma are also open to a loan to buy deal for Sancho, should that be United's preference. The Reds, however, are keen to offload the England international on a permanent basis.",
      "Gian Piero Gasperini's men are in contact with both Sancho and Aston Villa's Leon Bailey, as they look to strengthen out wide before the end of the summer. Sancho, meanwhile, has 'opened the doors' to a move to Roma and is prepared to make the switch to Italy for the next step of his career.",
      "MEN says: United need to sell Sancho this summer. The Reds need to get some high earners, such as Sancho, off the wage bill and raise funds to strengthen other areas. As the ex-Borussia Dortmund man doesn't have a future in Ruben Amorim's squad, securing £20m for his services would be an astute piece of business.",
      "For Sancho himself, he could do with getting a permanent move and revitalising his career after a difficult couple of years. Roma, who are in this season's Europa League, have ex-Atalanta manager Gasperini at the helm.",
      "Fulham are showing 'tentative interest' in signing United forward Rasmus Hojlund, according to the Daily Mail. Marco Silva's side are weighing up a move for the Denmark international as Rodrigo Muniz is the subject to offers from Serie A side Atalanta.",
      "AC Milan have been in talks with United for Hojlund and have offered a £4.5million loan fee with an option to buy for £39m. However, the 22-year-old has made it clear that he wants to fight for his place at Old Trafford, despite the arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last week.",
      "MEN says: I think that Hojlund is going to struggle for regular game time this season. Sesko is set to be United's first-choice striker, while Amorim could use Fernandes in the false nine role in his absence. It means that Hojlund might not even be the back-up option, meaning that an exit could be the most feasible and best solution.",
      "With Fulham about to lose Muniz, Hojlund would more than likely go in as the Whites' best No.9, though he would face competition from Raul Jimenez. I think that he should consider this move, as it makes sense all-round.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United legends Wayne Rooney and Roy Keane have disagreed about who they think will win the Premier League title with Arsenal and Liverpool the two favourites to battle it out for the crown.",
      "Arne Slot's side finished ten points clear of the Gunners in second place, with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City 13 points adrift of the summit in third. Enzo Maresca's Chelsea completed the top four, and a number of big name pundits have waded in on the debate ahead of this weekend's Premier League curtain raisers.",
      "Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has been left impressed by Ruben Amorim's summer transfer window but believes they still need further additions to sneak a top five finish.",
      "\"I still think they need one or two more signings,\" Rooney told the Match of the Day special edition preview. \"But I think you can see what Amorim is doing. I think it's looking better for Manchester United, and I think they will sneak into the top five. I hope they do, you never know.\"",
      "Rooney made it clear he expects Liverpool to retain the title, predicting Arsenal to finish second for the fourth year in a row, with Man City and Chelsea completing the top four.",
      "\"I already had Liverpool as favourites to win the title this year,\" said Rooney. \"But if Isak comes in, then I think they're gonna be unstoppable.",
      "\"The quality they've got, as Danny's just alluded [to], and I think a big thing was replacing Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. There's a lot of chances created, a lot of goals came from that side. I think [Jeremie] Frimpong has got the attributes to fill that, so I think Liverpool look strong.\"",
      "Former United defender Gary Neville believes Amorim's side could finish in fifth or sixth, but stressed the importance of signing one key position.",
      "“You’ve got to get a goalkeeper. If you’ve got a goalkeeper and a midfield player, I think fifth or sixth will be achievable,” Neville argued on the Stick to Football podcast. “I think without a goalkeeper, it’s eighth or ninth.",
      "“That is the number one most difficult position in English football, Manchester United goalkeeper. I think it’s the most scrutiny that anybody comes under.”",
      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher does not believe Liverpool would be automatic title favourites this season even if they sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak. \"Yeah, I think so,\" Carragher replied when asked if the Reds are the favourites.",
      "\"But I don't get this narrative of Liverpool are going to run away with it. If you look at history, it could tell you that it's not just about having the best players, it's about having the best team, and sort of making that balance right, and at the weekend it didn't quite look right.",
      "\"I think we will have a title race, and I think there's a lot of talk. I think the great thing about football is what we actually saw on Sunday with Liverpool. It didn't look right.",
      "\"It tells me it's not just about spending lots of money and buying the best players, you've still got to manage that team and make it work and have a nice balance to it.\"",
      "\"If they get Isak, which it looks like he's agitating for a move, then it will make them massive favorites. But Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, I think will push them closer than last year.\"",
      "Former Spurs and Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp also believes Liverpool are on to retain the Premier League title this season, especially if they're able to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, with Manchester United omitted from his predictions.",
      "He told BetVictor Casino : \"I'd have to fancy Liverpool again. They're looking strong, have made some good signings and are still obviously trying to get Alexander Isak in.",
      "\"If they get him, that would be icing on the cake probably for them. I've just got a feeling they could go on a run for a couple of years like we had with Manchester City dominating.\"",
      "\"Arsenal and Man City, they're the two big dangers,\" Redknapp added. \"I think everyone's expecting Chelsea. They're going to do it, they'll be close. But I think Arsenal and Man City, I see them as bigger dangers than Chelsea to Liverpool.",
      "“I think that will be the top four basically in whatever route, I think Liverpool top. After that, it will be second and third for either Arsenal or Man City. And I think Chelsea will probably finish fourth again.”",
      "Also on The Overlap - Stick to Football podcast, Neville probed Arsenal legend Ian Wright on whether Arteta's squad could finally clinch their first championship since 2004.",
      "Initially, he highlighted the three issues that Arsenal seem to have addressed, with the north London side now boasting a fit squad and having secured Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and prolific striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "Neville, speaking to Wright, said: \"Last season, three problems - injuries to [Bukayo] Saka and [Kai] Havertz obviously caused big problems, obviously you have to keep players fit.",
      "\"You had a problem in midfield and you've got Zubimendi come in and you had a problem up top, with presence really, and Gyokeres has come in. Does that give them the 'difference' to win the League?\".",
      "Wright replied: \"I hope so. I think so, because we've added to a team that's finished second three times now and we've added goals to it.",
      "\"You know, Zubimendi, especially with that mid-block [in the opposition] we can't break, Zubimendi the way he plays, I'm watching him break through [the mid-block]. You've got Gyokeres who can score a goal. You look at the fact that [Arsenal] were 17 goals behind Liverpool [last season] but defensively we're brilliant.",
      "\"So if we can sort that out, and this mid-block [problem] then yeah, I'm going to go for Arsenal again, of course I am, because absolutely, why wouldn't I?\".",
      "He further commented: \"What's good about us as well is the [contract] renewals. Saka, in good form now, he's probably going to renew. Gabriel, Ethan [Nwaneri], and for [Arsenal sporting director, Andrea] Berta to come in, and he's unbelievable when you meet him, Berta's done the deals, he's got it done.\"",
      "Despite his doubts, Keane supported Wright's evaluation, suggesting that Arsenal have genuinely addressed their issues, stating: \"Yeah, I'm going with Arsenal,\" while warning that Liverpool's ability to score under pressure could be a deciding factor.",
      "\"The only thing, and I'll go back to Liverpool, and Liverpool on a bad day, when they're off they can score three goals,\" Keane added. \"Even in the [Community] Shield at the weekend, [where they lost to Crystal Palace on penalties] they still scored two goals. And if you're scoring two goals on average every game, then that's hard to stop.\"",
      "However, Wright, undeterred, reiterated: \"We finished second three times, why would I go someone else?\"",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, Micah Richards revisited last year's predictions before giving his take on this season, saying: \"It's a hard one because I remember saying last season that I thought Manchester City had won it if everyone stayed fit. If [City] got any injuries, those little injuries could be the difference.",
      "\"Bringing in Gyokeres now for Arsenal is massive. And not just because he's a big-name forward. Because of his movement that we talk about with strikers all the time. Havertz is really good, we're all big fans of Havertz, but in a number 10 position where he can create, not leading the line.",
      "\"I know [Havertz has] done really good movement when he plays up there but he hasn't got a striker's instinct. So that's why I think Gyokeres is gonna add something really special.",
      "\"I still don't know if it's enough to get them [Arsenal] over the line. I still don't know. I think one or two injuries and they're back to the same as last season. So I'm going to say challenging but not champions.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer was in agreement with his podcast co-pundit, telling the Rest is Football podcast Arsenal will just miss out again this season. He said: \"I think they’ll challenge, I just think they may fall short again.",
      "“I like all of their signings. I think that’s exactly what they needed. And I still don’t think they may be finished yet in terms of bringing players in and certainly players going out.",
      "“I’ve definitely got them in Champions League but I just don’t see them having enough to win the title. Just fall short.”",
      "Gary Lineker also followed suit, stating: \"I think I concur with both of you on that front. I probably wouldn’t have said that if it wasn’t that Liverpool have strengthened so well. A lot too will depend on how Gyokeres does. I mean he scored a terrific goal in pre-season but we all know pre-season is not that important.",
      "\"Although, it is for a striker in terms of that feeling of hitting the back of the net. So I think a lot will depend on him but we know he’ll get good service. I think they could go close again but I’m going to agree.\"",
      "Former Man City defender Joleon Lescott believes Pep Guardiola's side will bounce back this season and win the title. Speaking at the launch of the new Topps Premier League 2025-26 trading card collection, he said: \"Regardless of how last season panned out, they are definitely going to be one of the favourites. It's Pep Guardiola, it's Man City with some of the world's best players\", reports the Mirror.",
      "\"It would be foolish to not see them as favorites in every competition they enter. That doesn't mean they're going to win everything, but they're definitely one of the favorites.\"",
      "City finished last season 13 points behind Arne Slot's Reds but Lescott felt there was a pretty clear reason behind it.",
      "\"It was obviously an unprecedented season for them last year, but they've achieved something no one in the history of English football has achieved so it's always going to take its toll,\" he explained.",
      "\"It did that last year. Not only a physical toll, but a mental toll to stay focussed for that long and to have to win games for that period of time. When they recognised that they weren't going to win the title, whether it was subconsciously or not, they were able to switch off a little bit.",
      "\"Physically the demand was still there but hopefully they've had a break mentally, not to have to go out there and concentrate points wise, hopefully that now means they'll come back ready to go.\"",

      "He has since informed United of his desire to explore different opportunities this summer. Chelsea have held a long-term interest in Garnacho and the Blues are moving closer to getting their man.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs for GiveMeSport, Chelsea have agreed personal terms with Garnacho. The ex-Atletico Madrid youth product is 'waiting' for a move to Stamford Bridge, as club-to-club talks are advanced.",
      "United want £50m for Garnacho, as they are of the opinion that he should not be sold for much less than the £52m Chelsea got for Noni Madueke, who made the move to Arsenal last month.",
      "However, Chelsea are aware that United need to sell players, especially if they want to pull off a record-breaking deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Garnacho represents pure profit on United's books and Chelsea are hoping to agree a fee south of £40m, having already spent in excess of £240m on no less than ten players, including Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato.",
      "Garnacho scored 11 goals and added 10 assists in 58 matches for the Reds last season and was one of their best players in Europe. Speaking about his future, following a lack of game-time in the Europa League final, Garnacho said: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and then see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Meanwhile, United head coach Amorim provided an update on Garnacho's future during the club's pre-season tour in the United States earlier this month. \"I think Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" Amorim said. \"And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "Having landed two major commercial partnerships in the past week, the anticipation is that a third will be on the way imminently for Manchester United. Both Coca-Cola and Sokin have come on board in recent days.",
      "On Wednesday, United announced that global drinks giant Coca-Cola would become the club's official carbonated soft drinks partner in the UK and Europe in a multi-year deal which has been reported to be worth around £1million to United.",
      "Then on Thursday came another announcement from the Old Trafford club that they had secured another multi-year partnership with fintech firm Sokin - who will become the club's official global business payments solutions partner in another boost to United's commercial portfolio.",
      "The decline in competitive success over recent years has been impactful when it comes to United's commercial success. While the club is still seen as a global blue-chip brand where partnerships bring exposure, the rate of growth when it comes to commercial activity has not been at the rate of their 'big six' rivals, with United seeing a 10 per cent growth since 2019 up to 2023/2024.",
      "That compares to Arsenal (97 per cent), Tottenham Hotspur (89 per cent), Liverpool (64 per cent), Manchester City (62 per cent) and Chelsea (25 per cent). Across that period, United have been surpassed by both City and Liverpool when it comes to annual commercial revenue.",
      "They do have some major sponsorship inventory still to sell, with the naming rights to their revamped Carrington training complex that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe toured this week on the block, as well as the training kit provider.",
      "The club's previous deal with blockchain firm Tezos came to an end this summer and, for recently installed chief business officer Marc Armstrong, hired from French club Paris Saint-Germain earlier this year, finding partners for these opportunities was key.",
      "The Tezos deal was worth around £24million per-year to United, while naming rights for the training ground likely to fetch some £20million per season plus, with Arsenal's deal struck with Sobha Realty last year worth £15million a year on a four-year agreement.",
      "Ratcliffe, when speaking at the opening of the revamped training complex this week, said of United as a brand: \"This is one of the most recognised brands in the world. It stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.\"",
      "With that in mind, United will see both pieces of sponsorship inventory as key to them driving revenues forward to enable them to stay within the confines of PSR, and be able to reinvest in the squad at a time when they are facing a period away from the Champions League and its riches for another season.",
      "Not underselling the value of such inventory won't be lost on United's commercial department, and the hiring of Armstrong was designed to ensure that the Old Trafford club had the best operators to navigate the partnerships space at a time where they were struggling competitively, but also still had the leverage of being one of the most globally recognised brands in world sport.",
      "The challenge for Armstrong and his team will be to wrestle back the commercial initiative from neighbours City and Liverpool, but a chunk of that will depend on whether or not head coach Ruben Amorim can deliver success on the pitch.",
      "But commercial revenues should get a healthy bump soon, with both the training ground and training kit likely to see valuable partnerships struck up very soon.",

      "So far, United have added four fresh faces to their first-team for the new campaign. Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko could all make their debut for the Reds this weekend having been signed and registered before the Premier League's registration deadline.",
      "This weekend, United must therefore ensure their registration will need to be completed by 12pm on Friday. This deadline is the same for 18 clubs this weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, because Liverpool and AFC Bournemouth kick off the new Premier League campaign on Friday, their deadline for registering fresh players has already passed for this weekend. Currently, it does not seem like United will be signing any new players before the weekend.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has been touted as a potential new recruit but it seems that United are too far away from the Seagulls' valuation to get that deal completed before the weekend, let alone Friday at noon. The registration window will be back open for United on Monday ahead of their fixture at Fulham.",

      "7) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",

      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts.

But you would expect the ex-Atalanta striker to favour loan interest from Italy.",

Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked.

It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front.

Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Christopher Nkunku in as part of the deal.",

The Italians have reportedly bid £20m for the 25-year-old. That being true, United should be snapping their hand off.",

      "7) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",

      "",
      "4) 🆕 Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Nottingham Forest\nBlimey. Forest are moving mad now that their Europa League spot has been confirmed. £26m for Kalimuendo is good business. £37.5m for Hutchinson is…interesting business.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nIt turns out that Ouattara has been an unhappy bunny on the south coast, and Brentford are prepared to make him happy with a key role in their attack. More of a Bryan Mbeumo replacement than one for Wissa, this deal could still help Newcastle finally land the 28-year-old.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nForest have won the race for McAtee, who had attracted interest from Germany. They will pay £30m and City have managed to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on clause. They are terrified of a Cole Palmer repeat.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. A deal worth £39million plus another £4million in add-ons was agreed and Ramsey flew to Tyneside for a medical on Thursday evening."

      "A Manchester United legend has told the club they “can’t pay” £100million for a “kid’ they don’t know “which way he’s going to go,” but the key to the transfer has been revealed in any case.",
      "United have spent north of £200million on transfers this summer. A nominal fee was paid for Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon, but big sums were dropped on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After that, the Red Devils have been heavily linked with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "The midfielder is valued at £100million or above, as is generally the case with Seagulls stars, but Roy Keane feels that’s too much for a 21-year-old with just 61 Premier League games under his belt.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Keane said: “I’d be surprised if it happened. Because I still think that kid, he’s got to do a bit more.",
      "“You’re talking about £100m, but I still think it’s potential with a lot of these players. You can’t pay £100m for a player where you don’t know which way he’s going to go.”",
      "Whether that £100million would be able to be paid by United is a question in itself. Our friends at TEAMtalk have stated the Red Devils board know it would blow their budget, but they’re willing to do it anyway to land Baleba, and will deal with the consequences after.",
      "Fabrizio Romano, though, has stated that sales – of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony or Jadon Sancho – will be ‘key’ to United offering a big sum for Baleba.",
      "He has also stated that the deal is difficult, with Brighton wanting to keep him, and they are more likely to sell him in 2026.",
      "As such, it would seem United would in fact need to get some cash coming back in before they can make a big outlay.",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has also detailed how unlikely he feels it is that Baleba will leave.",
      "He said: “I am very, very confident.",
      "“I didn’t see any change [from Carlos], he only changed his hair! He is enjoying being a Brighton player. He seems to be in a very good place, enjoying it with his team-mates.”",
      "And though Baleba has been suffering with a knee injury, Hurzeler has stated the midfielder is: “is an option to start tomorrow.”",
      "Indeed, it seems the odds are stacked against United unless something drastic changes in the latter stages of the summer window.",
      "Manchester United have given up on signing Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba this summer, per David Ornstein.",
      "Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has revealed he is “very confident” that Carlos Baleba will stay amid interest from Manchester United, as he revealed the “only change” the midfielder has made.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd ‘contacts are continuing on a daily basis’ with Brighton and Carlos Baleba’s agent.",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives.",
      "Man Utd have identified Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber as a potential alternative to Brighton star Carlos Baleba, according to reports.",
      "After Alexander Isak refused to train, the trio of pundits tore into the actions of the want away Newcastle striker."

      "Arsenal legend Ian Wright has stated that Viktor Gyokeres is “another level” to Benjamin Sesko, with the Manchester United new boy’s previous returns a “worry.”",
      "Arsenal and United both looked at the signings of Gyokeres and Sesko this summer. Arsenal moved first, opting for Gyokeres after the two strikers reached the final two on their shortlist.",
      "That left the Red Devils with a pretty easy choice, after Ruben Amorim’s former Sporting CP disciple had been taken off the table, to sign Sesko.",
      "The former RB Leipzig striker’s agent has stated: “What’s important here is that Benjamin’s wish, for years now, has always been United. And for United, he was even willing to take a pay cut to make the move happen. As his agent, I wanted to make that wish come true.”",
      "But former Arsenal striker Wright has told both clubs that Gyokeres is more advanced than Sesko at this stage, with the previous returns of the United new boy a concern.",
      "He said on The Overlap: “You look at Sesko and he scored 13 goals in 38 games in the German league, [Omar] Marmoush left in [January] and had 15.’",
      "“That says to me as a striker that he should be scoring more at that level, so you’re coming to United… I think Gyökeres… he’s got such great ability and physical, I think he’s going to be another [level]. He’ll get 15 [goals].",
      "“But that is a worry, 13 for a whole season, that would be a worry for me… what if he [Sesko] got 10 goals [in the Premier League]? What if he got 10? Because you just turned your nose up at me when I mentioned Gyökeres and 10 [goals], and now you’re thinking about Šeško and 10 [goals].”",
      "“I don’t care [that Gyökeres is further in his career].”",

      "Gyokeres has had a fantastic last couple of seasons for Sporting CP. Last term, in all competitions, the Swede scored 58 goals in all competitions.",
      "Sesko scored just 21, though it must be said that the level of football in Portugal is not the same as that of Germany.",
      "That said, Gyokeres bagged six goals in eight Champions League games, which is two more than Sesko scored in the same amount.",
      "Gyokeres bagged a hat-trick against Manchester City, proving he is ready for the Premier League, and he will hope to get anywhere close to the level of goals he scored last season.",

      "The agent of a Manchester United new boy has detailed how his “wish” for years was to join the Red Devils, while Wayne Rooney feels the move is the best deal done all summer.",
      "United have made four signings so far this summer. They’ve got young Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon through the door, as well as Premier League attackers Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko featured on Arsenal’s radar for some time. There was a toss-up between him and Viktor Gyokeres, and the Gunners opted to sign the Sporting CP striker, which left United able to land Sesko.",
      "But according to the striker’s agent, that was the move he wanted, anyway.",
      "He said: “What’s important here is that Benjamin’s wish, for years now, has always been United. And for United, he was even willing to take a pay cut to make the move happen. As his agent, I wanted to make that wish come true.”",
      "United legend Rooney thinks that deal was a fantastic one for the Red Devils.",
      "Asked on his BBC Sport show who has got the “best deal” of all of the Premier League’s big signings this summer, he suggested it was Sesko’s move to United.",

      "“I do. I like him, I think, because all his attributes. He’s big, he can head the ball, he’s strong, he’s quick, he can use both feet.",

      "United fans have not had a look at Sesko in pre-season, as the striker joined too close to their final match of the summer, against Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "But after 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, the Red Devils will expect at least a better return than they got from strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee last term.",
      "In the Premier League, with both men featuring in more than 30 games each, neither managed to get past five goals.",
      "The pressure that Rooney speaks of clearly told on the aforementioned pair, both of whom signed for United quite young, in the past couple of seasons.",
      "Sesko is only 22, so he could feel the pressure in the same way if he does not start the season well.",

      "It’s known that both he and the Spanish club want to reunite if possible, but so far, Betis have looked unable to drum up the required funds for the move for the United man.",
      "That issue could be taken off the table soon, though. According to Estadio Deportivo, one of the options being considered to ‘unblock the situation’ is a new deal being offered to the winger at Old Trafford.",
      "That is an option Antony is said to view ‘more favourably’ than in recent weeks.",

      "If he extends his deal, the Red Devils will surely be happier allowing him to go out on loan again, knowing there’s still a good chance of them receiving a fee in the future, particularly if Antony plays well.",

      "Continuing to play well at Betis would have given him the chance to stay in contention for Brazil and potentially to play in the World Cup.",

      "Schira wrote on X: ‘AS Roma have reached an agreement with Manchester United to sign Jadon Sancho for €22M. Roma are now pushing to try to close the deal: ready a contract until 2030 for the winger and are working to agree personal terms on the salary with Sancho.’",

      "But Man Utd are still looking to bring in more players with a defensive midfielder and goalkeeper top of their list before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Brighton midfielder Baleba is their priority target in midfield with the Red Devils prepared to see if the conditions are right for them to make an official offer.",
      "Speaking on Thursday, Romano said on his YouTube channel: “For Carlos Baleba, the contacts are still ongoing. This is a difficult deal for Manchester United, not just financially but also in terms of strategy.",
      "“Brighton at the moment are still not giving an official number to Manchester United. They did a similar situation with Moises Caicedo two years ago when he went to Chelsea, they were not giving a number, not giving an indication. Then when Liverpool arrived with an official bid, Chelsea offered a bit more and signed the player. Brighton are not giving a number for Baleba and keep saying they do not want to sell.",

      "“What is important to mention is Manchester United are still there, still in contact with the agents, still working on a deal. They want to understand how high is the wall from Brighton but they are still working on the Carlos Baleba. They are not giving up. Difficult? Yes. Very difficult? Of course. But, Man United are still there.",
      "“The player is not closing the doors at all. Personal terms are not a problem, European football for Baleba is not a problem. He would go to Man United immediately, I can guarantee that. But club to club, we are still far from a solution.”",
      "Before Romano added on X on Friday morning: ‘Man United keep working on Carlos Baleba deal. Sales (Garnacho, Antony, Sancho) could be key for higher bid. Initial approach to discuss with Brighton ready, deal difficult; #BHAFC want to keep + eventually sell in 2026. Carlos, keen on the move.’",
      "While in another update, Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Carlos Baleba, contacts are continuing on a daily basis with his agents and also with Brighton.",
      "“For Manchester United to present an official bid and to understand if it is worth negotiating with Brighton, it is important to see outgoings.",

      "Abdoulaye Toure (Le Havre, £2.5m)\nTen Ligue 1 goals from midfield for Le Havre last season sounds very promising indeed but a 15th-place finish having conceded 71 goals does raise the question as to how good Toure was at his primary job of protecting the defence.",
      "And there’s a suspicion of him taking a ‘f*** it, I’m going to enjoy myself’ approach to football at the age of 31 given his 11 previous seasons of senior football have yielded 17 goals in total.",

      "READ: Mailbox: Alexander Isak told ‘you signed a contract my dude’ as buy-out clauses mooted",
      "Neville continued: “Can they embed themselves at United? Can they get the probably 35-40 goals which would be par for those three players?",
      "“If they can get 40 goals – and United’s goals total last season was terrible – they’ve got chance of getting into that top six. But they’ve got to settle those three players, and we can’t take that for granted anymore at United, I don’t think.",
      "“United will be looking at Champions League, that’ll be the ambition. Not playing in Europe has to help, because there’s basically more training time, less pressure on the players, less injuries.",
      "“It means that the best players can play more often in the league, and not have those demands of a Thursday night game.",

      "The Old Trafford faithful may be given a first glimpse of summer recruit Sesko alongside Premier League debuts for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sesko, who had also been linked with a move to Sunday's opponents Arsenal earlier in the transfer window, completed a move to Old Trafford last week in a move worth £74m from RB Leipzig. Asked whether the 22-year-old striker would be involved from the start against the Gunners, Amorim said:",
      "\"He hasn't had a lot of time, [but] physically he's ready.",
      "\"He's really smart, a guy who's always thinking. He is ready to play but we'll see if he's going to start.\"",
      "Quizzed further about Sesko, Amorim lauded the Slovenia international for his attitude, suggesting United had found a player who could lead the line for the club for years to come.",
      "\"He [Sesko] has great potential,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He has a great potential in everything he does. He can play a different type of football. He is going to feel that the Premier League is aggressive. He is going to learn.",
      "\"But Ben can be a striker for United for a lot of years, that's why we paid so much money to have a striker who will have his history in our club.\"",
      "\"He's one guy who stays here, has lunch, and goes to the medical department, does the stretching.",
      "\"He is always thinking about football. He's really obsessed about that and that is a good thing because you don't have to think about that aspect with that young guy.",
      "\"I don't need to tell Ben, 'Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready, every game is like do or die'.",
      "\"With that guy, I don't have that concern. I have the opposite, enjoy a little bit.",

      "Asked whether Hojlund still had a role to play in the team, Amorim played down claims that Hojlund was surplus to requirements.",
      "\"He is one more option, we will see [about his future]. We are focused on Arsenal. Rasmus [Hojlund] is still our player.\"",
      "\"Benjamin Sesko is a big prospect but one with plenty to prove and his success could be crucial to Manchester United's rebuild under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.\"",

      "Friday 15 August 2025 09:34, UK",
      "“We struggled without a reference as a striker.” That was Ruben Amorim’s verdict on Manchester United’s final pre-season game against Fiorentina. “We have a new player, so we will see.” The hope is that Benjamin Sesko can make the difference.",
      "The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.",
      "But the modern United has become, perhaps, the ultimate test of that theory. At £73.7m, taking the summer spending on their new forward trio to over £200m, Ruben Amorim has certainly been backed. That brings pressure to make it work - and quickly.",
      "Amorim has been open about the fact that he is fortunate still to be in the job, reliant on the support of those above him after a miserable run of results that led to United's worst league finish in over 50 years. The consensus is that the mood has now changed.",
      "Luke Shaw recently admitted that the environment inside the club could be \"extremely negative\" and \"quite toxic\" before going on to claim that it is different now. Unhappy players have moved on. New ones have arrived with a point to prove. A cultural reset.",
      "Time on the training ground has helped too and the absence of European football means that there will be more of that throughout the campaign. Amorim will have the opportunity to demonstrate why he was regarded as a top young coach in the first place.",
      "The summer spending raises expectations, however. United are already fifth favourites for the title. Fail to secure European qualification and they will be out of Europe for back-to-back seasons for the first time since the ban on English clubs was lifted.",
      "The challenge is that Sesko is not the finished article. For now, at least, United are not in that market. And their opening Premier League game of the season offers an intriguing contrast. Opponents Arsenal tracked Sesko for a long time, a move seeming imminent.",
      "In the end, they opted for Viktor Gyokeres. The Sweden international has plundered well over 100 goals for club and country over the past two seasons at Sporting - more than Sesko has yet managed in his career. But he is 27. A signing for the here and the now.",
      "Maybe that reflects Arsenal's sense of urgency, a side that has been so close to major silverware in recent seasons, one that is seeking the final piece of their own puzzle. United are earlier in the process, betting on Sesko to develop into the superior player.",
      "His goal output might not be as immediately impressive as that of Gyokeres, but his 39 goals for RB Leipzig in all competitions over the past two seasons means that he has scored more than anyone else aged under 23 in Europe's five major leagues in that time.",
      "It puts him top of an illustrious list, although the presence of another name a little further down it is a reminder that, as former United coach Rene Meulensteen puts it, they are doing \"basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund\" with this signing.",
      "That is to say, United are spending big hoping to develop their own elite forward. Hojlund scored nine for Atalanta in Serie A prior to his arrival. Joshua Zirkzee managed 11 for Bologna before signing the following summer. For Sesko, it was 13 at Leipzig.",
      "That might temper the expectations a little. But speak to others and they will tell you that Sesko has better instincts. He is a player capable of finding space in the penalty box, someone who can get his shots away unusually quickly for a player of his size.",
      "He is not yet Alexander Isak and that is reflected in the price tag. But Isak was 22 years old, as Sesko is now, when he arrived in the Premier League after a season in which he scored six times in 32 games for Real Sociedad in LaLiga. That is the trajectory to target.",
      "Making it happen is the difficult part and it is now Amorim's job to help Sesko succeed where so many in a United shirt have struggled in recent years and fulfil his potential. Flanked by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, there is at least creativity around him.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are strong ball carriers who draw others towards them, creating space. \"It is going to be special,\" said Amorim of his two new wide forwards after the Fiorentina game. \"I think that they are maybe at 50, 60 per cent of what they can do.\"",
      "Another word of caution, though. There is some risk that the opposite is true. There were only three players in the Premier League who outperformed their expected goals by six or more last season. One was Chris Wood. The other two were Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Of the 10 previous players to have done that over the past eight years, only Heung-Min Son has scored more goals in the following season - and he dipped dramatically the year after. The vast majority of players have seen their goal output regress to the mean.",
      "One of the reasons cited for Liverpool's signing of Hugo Ekitike is that he actually underperformed his expected goals - they recognised the potential for his numbers to explode. United appear to have gone the opposite route, trying to sign elite finishers.",
      "Sesko could fall into that category having scored 27 Bundesliga goals over the past two seasons from chances with an expected-goals value of just 17.6. Could he be another Son, another Harry Kane, who consistently finishes better than the metrics suggest?",
      "If so, it could define United's season and with it Amorim's reign. There are other factors, of course. The balance in midfield is a concern and the wing-backs will be key. But it is this new forward line that will probably dictate how the rebuild is perceived.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have Premier League pedigree which will buy them some time. Rather unfairly, the referendum on young Sesko may come sooner than that. A swift impact against Arsenal, with Gyokeres among the opposition, would be most helpful."

      "The Premier League's elite clubs are rebuilding.",
      "This summer has seen the so-called Big Six spend in excess of £1bn between them on new signings. With several weeks of the transfer window still to go, the numbers will continue to rise.",
      "Liverpool are leading the way as they aim to consolidate their Premier League title win but Chelsea are close to their total for money spent, with Arsenal, Manchester City, and Manchester United next on the list respectively, and Spurs not far behind them.",
      "There is particular intrigue around the Manchester clubs.",
      "City recorded their lowest points total under Pep Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term. United plumbed far greater depths as they finished 15th and also failed to win silverware.",
      "So, are they on track to bounce back and enjoy the success their fans crave in the new season? Or is the road to the top longer? Much will depend on whether they can master the art of the rebuild, a process Sir Alex Ferguson once said he believed could take up to four years.",
      "Pep Guardiola and Manchester City have of course been here before.",
      "How they would love a repeat of the successful rebuild overseen early in his tenure following his arrival from Bayern Munich, when City recovered from a difficult first campaign, like the one they have just had, to win the first of many titles in 2017/18.",
      "\"They are one of the exceptions to that four-year rule,\" says Neville.",
      "\"Jose Mourinho came into Chelsea and won their first league title in a long, long time in his first season, creating a kind of unity straight away. Pep Guardiola got a great side that won the title in the space of two years at Manchester City.\"",
      "Neville also mentions Arne Slot's achievement in winning the Premier League straight after succeeding the legendary Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. \"I would say it was a very different team than under Klopp, with different components and ingredients.\"",
      "What they all have in common, and something key to a successful rebuild in Neville's eyes, is that they inherited the right type of characters in the dressing room.",
      "\"You think of what Slot was handed last season: [Virgil] Van Dijk, Alisson, [Mohamed] Salah, [Andrew] Robertson, [Alexis] Mac Allister, Trent [Alexander-Arnold].",
      "\"They are five or six proven winners at the highest level and they have been around the block. They've got pride and ego and they are not going to sit there and use the fact there's a new manager coming in as an excuse not to perform well.",
      "\"Players can hide behind managers. But if you've got good characters and leaders, people who have standards in their personal lives, you're going to get a better outcome.",
      "\"Slot harnessed that. He did a good job with those leaders. But he is not the one in the dressing room. People may or may not know this, but managers might not go in the dressing room at the training ground even for one minute during the week.",
      "\"For all those hours, it is policed by the senior players.\"",
      "Heavy investment was of course vital to the success of those previous Chelsea and Manchester City's rebuilds. But both Mourinho and Guardiola also inherited senior players to build around.",
      "For Mourinho at Chelsea, it was John Terry and Frank Lampard. Guardiola could call on Fernandinho, Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva at City.",
      "Guardiola has some similar characters now in Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, among others. At United, though, Amorim inherited very different personnel to the dressing room Neville experienced there in his playing days.",
      "\"For us it was Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes, Steve Bruce. Then when me, [Paul] Scholesy and others got older, it was us. When we left, others took over,\" he explains.",
      "\"You're asking those players in the dressing room to set the standards, to make sure negativity doesn't creep in. The people who sap energy, close them off straight away. Don't let them drain you, the people who constantly whinge in a negative way\"",
      "Amorim is still in the process of overhauling his dressing room as he aims to reverse a years-long slide from their success under Ferguson. Manchester United have signed three new attackers in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko but are still struggling to shift numerous unwanted players.",
      "\"This is a really unique situation,\" says Neville. \"I said before that you don't get three or four years to build a team, but because of Manchester United's relentless poor form over two, three, four or five years, it will take quite a bit to unwind that.",
      "\"Amorim has got players he quite clearly doesn't want and doesn't like, players on huge money, some of whom have cost huge money. And even if you do get them out, some of their wages will probably have to be subsidised by the club.",
      "\"So, I think he has a minimum of a two-and-a-half-year build to get to the point he wants with his unique system and buying the players he wants to fit that, just because of what has gone on there previously, but he's going to have to demonstrate progress.",
      "\"The problem he has is that you've got a top five now who like they are getting into the Champions League and the penalty for not being in the Champions League is big now because all these clubs - United, Villa, Newcastle, Chelsea - are on the edge on PSR.",
      "\"It's big for them if they drop out of those Champions League places. So Amorim has got to be relatively successful, which means finishing in the top four or top five, all while building a new team and recruiting the players he wants.\"",
      "Circumstances matter too when it comes to rebuilding efficiently. Guardiola knows that well given the importance of expiring contracts to his first Manchester City overhaul. A long list of departures in 2017 gave him space to reshape his squad.",
      "The list of players who reached the ends of their deals after Guardiola's first season included Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna and Jesus Navas. This summer, by contrast, the only one feels like a significant loss in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Guardiola points out there was a significant loss back in 2017 too. \"In that moment, we made one big mistake which was to not keep Jesus Navas with us,\" he says.",
      "\"I think he would have helped us a lot for the next years because he was a player who could play as a full-back, as a full-back inside, as a right-winger. He was incredible.",
      "\"For the rest, the club decided they needed new, fresh energy, so that's why we rebuilt. They bought some unbelievable players like Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva; top-class players who helped us start to do what we have done.\"",
      "Manchester City are having to work harder to shift players this time around. Their signings so far this summer have left them with a squad of 33 as things stand.",
      "Their plight last season shows the importance of forward planning. Could City's drop-off have been avoided if they had acted sooner to refresh their personnel?",
      "\"It's bloody hard when you've got a team that's won the treble, and a group of players who have been so good,\" says Neville. \"But they do tend to grow a little bit old together.",
      "\"It's about how you change it and when you change it when you have been as successful as they have been. To do it after a treble is the most difficult time.\"",
      "Neville sees some parallels between the plight of City's treble-winning team and that of United's in 1998/99.",
      "\"It felt like we only signed one or two players in the two years after the treble. We won the league in those years but then we saw a sharp decline and we only won one of the next four.",
      "\"You get this euphoric moment winning a treble, where you've built an unbelievable team, but within a couple of years they grow a little bit old together and you've got a situation where you can fall off the edge of a cliff and end up having to make big changes.\"",
      "Neville describes Manchester City's current rebuild as Guardiola's \"toughest job\" in management. \"You get to the point where you think, 'will he win it next season, or will it take two or three years?'\" he says. But the man himself sees it differently.",
      "\"The most challenging summer was when I was chosen to be the manager of the second team at Barcelona and prove myself to the board,\" he says with a smile.",
      "\"Then the challenge was to take over the Barcelona first team and prove myself, and after that go to Germany after the legend Jupp Heynckes had won the treble, when my German language was a disaster, to convince the players to keep going and winning.",
      "\"Then it was arriving here and in the first press conference they said, 'the club have brought you here to win the Champions League', and I said, 'wait a minute, please!' After that I was 'Fraudiola' and it was a disaster in the seasons we didn't win it.\"",
      "Guardiola is eager to point out that he saw progress even in his fraught first season, when he was assisted by now Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City finished 15 points behind eventual Premier League champions Chelsea.",
      "\"In the first season we played really, really well in moments,\" he says. \"Always with Mikel we talk about that, that in that first season we started to build something. This season is not the most difficult one because we did it. We proved we could do it.\"",
      "Guardiola is encouraged by how his side finished last season too, even if it ended in the disappointment of a second consecutive FA Cup final loss at Wembley, this time to Crystal Palace.",
      "\"I didn't like the way we lost against Man Utd in the [previous] FA Cup final. I was grumpy. This season, I was sad because we played really, really well. They know it. They knew we were there, the spirit was there, the chances were there.",
      "\"We missed something we have to recover next season. That belongs to me, it belongs to the players, it belongs to all of us. And after that we will create a team which can compete game by game and start in a better position in the Premier League.\"",
      "Guardiola stresses that pain forms part of every rebuild.",
      "That was true even for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, who mastered the art during his historic Old Trafford tenure, creating a series of trophy-winning teams.",
      "\"Each transition came with a bit of turbulence,\" says Neville.",
      "\"We then lost the first game of the next season and Alan Hansen said you can't win anything with kids. So, it was a lot of pressure at that time, changing and transitioning, and that is something you have to manage in a rebuild.",
      "\"We didn't win the league for three years between 2003 and 2006. That's the longest I ever went in my career. That was a point where Mourinho was absolutely on his game and [Arsene] Wenger's football was sensational. They were brilliant teams.",
      "\"Our recruitment wasn't the best. It took a while for Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to come through, for Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra to settle in.",
      "\"That was the time where I thought, 'will we win the league again?' We did it in 2006 and that set us up for another five or six years of winning titles because that team was amazing. But the key was the foresight and bravery Sir Alex had to let players go.\"",
      "The principles behind that ruthlessness remain crucial in today's game. It is about lowering the age of the squad and striking a balance between youth and experience while ensuring there is room for long-term growth and development.",
      "\"I used to think of it as a conveyer belt,\" says Neville. \"We came in in '92, '93, '94. We were the young ones at the start of the conveyor belt and we had the older ones falling off. We eventually moved on to the end of the conveyor belt and fell off ourselves.",
      "\"I always thought you needed a group of players that were young, a group of players in their peak, and then a few, four or five, who were in their 30s and set the standards. I think that was the sort of age profile Sir Alex considered when building teams, but there was always some turbulence.\"",
      "As their respective rebuilds continue, Manchester United and City will hope the turbulence eases for them in the new campaign.",

Howe is a master in these situations, but one area in management where he does struggle, looking at his recor,d is getting a team to start the season fast.",
      "Across the first three league games of a season for each club he's managed, he's only working at a 1.25 points per game ratio (P24 W8 D6 L10) and a winless pre-season won't have helped preparations for this one.",
      "Across the Champions League and Premier League, Villa are unbeaten in 24 home games, winning the last seven - including beating Newcastle 4-1 in April.",
      "If there's one fixture flying under the radar that screams goals at the prices this weekend, it's this one. I'm here banging the drum for the over 2.5 goals line at 4/6 with Sky Bet as a base to build a bet from.",
      "Brighton like to be positive at home and play with attacking risk in committing bodies forward, but that leaves gaps which expose their centre-backs. That's why backing the over line in their games last season was a betting-friendly angle, with 27 of their 38 games producing three or more goals.",
      "This has the smell of a goalless grind, doesn't it?",
      "I'm struggling to see how Sunderland score goals at this level. They only scored 1.29 goals per game last season - the eighth-highest in the Sky Bet Championship. Even Sheffield Wednesday averaged more.",
      "Regis Le Bris is someone who is suited to defence-first football and that is very hard to implement in this league with the quality in opposition ranks. Low-probability chances get taken.",
      "Le Bris will want to make this a scrap, kill the tempo, and smother the game. It's Sunderland's best chance for points.",
      "I wouldn't talk you out of the 0-0 correct score at a juicy price of 11/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Now I'm not for one second suggesting Scott Parker's side are about to storm North London and walk away with three points, but I do think the markets are disrespecting Burnley's potential to keep this competitive and overrating Spurs slightly based on their Super Cup heroics.",
      "This is a tough gig for Thomas Frank. Expectation is internally very high and Frank has no experience of managing workloads within a squad asked to compete across four competitions.",
      "They looked strong and organised for large parts vs PSG, but I think we need to treat that piece of form very carefully as the French side were clearly miles undercooked.",
      "Burnley aren't going to change their rigid and pragmatic style going up a level. This could be fiddly for Spurs as Burnley should be able to cover their +1.5 goal start handicap at 4/5 with Sky Bet, meaning we just need them not to lose by two or more goals.",
      "Jhon Arias could just take the Premier League by storm in this Wolves team. All the evidence suggests he'll adapt pretty quickly, be a main man in attack and judging by what I saw at the Club World Cup and from people who follow the Brazilian league, he has the quality to thrive in England.",
      "Wolves have played the Brazilian market very shrewdly in recent years, with Joao Gomes and Andre showing real adaptability to the league.",
      "Quick, direct and a great drawer of fouls, Arias will be to the fore for Wolves as they look to take advantage of Man City's vulnerabilities in transition without Rodri. Back him to be fouled at least twice through the Sky Bet BuildABet function at Evens.",
      "Trimmed from 20/1 to 8/1 in the summer to win the Premier League, there is a chance Enzo Maresca just might be building something extremely exciting at Chelsea.",
      "And why should we be taking them seriously? Moises Caicedo and Cole Palmer - they are Chelsea's assassins and quite possibly the core of what could be a title-winning side.",
      "Since Caicedo has found rhythm in the Chelsea midfield, he has owned so many games, including the Club World Cup final against PSG. If Chelsea are going to suffocate opponents and dominate the ball in big games - which they will need to do to win a title - it all starts with Caicedo.",
      "And Palmer is the stardust. When the spotlight is on, when the stage is at it's highest, Palmer performs. He can go to Eden Hazard's levels of domination at Chelsea this season.",
      "This axis puts Chelsea in the title mix, no question. It's a four-way fight. And they can start with a home win.",
      "Nottingham Forest played some unsustainable football last season and it's very hard to see how they're going to improve on what they achieved.",
      "Top goalscorer Chris Wood converted 30 per cent of his overall attempts in the Premier League last term, while goalkeeper Matz Sels enjoyed the season of his life, boasting the best save percentage in the league. They can't be expected to keep those numbers up.",
      "And Forest return to Europe this season which is bound to influence the side's performance. If you exclude Conference League participants, non-big-six teams who qualify for Europe win around 14 points fewer in the campaign immediately following qualification.",
      "That isn't too relevant for this devilishly difficult fixture to analyse from a betting perspective, but something to note when the fixtures start to pile up. This clash looks one where the draw is a huge runner at 12/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is going to a very watchable fixture, steeped in Premier League narrative - but one where goals could be lacking.",
      "I'm firmly in the under 2.5 goals camp - and at the prices on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet I'm happy to endorse it as one of the best bets of the weekend.",
      "Arsenal are traditionally a very reliable team to back under goals away from home, albeit also a risky favourite to back in these spots.",
      "When assessing the last nine games where they've gone off 11/10 or bigger on the road, they have won just once and the average goals per game sits at just 1.89 per 90 with seven of those nine going under 2.5 goals.",
      "Additionally, seven of those games finished all-square while four of the five meetings between Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have also ended level.",
      "Lots of the focus and pre-match narrative will be about Leeds, but I'm excited to see what Everton can do this season.",
      "I think we need to start putting some serious respect on what David Moyes is doing in the Premier League - I for one haven't given him enough credit. Since taking over at West Ham, he has recorded a 37 per cent win ratio in the Premier League - that's higher than Sean Dyche, Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "And when Jarrad Branthwaite was fit last season (he started 28 games), Everton conceded just 28 goals in those matches - that's one goal per game, which would equate to being the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season.",
      "With Branthwaite tied down to a new deal and money to spend, Moyes just may have the tools to overachieve on expectations. I like their chances at Elland Road, too, as Moyes has an exceptional record against newly-promoted teams, recording a 67-per-cent win rate from the last 16 fixtures. The away win looks big at 19/10 with Sky Bet.",

      "Friday 15 August 2025 06:17, UK",
      "The Premier League is back and has all the ingredients in the mix for this season to have serious G.O.A.T potential.",
      "For most of us the Premier League runs through our veins. Admit it, a little part of us has been missing these past few months. It is part of the fabric of society in this country - of why we all love this game.",
      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",
      "Wayne Rooney's first Everton goal that meant his world would never be the same again. Thierry Henry turning it on against Liverpool, bewildering our very own Jamie Carragher along the way, to keep Arsenal on track in the title race.",
      "David Beckham from halfway. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. Collymore closing in.",
      "Aguerooooo.",
      "Kevin Keegan loving it.",
      "Andrea Bocelli, Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City.",
      "Well, it's time to create new moments that are stamped in our memory banks as the 2025/26 Premier League rolls into town. And all the ingredients have been added to the pot to make this season one of the greats.",
      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",

      "By Nick Wright and Adam Smith",
      "Friday 15 August 2025 06:16, UK",
      "Are Liverpool destined to retain the title? Could Manchester United really finish in the bottom half of the table again?",
      "Liverpool are out to retain their crown. The champions are the Premier League's biggest spenders in this summer's transfer window as they look to build on the success of last season under Arne Slot.",
      "But will they see off the competition? Runners-up Arsenal have also strengthened. Manchester City have undergone a rebuild. Could Club World Cup winners Chelsea roar into contention?",
      "Opta predict Liverpool will retain the Premier League title following last season's success under Arne Slot, with Arsenal coming second again, albeit by a much narrower margin than last term.",
      "Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa are third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, meaning Opta's predicted top six mirrors the final top six last season.",
      "Opta's supercomputer is far from convinced when it comes to Manchester United and Spurs. They are predicted to come 12th and 14th respectively, only three places higher than last term.",
      "FA Cup and Community Shield winners Crystal Palace are predicted to clinch a seventh-placed finish, with Brighton, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest complete the top 10.",
      "At the other end of the table, Opta expect the promoted teams to go straight back down for the third season running, with Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland finishing 18th, 19th and 20th respectively, a long way off 17th-placed Wolves for expected points.",
      "Spurs, now under the management of Thomas Frank, and beaten on penalties by Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final, are predicted to come eighth.",
      "Liverpool, again, come out on top over Arsenal as champions, with Manchester City in third. But, as in Opta's table, the top two are only separated by a slender expected points margin.",
      "A key difference at the bottom of the table is that newly-promoted Leeds are predicted to survive at the expense of Wolves.",
      "The two tables feature key similarities, most notably in the make-up of their predicted top fours. But there are huge differences too.",
      "Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton are also given considerably lower predicted finishes, contrary to Opta's optimism.",
      "So why the differences? Both supercomputers are based on averages from 10,000 simulations, using bookmaker odds, historical and recent team performances, and transfer spending.",
      "But the intricacies of the algorithms are different, placing weight on varying factors, which helps to explain some of the disparities seen between the two predicted tables.",
      "The summer transfer window is of course a key factor in predicting how teams will fare. A high spend does not guarantee success. Far from it. But it can be vital to a team's capacity to improve.",
      "Their total spend is already close to £300m following the arrival of Florian Wirtz for a record fee along with the signings of Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "They are not the only ones to have strengthened at considerable expense. The so-called Big Six have spent over £1bn between them this summer. And in fact, Liverpool's net spend is much lower than most of their rivals thanks to some big sales, including those of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester City have work to do to shift their unwanted players but their high net spends help to explain why they are predicted to push Liverpool closer this term.",
      "Manchester United have overhauled their attack, making a trio of high-profile additions in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. So why the 12th-placed prediction from Opta?",
      "They are of course coming from a far lower starting point than Liverpool, having finished 15th last term, but it might also have something to do with how they have so far allocated their funds.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have plenty to offer offensively to a side that finished last season as the Premier League's biggest underperformers relative to their expected goals. The lack of firepower and cutting edge needed to be addressed.",
      "But have they overlooked other areas of their squad? Manchester United have invested nearly twice as much in forwards as any other club have invested in any position this summer, but there has been no turnover in goal or in midfield, and only £7m spent on defenders.",
      "This looks problematic given their issues last season were not limited to their attack. Ruben Amorim's side were far from solid in midfield or defence. Only nine Premier League sides conceded more goals. Only eight allowed more expected goals against.",
      "And yet, despite those issues, Manchester United look set to start the new Premier League season with roughly the same personnel as last season in goal, in defence and in midfield.",
      "Both predicted tables have Enzo Maresca's side in fourth place, and with near-identical points totals too, ensuring Champions League qualification for a second successive season, but falling a long way short of a push for Premier League glory.",
      "Chelsea, like their Big Six rivals, have invested heavily in new recruits this summer. There is excitement around Estevao, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in particular. They also start the campaign with a relatively favourable run of fixtures.",
      "But they haven't finished higher than third since their last title triumph in 2016/17. Could a tough run-in, when they face all of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Tottenham in the final 11 fixtures, and the exertions of an epic 2024/25 campaign, also bite them?",
      "Spurs finished last season on a Europa League-winning high but a 17th-placed Premier League finish did for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Frank has arrived from Brentford as his successor and the club have so far added six new players, including Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, both of whom impressed in their UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Daniel Farke's side, who pipped Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference last season, are predicted to finish 17th, fractionally ahead of Wolves, who have lost key players this summer in Cunha to Manchester United and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester City.",
      "The West Midlands club have so far spent modestly this summer, their outlay totalling just £48.4m, which ensures a healthy profit from the £103.7m received in sales, but raises questions about the quality and depth available to head coach Vitor Pereira.",
      "We asked our journalists to come up with their predicted tables too.",
      "As an average, Liverpool came out as champions, with Manchester United and Spurs in sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley are tipped for the drop.",

      "Read on to see our top 25 Premier League players - and then join the debate yourself in our live blog, where we want you to list your favourite footballers and debate and discuss our selections!",
      "Arsenal's defence was the meanest in the Premier League last season and Gabriel gets the recognition from our journalists and reporters - no doubt also impressed by his repeated threat from set-pieces at the other end of the pitch.",
      "Where would Man Utd be without Bruno Fernandes? That was a recurring question last season. Amid all of his team's travails, the Portugal midfielder's quality remains respected.",
      "Another driving force of Arsenal's title prospects, Declan Rice is becoming the complete midfielder in the centre of the park for the Gunners. If the football world is increasingly being filled by specialists, the England man can seemingly do it all.",
      "Arsenal supporters will surely want to see Bukayo Saka further up this list and their Star Boy could well prove this coming season he deserves a promotion. The next step is to inspire his team to success with his individual brilliance.",

      "The transfer saga of the summer? Alexander Isak's future at Newcastle is uncertain but his quality isn't in doubt. There's a reason why the Sweden striker is in demand after a brilliant campaign in black and white.",
      "Man City badly missed Rodri through his injury absence last season. If anything it underlined his importance to Pep Guardiola's side even more. He continues to be considered among the best in the world - fingers crossed he can return to his former levels.",
      "We love a maverick and Chelsea's Cole Palmer is one of the Premier League's top entertainers. He delivers in the big moments too - whether that's a Euros final with England or when Chelsea are in major finals.",
      "When you score 22 Premier League goals but are deemed to have had a disappointing season, you know you're a decent striker. Erling Haaland's goal-getting prowess continues to demand respect.",
      "No surprises here. Liverpool's star man swept the awards last season after inspiring the Reds to Premier League glory with one of the best individual campaigns we've seen.",
