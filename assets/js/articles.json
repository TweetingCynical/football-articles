      "Bruno Fernandes believed that Alejandro Garnacho didn't have \"the best attitude\" during his time at Manchester United. The 21-year-old winger secured a switch to Premier League rivals Chelsea during the summer after a bitter falling-out with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Argentinian found himself in the manager's bad books after publicly criticising his lack of playing time in the Europa League final, effectively dismissing the Portuguese boss's tactical approach. However, it wasn't only the boss who Garnacho rubbed up the wrong way, as club skipper Fernandes questioned the youngster's mindset while he was still at Old Trafford.",
      "After the winger netted the winning goal in a Europa League encounter against Real Sociedad in 2022, the midfielder didn't hold back with his assessment of Garnacho. Fernandes said: \"He was good but he knows we expect a lot from him.",
      "\"He's still really young, doing really well. At the beginning of the season, he was not at his best. On the [pre-season] tour he did not have the best attitude.",
      "\"That's why he didn't get his chance until now. He's getting his chances because he's training better, he's having the correct attitude.\"",
      "This wasn't the sole occasion that Garnacho irritated his teammates, as The Sun reported in September that numerous influential figures in the United changing room attempted to address the young striker's approach.",
      "Seasoned players, including Casemiro and Harry Maguire, were amongst those who tried to mentor Garnacho, though their efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful.",
      "Following United's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, Garnacho said: \"Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today – I don't know. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "He also criticised the club's Premier League campaign, adding: \"Obviously it's hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn't beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don't score goals, you always need more.\"",
      "The Athletic reports that Amorim was furious and told Garnacho: \"You better hope you have a good agent this summer,\" during a training ground exchange before their final match against Aston Villa.",
      "After his £40million transfer to the Blues in the summer, the 21-year-old was swift to express gratitude to the club and its fans for his time in Manchester. He said: \"Dear Mánchester. After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close. We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I'm very grateful for this.",
      "\"To the coaches, staff, and my teammates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had. I leave proud of what we achieved together and excited for what's to come. Wishing the club nothing but success for the future, while I look forward to giving my all in the next chapter of my career.\"",
      "Since his move to Stamford Bridge, Garnacho has yet to fully demonstrate his true potential for his new team, netting once and providing two assists in the league. Across all competitions, the Argentinian has made 13 appearances in total, scoring just twice, with his other goal coming in a 2-2 stalemate against Qarabag in the Champions League.",

      "Andre Onana has hinted that he's ready to end his Manchester United nightmare and sign for Trabzonspor on a permanent basis. Onana, 29, joined for the Turkish side in September on a season-long loan.",
      "The goalkeeper had fallen down to third in the pecking order at Old Trafford, starting just one of United's opening four games this season prior to departing. Ruben Amorim had installed Altay Bayindir as his No.1 before signing Senne Lammens, who's been ever present since his £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Amorim's decision prompted Onana to leave on a temporary basis, but it could now become permanent. \"I'm very happy, trust me. I'm living the best period of my life. I can't complain, I'm very happy to be here,\" the Cameroonian said.",
      "\"Sometimes I'm driving and a car cuts in front of me. 'Onana, stop, I want a photo.' I think to myself, 'Yes, but we can do this in another way.' But when they see me, they're happy, and so am I. It was difficult at first, but now I understand.",
      "\"They are my men, I love them, and I love this feeling. Because they are very passionate. It's a wonderful thing. It's something you can't describe if you're not here.",
      "\"But the time I've spent here has been perfect for me. I'm happy to be here. It's a different lifestyle, but it's great. Truly incredible, amazing.\"",
      "Onana has played all 13 Super Lig matches since coming into the team. Trabzonspor are currently third in the table, seven points behind leaders Galatasaray and four behind second-placed Fenerbahce.",
      "Although the former Ajax star has impressed, manager Fatih Tekke is concerned about how many risks he takes on the ball. Speaking to 61Saat, Tekke revealed: \"I have been warning Andre for two weeks; he is someone we like, and he knows this.",
      "\"He is one of the best when the ball is at his feet, but football requires immense attention. Moments are critical. Last week, he made two risky moves. He can break down the opponent, but a single mistake could have led to a very different outcome today.\"",
      "Trabzonspor president Ertugrul Dogan is also a big fan. \"As soon as he landed on Trabzon with his family, it was clear to us that he was a professional, and comfortable to play here. He shows true character,\" Dogan told HT Spor.",
      "\"Our young goalkeepers are very happy to have him here, After every training, he is almost giving them a private lesson, and he is not doing it because he was asked to, but because it is his character to do so.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's options seem to be limited as the January transfer window approaches, but Manchester United are still in a position to compete in the market. With Africa Cup of Nations commitments and injuries already taking their toll on the squad, a shake-up could be beneficial.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' recent injury is likely to result in the longest absence he's had since moving to England nearly six years ago. This is compounded by the absences of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, who are all currently competing in Morocco.",
      "While this may not be the happy ending many envisaged for Rashford at United, it could alleviate a lot of pressure for the club. With his ties in Manchester seemingly irreparable, a swift resolution would be a positive outcome at this point.",
      "Rashford's value is high due to his impressive form at Barcelona, who have the option to secure a bargain £28million deal for the forward. Despite their financial difficulties, it's still within the Spanish powerhouse's means to afford such a fee, although it may be optimistic to expect a deal to be finalised this far ahead of schedule.",
      "Clearing Rashford's hefty £300,000-a-week salary from the payroll would be a significant relief for United's board, even if Barca are footing the bill during his loan spell. This would equate to a saving of around £16m over the remaining two years of Rashford's contract, excluding any transfer fee.",
      "If Barca were to decide Rashford had earned a permanent move as soon as next month, it would provide United with an immediate cash boost to reinvest. And the amount would be appreciated following a summer of heavy expenditure.",
      "Securing established stars in the winter is always challenging, but Conor Gallagher presents an enticing prospect. Not only does the ex-Chelsea player have the potential to break into the starting XI, but he also fits the profile of player United currently need and could be available in January, possibly via an initial loan deal.",
      "After an impressive debut season at Atletico Madrid, Gallagher has fallen out of favour under Diego Simeone. He's only made eight starts in all competitions during the first half of the season, with suggestions a fee of around £26m could secure his departure from Spain.",
      "A versatile midfielder who can fill various roles, Gallagher would certainly ease the burden during Fernandes' absence. And with rumours once again circulating that the United captain could depart next year, signing a replacement now would demonstrate excellent foresight.",
      "The only drawback to bringing Gallagher on board is that it could further hinder the opportunities for Kobbie Mainoo to get game time. However, it seems increasingly likely Amorim doesn't have immediate plans to promote the academy graduate in any case.",
      "Despite the summer signings of Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, United's attacking options still appear somewhat thin. Sesko's recent injury exposed a worrying lack of depth in the forward line, a gap that Joshua Zirkzee and Cunha haven't quite managed to fill in recent weeks.",
      "Koln gem Said El Mala isn't a natural frontman, and Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1 formation doesn't necessarily accommodate wingers of his variety. However, at 19 years old, the right manager could shape him into a formidable threat in a modified role, and his age profile would mean the manager could bide his time developing the player.",
      "El Mala's 6'2\" stature may seem awkward out wide, but he has been used as a centre forward by Koln on occasion. The teenager has netted six goals and provided three assists in just 15 Bundesliga appearances this season, showing a natural goal-scoring instinct that could flourish if nurtured at Old Trafford.",
      "Once again, United would be wise to act swiftly as Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester City and Tottenham are among the clubs vying for his signature. His signing could come with a hefty price tag given he's contracted at Koln until 2030, but El Mala may be the kind of talent who becomes a key figure at the club for years to come.",

      "Manchester United's transfer plans may need a rethink after their long-standing target Carlos Baleba seemed to sustain an injury.",
      "The Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder has been on United's radar for some time. It was thought that Ruben Amorim's side were contemplating making a move during the summer transfer window, but the deal proved too costly, especially after shelling out over £200million on Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "However, during Cameroon's Africa Cup of Nations match against Gabon, Baleba appeared to pull his hamstring and had to leave the pitch. If he has indeed suffered an injury, it could scupper any potential move in the upcoming January transfer window.",
      "Given this development, the Mirror have identified 12 other midfielders who could be perfect fits for Amorim's squad.",
      "The former Chelsea vice-captain would bring energy and tenacity to Amorim's midfield, something which has often been found wanting. Moreover, with a price-tag understood to be around £35m, he'd be cost effective",
      "The Bournemouth midfielder has recently been linked with United. His footwork is excellent and he has the energy to get up and down the pitch. Given his age and his contract not expiring until 2028, he would be expensive",
      "Stanislav Lobotka's future at Napoli was uncertain last summer, but the Slovakian stayed put. Having only started eight Serie A matches this season, he may like the idea of a fresh start",
      "The Crystal Palace midfielder is likely United's dream transfer, but with a price-tag understood to be at least £100m, it may take club record transfer to sign him",
      "It's not a transfer window if Goretzka has not been linked with a move to Old Trafford. However, with his contract expiring next summer, now may be the time to sign the Bayern Munich midfielder on the cheap",
      "Anderson has established himself as one of the best all-round midfielders in the country and will likely start for England in the World Cup. He looks more than capable of playing for a club as big as United",
      "Hjulmand was also linked with a move to United in the summer and having worked with Amorim at Sporting, he would arrive knowing exactly what the United boss wants",
      "His deal at Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal expires next summer, which means he could be a bargain waiting in the rings. The Portugal international would bring invaluable leadership, energy and calm to a midfield which can get flustered",
      "Angelo Stiller is understood to have been on United's radar in the past, if he isn't already. He has an outstanding reputation as one of the Bundesliga's most consistent midfielders",
      "The Atalanta midfielder's agent recently suggested he could be available for between €30m-€40m (£26.2m-£34.9m). Given his reputation last season, this could be an amazing move for Amorim",
      "Spanish midfield prospect Javi Guerra was linked with United in the summer. With Valencia struggling on and off the pitch this year, he may be available for a cut price in January",
      "Timber has recently been linked with Brentford and West Ham, but given the fact his contract with Feyenoord expires in 2026 and he has eight international caps for the Netherlands, he could be a cost-effective option for the Reds",

City are poised to activate Semenyo's £65million release clause and leave the likes of United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham defeated in their efforts to sign him.",

      "\"Maybe I should be different like so many managers, but that is my thinking and I think it's the thinking of the board that we cannot do the same mistakes that we did in the past and we need to survive these moments because we have players coming from international [teams] and from Europe.\"",
      "Amorim doesn't need much time to work out if a target is right for his team, adding: \"I think I have a good feeling on that. That's why we will not bring in a player that has that feeling face-to-face.",
      "\"They can mislead me a little bit, but it's going to be hard, so I have the feeling and most of the time, I get it right. I just look at the guy, maybe it's the way they speak and I think I can detect the rubbish. I don't know.\"",

      "13 years ago, Adam Le Fondre was banging in the goals in the Premier League. Le Fondre spent just one season in the top flight - for Reading - scoring 12 times in 34 appearances.",
      "Fast forward more than a decade and Le Fondre, 39, is still going. Indeed, the veteran forward is plying his trade at non-league powerhouse FC United of Manchester, located less than 20 minutes from his hometown, Stockport.",
      "Le Fondre has found the net 10 times in 23 matches this season, with the ex-Bolton and Rotherham forward helping FC United mount a promotion push in the Northern Premier League, the seventh-tier of English football.",
      "FC United, who were formed in 2005 following the Glazers’ takeover at Manchester United, sit third in the NPL, winning 12 and drawing three of their 20 league matches and sitting just five points behind leaders Hednesford.",
      "\"We've put ourselves in a really good position to have a really promising season and a real good go at trying to get promoted out of this league as well.\"",
      "Le Fondre is among the top scorers in the NPL this season, having struck eight times in the league and a further two goals in cup competitions. It’s the seventh season in eight that he has hit double figures - and the 1986-born front man is feeling as sharp as ever.",
      "\"Yeah, I feel good physically,\" he said. \"Obviously, some days are better than others when you get to my age, but generally I feel really good physically.",
      "\"I feel in a really good physical condition as well. I look after myself on and off the pitch, and long may it continue for me, because that's the key to me carrying on playing, is me staying injury-free and being able to contribute to winning football as well.",
      "\"So, while I'm doing that, I'm not looking at leaving at this moment in time.\"",
      "Last month, Le Fondre netted his 300th senior career goal in a 2-1 win against Ilkeston - 21 years on from his first for Stockport in the 2004/05 season.",
      "Reflecting on that achievement, the striker said: \"Yeah, of course. I think for any player who's managed to play for as long as I have, the sort of things that you need to keep going for, milestones that you need to set, because you have to still keep that hunger, that drive there. That was just one of the ones for me I wanted to tick off.\"",
      "\"My next milestone now is 800 games,\" he added. \"So, that sort of thing, just for me, I set targets for myself to try and get to, because I need something for myself to be driving towards rather than just floating in the wind with no direction.\"",
      "Le Fondre, who had scored goals up and down the top four tiers throughout the first decade of his career, opted to leave England and make the move to Australia in 2018. He had played for Stockport, Rochdale, Rotherham, Reading, Cardiff, Bolton, Wolves and Wigan but decided to venture Down Under and sign for A-League side Sydney FC.",
      "It’s a move that paid off for Le Fondre, as he enjoyed a memorable five years - and a season on loan in India at Mumbai City - with The Sky Blues. In total, Le Fondre scored 73 times in 128 appearances for Sydney, winning three trophies in the process.",
      "But Le Fondre returned to the United Kingdom two-and-a-half years ago after receiving an offer from Scottish Premiership side Hibernian - who were about to embark on a European campaign - while he was coming to the end of his contract.",
      "Explaining why he left Australia to return to the UK, Le Fondre said: \"Obviously, I was out of contract at Sydney. There was no contract offer coming forward so I had to plan what was next and I still wanted to play. While I was over there, I got an offer from Hibernian to come and play in Europe.",
      "\"At 36 or 37 years old, I didn't expect to be going and playing in Europe. Even if it was qualifying, it was something I wanted to do as well. We were planning to come back for family reasons.",
      "\"Obviously, I want to see my parents and I have these three young children so it makes sense to come back and go back to normal life here. That was the thinking behind it. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to go and play for Hibernian up in Scotland.\"",
      "Le Fondre spent one season at Hibernian before moving to FC United last summer. He has since been at The Reds for the last 18 months, scoring 27 goals in the meantime.",
      "Although Le Fondre doesn’t have any plans of retiring from football soon, he has balanced playing alongside a video scout role at Manchester City's The City Football Group since October 2024.",
      "\"I'm still a video scout for Manchester City,\" he said. \"It was just off the back of a podcast. I had trials once and laid out what I envisaged myself doing in the future. Someone from the City Group got in touch and it sort of grew from there organically.",
      "\"Obviously, I can't go to live football games because I tend to be playing a lot. It's more I'll be on WyScout watching players and sort of carrying on from there. I envisage I'll carry on doing it. As long as it doesn't hinder my coaching, which it shouldn't do. I'll always have time for video scouting and it's always good looking at very good players.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Le Fondre is about to kickstart his coaching career after he was appointed as the Head of Football at FC United's new football academy, which is set to begin in September 2026. His role is expected to include a blend of coaching and overseeing the development of players, with an end goal of getting them into the first-team picture.",
      "\"It's going to be good to shape young people's futures,\" Le Fondre said. \"It's an opportunity for them to learn from me and hopefully I can help them better and help them have a football career. Obviously, I think the strength behind it is that FC United have created a pathway from their academy into the first team, and I'm going to try and help with that.",
      "\"The importance is on my shoulders to mould the players and try and turn them into football players who can contribute, whether it's the club as a whole or on the football pitch as well.\"",
      "Le Fondre is next in action for FC United when they travel to league leaders Hednesford in a vital clash at the top of the NPL on Saturday, December 27.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The January transfer window is set to swing open on the turn of the year, as clubs look to strengthen their side for the latter half of the season. In England, talk of potential moves hasn't stopped since the summer window came to a close on September 1, with a number of teams looking to pick up where they left off, despite a collective spend of around £3billion.",
      "Liverpool were the biggest spenders over the summer, splashing £415million on the likes of Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak. They were tailed by Chelsea, who flaunted £285million and Arsenal, who committed to spending £255million on the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke and Martin Zubimendi.",
      "The ongoing argument is whether Man City have become too \"Haaland-dependant\" or \"predictable\", as the prolific Norwegian has scored 25 of their 76 goals in all competitions so far - roughly a third of the total. They look set to sign Antoine Semenyo, who is reportedly available for the total of a £65m release clause and would freshen up Pep Guardiola's attacking options.",
      "Villa are reportedly ahead of their rivals in already securing perhaps their most-needed transfer for winter. With Evann Guessand a late call-up to Ivory Coast's AFCON squad, teenage Brazilian winger Alyson Edward is apparently set to join for £10.5m from Gremio.",
      "Chelsea were reportedly looking at the possibility of signing Mike Maignan from AC Milan this summer, only to be put off by Il Rossoneri's price tag of around £21m. However, with the Frenchman's contract expiring at the end of the season, the Blues may opt to revisit the deal with hopes of agreeing a cheaper fee.",
      "Alexander Isak's injury paired with Mohamed Salah's absence due to AFCON has given Liverpool a new problem to consider in attack, but it is clean sheets they have struggled with all season - keeping just five. They were denied Marc Guehi's signing last summer and could get him for free in the next, but securing the player now has become a necessity, not a luxury.",
      "Sunderland chased Sassuolo forward Armand Lauriente for the majority of the summer, only for a deal to fall through. It will be interesting to see if the Black Cats reignite their interest in January, considering they could use further additions on the wing and up top.",
      "Man United were already in the hunt for a new midfielder before Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo were taken injured over the weekend. They can reportedly add Ruben Neves to their squad in a cut-price deal with Al-Hilal this January, as the Saudi club could cash in before the 28-year-old's contract expires in summer.",
      "Palace know they will be losing captain Marc Guehi at some point in 2026 - it comes down to whether they cash in now or allow the 26-year-old to walk away for free in summer. They can secure the perfect long-term replacement in 20-year-old Rennes central defender Jeremy Jacquet.",
      "Brighton should be on the lookout for a striker in the January transfer window as they will now be without Stefano Tzimas until next season due to an ACL injury, plus Danny Welbeck's own injury record at 35 doesn't exactly inspire confidence he can lead the line throughout a campaign. The club were interested in Gonzalo Garcia this summer, but the Real Madrid sensation could be a longshot all things considered.",
      "Problems in defensive midfield could spiral out of control if Everton are not careful. Idrissa Gueye has already missed three matches through a bizarre red card suspension, now he has jetted off to AFCON and left David Moyes light on options. The banks of the River Mersey would be the perfect place for Kalvin Phillips to jump start his career, just as his former Man City teammate Jack Grealish has done.",
      "The Magpies are said to be monitoring Nicolas Jackson's situation at present as the Chelsea star fails to make headwind during his loan stint with Bayern Munich. The centre forward could certainly give Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa competition for their places.",
      "With Jordan Henderson in the twilight years of his career, Brentford are said to be on the hunt for a controlling midfielder. PSV's Joey Veerman could certainly fit that bill, and he's available for around £20m through a contractual release clause.",
      "With Fulham flourishing in attack at present, the club would be wise to tighten up at the back considering they have shipped 26 goals this season thus far. FC Midtjylland's Ousmane Diao is one centre-half said to be on the club's radar, and he could be available on the cheap.",
      "Thomas Frank needs to a proven goalscoring, supporting attacker to get the best out of his system, otherwise his Tottenham project is doomed to fail. As they are unlikely to pry Morgan Rogers from Aston Villa or Iliman Ndiaye from Everton during the winter window, Atalanta's Ademola Lookman could be a more reasonable option.",
      "If a certain star winger departs, Andoni Iraola will need the best possible replacement he can get his hands on. With Spurs reportedly open to selling Brennan Johnson mere months on from his Europa League final-winning goal, the Welshman might just be the answer.",
      "Leeds are restricted by PSR regulations with the club \"maxed out\" in their limits, therefore a mass January haul isn't possible. But, they are looking at opportunities and Lille's Matias Fernandez-Pardo may be too good to pass up. However, they will face stiff competition from Brentford, West Ham and Wolves.",
      "A number of Premier League clubs, including Nottingham Forest, are reportedly interested in snapping up Inter Milan stalwart Stefan de Vrij. The centre-back would be a worthy acquisition for Forest given his wealth of experience at the highest level.",
      "Familiarity could be the key for Nuno Espirito Santo unlocking West Ham's attacking verve whilst they sit in a dire position. Adama Traore - a player he honed at Wolves - is in the final year of his contract at Fulham and could be a low-cost, low-risk transfer to provide an extra threat.",
      "Given an incredibly poor start to the new season, Burnley could do with an attacking threat at the turn of the year - they've managed just 19 goals in total thus far. FC Union Berlin's Andrej Ilic could certainly provide that.",
      "With only nine goals scored this season, it is clear to see what last-placed Wolves' weakness is as they stare relegation in the face. An ambitious loan move for Arsenal's Ethan Nwaneri would give Rob Edwards desired attacking flare, and the 18-year-old a chance to shine at the top level at little risk to his long-term Gunners career."

      "Former Manchester United bidder Thomas Zilliacus has tabled a fresh £375million proposal for the club. The Finnish entrepreneur competed against the likes of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim when attempting to buy United in 2023.",
      "When the Glazer family offered United up for complete or partial acquisition three years ago, Zilliacus put forward his supporter-driven bid, which he insisted could have generated up to £15billion for the club.",
      "The ex-Nokia executive ultimately pulled out of the running. Ineos secured sporting authority as Ratcliffe acquired a 27.7 per cent shareholding in the club. But Zilliacus now has another proposition for United in the shape of a substantial sponsorship agreement.",
      "\"For me, it's not about owning something. It's not about having a trophy to show off. It's about how we make Manchester United so strong financially that they can become the number one club, not only in England, but in Europe.",
      "\"So, I have decided to propose a $500m (£375m) sponsorship deal over five years. It goes back to global fan engagement and how we get the fans involved around the world.",
      "\"I have a programme that in a very interesting way activates these fans and it's around that that I am confident I can offer this sponsorship deal over five years. With that money, Manchester United could significantly strengthen their squad and do other things as well.",
      "\"Within the XXI Century Capital Group we have a number of brands. It wouldn't necessarily be the XXI Century Capital brand that sponsors. It could be some other brands within the group. It could be Champion Circle, which is the specific fan engagement programme.\"",
      "Zilliacus also expressed his desire to collaborate with Ratcliffe at the club. He added: \"I would love to be working with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. When us three, Jim Ratcliffe, Sheikh Jassim and I, were bidding for Manchester United, I said, 'Look, instead of just trying to overbid each other and make the Glazer family even more wealthy, why don't we work together for the benefit of the club?'",
      "\"That is still how I see things. You usually get better results when you work together. I want to be heavily involved in agreeing on how sponsorship would work. Then when it comes to developing the club, I would be very happy to offer my ideas, my thoughts and my advice but I would not impose.",
      "\"I would not say, 'Look, you have to include me in some decision-making.' But I do think there are so many things that could be done even better.",
      "\"Starting from player acquisition to how we make the fans happier with everything that they experience, be it inside the stadium or outside the stadium.",
      "\"I also have experience in developing sports arenas and have views on the stadium. So I would very much like to be involved with that. From the sponsorship angle, this would also open up new opportunities that would be a win-win for all parties.\"",

      "Despite his past heroics for Manchester United, few at Old Trafford will have expected Marcus Rashford to kick on quite so forcefully at Barcelona. But after struggling to find his most talismanic self on home soil, the Englishman could now celebrate the most successful season of his career to date away from the club that made him.",
      "On one hand, neither supporters nor the club itself should be surprised. It's become a sad sort of ritual in recent years for players to leave the Theatre of Dreams before going on to reach greater heights elsewhere, though football finance expert Kieran Maguire suggests it may be a worthy sacrifice in Rashford's case.",
      "Scott McTominay did it last season when he joined Napoli en route to becoming Serie A Player of the Year following his first season in Italy. He's since been joined in Naples by a revitalised Rasmus Hojlund, while the likes of Antony, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Anthony Elanga and Alvaro Carreras have each pulled off similar rebounds in the post-United phases of their careers.",
      "Rashford is perhaps different from most of those examples in that he could still have a future under Ruben Amorim in Manchester. The main question is whether that prospect will even tempt the player now his eyes have been opened as to what's possible at the Camp Nou.",
      "\"I don't see anything here as like a pressure. It's just, I'm here to play football,\" Rashford told BBC Sport in December. \"It's been amazing. I feel welcome, I feel at home. I've just been enjoying every step of the way.\"",
      "A permanent signing looks like a no-brainer from Barca's perspective. La Blaugrana can sign Rashford for the affordable sum of around £30million, a good deal less than the £40m United would reportedly demand from any other club wishing to sign their star.",
      "Indeed, United may in fact hope Barcelona don't trigger the option in Rashford's contract in light of his Catalan revival. The club stands to make a much greater profit from any deal if a different side steps up for his signature following what's been such a successful stint in the shop window to date.",
      "Maguire, who runs the Price of Football podcast and is highly sought after for his knowledge in football finance, contrasted Barca's modern model against that of rivals Real Madrid. And whereas Real have sustained an era of success in buying and selling, the Catalan kings have been less reliable maintaining their empire.",
      "\"Barcelona are a bit more of a basket case. So, I am concerned with Barcelona's finances,\" he continued. \"They have to satisfy La Liga's cost control rules, which are very onerous.",
      "\"Progress in the Champions League, however, could be sufficient to warrant or to free up enough money which would allow them to sign Marcus Rashford, because they could easily make in excess of £100m this year from a good run in the Champions League.\"",
      "There are believed to be reservations from Barca's side, and understandably so. Rashford is already 28, and Barca's transfer model in recent years has seen them reluctant to splash out major fees on players over 25, especially those in the forward roles.",
      "And with good reason, considering finances at the Camp Nou are a touchy topic at the best of times. The club's ongoing stadium renovation has left the coffers relatively dry, and it was even briefly in doubt as to whether Barcelona would be able to register Rashford this season after he was signed.",
      "The forward even agreed to take a 25 per cent pay cut in order to force through a move to Barca, who are covering his wages for the duration of his loan. That decision only enamoured fans in Spain even more with the player, as if his on-field output hasn't done enough talking.",
      "But the fact remains Rashford is now in his 11th season of senior football and eking ever closer to 30, often deemed a no-go area for some clubs when it comes to more expensive recruits. United will be all too wary of that fact also, particularly after it seems certain bridges were burned back in Manchester.",
      "\"It's a horrible thing to say, because ultimately he's a young man in a professional elite career, but from an ownership point of view, he's a wasting asset,\" added Maguire. \"In the sense that his market value is only going to go down at this point, because whoever buys him will get no resale value in all probability, if he goes at 28 or 29, so it's a five-year contract.",
      "\"There's no upside towards the end of that contract. So that has to be taken into consideration. Clearly there's also a breakdown in the relationship between him and senior management at [United], which normally means that a parting of the ways is best for all. It's now an issue of price and just how keen are Barcelona to sign him.\"",
      "For his part, the player has done nothing to dissuade his new club from temptation. Rashford quickly settled in Hansi Flick's system and has had 18 direct goal involvements (seven goals, 11 assists) in 23 outings across all competitions this season.",
      "Only Ballon d'Or contender Lamine Yamal (nine goals, 11 assists) has contributed more in front of goal for Flick this term. And given the youngster's standing in Spain, that serves to illustrate the kind of impact Rashford has had for his temporary employers.",
      "Speaking to ESPN in October, Rashford had already made up his mind on whether he would like the stint to become permanent. When asked if he wished to extend his time in Barcelona beyond this season, he replied: \"For sure.",
      "\"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player it is an honour.\"",
      "Things appear happier for Rashford off the field, too. It was reported not long after the move to Spain was confirmed that the England attacker was back with former fiancee, Lucia Loi.",
      "The childhood sweethearts were due to be wed after becoming engaged in 2022, only to split the following year. It was around the same time Rashford went from the highest-scoring season of his career to plumbing new depths amid a miserable run of form.",
      "Around the same time, Rashford was pictured arriving back at his Miami hotel at 5am with fitness trainer Courtney Caldwell in June 2023, per The Sun. His wild spell continued into early 2024 when he was disciplined for United for missing training following a boozy night out in Belfast.",
      "So it's good news for Barca fans that Lucia has reportedly joined Marcus in Spain after patching things up. The Daily Mail cited sources close to the player in August, who suggested Lucia has a huge impact on Rashford's happiness.",
      "It's little wonder his form has performed a 180-degree turn in Spain if that is the case. And Barcelona's loss could prove to be another club's gain should they reject their first-dibs opportunity to take him up on a long-term deal.",
      "Having only recently turned 28, there's reason to believe Rashford still has plenty of value left to offer. Even if his signing wouldn't fit with Barca's usual recruitment model.",
      "Anyone doubting whether Rashford still had the goods to produce at the highest level has been silenced in recent months. The player's own comments suggest he's done with United for good, though there are sure to be plenty who hope that isn't the case if he can be convinced there's a future to be had under Amorim.",
      "Either way, Rashford's resurrection is great news for United, wherever he ends up playing his football next season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly prepared to support manager Ruben Amorim in the January transfer window, with a particular focus on bolstering the midfield. Both permanent and loan deals are said to be on the cards.",
      "United, along with their rivals, have the opportunity to enhance their squads when the mid-season window opens in just a few days. Clubs will have the entirety of January to finalise both incoming and outgoing transfers.",
      "United have been linked with several potential signings, with the central midfield identified as an area for reinforcement. Names in the mix include Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson.",
      "The Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs) have previously hampered United's transfer ambitions, meaning player sales were needed before any new arrivals. However, recent reports suggest this may not be a stumbling block this time around.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, PSR is 'no longer thought to be an issue. ' The report goes on to say that the club are 'ready to act' if the right opportunity to secure a signing, either on loan or permanently, presents itself.",
      "However, it's reported that the club won't do 'anything silly' in terms of acquisitions. But there is optimism that any new additions will prove successful.",
      "Injuries to Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo have worsened the mounting crisis in midfield. The former picked up a hamstring problem during the defeat against Aston Villa and there's no clear timeframe for his return, whilst Mainoo is anticipated to be sidelined for even longer than the club captain.",
      "Discussing potential signings to address the situation, Amorim explained: \"We will only try to bring players that we think are going to be the future. It's not going to be to save something in this moment.",
      "\"Even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more. We will try to bring now, and [at] the end of the season, players that are perfect for our future.",

      "There is only one Boxing Day encounter in the Premier League this season, which comes from Old Trafford, as Manchester United play host to Newcastle. Both teams have European qualification in their sights, as they look to make a push towards a Champions League place.",
      "Starting with Man United, they have shown signs of improvement this campaign under Ruben Amorim, following a summer of heavy spending. The attacking options look rejuvenated, but with a leaky defence, there hasn't been quite the same consistency that would push them into the top four.",
      "With several injury issues, alongside some players being unavailable, Amorim has plenty of selection dilemmas to think over during this period. Similar can be said of Eddie Howe, who has guided Newcastle to 11th in the league, three points behind Man United as it stands.",
      "The Magpies have struggled with injuries on their return to the Champions League, which has resulted in some mixed result in the league itself. Both sides have summed up the flux that the Premier League finds itself in, with no clear frontrunner in the chasing pack for Europe.",
      "So, with that said, here's a look at the latest injury news and updates ahead of the match between Man United and Newcastle on Friday.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is set to miss out on Manchester United's clash with Newcastle through injury. The club captain picked up a problem in the defeat at Aston Villa, which saw him withdrawn at half-time. The playmaker is set to miss out on roughly one month of action as he recovers.",
      "It's been a tough season for Kobbie Mainoo, not made much easier through injury. The midfielder picked up a problem in training before the Aston Villa game, which saw him miss out. While it's a short-term concern, he looks set to miss out against Newcastle.",
      "Harry Maguire has been out since early November through injury. He is nearing a return, but the Newcastle game has come slightly too soon for him to be back in action.",
      "There is another defensive absence for Manchester United, as Matthijs de Ligt is managing a back problem. Like Maguire, he is nearing a return, but won't be back in time to face Newcastle.",
      "There are three AFCON absences for Manchester United, which includes Bryan Mbeumo. The forward's campaign starts on December 24, when Cameroon take on Gabon.",
      "Amad is another absence due to AFCON, joining up with the Ivory Coast. He was in action for their competition opener against Mozambique.",
      "The third and final AFCON absence for Man United is Noussair Mazraoui. The defender is away with hosts Morocco, who kicked off the tournament with a 2-0 win over Comoros.",
      "Dan Burn is set to miss out on a few games after injuring his ribs in the clash with Sunderland. The Newcastle star also suffered a punctured lung, which will sideline him for a little while longer.",
      "Sven Botman has started to make a positive recovery from a back injury. While the Newcastle star is closing in on a return, he won't be available just yet, and will miss out against Man United.",
      "There were concerns among the Newcastle fanbase when Tino Livramento picked up a knee injury against Fulham in the Carabao Cup. However, fortunately for them, Eddie Howe suggested it wasn't as serious as first feared. There is extra clarification needed on the extent of the problem, however, meaning he is likely to miss out against Man United.",
      "Experienced defender Kieran Trippier is expected to miss out on the Boxing Day clash. The Newcastle star picked up a hamstring injury which means he is set for a spell on the sidelines.",
      "Nick Pope has been out of action for a few weeks with a groin issue he picked up against Marseille. The goalkeeper has been replaced by Aaron Ramsdale in recent weeks, but he could return against Man United.",
      "Will Osula has been struggling with persistent ankle issues, which means he is set to miss out on the clash on Boxing Day.",
      "Jamaal Lascelles has rarely featured for Newcastle this season, with his latest injury keeping him out of action once again.",
      "Emil Krafth has been out of action after a shin injury, which required some treatment. He is nearing a return, but it remains to be seen if he could feature on Friday."

      "Manchester United were dealt a significant blow during their match against Aston Villa, with Bruno Fernandes having to leave the pitch at half-time. Manager Ruben Amorim had already been forced to start the game without his preferred line-up, as Casemiro was serving a suspension and Kobbie Mainoo was out due to a calf injury.",
      "Adding to Amorim's woes, his team has one of the shortest festive breaks. They face Newcastle United as the only two teams playing on Boxing Day.",
      "This tight schedule leaves little time for his squad to recuperate after their demanding fixture last weekend. With three crucial players - Amad, Noussair Mazraoui, and Bryan Mbeumo - away at AFCON on international duty, the United boss would have been praying for an injury-free Christmas period to prevent further thinning of his squad.",
      "However, fortune hasn't favoured Amorim, who is facing a difficult upcoming run with some injured stars. So, with this in mind, The Mirror has provided an update on the current state of Man United's injury list.",
      "Man United captain Bruno Fernandes picked up an injury during his side's defeat at Aston Villa, which forced him off at half-time. The playmaker is now expected to miss one month of action at least, which may not see him return until late January.",
      "Potential return: Late January 2026.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been unfortunate this season, with limited opportunities to impress Ruben Amorim. Bruno Fernandes' injury has opened up an opportunity, but his own calf problem now makes him unavailable to face off against Newcastle. Mainoo's injury is believed to only be a short-term issue, which could see him back in the New Year.",
      "Potential return: Early January 2026.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt could be closing in on a return to the Manchester United squad soon. The defender has been out with back pain, but there is growing belief that he could be involved again in the coming week. Amorim made it clear that he is handling the situation with caution, however, to avoid a repeat injury, but confirmed that he will miss the Newcastle game.",
      "Potential return: Wolverhampton Wanderers (H) - December 30.",
      "Rounding off the injury list is Harry Maguire, who is dealing with a thigh injury. The defender has been out of action since early November, but could return soon. Amorim confirmed the star is available again soon, but the Newcastle game has arrived too early.",
      "Potential return: Wolverhampton Wanderers (H) - December 30."

      "Mbeumo joined Ruben Amorim's side from Brentford in the summer and looks to have been a success story as United look to get back on track. The Red Devils were unable to land Baleba from Brighton, however, as they were quoted more than £100million.",
      "A central midfielder remains a priority for United, who are short in the position following Bruno Fernandes' injury. The Portuguese star has been ruled out of action on Boxing Day and is likely out until next month.",
      "The Old Trafford side have been widely linked to Ruben Neves, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson, with Baleba still said to be on United's shortlist. And now the 21-year-old has talked up his leadership abilities in addition those those of Mbeumo.",
      "\"I believe in our players,\" Baleba said. \"We go to play the AFCON, and I think we're going to do well.",
      "\"Playing for Cameroon, for me it's big, because I want to win something with my country. It's a pleasure to play for my country. I want to win the AFCON and World Cup with my country!",

      "Yoro, 20, and De Ligt, 26, arrived at Old Trafford in 2024 but have failed to impress the ex-Blackburn midfielder. The French defender arrived from Lille as United beat competition from Real Madrid for his signature, while De Ligt joined from Bayern Munich, having already featured for Juventus and Ajax.",
      "Sherwood has acknowledged that players from Europe need time to settle in the Premier League, but is not convinced that it will lead to a positive result for the Red Devils.",
      "Sesko fared no better in Sherwood's mind. The young striker has scored just two goals in 14 appearances for United, and the former Aston Villa boss reckons if he'd come through the club's academy, he would not have been offered further chances by Amorim.",
      "Sherwood told BetWright : “I don’t see it with Leny Yoro at the moment, to be honest. I always feel that players need time to settle into the Premier League, especially if you’re a young player who’s come from Europe, but I don’t see it with him.",
      "“Having said that, I also don’t see it with Matthijs de Ligt either – I don’t think he’s the answer for Manchester United.",
      "“You could say the same about a lot of Manchester United’s players, and I think it demonstrates how big of a drop off there is between Arsenal and Manchester City ’s squad and the rest of the league.",
      "“I’m also not sold by Benjamin Sesko. He hasn’t had a huge amount of chances, but I’d have at least expected to see something by now. I don’t see anything with him at the moment.",
      "“If he was an academy player at Manchester United coming through the ranks and he performed the way he has, you’d never seen him again and he’d never get another opportunity.",
      "“I hope for Man United’s sake that he improves, but at the moment, I don’t see it with him.”",
      "Sesko returned to United's starting line-up in defeat to Aston Villa after a period out with a knee injury. The striker could next feature against Newcastle United on Boxing Day.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim does not expect Bruno Fernandes or Kobbie Mainoo to be available for the Boxing Day meeting with Newcastle. While not giving precise return dates, he said he expected Mainoo to return sooner.",
      "Fernandes picked up an injury during the first half of United's defeat at Aston Villa over the weekend. He battled through until half-time but didn't return to the pitch for the second half as a Morgan Rogers double was enough to hand United's opponents all three points.",
      "Mainoo was injured in training on the eve of the Villa game but is closing in on a return. \"No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster for Bruno,\" Amorim said.",
      "United take on Manchester City in the derby on January 17, and it remains to be seen whether their skipper is back in time for that game. \"I don’t want to say. I have an idea, of course, but let’s see,\" Amorim said when asked about Fernandes' return date.",
      "Since joining United from Sporting CP in January 2020, Fernandes has been a near-permanent fixture in the first team. The 31-year-old has missed just nine of United's 221 league games over that period, and had played the full 90 in the bulk of this season's games before injury struck at Villa Park.",
      "Amorim is already without Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad, with all three away at the Africa Cup of Nations. The loss of Fernandes is an additional blow, and the head coach will need to find a way to make up for the absence of a player who has contributed five goals and seven assists this term.",
      "United take on Newcastle on Boxing Day, and follow that with another home game four days later against Wolves. They have two further league games before the Manchester Derby on January 17 - away at Leeds and Burnley - and will host Brighton in the FA Cup on January 11.",
      "United will at least be able to call upon Casemiro on Boxing Day. The Brazilian sat out the Villa game through suspension, but it was just a one-game ban for the accumulation of yellow cards.",
      "Manuel Ugarte could continue after being given a rare start at Villa Park. Lisandro Martinez is another option, with the centre-back used in a midfield role after coming off the bench, while young midfielder Jack Fletcher will be pushing for more minutes in the middle after making his Premier League bow over the weekend.",
      "\"We have other players, we need to maybe see different ways of playing,\" Amorim said. \"I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job, and that’s why when we have these opportunities, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones.\"",
      "When discussing Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, who both missed Sunday's game through injury, he added: \"We are still working with them. They are not available for this one, but let’s see for the next one.\"",

Former United goalkeeper Ben Foster has laid bare his concerns, suggesting the current back line doesn't possess the winning mentality needed to keep goals out on a regular basis.",
      "The ex-England and Wrexham shot-stopper, who spent five years at Old Trafford between 2005 and 2010, has cast doubt over whether any of the club's curren defenders would strengthen their main Premier League competitors. The scrutiny follows Amorim's side suffering a 2-1 loss at Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Speaking on the Fozcast podcast, he said: \"I think Roy Keane got it bang on about the dedication to really stop goals going in. They don't want to get exposed by somebody doing them.",
      "\"They don't want a meme to appear of them getting absolutely 'megged, twisted or turned, so they stand off. They still seem like they're missing in four or five positions where they need somebody that's w‎orld class in that position.\"",
      "He added: \"Look at the back line of Man United. Would any defender from that team get into any of the big boys like Liverpool, Arsenal or Man City? They're not going to improve any of those teams. They're good players, but they're not going to stop goals like this, because they're not willing to really do the dirty stuff.\"",
      "Sunday's loss proved costly for United, who desperately needed the three points against Villa to stay in touch with their top-four competitors. The outcome left Amorim's squad sitting seventh in the Premier League standings, now trailing Sunderland by a point and both Liverpool and Chelsea by three.",
      "The match also represented the sixth occasion in eight league fixtures that United have failed to secure maximum points. From the start of November, their record shows four draws, two defeats and two victories as their momentum has ground to a halt. Keane particularly targeted Diogo Dalot for criticism following the Villa loss.",
      "He said: \"You can have all the talent in the world, but we mention it time and time again, you've got to roll your sleeves up. When the game gets a bit tired, or those moments, you go, 'I'm going to do my bit for the team.'",
      "\"There's too many players like Dalot, who just don't do enough. I won't use the word 'cheating' but they're not doing enough.\"",
      "Reflecting on United's performance overall, Keane said: \"I wouldn't say they were unlucky - they gave up two goals. They've conceded six goals in the last two games, and that's not good enough.",
      "\"We praise them going forward, and they are more of a goal threat, but with the amount of chances and goals they're giving up, you can't make progress. United can dig deep, they showed that again today, but they need to be more intense when they're defending, they need more pride there.\"",

      "The 20‑year‑old broke through from the academy in the 2023/24 season but is yet to start a Premier League game for United this campaign. He has played just 212 minutes as a substitute and even came close to leaving Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "United are expecting approaches for the youngster in the New Year, though only an 'exceptional offer' will force the club to consider selling. Meanwhile, Morrison, who also came through the academy, struggled to nail down a regular spot despite being tipped for greatness at the club.",

      "The Old Trafford waterfall could soon be a thing of the past, with Manchester United's owners ready to deal with the lingering problem. Long time owners the Glazer family have appeared to make the issue a low priority, but it has been claimed that things will now change with Sir Jim Ratcliffe in charge.",
      "Not that Ratcliffe himself has acted immediately. The British billionaire's investment was announced midway through the 2023/24 season, and a new stadium was discussed as a target for the club before more recent conversations around redeveloping the current site",
      "For now UEFA rules could force the owner to act, according to the Sun. Work on improving the Old Trafford drainage system is one of a number of proposed changes as United chase a return to European competition, with a pitch renovation and improvement to both dugouts also on the cards.",
      "In May 2024, it had emerged that United were delaying direct work on the roof until after a decision had been made on the future of Old Trafford. Heavy rain and stormy conditions during a match against Arsenal earlier that month had left areas flooded, with the club indicating at the time that the stadium's siphonic roof drainage system overflowed, causing the waterfall-like conditions.",
      "It wasn't the first time the club had dealt with such a scenario at their famous stadium. Ahead of a Manchester derby in 2019, water was seen pouring from the roof onto the seats after a thunderstorm in the vicinity.",
      "Earlier in the same year, Ratcliffe spoke about the argument for refurbishing United's home. “The two most talked-about issues at Manchester United are number one, the football, the performance on the pitch and the second one is the stadium,\" he said. \"What we can see so far is a really good case to refurbish Old Trafford, probably about £1billion in cost.\"",
      "One of United's potential routes into Europe has gone thanks to a shock Carabao Cup exit at the hands of Grimsby Town. They could still secure a European spot through their league position, though, while they will kick off their FA Cup campaign in January with the goal of reclaiming the title they won in 2024.",

      "Semenyo has scored eight goals and bagged three assists this season and while he could be available in the summer, no team looks willing to take this risk. Reports suggest City are Semenyo's preferred destination but United are not thought to be out of the running.",
      "The 25-year-old is the latest star player ready to make a move to a top club but exactly who that will be remains to be seen. So with Semenyo's future firmly in the balance, MEN Sport has asked United and City writers Tyrone Marshall and Simon Bajkowski for the state of play at the Manchester clubs surrounding Semenyo and transfers.",
      "Can they afford it?",
      "Yes. United’s financial situation is much improved from a year ago and they are now more comfortable with their compliance with Profit and Sustainability rules, which are coming to an end anyway. They spent more than expected in the summer and much of it was on what United saw as favourable payment terms, so they can make this deal happen, especially as it was a move they had planned for the summer anyway.",
      "Would he want to go to United ahead of other Premier League clubs in the Champions League?",
      "United feel they are in with a chance so the indications are he is open to it. They aren’t making smooth progress towards qualifying next season either but you feel that it is there for them if they can put the pedal down. There is still an attraction to playing for this club, despite what has happened in the last few years.",
      "Does he fit into Ruben Amorim's rigid system as another 10 or wing-back?",
      "I think he fits in as both and that will be a big attraction to United. If everyone is fit and available, I would expect him to get in the team as a left wing-back, with Amad on the right and Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as the No.10s.",
      "That would give United significant firepower and a much more attacking outlook. But Semenyo can play on both flanks and through the middle and the fact he could cover so many of those positions in Amorim’s system makes him doubly attractive.",
      "Who is he an upgrade on?",
      "As a left wing-back, he is an upgrade on everyone. Diogo Dalot has done a respectable job there and Patrick Dorgu looked better at Villa Park, but it is still a problem position. Semenyo could fill it. And as an option as another No.10 he is clearly better than Joshua Zirkzee as well. He would be a major upgrade at left wing-back and as the third or fourth No.10.",
      "Where does Semenyo fit among all the attacking options?",
      "Semenyo is a wide option in a team that is not flush with them. Pep Guardiola has moved away from using his wingers really this season, even moving Jeremy Doku inside. Semenyo can play on either flank and so could give City extra options of playing but at the same time he will also be expected to add extra dimensions to his game.",
      "Who is he an upgrade on?",
      "In terms of the current squad, he would definitely move ahead of Oscar Bobb. The Norwegian hasn't recovered from the leg fracture that robbed him of a breakthrough at the beginning of the 2023/24 campaign, so is looking vulnerable in the January window. Semenyo would also be expected to challenge with Savinho - who he has outperformed this season with Bournemouth - and Doku for a place in the team.",
      "What does Guardiola like in Semenyo that's similar to past successful City players?",
      "More than anything with a January signing, you want somebody who can fit straight into the team. Semenyo is a bit different in the sense he's only moving in January because of opportunity for him and Bournemouth, but the fact he is Premier League proven is perfect for a manager looking to make sure he has a squad capable of going far in all competitions.",
      "Semenyo has shown he's versatile and can play in different systems so there is plenty to like.",
      "Simon is the MEN's Chief Manchester City Writer. He joined the MEN sport desk in 2013 and has covered City home and away since 2016, reporting on Pep Guardiola's time at the club.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo will be unavailable for Manchester United's game against Newcastle due to injury. Fernandes started against Aston Villa last weekend, but he was brought off at half-time after holding his hamstring. Mainoo was absent from the squad in Birmingham after picking up an injury in training.",
      "Amorim confirmed Fernandes had suffered a muscle injury following the Villa defeat, but the United boss provided a further team news update during his Christmas Eve press conference. Speaking about Fernandes and Mainoo, he said: \"No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno.\"",
      "When asked when Fernandes would return, Amorim responded: \"I don’t want to say. I have an idea, of course, but let’s see.\" Amorim was asked about filling the void and said: \"We have other players, we need to maybe see different ways of playing. I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job, and that’s why when we have these opportunities, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones.\"",
      "Fernandes has only missed two United matches due to injury during his time at Old Trafford. The midfielder's other enforced absence was due to illness against Tottenham in March 2022. Harry Maguire has not played since picking up a hamstring injury against Tottenham Hotspur on November 8, while Matthijs de Ligt last played against Crystal Palace on November 30 due to a back injury.",
      "Both Maguire and De Ligt remain unavailable. \"We are still working with them,\" Amorim said about the pair. \"They are not available for this one, but let’s see for the next one.\"",
      "Casemiro will be available to face Newcastle on Boxing Day after serving a suspension last weekend. The Brazilian was forced to sit out the visit to Birmingham after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season.",
      "Amorim will oversee his second game without Bryan Mbeumo and Amad, who both started in the 4-4 draw against Bournemouth before travelling to the Africa Cup of Nations.",

      "Hello Manchester United fans and Merry Christmas from all of us here at the MEN.",
      "Though the majority will be relaxing today, the football word does not really stop especially as the January transfer window approaches with Ruben Amorim likely hoping to find a number of things under his tree.",
      "A new central midfielder would be a welcome present, but it looks unlikely to be Carlos Baleba that makes the switch after he suffered an injury at AFCON. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad are also at the tournament in the Morocco with the United stars key in helping Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, respectively, to opening matchday wins.",
      "Elsewhere, Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is set to be on the move in January with Manchester United linked. However, it looks as though he has chosen the other side of the city over Amorim's side, Tottenham and Liverpool.",
      "With all of that being said, stay with us on MEN for all of the latest United transfer news and rumours!",
      "Ruben Neves' agent has reportedly held talks with United about several of his clients, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The former Wolves midfielder is part of the Gestifute agency, which represents a range of players from across Europe, including Alejandro Balde, Bradley Barcola, Joao Neves, Karim Adeyemi, Lamine Yamal and Vitinha.",
      "Nani believes that Antoine Semenyo would be the type of player that United fans want to see at the club.",
      "Nani told Metro on behalf of online casino experts, casino.co.uk:",
      "I think all the players who have the ability to move forward at speed, being able to dribble, able to shoot, to score goals, to assist and just have that general creativity in the moment would suit Manchester United. That’s the type of player the fans want to see.",
      "However, we know that when players come to Man United, this is totally different. It’s a different environment, different pressure, different mentality, different job, and then they have to adapt. I hope that if we get Semenyo, he can come with his attitude, with this mentality, and he can put all of his talent on the field and help the team.",
      "Diego Leon's agent, Renato Bittar, is adamant that the Paraguay international will stay at United for the entirety of this season.",
      "Bittar told ABC Cardinal, as relayed by Juanma Figueredo and Sport Witness:",
      "We’re always in touch with the club, and Diego Leon will stay at United for the entire season; he’s not going anywhere In my opinion, Diego León should stay at Manchester United. He’s playing for the Under-21s and alternating as a substitute [on the bench] in the first team.",
      "Ruben Amorim has urged Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez to step up in the absence of Bruno Fernandes to injury.",
      "The Manchester United captain has been ruled out of the Boxing Day clash against Newcastle United and Amorim wants to see others step up in his absence.",
      "He said in a press conference on Wednesday: \"If you see it's not just the creation [from Fernandes], it's every set-piece when the guy is organising sometimes the team, which is a good opportunity for everyone to step up.",
      "\"They need to understand we cannot rely on one player for everything, and sometimes we rely on Bruno in the organisation, in the creation. We have lost Bruno, Amad and Bryan for set-pieces, so this is massive for the team, but it's an opportunity for other players to step up and show leadership in the team.",
      "\"He understands every position on the field, every detail and every set-piece; he is always the guy who is telling the other guys where they should be. That is a very good opportunity for guys like Licha [Martinez] and Luke Shaw, all these guys, we need to step up to have more leaders in the group.\"",
      "Despite it being Christmas Day, former Manchester United defender Chris Smalling looks set to be in action as his Al-Fayha face Al Hazem in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The 36-year-old has made 10 appearances this season with his side currently sitting tenth in the table.",
      "Smalling joined the club in the summer of 2024 from AS Roma.",
      "Jonathan David could find himself in the Premier League if a truly sensational swap deal goes through.",
      "Manchester United were one of many sides linked to the Canada international as he prepared to leave Lille at the end of his contract last summer. Juventus ultimately signed him but could now look to offload in order to sign Sandro Tonali.",
      "As per Gazzetta dello Sport, Juve are prepared to include David in a deal to sign Tonali from Newcastle United.",
      "Given all the factors needed, this rumour can be taken with a pinch of salt, but it is not entirely impossible with Tonali likely to return to Italy at some point and David struggling in Serie A.",
      "Antoine Semenyo appears destined to join Manchester City from Bournemouth in the January transfer window.",
      "United have certainly made a play to sign him and felt they were in with a chance of signing. However, his preference looks to be Etihad Stadium and not just for financial reasons with United able to afford the move, despite recent financial troubles.",
      "Ruben Amorim is fairly well-stocked in the areas that Semenyo would fill with it a great market opportunity that United were likely trying to take advantage of.",
      "Instead, Amorim's side will be better off focusing their efforts on a central midfield signing next month.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo grabbed an assist in Cameroon's AFCON opener against Gabon.",
      "The Manchester United set Etta Eyong through on goal with the striker finishing clinically. That victory will likely delay his return to Old Trafford as Cameroon have one foot in the knockout stages.",
      "Amad also made an impact for Ivory Coast as he scored the winning goal, with the same situation applying to him as Mbeumo.",
      "Carlos Baleba has been of concrete interest to Manchester United over the last six months.",
      "However, those links look set to dissipate soon despite the January transfer window opening in less than one week.",
      "That is because Baleba appeared to suffer a concerning injury just before half-time of Cameroon's clash against Gabon at AFCON. He received treatment from physios and despite initially continuing, Baleba did not come back out for the second half.",
      "If the Brighton star is ruled out for a period, it seems highly unlikely that he will be sealing a move next month.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United news and transfer rumours live blog!",
      "It was a busy day for two United stars yesterday with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad both in action and contributing to goals at AFCON.",
      "For the latest January updates on Antoine Semenyo, Carlos Baleba and much more, stay tuned to this page.",
      "Here is everything you need to know about the upcoming January transfer window:",
      "When does it open?",
      "The window opens for English a Scottish clubs on Thursday, Jaunary 1.",
      "When does the window close?",
      "Because the last day of January falls on a weekend, clubs have a couple of extra days to complete their business. The window closes at 7pm on Monday, 2 February.",
      "How many loan players can be signed?",
      "The Premier League hanbook states that Premier League clubs can't register more than two players on loan at any one time. A club can't loan more than one player from another club at any time.",
      "Here's what Ruben Amorim has said about possible January transfers over the next month:",
      "“We will only try to bring players that we think are going to be the future. It’s not going to be to save something in this moment.",
      "\"Even if we try to bring one player, maybe it’s not the position that we need more. We will try to bring now, and [at] the end of the season, players that are perfect for our future.",
      "\"So, I don’t know what is going to happen, but it is possible that we can do something.\"",
      "Bournemouth head coach Antoine Iraola has given his thoughts on the future of Antoine Semenyo, highlghting his wish to keep the player beyond January.",
      "Talking in a press conference, he said:",
      "\"Antoine Semenyo right now is with us, has trained today, very well, is playing very well. I understand that there is a lot of noise around antoine, but my concern is that it doesn't effect him, his performances and we are seeing that in his performance he is very committed to the team and I hope that we can keep him.",
      "\"There are situations that I cannot control, or we cannot control, but right now, Antoine is our player and he's going continue playing for us. If you ask me, I don't want to lose him, but like we always say, every time the market opens you never know what's going to happen.\"",
      "Carlos Baleba has praised Manchester United star and international teammate Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Both are currently away on international duty with Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "\"I believe in our players,\" Baleba said. \"We go to play the AFCON, and I think we're going to do well.",
      "\"Playing for Cameroon, for me it's big, because I want to win something with my country. It's a pleasure to play for my country. I want to win the AFCON and World Cup with my country!",
      "\"I've become a big leader but there are a lot of leaders in the group. There are a lot of leaders like Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"But everyone, we're going to stay together and play. And maybe we can give all of ourselves to our country. But the first thing is to believe in our team.\"",
      "Ruben Neves has been named as a potential replacement for Bruno Fernandes for Manchester United, but it seems that they could have competitiion for the former Wolves man.",
      "Neves' former teammate Sami Al-Jaber has given his thoughts on his next move, he told MBC:",
      "“I fear Neves will move from Al Hilal to Real Madrid for free after his contract with the club expires at the end of this season.",
      "“There are Premier League clubs that want to sign Neves, and the contracts they are offering him are for three years, meaning until he turns 31.",
      "“Real Madrid are also interested, and I’m sure there are other clubs that want Neves.”",
      "It seems that United's biggest rivals in the race for Antoine Semenyo is Manchester City, with reports that the player himself is keen on a move to the Etihad.",
      "It seems that Pep Guardiola has not hid his admiration for the player.",
      "Speaking earlier this season, the Man City boss was full of praise for the Bournemouth man.",
      "\"He's an extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinary player,\" he said.",
      "\"His energy, his confidence, his movement - unbelievable. He doesn't stop running, he attacks space so well, and when he has the ball, you feel something will happen.",
      "\"He's improving every game. Players like him make this league special - always hungry, always brave.\"",
      "Former Premier League striker turned pundit Chris Sutton has given his prediction for the Boxing Day clash against Newcastle.",
      "Speaking to BBC Sport, he said:",
      "\"Manchester United got a bit of praise for their performance against Aston Villa, even though they were beaten.",
      "\"The key to how this game goes is what they do without Bruno Fernandes, and how they are going to cope without him.",
      "\"You look around Ruben Amorim's squad and he does not seem to have a lot of leaders in there.",
      "\"It will be interesting to see if Amorim plays centre-back Lisandro Martinez in that holding midfield role, the same job he did when he came on for Fernandes against Villa, because he could provide that leadership they will need.\"",
      "Chris Sutton's prediction: Man United 0-1 Newcastle",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw to \"step up\" in the dressing room in the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who picked up a muscle injury against Aston Villa. Fernandes was brought off at half-time against Villa, and he will be unavailable when United take on Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival in Manchester in January 2020, but Amorim will have to manage without his captain. Amorim confirmed Fernandes would miss the Boxing Day clash at his pre-Newcastle press conference, and he discussed how the team would cope without the Portugal international in the side.",
      "\"I'm confident we can win any game,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we have some problems, but we need to believe in the team, even without many players in this moment. I believe in the team and believe we can win any game.\"",

      "Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival in Manchester in January 2020, but Amorim will have to manage without his captain. Amorim confirmed Fernandes would miss the Boxing Day clash at his pre-Newcastle press conference, and he discussed how the team would cope without the Portugal international in the side.",
      "\"I'm confident we can win any game,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we have some problems, but we need to believe in the team, even without many players in this moment. I believe in the team and believe we can win any game.",
      "\"It's more difficult, but I trust in my players, and if we are really focused, we can win. I think it's impossible to replace Bruno, but I said to the team we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing, that a lot of people need to step up.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"If you see it's not just the creation [from Fernandes], it's every set-piece when the guy is organising sometimes the team, which is a good opportunity for everyone to step up. They need to understand we cannot rely on one player for everything, and sometimes we rely on Bruno in the organisation, in the creation. We have lost Bruno, Amad and Bryan for set-pieces, so this is massive for the team, but it's an opportunity for other players to step up and show leadership in the team.",
      "\"He understands every position on the field, every detail and every set-piece; he is always the guy who is telling the other guys where they should be. That is a very good opportunity for guys like Licha [Martinez] and Luke Shaw, all these guys, we need to step up to have more leaders in the group.\"",
      "United's injuries opened the door for Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey to make their debuts against Villa. \"They are normal, they are good kids,\" said Amorim when asked how the pair have reacted.",
      "\"The behaviour they have shown during these weeks is really good, but I don't have that feeling that they are a little bit different because they play for Manchester United. They are really focused, and they are preparing the game. They believe they can play, so that is a good feeling.\"",
      "Amorim was without multiple key players at Villa Park last weekend, but Newcastle have a dismal away record this season. Newcastle won 2-0 at Old Trafford last December, which was a miserable month for Amorim. The Magpies subsequently beat United 4-1 at St. James' Park when the two sides met again in April.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has spoken to the media ahead of the Boxing Day Premier League clash with Newcastle this week.",
      "Amorim confirmed in his press conference Bruno Fernandes is out for the foreseeable, including the fixture on Friday night. He is joined in the injury room by Kobbie Mainoo who suffered a calf issue prior to the loss at Aston Villa.",
      "The United boss confirmed Mainoo would be back before Fernandes but would not give a timeframe for the captain's return. Amorim also stressed the Portuguese midfielder's absence was a chance for the leadership team to step up.",
      "Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt are also out of this game but there was better news on their fitness. While Boxing Day has come too soon for their return, they could be back for the visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers next Tuesday.",
      "Take a look back at everything Amorim had to say in the blog below...",
      "Amorim has challenged Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw to \"step up\" in the dressing room in the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who picked up a muscle injury against Aston Villa. Fernandes was brought off at half-time against Villa, and he will be unavailable when United take on Newcastle on Boxing Day. Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival in Manchester in January 2020, but Amorim will have to manage without his captain. Amorim confirmed Fernandes would miss the Boxing Day clash at his pre-Newcastle press conference, and he discussed how the team would cope without the Portugal international in the side.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim has confirmed Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo will be unavailable for Manchester United's game against Newcastle due to injury. Fernandes started against Aston Villa last weekend, but he was brought off at half-time after holding his hamstring. Mainoo was absent from the squad in Birmingham after picking up an injury in training. Amorim confirmed Fernandes had suffered a muscle injury following the Villa defeat, but the United boss provided a further team news update during his Christmas Eve press conference. Speaking about Fernandes and Mainoo, he said: \"No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno.\"",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That is everything from the press conference. The second part of the press conference is embargoed until 10.30pm this evening.",
      "Everything. Everything because he understands every position on the field. He pays attention to every detail. Every set piece when you have a substitution, he is always the guy who is telling the other guys where they should be. But that is a very good opportunity for guys like Licha, Luke Shaw, all these guys. We need to have more leaders to step up because this can happen to Bruno, it is not usual, but this can happen, so it is a big opportunity for the other guys.",
      "It is impossible to replace Bruno but I say that this morning to the team, I think we need to take the good thing if there is a good thing on that, that a lot of people need to step up. It is not just the creation, it is every set piece he is the guy who is organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and understand that we can't rely on one player for everything. Sometimes we rely on Bruno in the organisation, in the creation. We lost Bruno in set pieces we lost Bryan (Mbeumo) in those set pieces so this is massive for the team but it is an opportunity for players to step up and to show the leadership we need in the team.",
      "They are normal, they are good kids. The behaviour they have shown during this week are really good. I don't have the feeling that they were a little bit different because I played them for Manchester United. No, they are really focused, they are preparing for the game and they believe that they can play. That is a good feeling, so nothing different to what I saw in the last few weeks.",
      "I am confident we can win any game. Of course, we have some problems but I believe in the team even without many players in this moment I believe in the team and I believe that we can win any game. Of course, it is more difficult but, again, I trust in my players and if we are really focused in the game, we can win.",
      "No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno. I don’t want to say. I have an idea, of course, but let’s see. We have other players, we need to maybe see different ways of playing. I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job, and that’s why when we have these opportunities, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones.",
      "We are still working with them [Maguire and De Ligt] They are not available for this one, but let’s see for the next one.",
      "Amorim is here and the press conference will begin shortly...",
      "It won't be long until we hear from Amorim for the final time before Christmas",
      "As we head into Christmas, United are sitting in a better position than they were last year. In 2024, the Reds had 22 points and sat 13th. This year, Amorim's men are up to seventh but more importantly are four points better off. Presuming United do not have a second half of the campaign as bad as last season, the Reds are on track to perform much better this campaign.",
      "We are just less than 30 minutes away from Amorim's press conference. Will the United boss be in the festive spirit this afternoon as he previews Boxing Day?",
      "United would rather not be heading into the January transfer window needing to bring players in. Time and time again we have been told the winter market benefits sellers rather than buyers, but needs must. Despite all the money spent in the summer, United are still lacking options. Amorim knows this and addressed the situation before the trip to Villa Park on Sunday. \"The only thing we know is we will only try to bring players that we think are going to be the future,\" he said. \"It’s not going to be to save something in this moment.\"",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "United are set to appoint Paul Midgley as their new head of youth recruitment. Midgley has worked in the same role at Newcastle, but he will swap St. James Park for Old Trafford. United have been searching for a new head of academy recruitment since Luke Fedorenko accepted an offer to work for a football agency. Fedorenko played a crucial role in landing top youth signings during his time in Manchester, but he decided it was time for a new chapter after Nick Cox's exit.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "It may be a quieter press conference room than usual due to it being Christmas Eve but there is plenty to discuss prior to Boxing Day. Here's what could be on the agenda:",
      "Ahead of the January transfer window, it appears Rashford is more keen than ever to stay at Barcelona beyond the end of his current loan deal which expires at the culmination of the campaign. Speaking to the media, he said:",
      "Barcelona is a fantastic club, a huge, huge club that is known for winning, and this type of, I want to say pressure, but it’s not a bad type of pressure, it’s a pressure I want to have when playing football. If I’m at a club that doesn’t demand these things, then it’s more difficult for me to be motivated. It’s a fantastic environment for me to continue my football journey. I try to do my best and try to push the team to win, and in the summer, we will see what happens.",
      "Amorim is highly unlikely to want to talk about Rashford in his press conference today.",
      "It's going to be a strange experience for Bruno Fernandes on Boxing Day when he sits down to watch United and is unable to influence the action. Whether Fernandes has his hamstring wrapped up in the warm at home, or has his big coat on at Old Trafford, he isn't going to know what to do with himself when his teammates take on Newcastle United. Fernandes is 31 and a veteran of 683 appearances for club and country, but astonishingly, he has missed only four games in his career through injury. Two of those were for Portugal in the March 2019 international break and then two for United in May 2024. He has missed two more games due to illness, in 2017 and 2022, and that is it.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "How do you solve a problem like Bruno? In a week when United had to consider the possibility of losing their best player after his unexpected comments about his future, they are about to get a taste of what life without Fernandes might actually be like. The 31-year-old reckons United's powerbrokers wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the \"courage\" to go through with it. His performances this season have once again made him indispensable, but after picking up a hamstring injury at Aston Villa, he now faces a spell on the sidelines.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "In last week's pre-match press conference, all the build-up surrounded the comments made by Fernandes in an interview with Portuguese media. This time, Fernandes is in the spotlight once more but due to his injury picked up at Villa. There are reports the captain could be out for a month but we should know more when Amorim speaks this afternoon.",
      "Amorim is due to speak to the United media at 1.15pm with the embargo lifting at 1.30pm. We will get the quotes from the press conference as soon as we can after that!",
      "Good morning and welcome along to our Amorim press conference blog on Christmas Eve!",
      "Make sure to stick right here as we build up to the United boss speaking this afternoon. Ahead of the Boxing Day fixture, the Reds have a number of injury issues which need addressing.",
      "Fernandes, Mainoo, Maguire and De Ligt are all expected to be out against Newcastle. The midfield absentees are a huge blow for United and will provide Amorim with a headache over his Christmas dinner.",
      "Stay tuned for all the build-up to Amorim's press conference..."

      "When Adam Le Fondre made the move to FC United of Manchester in August 2024, few could believe it. The Red Rebels, formed in 2005 following the Glazers' takeover of Manchester United, managed to lure the 39-year-old forward to the seventh-tier of English football, despite playing in Europe for Hibernian the previous season.",
      "Although Le Fondre is approaching the twilight of his career, he has showed no sign of slowing down at FC United. Indeed, after finding the net 17 times in his debut campaign at Broadhurst Park, he has struck 10 goals in 23 appearances this season.",
      "His form has helped FC United mount a promotion push in the Northern Premier League, with the Reds sitting third and just five points behind leaders Hednesford.",
      "\"We've put ourselves in a really good position to have a really promising season and a real good go at trying to get promoted out of this league as well.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I feel good physically,\" Le Fondre said, when reflecting on his own performances. \"Obviously, some days are better than others when you get to my age, but generally I feel really good physically.",
      "\"I feel in a really good physical condition as well. I look after myself on and off the pitch, and long may it continue for me, because that's the key to me carrying on playing, is me staying injury-free and being able to contribute to winning football as well. So, while I'm doing that, I'm not looking at leaving at this moment in time.\"",
      "Alongside playing part-time for FC United, Le Fondre balances that with working as a video scout for Manchester City's The City Football Group.",
      "\"Yeah, I'm still a video scout for Manchester City,\" Le Fondre, who has vacated that role since October 2024, said. \"It was just off the back of a podcast, 'I had trials once' and I laid out what I envisaged myself doing in the future.",
      "\"Someone from the City Group got in touch and it sort of grew from there organically.\"",
      "\"Obviously, I can't go to live football games because I tend to be playing a lot,\" he continued. \"It's more I'll be on WyScout watching players and sort of carrying on from there. Yeah, I do envisage I'll carry on doing it. As long as it doesn't hinder my coaching, which it shouldn't do.",
      "\"I'll always have time for video scouting and it's always good looking at very good players.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Le Fondre is due to kickstart his coaching career after he was appointed as the Head of Football at FC United’s new football academy, which is set to begin in September 2026. His role is expected to include a blend of coaching and overseeing the development of players, with an end goal of getting them into the first-team squad.",
      "\"It's going to be good to shape young people's futures,\" Le Fondre said. \"It's an opportunity for them to learn from me and hopefully I can help them better and help them have a football career. Obviously, I think the strength behind it is that FC United have created a pathway from their academy into the first team, and I'm going to try and help with that.",
      "\"The importance is on my shoulders to mould the players and try and turn them into football players who can contribute, whether it's the club as a whole or on the football pitch as well.\"",
      "Last month, Le Fondre scored his 300th senior career goal during FC United’s 2-1 win against Ilkeston. It came almost 21 years since his first, with the forward starting out as a teenager at Stockport before moving to Rochdale and enjoying time across the EFL and having one season in the Premier League at Reading.",
      "When asked about that achievement, Le Fondre admitted: \"I think for any player who's managed to play for as long as I have, the sort of things that you need to keep going for, milestones that you need to set, because you have to still keep that hunger, that drive there. That was just one of the ones for me I wanted to tick off.",
      "\"My next milestone now is 800 games. So, that sort of thing, just for me, I set targets for myself to try and get to, because I need something for myself to be driving towards rather than just floating in the wind with no direction.”",
      "Out of the 300 plus that Le Fondre has now scored, there are a couple that stand out to him. \"I think for probably importance, I've got a couple really where I've scored two against Southampton in the same game for Reading,\" he said. \"Probably them two for just general importance and what they meant to the title race at that time and the club.",
      "\"For Bolton as well, I've been lucky enough that when we got promoted on the last day of the season against Peterborough at home, I scored and set up a goal in that game. The following season, when we stayed up on the last day of the season against Nottingham Forest, I managed to score and set two up on that.",
      "\"So, those sort of goals live long in the memory of what I've done in football. Like I say, it's hard to pick ones out, but I think them ones, they've got a bit more significance tied to them and a bit more importance behind them as well. For me, probably them goals are the ones that really helped contribute and I look back on so fondly of the scenes of that as well.\"",
      "Another significant goal for Le Fondre is the one he scored against boyhood club Manchester United in the Premier League, even if Reading ended up losing the game 4-3.",
      "\"It's something I can look back on with immense pride,\" Le Fondre admitted. \"Obviously, I scored against United. For me, it's unfortunate we didn't win the game.",
      "\"It's great for me to score, but if you don't win the game, ultimately, I've sort of failed my job as well because we've not won. So, there's always a little bit of tinge with certain goals. Don't get me wrong, I look back very fondly on all the goals I've scored throughout my career.",
      "\"So, it's not as if I'm dismissing them. It's just that some sort of mean a little bit more with how the result panned out and what came off the back of them as well.\"",
      "Although Le Fondre will 40 next December, he doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon. \"It's just how I feel. If I feel good and it fits into my day-to-day schedule, then I'll carry on doing it,\" he finished.",
      "\"Obviously, I'm still contributing and still looking a little bit like myself as a footballer, then I'll continue to play and contribute. But I've not set a date on anything going forward-wise.",
      "\"If stuff outside the pitch gets a little bit more traction than on the pitch, then it'll be a time to step away and do that. But at this moment in time, there's no timescale on anything like that.\"",
      "Le Fondre and FC United are next in action when they face table toppers Hednesford in a blockbuster Christmas clash on Saturday, December 27.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Roy Keane and Alan Shearer both enjoyed hugely successful careers. The former captained Manchester United and won 17 trophies during his time at Old Trafford, while the latter, who also captained his side, is still the all-time Premier League top goalscorer and famously won the top-flight title with Blackburn Rovers in 1995.",
      "Given that United were considerably more successful than Blackburn Rovers, and later Newcastle United, the rivalry that began to develop between Keane and Shearer came as somewhat of a surprise to many people. Two of the league's most prominent figures had somehow become on-field enemies.",
      "The spark that ignited the feud occurred in 2001. The pair famously clashed on the pitch in the dying seconds of the Magpies' 4-3 home victory against United, with Keane petulantly throwing the ball at Shearer's head after the Magpies striker blocked a quick throw-in. The Irishman would go on to shove his opponent, before slapping the yellow card that was waiting for him out of the hands of referee Steve Bennett.",
      "Keane was jeered by the St James' Park crowd - who had applauded his subsequent red card - with Gary Neville and David Beckham having to pull his teammate away from Shearer.",
      "Shearer, having stared back into Keane's eyes, certainly played his part in the incident. It was, in some ways, just as villainous as the acts performed by his foe, but the difference was that he managed to keep his cool. The United midfielder was frustrated that the Magpies ace, who had put Newcastle ahead in the seven-goal thriller just eight minutes prior, did not fall into his trap.",
      "The drama, albeit a blow for United, was entertaining for spectators, and it was far from over, too. An incensed Keane was waiting for Shearer in the tunnel after the match - an incident that the BBC pundit recalled in 2021. He told The Athletic: \"When the final whistle went, Roy was standing at the top of the stairs waiting for me.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure a few more choice words were exchanged, there was some bustling and scrambling, but there were way too many people between us for anything physical to actually happen. That's usually how it pans out in football.\"",
      "When asked why he decided to push Shearer, Keane previously said: \"I lost my temper, we were losing 4-3, I think, in the last minute. If you're going to get sent off, the worst thing is, I pushed him. If you're going to get sent off you might as well punch him properly because you're going to get the same punishment.",
      "\"You might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. That's what I was thinking afterwards. It was just a push. It was ridiculous.\"",
      "The former England striker has been keen to insist that he didn't view the Reds midfielder as an \"enemy\" - but Keane, on the other hand, has certainly never been complimentary when it comes to talking about Shearer. While the pair currently work for rival broadcasters, there was a time when they were both doing punditry work for the BBC.",
      "During an episode of The Overlap Live, Keane was asked if any of the feuds he was involved in on the pitch had led to issues in the TV studio. He appeared to indicate that him and Shearer were still not on good terms.",
      "\"Yeah, most weeks!\" Keane replied. \"There's one or two I've done games with where we couldn't get over that hurdle of what happened in the past.\"",
      "When he was pushed to reveal the player's name, he said: \"Shearer... forget it.\"",
      "Although Shearer had suggested that any lingering problems between himself and Keane were non-existent, he then appeared to reignite the feud. Shearer seemingly changed his story about the clash, claiming, or potentially joking, that Keane had actually ran away from him.",
      "\"Roy didn't like me for some reason, I don't know why. He was getting beaten that day, that's [probably] why,\" said Shearer. \"We were winning the game and there was only a minute left. I was waiting for him in the tunnel - he ran away!\"",
      "However, Shearer's former teammate Craig Bellamy didn’t quite recall it that way. In fact, he suggested that the Magpies striker was, conveniently, taking his time to exit the field following the full-time whistle.",
      "He claimed in his autobiography: \"I saw him waiting for Alan in the tunnel at the end of the game and Alan didn’t seem to be hurrying off the pitch! He was one of the last to come off actually, which we all made sure we remarked on when he finally made it back to the dressing room. Keane had to be dragged into the United dressing room by then.\"",
      "Keane, meanwhile, almost considered retirement after being sent off in the Premier League clash with Newcastle. The Irishman, known for his professionalism and determination to succeed and win, was so annoyed by his actions that he thought about walking away from the game - despite only turning 30 the previous month.",
      "\"I was fed up and annoyed with myself. Especially after the match,\" Keane explained. \"The gaffer [Sir Alex Ferguson] never really had a go at me. I knew from his body language – 'how much more, Roy?' I saw him the next day and I said 'I’ve had enough' – and I meant it.",
      "\"He said 'you'll miss it' and I was convinced I wouldn’t but I suppose deep, deep, very deep down of course I knew I would miss walking out at Old Trafford. I loved playing at Old Trafford and I loved playing for United.\"",
      "The Irishman, thankfully, decided to continue playing. He would eventually leave Old Trafford having played 473 matches for the Reds, registering 51 goals and 36 assists. Keane retired as a Premier League legend. As did Shearer.",
      "While the pair were quick to clash on the pitch - and are unlikely to ever be friends off of it - they clearly had respect for each other. That, unlike Keane's attempted swing, was never missing.",

Fedorenko played a crucial role in landing top youth signings during his time in Manchester, but he decided it was time for a new chapter after Nick Cox's exit.",

      "When the Glazer family put United up for a full or partial sale three years ago, Zilliacus launched his fan-led proposal, which he claimed could have earned the club up to £15billion.",
      "He said: \"I have decided to offer Manchester United a sponsorship deal through my company XXI Century Capital Group. I want to be able to give a Christmas present to Manchester United.",
      "\"For me, it's not about owning something. It's not about having a trophy to show off. It's about how we make Manchester United so strong financially that they can become the number one club, not only in England, but in Europe.",
      "\"So, I have decided to propose a $500m (£375m) sponsorship deal over five years. It goes back to global fan engagement and how we get the fans involved around the world.",
      "\"I have a programme that in a very interesting way activates these fans and it's around that that I am confident I can offer this sponsorship deal over five years. With that money, Manchester United could significantly strengthen their squad and do other things as well.",
      "\"Within the XXI Century Capital Group, we have a number of brands. It wouldn't necessarily be the XXI Century Capital brand that sponsors. It could be some other brands within the group. It could be Champion Circle, which is the specific fan engagement programme.\"",

      "\"When us three, Jim Ratcliffe, Sheikh Jassim and I, were bidding for Manchester United, I said, 'Look, instead of just trying to overbid each other and make the Glazer family even more wealthy, why don't we work together for the benefit of the club?'",
      "\"That is still how I see things. You usually get better results when you work together. I want to be heavily involved in agreeing on how sponsorship would work. Then when it comes to developing the club, I would be very happy to offer my ideas, my thoughts and my advice but I would not impose.",
      "\"I would not say, 'Look, you have to include me in some decision-making.' But I do think there are so many things that could be done even better. Starting from player acquisition to how we make the fans happier with everything that they experience, be it inside the stadium or outside the stadium.",

      "Bryan Robson's comments about Marcus Rashford will give the forward plenty to think about when it comes to making a decision about his Manchester United future.",
      "Rashford fell out of favour with Ruben Amorim a year ago and found himself frozen out of the team. The struggling England forward left his boyhood club to go out on loan to Aston Villa for the second half of the 2024/25 season, where he showed glimpses of his former self.",
      "The 28-year-old then secured his dream move to Barcelona on a season-long loan from United in the summer. The deal reportedly includes an option for the La Liga leaders to make his move permanent at the end of this season for around £26million.",
      "That seems to be Rashford’s preferred scenario as he appears to be loving life in Catalonia, having enjoyed a brilliant first five months with the Spanish giants.",
      "But Barcelona’s sporting director Deco insists it’s too early to make a decision on the player’s future beyond this season. And, should the Blaugrana opt out of the option to buy Rashford, he has a huge decision to make about potentially remaining at United and making things work with Amorim.",
      "Club legend Robson indicated as much when he stated Rashford should be playing his best football for United while giving the player a firm dressing down during his loan stint at Villa earlier this year.",
      "\"Well, I haven't come out publicly and said anything, but the TV pundits drive me crazy,\" Robson told The Express. \"I'm talking about ex-players saying that as soon as he went to Villa, he was enjoying his football again.",
      "\"Hold on a minute. You are so fortunate to be a football player. If I'm at Man United, I'm enjoying my football, or I should be enjoying my football, and I'm going to work hard to try and make the team successful.",
      "\"So when you go to Villa, it's no different from playing for Man United. You try and enjoy your game and do the best you can. So there's no excuses.”",
      "He added: \"Marcus has unbelievable talent and should be doing better for Manchester United. He shouldn't even be moving on to Aston Villa. He should be giving his best for Man United.",
      "\"[Whether he comes back] is the manager's and Marcus's decision. But for me, he's got the talent, and you've got to get the best out of him. And Marcus has got to get the best out of himself, and he should be a Man United player next year.\"",
      "Speaking earlier this month, Barcelona boss Deco explained: \"It's not the time to make any decision regarding Rashford's future. \"We're happy with him. He's contributing a lot to the team. In the win against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, he came on and did well again, but we have time to make a decision on him still.\"",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is facing at least one month out of action after suffering from an injury in his side's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon.",
      "That's according to The Telegraph, who report that the club captain sustained a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\", which saw him forced off at half-time at Villa Park.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker was seen struggling through the first half of the match, with the second half seeing him replaced by Lisandro Martinez, who took up the midfield role instead.",
      "The injury for Fernandes comes as a blow to Man United at the worst possible time, with three game-changers in Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, and Noussair Mazraoui all away on international duty with their respective nations for the Africa Cup of Nations over the next month or so.",
      "That has already seen Ruben Amorim dealt a depleted squad, which was evident with his reliance on younger players in the defeat on Sunday.",
      "The loss of Fernandes is a particularly huge blow, considering how crucial he has been to their recent uptick in form, picking up five goals and seven assists from his deeper midfield role.",
      "Speaking about the injury after the game, Amorim said: \"I think it's a soft-tissue injury so it's going to be a while. He is a guy who is always fit so we hope he can recover well. We will see.",
      "\"It's an injury and sometimes it’s bad luck or something else at the same time. You can never control these things.",
      "\"We will need to find solutions and we cannot use anything as an excuse. We need to prepare all the guys that we have for the next game.",
      "\"No one is going to remember these problems, so let’s cope with that. It will make us stronger.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo may finally be given a chance to shine, after calls from all sections of the fanbase for the youngster to be given an opportunity.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, despite previously proving himself at the top level, which has raised plenty of eyebrows.",
      "Mainoo was absent from the defeat at Villa Park, due to a minor injury picked up in training, which meant he couldn't be the immediate Fernandes replacement on Sunday, but could be for Boxing Day's clash with Newcastle United.",
      "With yet another injury issue, there are some big games for Amorim coming up over the next month that could see the club captain out of action.",
      "With United's last realistic chance of silverware coming in the FA Cup, the loss of Fernandes for the Brighton clash could be huge, on top of his absence for matches against rivals such as Leeds, Manchester City, and Arsenal.",
      "In his absence comes a chance for someone to step up and make themselves a hero, however.",

      "That run of form is built on shaky foundations if you believe the data geeks, but Morgan Rogers is doing his best to condemn the boffins to the bin this season. He is making a habit of scoring stunners, so the solution is to make sure he can't shoot. Instead, Leny Yoro was so busy handing out gifts he should have been wearing a white beard.",
      "He was too passive against Rogers and paid the price twice. It undid a lot of the good work that United put in at Villa Park. For the second game running, they created chances and looked like a threat going forward, but failed to win. It is now two wins in eight.",
      "Villa came out of the blocks quickly, as you would expect of a team on a run of nine successive wins. Ayden Heaven twice had to block shots from Ollie Watkins, Senne Lammens made a save from John McGinn and Rogers reacted quickly to flick an Ian Maatsen drive towards goal in the six-yard box, only to see it squirm just wide.",
      "United settled their rocking ship, however, and should have led by the midway point of the half. Benjamin Sesko found himself in on goal only to be denied by a sprawling save from Emiliano Martinez. A minute later, it was a clever pass from Matheus Cunha that sent Sesko in, but he took a heavy touch when trying to round Martinez, when he should have attempted to lift a first-time finish.",
      "In a stodgy half, it was Rogers and Cunha who had looked like making something happen, and they delivered within minutes of each other. Rogers had nothing on when he picked up possession on the left touchline, but Yoro never got close to the Premier League's in-form player and let him drift into a shooting position, from where he picked his spot clinically.",
      "Thankfully for United, Matty Cash was also in the Christmas spirit. He was caught napping by Patrick Dorgu, with the ball falling to Cunha. The Brazilian had plenty to do, but his unerring finish was measured to perfection.",
      "The half-time loss of Fernandes was a hammer blow for United. The captain had stopped the game after clutching his hamstring, but continued until the break. He even had a goal-bound shot blocked by Ezri Konsa in that period, but couldn't continue. It meant Amorim had to raid his threadbare bench and the promotion of Martinez to midfield showed what he thought of the other options available to him.",
      "Martinez settled into the game quickly, and United started the second half well, but were again undone by a moment of Rogers' magic. The finish was from a similar angle after the ball bounced clear to him, and again, Yoro was too cautious in trying to stop him. His two shots were worth a combined xG of 0.07 on the spreadsheet. Unfortunately for United, the game was being played on the pitch.",
      "The consolation for Amorim was that his team was being beaten by stunners. So stretched were resources that the Portuguese called a truce with the academy, handing out two debuts, with Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey coming off the bench.",
      "Diogo Dalot forced Martinez into a save and Dorgu's follow-up was blocked by Cash. The recalled wing-back then stuck a cross on Cunha's head only for the Brazilian's effort to bounce wide. Lacey managed a shot on target from distance and Mount whipped a free-kick onto the roof of the net.",
      "It was an afternoon when United could count themselves a little unlucky, but the results are flatlining again. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day. Who partners him is anyone's guess.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is absent from the Manchester United squad at Aston Villa after he picked up an injury in the final training session before the trip to Villa Park. The injury is described as a \"small issue\", but it is enough to rule the academy graduate out of a game he might have started.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a game in the Premier League this season and he is eyeing a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, but Ruben Amorim urged him to stay and fight for his place in his press conference ahead of the fixture against the league's in-form side.",
      "Amorim had hinted he could play a back four against Villa, a formation that would have meant three midfielders and would have resulted in an expected promotion for Mainoo, 20, with Casemiro suspended after picking up a fifth booking of the season.",
      "But his cruelly timed injury means he won't get to add to his 212 minutes of Premier League football so far this season. With Mainoo unavailable, Amorim has stuck by his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United are short of options with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Mainoo has joined Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt on the treatment table.",
      "Amorim was asked about Mainoo during his press conference and urged him to accept his current predicament and prove him wrong, hinting he could be in the side against Villa.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" he said. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. Veron was not playing.",
      "\"So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team to win. To help Kobbie to be a better player. I'm not trying to say to Kobbie 'You are a big player here, let’s put him on the bench to show something.'",
      "\"No, no. What I’m saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobe sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, Sunday he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, is going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me for the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone. I'm just saying that I'm trying to win games and to show to the players that if you do the things right, you will play no matter what the name.\""

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says Bruno Fernandes is “impossible to replace” but he has to find a way against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Fernandes was brought off at half-time in Sunday’s Premier League match at Aston Villa after suffering a muscle injury.",
      "The Portugal international has only missed two club matches through injury in his professional career, but is set to be absent for around a month.",
      "It’s a huge blow for United, who only know life with their captain in the starting XI. It will be interesting to see how they cope without him. They will either crumble, or, for no reason other than football being very weird at times, look significantly better.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the natural choice to replace Fernandes, but he is also injured.",
      "It’s typical of the young midfielder’s season, which has been stop-start and frustrating. Mainoo knows he is competing against Fernandes for a starting spot rather than alongside him.",
      "Dislodging the United skipper is an impossible task and his injury should have presented the perfect opportunity for Mainoo to finally stake his claim under Amorim.",
      "Instead, the United boss is without both and could move Mason Mount back into midfield to play alongside Casemiro, although centre-back Lisandro Martinez came off the bench to feature there at Villa Park.",
      "Amorim has to find a solution, but you can’t blame him for being a little tentative.",
      "Speaking during his pre-match press conference on Wednesday, Amorim said: “It’s impossible to replace Bruno. But I said that this morning to the team that we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing in that, and a lot of people need to step up.",
      "“It’s not just the creation. On every set-piece, he is the guy organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and realise we can’t rely on one player for everything.",
      "“Sometimes we rely on Bruno for the organisation and creation. We lost Bruno, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad [Diallo] on set-pieces so this is massive for the team.",
      "“This is a good chance for Lucha [Lisandro Martinez], Luke Shaw and all of these guys to step up and have more leaders in the group.”",
      "Young midfielder Jack Fletcher, son of United hero Darren, came off the bench against Villa and is one of the options Amorim is considering.",
      "“We have other players. We maybe need to see different ways of playing,” he said.",
      "“I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job and that’s why, when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and others. We will find solutions to play.",
      "“I am confident we can win any game. We have some problems, but I believe in the team, even without many players at this moment. It is more difficult, but I trust my players. If we are really focused on the game, we can win.”",
      "So, who replaces Fernandes in the United midfield?",
      "A Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte pairing seriously lacks creativity and, in the latter’s case, quality.",
      "Ugarte is short on confidence and has struggled every time he has taken to the pitch this season, with most of his appearances coming from the bench.",
      "He started against Villa last weekend and could start again if Amorim believes continuity is required to restore his form.",
      "But with Newcastle looking far less combative and physical in midfield, there is little need to pair the two South Americans.",
      "Fletcher is an option, but it will likely be Mount who starts alongside Casemiro, who returns from suspension to face the Magpies.",
      "Mount has impressed in recent weeks in a more advanced role, but he is perfectly capable of dropping deeper to perform a similar function to Fernandes.",
      "Mason Mount’s impact for Manchester United this season 🔴 pic.twitter.com/k9slPwA1FV",
      "He has the engine, tactical awareness and set-piece delivery to do as good a job as any in the middle of the park. It will be a big test, but one he is capable of passing.",
      "Mount could thrive in a starring role rather than a supporting one, and a top performance against Newcastle could put him firmly on England boss Thomas Tuchel’s radar, if he isn’t already.",
      "Mount dropping deeper, combined with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo being away at the Africa Cup of Nations, leaves question marks over Amorim’s front three.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is expected to start up front, with Matheus Cunha in behind him. The final attacking spot is up for grabs and will probably go to Joshua Zirkzee, with young striker Chido Obi the only other first-team option.",
      "It is either Casemiro and Ugarte in midfield with Mount, Cunha and Sesko ahead of them, or Casemiro and Mount in midfield with Zirkzee, Cunha and Sesko up front, or Martinez will start as a wildcard.",
      "That is, of course, unless Amorim does the unthinkable and changes formation.",
      "That really would be a Christmas miracle.",
      "Man Utd are one of two Premier League clubs to have made an ‘offer’ for Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior ahead of the summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes is likely to miss the Red Devils’ next six matches, according to reports, after picking up an injury against Aston Villa.",

      "Christmas has been ruined for Kobbie Mainoo after the news he may have to stay at Manchester United after all.",
      "Fabrizio Romano insist that Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim will “suffer” for the rest of the season if it means getting in the right long-term transfer targets.",

      "Boxing Day falling on a Friday may have robbed us of our God-given right as Englishmen to spend the day watching wall-to-wall top-flight football, but it’s still a pretty Big Christmas Weekend, we suppose.",
      "The one game we are being allowed by the wokerati on Boxing Day is at least a good one, and the following couple of days do have some belters to be fair. Including – again, as should be law at this time of year – a couple of potential opportunities to deploy the word ‘sack’ in whimsical fashion to refer to both Santa’s preferred if archaic toy delivery method and the fate of a couple of under-fire managers.",
      "It’s the most wonderful time of the year, all right.",
      "",
      "Always looked like it would be the most significant game in the title race over the festive weekend, but only in the last few weeks has it become clear that this is because of Aston Villa’s involvement and not Chelsea’s.",
      "It is, obviously, a huge test of Villa’s stickability; Chelsea may have meekly surrendered their own chances in self-fulfilling fashion once again, but they remain a tough test for a team trying to compete with two giants in Arsenal and Man City.",
      "The actual dynamic of this Saturday evening affair will inevitably be coloured by what Man City and Arsenal themselves have done earlier in the day. Fair to say Villa would at this point settle for a retention of the status quo in terms of their gap to the top two.",
      "And without wishing to pour any rain on Villa’s current parade, it does still bear mentioning that as the second half of the season pans out there is still the possibility/probability that Chelsea emerge as more significant rivals to Villa than the top two anyway in terms of Champions League qualification.",
      "Villa currently lead Enzo Maresca’s side by seven points and while sprinting to keep up with the top two isn’t doing Unai and the lads any harm right now it does feel like a day where, even for a team with 11 wins from their last 12 Premier League games, a draw would be absolutely fine and not in any way necessarily a momentum killer.",
      "",
      "Villa are obviously the best team in the country right now, but for the first time in a good while it’s looking like Man City might be second best. They’re certainly playing more convincing football than Arsenal right now, and have another chance to briefly leapfrog their main title rivals and put pressure on a potentially ticklish home game for Arsenal against a Brighton side who so often relish the chance to mess with the bigger boys.",
      "But in order to apply that pressure City must take care of their own business against Sean Dyche’s Nottingham Forest, a team that can’t quite be described as resurgent but is definitely no longer the pushover of the brief but hilarious Angeball days.",
      "They’ve been alternating between victory and defeat for the last six Premier League games, and the bad news for City is that they’ll arrive at the City Ground at the wrong point in that particular pattern.",
      "The good news for City is that they aren’t currently alternating anything having won each of their last five Premier League games, the last three of them by 3-0 margins and with 17 goals in total across those five games. Which, even after the 3-0 paddling of Tottenham the other week, is still the total number of Premier League goals Forest have managed all season.",
      "",
      "We may only have one Premier League game on Boxing Day, because of woke, but it is at least a good one as the tentatively improving Man United take on a frustrating Newcastle side whose season still awaits any kind of real lift-off.",
      "The big news for the home side, of course, is how they fare without Bruno Fernandes. He isn’t the actual most irreplaceable player in the league, because that probably is still just Erling Haaland because of sheer weight of numbers, but his combination of vital importance and until now impeccable reliability does give this some real heft.",
      "This is a player who basically plays all of the football for Man United, and there’s a certain irony that his first vaguely serious injury in five years has come right at the start of the busiest time of the quietest season.",
      "But every crisis is an opportunity, and now for the first time in his United career we get the chance to see Mason Mount cast in a starring rather than supporting role.",
      "For him, the timing does seem rather good. He has in recent weeks been playing the best football he’s produced since leaving Chelsea and has already proved he can do a job playing alongside United’s undisputed star man.",
      "Now he must show he can pull the strings in Bruno’s absence, or all the hints of recovery for both United and Mount himself over the last couple of months could be washed away before January is through.",
      "",
      "The current favourite in the Sack Race takes on the current favourite to replace him as Thomas Frank’s Tottenham travel to Crystal Palace for a real melon-twister of a game.",
      "Oliver Glasner’s departure for somewhere shinier than Palace has long felt inevitable, but it wouldn’t do at all for them to lose him to somewhere as ropey as Spurs. So Palace need to tread carefully here, making sure to win, obviously, but not in such a way as to hasten Frank’s demise.",
      "Luckily, Liverpool have given them the perfect blueprint for how to be alarmingly bad but still beat Spurs.",
      "Frank is, clearly, in very deep trouble. The fallout from that vaguely absurd game against Liverpool in which Spurs played better with 10 men and then better still with nine means he has to try and engineer a result at Selhurst Park without both Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero. Both let him down badly on Saturday in inconsistent seasons, and this doesn’t look like a moment in which Spurs or Frank can afford to have both their attack and defence weakened in this manner.",
      "Frank has already survived one encounter with his former club Brentford that had the possibility to end his Tottenham reign. But if he leaves Selhurst Park with the result we suspect, then the New Year trip to his old patch will carry old problems.",
      "There was mitigation and even encouragement from the performance even in defeat against Liverpool, but that won’t fly in the next couple of games. He’s got to find a result in one of these two games surely. And even that may be no more than delaying the now inevitable.",
      "",
      "Unlike the ultra-woke, Christmas-cancelling Premier League, the Football League is delivering a full sack of Boxing Day fixtures to enjoy with your turkey sandwiches, Rennies and hangover.",
      "Couple of tasty ones from the Championship promotion picture, too, with a couple of six-pointers among pairs of teams with their eyes on a play-off finish at worst.",
      "Stoke v Preston is one, with the Potters looking to arrest their recent slide while for Preston the recent issue has been too many draws in a six-match unbeaten run.",
      "The pick, though, looks to be Millwall v Ipswich, because third v sixth with third place up for grabs is always a particularly delicious dynamic for a Championship fixture at any time of the season.",
      "",
      "God bless Serie A for carrying on even though it’s Christmas, and also this season for delivering what looks certain to be the best title race across Europe’s big leagues. We still here have a top five separated by just four points and after a bad couple of weeks for Bologna and Como it does seem now to have crystallised into a scrap between five big guns.",
      "It’s currently all rather neat, with Inter top on 33 points and stacked up at one-point increments behind them come Milan, Napoli, Roma and Juventus.",
      "The Christmas weekend doesn’t pit any of the contenders in direct conflict, but Inter’s trip to Atalanta does look as good a choice as any.",
      "Essentially, absent a clear standout fixture for any of those title contenders, if you’re picking one game Inter are generally the safest bet on the entertainment front. They’ve conceded more goals than anyone else in the top eight bar Juventus (by a single goal) but with 34 goals in their 15 games thus far are 10 goals clear of anyone else."

      "Man Utd are one of two Premier League clubs to have made an ‘offer’ for Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior ahead of the summer, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side were perhaps the better team against Aston Villa on Sunday in their 2-1 defeat with the Red Devils missing Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "There were a number of youngsters on the Man Utd bench on Sunday and it now seems the Red Devils are likely to enter the January transfer market for new players.",
      "Man Utd had strong interest in signing Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth until widespread reports claimed that Man City is the Ghana international’s ‘preference’.",
      "With Amorim’s insistence that Man Utd don’t want to rely on short-term fixes, any deal for an attacker could have to wait until the summer, unless another good opportunity arises.",
      "READ: Top 10 post-Christmas title capitulations to frighten Arsenal (who have previous)",
      "And reports in Spain claim that Real Madrid have ‘received two offers of more than €100m’ for Vinicius Junior, one of which has come from the Red Devils.",
      "Real Madrid are struggling to get Vinicius Junior to sign a new deal as the Brazil international wants parity with top earner Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The report adds: ‘Faced with this situation, those at the Bernabeu have decided not to remain idle. Real Madrid are already listening to offers and, according to sources close to the club, two very serious proposals have arrived from the Premier League. Chelsea and Manchester United have put more than €100 million on the table to acquire Vinicius this summer, a figure that, at the very least, compels them to sit down and talk.",
      "‘At Real Madrid, there’s no urgency to sell, but there is concern about losing control of the narrative. Letting time pass without renewing Vinicius ‘ contract could become a strategic problem, especially if the player enters the final stretch of his contract without an agreement. Selling now, with strong offers and room to manoeuvre, is starting to look like a logical option.’",
      "There could be conversations about Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes being involved in the deal for Vinicius Junior in the summer with Spanish website Fichajes claiming Real Madrid see the Portugal international as a ‘realistic option’.",
      "It has been revealed that clubs from outside the Premier League can buy Fernandes for €60m as he has a release clause in his contract and ‘that amount fits within Real Madrid’s parameters for a strategic signing’.",
      "Fichajes adds: ‘Herein lies the main doubt. Bruno Fernandes is 31 years old, a factor that doesn’t quite convince Florentino Pérez. In recent years, the president has opted for young signings with potential and resale value.",
      "‘However, the club also recognizes the need for balance. Incorporating proven experience can be key to supporting an increasingly young squad in crucial moments.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano clarified Fernandes’ release clause earlier this week, he said: “In January, I don’t expect any movement despite all the interviews, all the quotes from Bruno. My expectation is not for Bruno to move in January. Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",
      "“There is a release clause in the contract of Fernandes. And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only valid for clubs from abroad.",
      "“It’s slightly over €60m, so there would be the possibility for several clubs to attack. But in that case, it depends on what Bruno wants to do.",
      "“Bruno said already in an interview a few days ago that he said no to Saudi, it was Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window. Bruno wanted to stay at Man Utd, but the clause is going to be still there in summer 2026.",
      "“It’s going to be up to Bruno to decide what he wants to do next and what’s going to be the mission for him on the transfer market for summer 2026. As of now, I can guarantee that the focus of Bruno is completely on Man Utd. Bruno wants to do his best for Man Utd.",
      "“Then there is the World Cup with Portugal as well. But in terms of club football, Bruno only wants to focus on United. He is not planning any transfer. It’s from Saudi that they are still very interested in Bruno, but it’s not Bruno entertaining talks or opening discussions already for 2026.”",
      "Man United head coach Ruben Amorim says Bruno Fernandes is “impossible to replace” but he has to find a way against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes is likely to miss the Red Devils’ next six matches, according to reports, after picking up an injury against Aston Villa.",

      "Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes is going to be out for “a while” after he came off injured in their 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has predicted that Bruno Fernandes will be out of action for “a while” after being forced off against Aston Villa.",

      "Former Man Utd flops Juan Sebastian Veron, Eric Djemba-Djemba, Angel di Maria, Diego Forlan and others will go down as some of the worst deals in the clubs history – but Scholes reckons Bosnich is up there due to his “unprofessional” nature.",
      "When suggested that Veron was the Red Devils’ worst-ever signing, Scholes replied on The Overlap: “Veron was a great player, a talented player. Don’t really know why it didn’t work for him but what a footballer.",

      "“In shooting practice, you normally have like 15, 20 shots. After three shots, he’s knackered, ‘oh no, get someone else in’.",
      "“I never realised, he couldn’t kick a football. I’ve never seen anything like it. We played Everton away in first game of the season, and none of us picked up on it, he couldn’t reach the halfway line.",
      "“There was no wind, it was a perfect day. But when you look at his feet, size 14s, honestly he was just kicking the floor all the time, big flippers. Honestly, it was disappointing.”",
      "In Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography in 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson also branded Bosnich – who came through the youth ranks at Man Utd – “a terrible professional”.",
      "On Bosnich, who played 38 times in two spells for Man Utd, Ferguson said: “Mark Bosnich was, in my opinion, a terrible professional, which we should have known.",
      "“The Bosnich buy stemmed from Peter Schmeichel announcing in the autumn of his final season that he would be retiring, which caught us on the hop. We jumped into decisions.",
      "“We met Bosnich in January, despite reports filtering through to us about his conduct off the pitch. I sent someone down to watch him in training. He was doing nothing in the sessions that convinced me he was the right man for Manchester United.",
      "“I changed tack and went for Edwin van der Sar instead, spoke to his agent and then to Martin Edwards, who told me, ‘Alex, I’m sorry, I’ve shaken hands with Bosnich.’ That was a blow. Martin had shaken Mark’s hand and would not go back on his word, which I respect. But it was a bad piece of business.”",
      "When asked about Ferguson’s comments about him, the former Man Utd goalkeeper told FourFourTwo: “It wasn’t unfair – it was just a lie.",
      "“He’s always said that he doesn’t bear any grudges, but obviously he does. But he can say that because he knows what happened afterwards, with the drugs and so on – he’s got good evidence to back himself up. At that time, though, it was a lie.",

      "As a Christmas treat we always like to revisit our pre-season predictions to get a sneak peek at who is on the way to looking utterly clueless.",
      "The full pre-season predictions are here if you want to have a proper laugh, or we will pick out the highlights…",
      "Starting – as is traditional – with the Premier League champions, this was bold from the boss (me): ‘Not Arsenal. Not having that.’ So guess who is very, very invested in the Gunners f***ing this up as they traditionally do from being top at Christmas.",
      "Dave Tickner was the only F365-er who actually tipped Arsenal, while Matt Stead and Ian Watson also plumped for Manchester City. The rest are already out of the race by tipping Liverpool and Chelsea; this was back in the days when we were dreaming of a four-horse title race.",
      "The top four, which nobody ever gets right? Every single one of us went for a combination of last season’s top four, with Lewis Oldham adding to his Liverpool title prediction with this beauty: ‘Chelsea. Arsenal. Manchester City. Not sold on City as title challengers yet. Arsenal third in the battle for first as real deal Chelsea (26/27 will be their year) to edge out their rivals to second and potentially seal Arteta sack.’",
      "Nobody saw Aston Villa coming.",
      "Let’s get relegation out of the way. Some of us absolutely f***ed it on Sunderland but Joe Williams, Jason Soutar and Lewis Oldham saw the Black Cats surprise coming. There were far too many Brentford shouts, but John Nicholson, Williams and Soutar nailed it on Wolves. Williams may yet still entirely nail it with Wolves, Burnley and Leeds, but that’s expecting a lot of West Ham.",
      "The pleasant surprise of the season? There was a weird volume of excitement about Everton, but points go again to Williams for his Sunderland shout. It looked ridiculous at the time. What looks ridiculous now is Stead: ‘It has been an absolute delight to laugh at them all summer but Newcastle will rise from the cuck chair and excel on the pitch, if not the boardroom, with another top-five finish.’",
      "Also ridiculous was Watson dreaming that Manchester United would sign a ‘midfielder with legs’. He is still waiting.",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot? ‘This is dull but Erling Haaland. I can’t see Mo Salah coming even vaguely close,’ said Winterburn (me, this is weird). Taking that all day.",
      "We’re still not sure if Johnny was being serious with his Liam Delap call, while Watson bought into the Viktor Gyokeres hype. But once again, we return to Stead: ‘Alexander Isak stays, quickly realises it might not be the best idea to entirely starve oneself of competitive football in a World Cup year and has his Luis Suarez season before getting that move.’",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? There were big shouts for Gyokeres and Joao Pedro, while Will Ford had an inkling for Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall at Everton. I did say we were oddly excited about Everton. What’s the actual answer so far? Probably Granit Xhaka or Robin Roefs.",
      "As for the massive flop…I was likely wrong on Hugo Ekitike, but Stead was right on the assorted Chelsea rejects. Williams might have nailed it again as he described Benjamin Sesko as ‘wildly overpriced’ while Tickner might be oddly prescient in suggesting that Gyokeres, Sesko and Ekitike would all struggle to reach double figures.",
      "There were calls for Bryan Mbeumo, Rayan Cherki and Noni Madueke that could be a little wide of the mark, but Ford might have smashed it with Gyokeres. The predictions were written before the Alexander Isak signing so Floppy McFlopface did not get a mention.",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? ‘Rayan Cherki feels like a steal at £34m…or a third of a Grealish,’ might be my finest hour. Stead’s Jhon Arias call might not be his, while the least said the better about mentions of Angus Gunn and Kyle Walker-Peters.",
      "PFA Player of the Year will not be Rodri, Cole Palmer or Florian Wirtz. It might be Declan Rice, though. The Spurs fan among us what the only true believer in Arsenal.",
      "The first Premier League manager to be sacked was Nuno Espirito Santo. Once again, we give you Tickner. He confidently wrote: ‘Mr Marinakis is on one right now, positively aglow with main character energy, and the off-field shenanigans cannot mask that Forest ended last season in pretty ropey fashion. And have been honking in pre-season. They only managed eight points from their final nine Premier League games last season – and it wasn’t that tough a run-in either. Start this season anything like the way they ended the last with Marinakis in his current mood to move fast and break things, and Nuno is very quickly in very big trouble.’ No notes.",
      "We always end with ‘in five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season’.",
      "I stand by mine: ‘A proper f***ing title race.’"

      "Arsenal sit top of the table at Christmas for the fifth time in the Premier League era; they have never won the title from this position!",
      "Only Liverpool have been top of the Premier League at Christmas more times and failed to get over the line.",
      "They join Manchester United (twice), Newcastle (twice), Norwich, Aston Villa and Leeds United in knowing the pain of getting over-excited over the turkey only to end the season empty handed, and some of those collapses have been rather spectacular.",
      "Here’s 10 of the worst from the past 33 years, including a handful of particularly notable ones from the lower leagues.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester United – 2003/04 (Premier League)\nUnited at least had the excuse of going up against Arsenal’s Invincibles, but the depth of United’s post-Christmas drop-off was surprising for a Sir Alex Ferguson side nonetheless.",
      "They had lost just three times before Christmas, with a goalless draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford the only time they had shared the spoils, putting them a point ahead of Arsenal and Chelsea on Christmas Day.",
      "But United dropped points more often than they won them from there: their post-Christmas record was W10, D5, L6, with a 4-1 defeat to away to struggling Manchester City particularly painful, especially as it left Fergie’s side with just two wins in eight games. United ended up finishing third, 15 points adrift of unbeaten Arsenal.",
      "",
      "9) Norwich City – 1992/93 (Premier League)\nTitle-less Norwich had also been top on Christmas Day 1988, only to end up finishing third behind Arsenal and Liverpool. Well, this time it was going to be different! Except, erm, no, it wasn’t.",
      "The Canaries learned nothing from the warning they had provided themselves on their previous trip to the coal mine, and in fact their collapse began just before Christmas: they didn’t win any of their six games between their loss at Old Trafford on 12th December and their 1-1 draw at home to Coventry on 16th January.",
      "Mike Walker’s side remained in indifferent mid-table form for the rest of the campaign, bizarrely alternating between impressive victories and crushing high-scoring defeats. Norwich ended up finishing 12 points behind Manchester United in third – and, very weirdly, with a negative goal difference to boot.",
      "",
      "8) Leeds United – 1999/00 (Premier League)\nLeeds were two points clear at top for the last Christmas of the 20th century (yeah, yeah, shut up, ‘the millennium was actually 2001′ pedants, nobody likes you) partly because they had a game in hand over Manchester United, but again , it’s the sheer depths they sank to from there that makes it notable.",
      "After shrugging off early-season defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool, David O’Leary’s Leeds had been almost unstoppable. Only Everton and Wimbledon succeeded in getting anything off them in an impressive run up to and including Boxing Day, with Michael Bridges and Harry Kewell particular stars.",
      "But things immediately nosedived after that: Leeds lost four of their next six, including six-pointers against fellow title hopefuls Man United, Arsenal and Liverpool. Three straight wins in March briefly revived Leeds’ hopes of pushing Ferguson’s men all the way – they had just four points to make up in their last nine games – but they promptly lost four in a row to put themselves dead in the water and ended up third, some 22 points off the pace.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds United – 2018/19 (Championship)\nAnd what a lovely way to segue to the EFL section of our list. It was Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds this time, and again they were one point clear at the top of the second tier on Christmas Day with exactly half the season’s games played. More importantly for their automatic promotion prospects, they were six ahead of third-placed West Brom.",
      "We’re going to resist the temptation to put their decline down to the infamous spygate incident, not least because Leeds actually lost both their last game of 2018 at home to bottom-half Hull and their New Year’s Day fixture away to Nottingham Forest. Yet despite looking far more fragile and, frankly, knackered than in the first half of the season, Leeds remained in the top two. With just four games to go Bielsa’s side were still in second place, three points clear of third-placed Sheffield United.",
      "Their fixture list was extremely inviting, too: encounters against 21st-placed Wigan, 15th-placed Brentford, fifth-placed Aston Villa, and rock-bottom Ipswich. They got a decent point against Villa, but contrived to lose the other three. That meant Leeds finished six points away from automatic promotion; narrative dictated they must then lose to Derby in the play-off semi finals.",
      "",
      "6) Portsmouth – 2020/21 (League One)\nThat season behind closed doors is one we’d all collective like to forget, but nobody more so than Portsmouth. They led an extremely tight third-tier table on Christmas Day on goal difference and having played a game more than second-placed Lincoln City, but their credentials were supported by Pompey having the best record in the division in both the goals for and goals against columns.",
      "But an abysmal run that started with a four-goal defeat at home to Hull in late January saw Portsmouth plummet to 10th by March, costing manager Kenny Jackett his job.",
      "Hopes of a reviving the season just enough to claim a play-off spot were briefly awakened as new appointment Danny Cowley led Pompey to four wins right off the bat, but they won just two more of their remaining eight games and ended up in eighth place, two points shy of the top six.",
      "",
      "5) Huddersfield Town – 1999/00 (Championship, as it wasn’t called then)\nEnglish football’s first three-in-a-row champions had spent 27 years outside the top flight by the time they sat top of the tree for Christmas 1999, thanks in no small part to Marcus Stewart’s superb form in front of goal.",
      "Steve Bruce’s Terriers won just one game in January and February, however, and compounded their slide to fifth place by unexpectedly selling Stewart to fourth-placed Ipswich Town on 1st February.",
      "Stewart would, naturally, score the winner against Huddersfield less than two weeks later, then help fire the Tractor Boys to promotion via the play-offs; Huddersfield weren’t even involved, having finished the season in eighth place. Stewart scored 19 Premier League goals the following season as Ipswich finished a brilliant fifth; Huddersfield were meanwhile relegated to the third tier. So that worked out well.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool – 1996/97 (Premier League)\nAlright then, back to the Premier League from here, we reckon. And again we return to the 1990s, when a lot of the time you could win titles with a points tally in the 70s. Liverpool were well on course for that by Christmas 1996, when the Spice Girls were top of the charts with 2 Become 1 and the Spice Boys were top of the Premier League. Unfortunately for them, 1 Became 4.",
      "It wasn’t any one extended run of especially awful form that did for them – they never went more than two games without a win – but more a general inability to string together a convincing run of victories: they only did so once in the second half the season, in fact, winning three in a row in January-February.",
      "A series of David James blunders was particularly costly for Roy Evans’ side, whose title hopes were effectively killed off by a 3-1 defeat at home to eventual champions Manchester United with just three games left to play. Newcastle and Arsenal snuck in ahead of the Reds on goal difference on the final day, to boot, leaving Liverpool to finish fourth in a two-horse race.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa – 1998/99 (Premier League)\nIt’s always remarkable to look back on Manchester United’s treble-winning season and remember just how easily they could have ended up completely empty-handed. Case in point: it was John Gregory’s Aston Villa, not United, who sat top of the table on Christmas Day that season.",
      "It didn’t last long: Villa were displaced by a defeat away to Blackburn Rovers on Boxing Day, returned very briefly by beating Sheffield Wednesday, then never reclaimed top spot as they embarked on a genuinely miserable second half of the season as Dion Dublin and Julian Joachim’s brilliant goalscoring form dried up.",
      "Villa took just 12 points from their final 16 games of the season, with their only three wins in that run all coming in a vain and far-belated burst of late-season form. They were already down to sixth by that point, and three straight losses to finish the season ensured that was where they finished.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – 2013/14 (Premier League)\nAh, god, do we really need to recap this one? It takes such a high position not because Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool were miles ahead at Christmas, because they weren’t: they were only top on goal difference and just two points ahead of fifth-placed Everton.",
      "Nor is it because Liverpool were notably awful in the second half of the campaign: they were the joint-second best team in the division from Boxing Day onwards, too, dropping just four points between between game 20 on New Year’s Day and game 35 in mid-April.",
      "But come on. You can’t make any list of title capitulations without including Liverpool 2013/14. This does not slip (which he did). Another Istanbul (which they were on the receiving end of from Crystal Palace). Comedy gold.",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United – 1995/96 (Premier League)\nA brilliant failure that may never be topped. Ten points. Ten bloody points clear, Newcastle were. Ten points at Christmas. They’d been top of the table since beating Coventry 3-0 on the opening day and would stay there until close to the end of March. In the bag.",
      "Except that having been dodgy as owt going into Christmas, a Manchester United inspired by Eric Cantona’s return from his fan-kicky suspension were virtually flawless after opening their stockings (leave it), winning all but four of their games – starting with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle themselves.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, were very, very flawed, with Faustino Asprilla’s mid-season arrival bringing yet more flair to an already attacking side but leading Kevin Keegan to disastrously change shape to fit him in, while new midfield arrival David Batty failed to help matters.",
      "That famous 4-3 defeat at Anfield in early April was Newcastle’s fourth defeat in six games, and the upturn in their form that followed was too late: Manchester United had overtaken them, and made sure the title was sealed on points rather than goal difference by winning their final two games while Newcastle were only able to draw theirs."

But Sanchez admitted he wanted to quit United and return to Arsenal after only his first training session. Sadly for him and United, there was no return policy on the £35million swap deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan join the Gunners.",
      "Then the highest-paid player ever in the Premier League, Sanchez stuck it out for 32 league appearances, scoring three goals while barely hiding his contempt for his surroundings.",
      "In fairness to United, no one saw it going this badly wrong when he was tinkling the ivories for his unveiling video. In Sanchez, they had signed one of the Premier League’s best players. But, even by United standards, the immediate slump in the Chilean’s output once he walked through the Old Trafford door was damning on all concerned.

      "Valdes played two games for United, serving as understudy to compatriot David De Gea before p*ssing off Van Gaal to the extent he wasn’t allowed to train even with the youth team or allowed a locker for his Rolex while he worked out alone with an academy goalkeeping coach.",
      "",
      "Arriving on loan from Palace in January 2023, ex-England stopper Butland was just one of a few odd goalkeeper signings made by United, replacing another in Martin Dubravka. At least Dubravka got his gloves dirty twice. Butland never made it off the bench for the club he supported as a boy, even if he took an FA Cup runners-up medal back to Palace with him.",
      "",
      "The Netherlands international is widely derided on the basis that he failed to score a Premier League goal in his half-season at Old Trafford. Which isn’t a good look for a centre-forward.",
      "But after a loan switch from Burnley, with the Clarets splitting £3million with Besiktas, Weghorst endeared himself to the United faithful just by running around a bit and showing an appetite to be there. That’s how low the bar was for a fanbase fed up of watching Anthony Martial’s mard-arse saunter around Old Trafford.",
      "He scored two cup goals, won the Carabao Cup and generally seemed to relish his big opportunity. But, enthusiastic though he was, he was never likely to be the top-class striker Erik ten Hag needed.",
      "",
      "Ten Hag had to hurriedly spin through his Rolodex during the final days of the January 2023 transfer window as soon as it emerged that Christian Eriksen would be out for three months after bumping into Andy Carroll in a bad mood.",
      "As the first Austrian to play for United, Sabitzer scored three goals in 18 appearances and had a hand in the Carabao Cup triumph by coming off the bench in the final against Newcastle. When his loan was up, everyone concerned seemed pretty non-plussed about the prospect of making it a longer-term arrangement. He did okay but his impact was negligible.",
      "In the end, Sabitzer returned to Bayern Munich before being sold to Borussia Dortmund.",
      "",
      "United’s move for Ighalo in January 2020 sparked a new genre of transfer: an Ighalo-type move, one defined as late, desperate and short-term. See: Weghorst.",
      "In that sense, Ighalo served his purpose. Arriving from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua in January 2020, he bagged five goals in 19 appearances in the Covid season to earn a six-month extension before heading off to Al Shabab to complete the lucrative CSL-Pro League double bubble.",
      "MORE FROM F365: Liverpool, Tottenham and Newcastle among top 10 storylines we weren’t expecting in 2025",
      "The jury is still out on Dorgu but a year on from his arrival from Lecce, a verdict is surely imminent. Frankly, though, it doesn’t look encouraging. And the slim possibility that he might yet come good means he ranks higher than his performances so far merit.",
      "The Denmark international is still only 21 with less senior experience than many peers of a similar age so it was unfair to expect him to hit the ground running. But it is hard to identify many redeeming features in the left wing-back. He’s quick, sure. But can you recall him giving many opposition full-backs a hard time? There is certainly little encouragement to be found in a record of no goals and three assists in 37 appearances. Dorgu was Amorim’s first signing but wing-backs on both sides are among the areas United are still considered weakest.",
      "",
      "The spectacle of club-record signing Mata being choppered into Carrington to join United in January 2014 summed up the post-Fergie United. Or rather the post-David Gill United. The Woodward United.",
      "Not that any of that was Mata’s fault. And for much of his career at United, the former Spain playmaker was a pleasure to watch. Never more than in March 2015 at Juanfield. And the fact he’s a good egg did him no harm, even if he rarely dragged United to new heights as one might expect of a creative record signing.",
      "Mata spent seven and a half years at Old Trafford, scoring 51 goals in 285 appearances, winning four trophies. Never the big ones, but United haven’t been in a position to be sniffy about silverware.",
      "The Diallo deal was arranged in October 2020 to be completed the following January. And for a while, it looked like more money down the drain when the winger struggled to make a first-team breakthrough. A loan move to Sunderland went much better than an earlier stint at Rangers and eventually, three years after he joined, Amad began to get some regular minutes in the second half of the 2023/24 season under Ten Hag.",
      "When Ten Hag was binned, Amad was expected to be one of the players to profit from Amorim’s appointment and the sudden need for wing-backs. Indeed, were it not for an ankle injury last season, he would be in the top three players with most minutes under Amorim. Amad can play as wing-back or as one of the wide forwards. He probably prefers the latter but is needed more as the former.",
      "",
      "Quite simply the best signing of the post-Fergie era, be it the summer or winter window.",
      "Fernandes has been the single consistent bright spot on a rather bleak landscape since he arrived from Sporting Lisbon pre-Covid in 2020. Immediately dismiss the opinion of anyone who pushes the claim that Fernandes has been ‘a problem’, or indeed anything but the best, most creative signing of the last dozen years. Imagine how bad United would have been without him.",

      "Alexander Isak has *finally* broken his silence on his injury four days ago, but Liverpool need not worry because a perfect replacement has been identified.",
      "There is anger at the notion that Alexander Isak’s leg break was karma and not a lot else in the pre-Christmas Mailbox.",
      "Liverpool’s frustration at Alexander Isak’s injury is obvious and understandable, but there is no villain in this story and no justice to be served.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "Liverpool reportedly have an agreement with Marc Guehi but waiting for the Crystal Palace player could have costly ramifications."

      "“He’s been the one constant through all their troubles, the one pulling them through games at times. There’s no doubt they’ll miss him massively. He very rarely gets injured, so he’ll be a big miss.",

      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker has questioned whether the Red Devils “sent anyone to actually watch” Benjamin Sesko play before signing him.",
      "The Red Devils paid out around £74m to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig in the summer transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backed Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man Utd spent almost all of their budget on attacking players with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo also joining, while Senne Lammens and Diego Leon were the other summer arrivals.",
      "Sesko has struggled to adapt to the Premier League and playing for Man Utd, with the Slovenia international contributing two goals and one assist in 14 matches in all competitions.",
      "And Parker wonders whether Man Utd ever sent any scouts to go and watch Sesko as they are failing to play to the 22-year-old’s strengths.",
      "The former Man Utd defender exclusively told Football365 in association with gambling portal British Gambler: “You look at Benjamin Sesko and the goals he’s scored, it makes me wonder whether Manchester United sent anyone to actually watch him play. When he was at Leipzig, there were lots of balls coming into the box and those big-angle passes being hit at him from deep for him to run onto.",
      "READ: Arsenal top, Tottenham freakout, assorted flops – 10 of the 2025 storylines we DID see coming",
      "“He was scoring all kinds of goals there, and at United they’re feeding him breadcrumbs. The players behind him aren’t giving him opportunities so he’s having to do a lot of the work himself which is of course expected, you have to give a little bit back sometimes.",
      "“That was Rasmus Hojlund’s issue, too. He struggled in the Premier League because he wasn’t fed enough, but also agility-wise and quickness of feet, they were reasons he struggled, too. That’s why he’s been given the opportunity to flourish in the Serie A because the pace of that league is no where near the speed of the Premier League.”",
      "It’s unlikely that England will take many Man Utd players to the World Cup but Parker has addressed the media narrative surrounding former Old Trafford transfer target Jude Bellingham, who now stars for Real Madrid and the Three Lions.",
      "Parker added: “If you’re going on current form, Morgan Rogers should be starting ahead of Jude Bellingham for England next summer at the World Cup. When you play with England you try and make everything as close to a club’s scenario as possible.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Bruno Fernandes limp exclusive as Antoine Semenyo decision YESTERDAY",
      "“The issue is that the media have been so pivotal in driving Bellingham’s narrative. The media have been pushing Bellingham since the Euros to make it all about him. When you look at Rogers, he’s that one player in the team who’s allowed to go wherever he wants, he often comes in from the left-hand side to score goals.",
      "“I love what Rogers is doing for Villa but also what Eberechi Eze did for Crystal Palace when he played a similar role. Eze was outstanding at that time and I think he was the best in the Premier League in that position last season.",
      "“I think that freedom has been taken away from him by Mikel Arteta since going to Arsenal. They bought him for what he was delivering and then when they got him, they’ve tried to get him to do something different. It doesn’t make sense for that kind of money.",
      "“Cole Palmer is another vying for that role and he’s good in the big games. He’s proven that for club and country already. It’s about him getting the games back under his belt after his injury, but for me he’s the most standout player. He plays off the cuff, not that Rogers and Eze don’t, but Palmer stands out the most, the issue is there that he’s got a manager who’s still trying to school him.”",

      "Sure, they did manage to win it in the Spursiest way imaginable, stumbling over the line in a historically poor final against a historically poor Man United side and having completely abandoned all pretence at participating in multiple competitions to the extent that they finished 17th in the league.",
      "But that’s all irrelevant: they won a trophy. We can’t all be sat here telling them for years and years and years that they needed to stop f*cking about and win a trophy and then go ‘No, not like that’ when they actually do it. Fair’s fair.",
      "So yes, we were surprised by that. We have been surprised by absolutely nothing they have done since, though. An even halfway-sensible club of Tottenham’s size would have recognised the enormous potential of the launchpad it provided. A real chance to be the start of something.",

As small-time as Nuno; as defensively naïve as Postecoglou; as attackingly bereft as Mourinho; as full of undisguised loathing for the club and its fans as Conte.",
      "They’ve got two sporting directors, one of whom is about to sack it all off just a few months after returning because Fiorentina – hardly a superclub – are making eyes at him. Nobody knows what the plan is. Nobody knows who to pin it on now it’s all going wrong, if indeed it is actually going wrong, which nobody knows for sure because of the aforementioned lack of plan.",

They don’t seem to know what to do about the failing manager, or just as importantly who should do it, or, again, if it actually needs doing. What does success or failure here even look like now?",

We are but a tiny little David attempting to compete with veritable Goliaths, our only weapon a tiny catapult costing hundreds of millions of dollars and fashioned only from the most basic raw materials of loads of brilliant footballers, some eight-year contracts and clubs around the world where we can park them for a bit with no regard for either player or that club as long as it keeps the tills ringing at HQ.”",

He was only able to sacrifice the league campaign because it had already gone really badly wrong before the Europa League got down to brass tacks, and because there were three teams sufficiently abysmal that Spurs had the luxury of calling time on their league campaign after a trio of wins in February took them to the dizzy heights of 33 points from 26 games.",
      "Point here being: that’s still crap. In any normal season, that is not entirely-out-of-the-woods safe. The fact it’s very possibly more points than Spurs will have after 26 games of this season is simply funny, but doesn’t really help Postecoglou.",

Certainly not until January, and only then for a decent fee with plenty of time to source a replacement. The forward’s importance is evident in the fact that as soon as his fine form dipped, Bournemouth went winless.

      "A triple substitution is generally damning enough for the team concerned, but the lesser-spotted quadruple change is effectively the manager ripping to shreds his own plan and his players’ performances. Which was Fabian Hurzerler’s intention when four numbers went up around the hour mark when Brighton were losing and toiling against Manchester City on the last day of August.",
      "James Milner, Yasin Ayari, Georginio Rutter and Brajan Gruda entered the play and while Brighton’s shape remained roughly the same, they suddenly became much more troublesome for City, who went from dealing easily with their hosts’ direct approach to creaking underneath it. Milner levelled shortly after coming on before Gruda won it late on for Brighton’s only win in their first five.",

      "If Leeds stay up this season, most likely they will look at half-time during a defeat to Manchester City as their turning point. When 2-0 down at the break, Daniel Farke ditched the 4-3-3 and moved to a 3-5-2. It reaped immediate dividends. They hauled back their deficit, terrifying City in the process, and were unlucky to lose in added time. But that second half was enough to make Leeds fans feel that Farke might be on to something.",

Liverpool might say ‘yes’ but we bloody doubt it.

      "City have hardly embraced Route One in 2025 but they have at least kept up with the trend for playing direct, finding ways to profit in possession while future-proofing themselves at the back, most obviously with the move for a big goalkeeper who was a long way from the archetypal Guardiola goalie.",

Buying two exciting forwards; ridding themselves of a goalkeeping clown; keeping Bruno Fernandes, even if that decision came from the player rather than the club, have allowed United to make some progress on the pitch. And however long he lasts, Ruben Amorim can claim to have improved the culture around Carrington by binning the bomb squad featuring three, maybe four energy drains. Wherever Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony go, and however they perform, Amorim was absolutely right to stick to his guns in exiling the self-serving foursome.",

      "After going 17 games without a win against Liverpool, a run that lasted just shy of a decade, Newcastle decided to stop showing the table-topping Reds too much respect when they met in the Carabao Cup final. Eddie Howe’s tactic against a side then 12 points clear was usually to sit back and frustrate but, at Wembley, the Magpies got into ’em. The front three pressed and the midfield squeezed the life out of Liverpool, providing the platform for their first silverware in 55 years.",

      "\"It's impossible to replace Bruno,\" the head coach said in his pre-match press conference. \"But I said that this morning to the team, we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing on that, and a lot of people need to step up.",

      "Wednesday 24 December 2025 14:36, UK",
      "For the first time since he joined in 2020, Manchester United face the prospect of losing the talismanic Bruno Fernandes through injury for a sustained period of time.",
      "Fernandes was replaced at half-time during the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa after suddenly pulling up late in the first-half. United boss Ruben Amorim clarified after the game that his captain had suffered soft tissue damage and that he would miss 'some games.'",
      "It's a bitter blow for the Red Devils ahead of a busy period that could define their season. Every statistic under the sun shows just how valuable the 31-year-old is at Old Trafford.",
      "Most, if not all Manchester United fans will be thinking that this is the opportunity for Kobbie Mainoo to prove his worth to Ruben Amorim.",
      "From scoring the winning goal in the 2024 FA Cup final and representing England at that year's European Championships, the midfielder finds himself without a Premier League start this season.",
      "It has led to speculation that he could depart the Theatre of Dreams, on loan or permanently, as frustration over game time grows.",
      "Unexpectedly, the door has now opened. With Fernandes out, there is no chance Amorim lets Mainoo go in January. And having insisted that the club captain is who the academy graduate is competing with for a place in the team, it seems only logical that he will finally be handed his opportunity.",
      "That won't be against Newcastle though, as Amorim confirmed he will likely miss out with a calf injury that also saw him left out of the squad against Villa. He'll be hoping one of the other alternative options doesn't lay claim to the spot before he even has a chance to.Callum Bishop",
      "Mason Mount has started Manchester United's last three Premier League games. Into his third season as a United player, this is only the second time that he has been on such a run, previously starting four in a row at the back end of last season.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's absence has opened up a slot for him tucked in off the right but Mount has had plenty of Premier League minutes in a deeper role and could prove a good foil alongside the far less mobile Casemiro. He would appear an able deputy for Fernandes.",
      "Of course, shifting him from the forward line, particularly with Mbeumo and Amad Diallo away, would only present Amorim with another challenge and it may be that Mount's pressing higher up the pitch is deemed a more important asset to the United coach.Adam Bate",
      "\"In the first half they were by far the better team and surprisingly, I thought with Martinez in midfield in the second half, they were the equal of [Aston] Villa as a minimum.\"",
      "Those were Gary Neville's words as Lisandro Martinez was brought on at the break to replace the injured Fernandes at Villa Park.",
      "Martinez is primarily a centre-back, but has shown he can step into midfield when required. The Argentine is not unfamiliar with that position. During his time at Ajax, he was at times utilised in the middle of the park.",
      "In his 22 games as a stereotypical number six, he averaged close to 66 passes per 90 minutes with an accuracy above 86 per cent, ranked highly for final-third passes among others in those games, and still contributed defensively with solid numbers for tackles, interceptions and possessions won in the middle third.",
      "Martinez would not offer the same creativity as Fernandes, but his ability to recycle possession, read the game and maintain structure could provide a different type of balance in midfield. With fixtures coming thick and fast, his versatility gives Amorim another internal option to consider while United’s captain remains unavailable.Sam Cohen",
      "With Casemiro suspended against Aston Villa, it was left to Manuel Ugarte to try and slot in next to Fernandes, though he did little to rubber stamp his credentials.",
      "Ugarte once again failed to impress. He was lacklustre with and without the ball - he didn’t create any big chances or manage a single shot on target, whilst also losing the most aerial duels of any player in the game.",
      "Defeat on Sunday means that the Uruguayan has lost all seven of his last seven starts. To boot, an eighth loss in nine marks the longest run without a Premier League victory for a starting Man Utd player for over two decades. Only Kleberson, between January 2004 and May 2005, managed a longer winless run in a red shirt.",
      "Ugarte’s hefty £50.7m price tag has come into question frequently during his tenure in Manchester, especially given the recent success of his predecessor, Scott McTominay. The Scotsman was allowed to leave United for £26m - only half of the outlay for Ugarte.",
      "Just this weekend, McTominay won the Italian Supercoppa, his second piece of silverware since moving to Italy, off the back of being named Serie A Player of the Year last month.",
      "He likely would’ve been an ideal solution. But the man who essentially took his place in the squad has done little to silence the doubters.Noah Langford",
      "There was something noticably different about the way United set up against Aston Villa. As opposed to leading with a pressing front three and double pivot behind, Amorim opted to defensively lead with a front two and a triangle three propping up behind, including Fernandes, Mount and Ugarte.",
      "Assuming Casemiro would return in place of the latter, this could be something Amorim turns to more often. Mount or Mainoo could slot into the Fernandes role, with the other remaining further up the pitch.",
      "Should Bryan Mbeumo return from AFCON before Fernandes is fit to return, perhaps he links up with Matheus Cunha up top while Benjamin Sesko takes up an impact substitute role as he continues his adaptation to the Premier League.",
      "This would still give Mount the chance to take up an important position in the team given his growing influence on the side of late.Callum Bishop",
      "We'd be remissed not to touch upon the fact that there could be a surprise inclusion for one of United's youngsters to step into the team with Fernandes out.",
      "Jack Fletcher, son of former Red Devil and current lead coach of the club's under-18s side Darren, made his senior debut off the bench at Villa Park and has been touted as a potential star of the future. His twin brother, Tyler, also plays as a midfielder and may see a chance for himself.",
      "Eighteen-year-old Jim Thwaites has also been earning praise for his development, while Sekou Kone has had experienced training with the first-team before. Although, recent fitness struggles may set back any hopes he has of a sniff.",
      "Amorim has not long spoken about the entitlement of some of his youngsters, but now he may have to rely on them more than previously.Callum Bishop",

      "It was whatever you need to do, however it's going to look for you, it can look like that and I'm so appreciative for that because like I said there was no pressure on getting back in or having to meet this date or this time, it was whatever you feel like and even if you come back in and you're not feeling great, dip back out if you need to.",
      "I haven't because I love my job, it's a job at the end of the day but it's what you've worked so hard for being a young kid that you can make this your work and I love playing football. And obviously at the minute, you know, I'm injured and that and it is difficult but then it's looking at other ways you can spend your time and positive distractions.",
      "To be honest I've picked up the DJing, so I'm just giving that a go now but yeah because I can't play padel and stuff (because of his injury).",
      "You look at things with a bit of a different perspective on life…football isn't my whole identity as much as you love it so much, it's kind of broadening those horizons and trying to trying to fulfil your life in other ways where I'm not just reliant on if I'm fit and not injured because then, when I do get injured, mentally you can take a bit of a dip because you're so caught up on needing to get back. And so, just broadening those horizons is what I've been trying to do, to be honest.",
      "Hopefully I'll get back from the injury I've got and get out on loan in January.",
      "But I think the thing for me it's about going forward… there's always going to be a piece of you missing. Anybody who's gone through this will know there'll always be a piece of you missing but you learn to just carry on because you have to.",
      "What I'm saying is just because six months have passed, we're still going to talk about our feelings and not act like that's done and that's behind us. There's never any time limit on it.",
      "Rhys Bennett was speaking while supporting the Premier League's Together Against Suicide campaign.",

      "Manchester United, Manchester City or Liverpool? The race for Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo is on a knife edge.",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are still ahead of other clubs and remain neck-and-neck for his signature.",
      "But Liverpool remain interested and are understood to be considering their options in the wake of Alexander Isak's injury.",
      "Spurs, who were interested in the Bournemouth forward over the summer and earlier this season, are moving onto other targets and out of the race.",
      "\"If Liverpool come in for him, he'll go to Liverpool. Liverpool is too good a move to turn down. They have been big admirers of him. They have looked at signing him before.",
      "\"They also have a track record of signing players in January. Luis Diaz looked like he was going to Tottenham and at the last minute Liverpool came in for him. Cody Gakpo looked like he was going to Manchester United.",
      "\"Liverpool don't get involved in a bidding war. They wait until the last minute, until other clubs almost do a deal for a player and then they make a phone call to say they will match the deal.",
      "\"Liverpool are expected to have a quiet January. There is money to spend. Sometimes they move quickly to get a summer target in if they think they are going to go somewhere else.",
      "\"Over the next few days, especially in light of Isak's injury, there will be discussions over whether they make a late move for Semenyo.\"",
      "Kaveh Solhekol:",
      "\"If I'm Antoine Semenyo. I'm looking at that Man City squad and thinking, dream come true to sign for Man City. On the other hand, how much game time am I going to get if I move there?",
      "\"I'm not really sure there is a desperate need for them to spend money in January.",
      "\"Another interesting subplot is Pep Guardiola's future. He signed a new contract that takes him to the summer of 2027, but there is talks already that he might call it a day this summer.",
      "\"What impact could that have on Manchester City's transfer plans? As much as we say clubs buy players, Guardiola has been there for so long that he will have a say in which players come to the club.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has consistently said that the club will make moves in the January transfer window provided it is in the long-term interest of Manchester United.",
      "\"They have kept a keen eye on Semenyo's development. That interest goes further back than the summer transfer window.",
      "\"Semenyo signed a new contract in the summer that included a release clause of £65m. That release clause is only valid in the first half of January. That's because if someone triggers the release clause, Bournemouth want time to find a replacement.",
      "\"There is then a lower release clause in the summer transfer window. Expect some sort of movement in the first half of this transfer window.",
      "\"The interesting thing with Semenyo is if United were to sign him, where Amorim would want to play him.",
      "\"Is he going to take over from either of Cunha or Mbeumo? It's very unlikely. Is it the left-wing back position that Amorim has cited Semenyo? And would Semenyo be happy playing in that position?\"",
      "\"One thing for certain now, Mo Salah will be staying at the club. There's a good chance Harvey Elliott would come back from Aston Villa as well.",
      "\"Whether Liverpool go for a striker or another attacking player like Semenyo, who Liverpool have been heavily linked with as well, we all know he's got a buyout clause in January.",
      "\"Then you've got wide players, as in Salah and Gakpo, who've played a lot of games through the middle as well. You've got young Jayden Danns.",
      "\"That's the way they could go around it because I don't think Liverpool, when you go back a few years when they had a real problem at centre-back, they didn't go and spend big money on someone they didn't want.",
      "\"They won't go out and buy a striker who they don't really want. If they do want Semenyo, that's probably a good way around it.\"",
      "Liverpool - there are two sides to this particular route: short-term and long-term.",
      "Semenyo would be an excellent addition for Liverpool right now, with injuries to Isak and Gakpo - plus Salah's departure to AFCON - leaving Arne Slot's side short in attack for the coming weeks.",
      "That's the short-term, but the long-term vision of Semenyo at Anfield is more complicated. Should Salah leave, then Semenyo could be deemed the natural heir to the Egyptian's role at Anfield.",
      "But what happens if Salah and Slot put their issues aside and the former returns to form? Then once Gakpo and Isak return from injury, where would Semenyo fit in with Hugo Ekitike as well?",
      "Man City - this would be another interesting question regarding squad competition. With everyone fit, would Semenyo get into Man City team right now?",
      "Guardiola has finally managed to settle his squad with Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku acting as the perfect trio behind Erling Haaland.",
      "However, there is a argument that squad depth is still an issue. The recent 2-0 loss to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League showed how the floor of City's squad could do with a lift - and Semenyo could help that.",
      "Man Utd - Amorim spent around £200m on bringing in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha over the summer, and now he wants to add more attacking quality to his ranks?",
      "Perhaps a potential January departure for Joshua Zirkzee could open up a spot in the United squad for Semenyo to fill?",
      "One area Semenyo could play is at wing-back, especially with his qualities out wide. But could he play there with Amad Diallo on the other flank? Would that be too attacking?",
      "Bournemouth - Another possibility for Semenyo could be to stay at the Vitality Stadium until the end of the season, especially if his desired team stalls this month.",
      "But the Cherries are a long way off being the European contenders they were last season. With Andoni Iraola's future never certain and Bournemouth's form needing to pick up, there are a few dominoes needing to fall at the south coast.",

      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title. A number of players are still to return from injury, including Gabriel and Kai Havertz.",
      "Mikel Arteta has always said they will keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal are always looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less than convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliot's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Antoine Semenyo's future will dominate at least the first part of Bournemouth's window and is something that could be concluded quickly. His £65m release clause is straightforward but not active for the entire window, in part to protect Bournemouth from being left short of a replacement on February 1.",
      "They want to bring in a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone given Semenyo almost left in the summer. Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, goalkeeper is a position Bournemouth are looking to recruit in again to find someone that can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez Liverpool. There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Spurs and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing the player in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Captain Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer - but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Man City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON. They are considering an approach for Tottenham's Brennan Johnson, while Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis was a target in the summer.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right wing-back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Marco Silva did not hide his frustrations about the lack of depth in Fulham's squad after Newcastle knocked them out of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, and he will be hoping to address those problems in the January transfer window.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen after a difficult first half of the season.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds United are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Farke has switched to a 3-5-2, but wants his team to be flexible, as shown when he reverted to a back four mid-game against Liverpool and Brentford - a tweak that helped Leeds come from behind to draw in both games - so their plans are not shaped around one formation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlwo, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window even after spending £200m+ net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah firmly put his future on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad - but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Manchester City have emerged as the frontrunners in the race for Antoine Semenyo in January but both Liverpool and Manchester United remain interested.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting on, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United are another club interested in Antoine Semenyo but look set to miss out to rivals Manchester City. The biggest aspect of the decision for United is with £65m potentially hitting the summer kitty without significant sales.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires the club to be careful but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "At the time of writing, Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are out injured and if they lose anyone else then Newcastle will be in big bother. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo was of long-term interest but Spurs ended their pursuit of the Ghana forward. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "Spurs could also look to sign a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for players such as Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Johnson, scorer of the winning goal in last season's Europa League final, is of interest to Crystal Palace. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season. Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",
      "The window opens on Thursday January 1, 2026 and closes on Monday February 2, 2026.",

      "Gary Neville on Ruben Amorim's change in Man Utd approach: \"I'm happy he's adapting... he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton. That would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job\"",
      "Monday 22 December 2025 06:11, UK",
      "Gary Neville feels Ruben Amorim has given himself a blueprint to move forward after a notable change in style this week - but Roy Keane remains unimpressed with \"one of the worst teams in the league\" without the ball.",
      "For the first time in his tenure, Amorim has visibly moved away from the rigid 3-4-2-1 formation he had previously stuck with both at Old Trafford and across his managerial career, displaying a level of flexibility which had previously become a bone of contention for Manchester United supporters.",
      "After deploying a hybrid back four in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth, United put on another improved display despite losing 2-1 to in-form Aston Villa at Villa Park and deserved more than they got for the second game in succession.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: \"I thought it was a really good performance, but the details of the two goals have cost them.",
      "\"Now that's going to continue to happen whilst they don't have the likes of Harry Maguire and Matthijs De Ligt, and they don't have players that would make them a lot stronger.",
      "\"What I have seen in these last two games is a couple of things. One, the manager has changed. Quite obviously, the system that he said he would never change, the five or the three [at the back], the two in midfield, the two wing backs and the three up front, that has been thrown out of the window in the last two matches. That's a good thing.",
      "\"I'm happy that the manager is adapting to what's happening out there because of what's happening with AFCON, but also I think there's an element where he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton at home.",
      "\"More of that would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job, and will allow him to build something, because you can build off what you've seen here.",
      "\"Manchester United can still finish in the top five and they've missed three or four opportunities in the last three weeks to do that, but if they can get those players back from AFCON and they can stay fit, they can do something.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has got to approach it the way in which he has in the last five or six days. The system has been tweaked - more than tweaked - and I think with [Mason] Mount, [Matheus] Cunha, [Bruno] Fernandes, [Bejamin] Sesko, [Bryan] Mbeumo and Amad [Diallo] out there on the pitch, not all of them but probably four or five of them, they will cause a lot of teams a lot of problems.\"",
      "Keane was similarly impressed with Man Utd's attacking output, with Amorim's side only outscored by Manchester City this season, but felt that was little excuse for the ease with which they were cut apart for both of Morgan Rogers' fine strikes in their latest defeat - their fifth from 17 league games.",
      "Leny Yoro was singled out for criticism for a lack of intensity in closing down Rogers when he first received the ball before cutting inside and netting a stunning opener, while Keane was just as frustrated by Diogo Dalot's attempts to block a cross leading up to his second.",
      "\"You can have all the talent in the world, but you have to roll your sleeves up and when the game gets a bit tight you say you're going to do your bit for the team,\" he said on Super Sunday. \"This isn't a tricky winger, it's just a little shimmy. He's like yeah, have a cross. This ends up being the winning goal.",
      "\"It's not like someone's done a brilliant trick or run at him with real pace. You get down low, you get your body in position. You say if you're going to get a cross in, you're going to have to do remarkably well.",
      "\"There are too many players who don't do enough. Not just Dalot. In the last two games Man Utd have conceded six goals. What chance have you got? Newcastle are coming up in a few days, they'll come to Old Trafford and enjoy it, they'll have runners.",
      "\"These are the ugly bits of football. We know you've got the other bits, but you've got to do the ugly bits. That's what all the top teams do.",
      "\"But you can also dig deep, you can win playing ugly. You have to find a way to do that.",
      "\"Out of possession they're one of the worst teams in the league. With the ball they're good, but if you want to be a top footballer, it's about what you do out of possession.",
      "\"Man Utd cut corners, take too many risks and I'm glad they get punished. I like to see teams getting punished who take chances and let their team-mates and fans down.\"",
