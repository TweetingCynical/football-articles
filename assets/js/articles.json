      "Michael Carrick has implemented several changes already at Manchester United(Image: Mike Egerton/PA Wire)",
      "Michael Carrick's Manchester United revolution has seen him transform the club both on and off the pitch after just three weeks at the helm. The legendary former United midfielder was appointed as interim head coach until the end of the season in January.",
      "He replaced the recently sacked Ruben Amorim, whose miserable 14-month spell in Manchester ended seemingly following disputes with the club hierarchy over tactics and transfer business.",
      "Since taking charge, the 44-year-old has secured three wins from three fixtures, restoring hope at United and delivering football that reflects the club's 'DNA'. A convincing 2-0 win in the Manchester Derby was followed by a 3-2 victory away at league leaders Arsenal, before securing a late winner against Fulham last weekend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Both Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag required players who featured in games to attend the training ground the following day for recovery work. Carrick has scrapped this rule, instead granting designated rest days within 24 hours of a fixture. Recovery sessions have now been rescheduled to take place two days after the final whistle.",
      "Amorim enforced a rigid 3-4-3 system and was unwilling to stray from his approach, despite his squad being better equipped for a more conventional formation. That meant dropping certain players, including academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, from the first team.",
      "However, a crucial element of Carrick's transformation has been scrapping the 3-4-3 shape and reverting to a more traditional United-style 4-2-3-1 with fast-paced wing play. He has also brought fan favourite Mainoo back into the starting eleven.",
      "Training was very different under Ruben Amorim(Image: Crystal Pix/MB Media, Getty Images)",
      "Amorim prohibited food from being taken into the dressing room after emphasising the need to improve player fitness standards, potentially affecting team morale in doing so. Carrick is understood to be scrapping that policy by transforming the dressing room into a haven for players, where they can feel valued.",
      "He has introduced a new philosophy that players must not leave the dressing room until they feel they have been addressed and listened to, by speaking to players immediately after matches. Harry Maguire is reportedly someone who will spearhead this approach and become an influential voice.",
      "That's a departure from Amorim's tenure, where players were supposedly dismissed after matches, frequently without him addressing them, to allow emotions to settle before making hasty decisions. He would then share his views the next day as it afforded him an opportunity to further analyse aspects of the match and provide a measured evaluation once the heat of matchday had subsided.",
      "Amorim reportedly prevented his own coaching team from delivering complex tactical instructions to the players in order to maintain simplicity. Carrick has changed the coaching structure, allowing for a different flow of information and instruction.",
      "Players have been impressed by the more direct involvement of Carrick and his staff in contrast to Amorim, who participated but sometimes chose to watch rather than intervene.",
      "Manchester United players now arrive later to matches(Image: Getty)",
      "A minor adjustment Carrick has made is having his players arrive at Old Trafford for fixtures slightly closer to kick-off time. The different pre-match routine has been brought in to try to freshen things up, with Amorim being strict on earlier arrival times ahead of fixtures.",
      "For the Premier League victory against City, the team bus turned up around 15 minutes later than normal. This was a deliberate change by Carrick to prevent his players from waiting around in the ground ahead of kick-off, while also guaranteeing his squad received a strong reception.",
      "Carrick has reduced the length of training sessions but raised the intensity of the drills undertaken, with a focus on tailored one-to-one coaching as well. Under Amorim, training sessions were longer but were lower in intensity and had different tactical focuses.",
      "It is believed Carrick made the change to stress the importance of performing at one's best each day. Reports suggest the energy in training is now a far cry from that under Amorim, with Carrick aided by two new assistant coaches in Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate.",
      "Carrick is trusting players like Kobbie Mainoo (Image: Getty)",
      "Amorim left fans and former players frustrated by appearing to overlook the club's gifted youngsters who had progressed through the academy. While the Portuguese manager did hand opportunities to players such as Chido Obi, Harry Amass and Ayden Heaven, he also publicly criticised them, alongside Mainoo, which seemed unusual for a United boss to do.",
      "Carrick, in contrast, has already shown a stronger commitment to providing young players with opportunities and engaging with the club's academy more broadly. He recalled youngsters such as Habeeb Ogunneye from loan and Joe Hugill to train with the first team.",
      "He's also been spotted watching youth team fixtures - something Amorim was criticised for neglecting - which will reassure academy prospects that there is a genuine route to the first team.",

      "Club owners, including Sir Jim Ratcliffe, will look to make a full-time appointment in the summer. Carrick is among the favourites, having won his first three games since taking charge.",
      "The likes of Carlo Ancelotti, Thomas Tuchel and Luis Enrique are also under consideration. But Dutch legend Gullit reckons Van Persie would be a suitable candidate to manage his former club at some stage down the line.",
      "Gullit told Gambling Insider : \"It would be great if Robin van Persie became the manager of Manchester United in the future. I definitely hope that happens at some point! Robin is a great manager, but he’s struggling a little bit at Feyenoord at the moment.",
      "\"I feel like the expectations for him are very high because of the career he had, so he’s under the spotlight a lot more than other managers in the Eredivisie.",
      "\"He’s under fire over here in Holland at the moment, but I hope he’s given time to rectify it and prove how good he is. Look what happened with Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United - they kept him, and look how good he ended up being!",
      "\"Down the line however, I think it would be great for Robin to manage at Old Trafford one day.\"",
      "Van Persie joined United from Arsenal in a stunning deal in 2012.",

      "He was notably left out of the side as they took on Al-Riyadh on Monday and he is considering also sitting out for Friday’s clash with Al-Ittihad.",
      "Saudi bosses have now responded to Ronaldo’s grievances and have claimed that every club run under the PIF banner is run independently. A spokesperson said: “The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules.",
      "“Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.",
      "“Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al-Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club’s growth and ambition. Like any elite competitor, he wants to win. But no individual – however significant – determines decisions beyond their own club.",
      "“Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.",
      "“The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.",

      "But he has yet to lead the club to the league title during his time with the club, Al-Nassr having finished third last season. That is a position that they occupy midway through the current campaign, having slipped four points behind league leaders Al-Hilal.",
      "Ronaldo only signed a new two-year deal with Al-Nassr in June last year that sees him bank an eye-watering £178m per year. That contract is due to run until June 2027.",

      "Michael Carrick didn't sign anyone in January but is fortunate to still have one of Manchester United's best winter transfers at his disposal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The January transfer window was a quiet one for Manchester United, but the silver lining behind that is that a more productive summer may be around the corner.",
      "Michael Carrick didn't bring any new signings to Old Trafford last month and emerges from the window with the same squad he inherited. That's despite the fact that some of the club's all-time best signings just so happen to have arrived in the winter.",
      "Based on his fast start at the United helm, Carrick may just get the chance to conduct business for his old side in the future. And if all goes to plan, he'll still be at the helm at the start of 2027 to have his first real crack at January dealings",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Arguably one of the greatest January signings in Premier League history, Nemanja Vidic emerged from relative anonymity at Spartak Moscow to become one of the finest defenders the Premier League has witnessed. The Serbian joined for a modest £7million in January 2005 and claimed his first trophy with United after barely a month, defeating Wigan Athletic to secure that season's League Cup.",
      "Vidic's legacy at Old Trafford is nothing short of remarkable - 15 trophies, including five Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League. Sir Alex Ferguson didn't mince his words when describing the Serbian's consistency, whose legendary defensive partnership with Rio Ferdinand became the stuff of United folklore.",
      "\"I always used to say Denis Irwin would give us eight or nine out of 10 every week, but he never got a mention when the praise was being given out,\" the Scot said in 2009. \"We all knew the value of him, and it is very much the same with Vidic. He has been a fantastic performer for us.\"",
      "Few fans may have known Nemanja Vidic's name when he arrived in England, but they certainly did by the time he left(Image: Alex Livesey, Getty Images)",
      "Few United supporters would dispute Paul Scholes' status as a club legend. However, many overlook the extraordinary fact this one-club hero technically signed for the Red Devils on more than one occasion.",
      "At 36, Scholes hung up his boots in the summer of 2011. Yet Ferguson sensed his midfield maestro had unfinished business - and his instincts proved spot on. The ginger genius made a sensational return halfway through the 2011/12 season, netting four league goals in the latter half of the campaign, his best tally since 2006/07.",
      "Despite United narrowly missing out on the title as City dramatically snatched the crown on goal difference, Scholes stayed put to claim his 11th and final Premier League trophy in 2013. However, he later confessed he felt the comeback was a misjudgement.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is United's best January recruit of the modern era(Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "The only member of this list still on the books at United, Bruno Fernandes ignored interest from other European big guns to sign in January 2020. And the former Sporting CP playmaker has succeeded in lifting the standards at the Theatre of Dreams, just as he did in Lisbon.",
      "Some will say the jury is still out on whether Fernandes has justified the initial £47m paid for his services given an FA Cup and League Cup is all they've lifted in the six years since he arrived. However, his 88 goals and 77 assists in 268 appearances for United, and the fact he was made captain in 2023, speaks volumes of his work.",
      "Fan favourites don't get a lot more beloved than Patrice Evra, who supposedly snubbed interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Real Madrid to join United. Five Premier League titles, one Champions League crown and 379 appearances later, the Frenchman had secured his spot as an Old Trafford icon.",
      "Ferguson moved for Evra in January 2006 because of an injury crisis in defence at the time, but his £5.5m arrival soon looked like a steal. Evra ousted Gabriel Heinze from the left-back spot permanently and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season on three occasions.",
      "Patrice Evra was an understated signing under Sir Alex Ferguson but went on to become an all-time great(Image: Matthew Peters, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "United icon Ferguson had a knack for poaching the Premier League's most prolific goalscorers from rival clubs, and Louis Saha's signing in January 2004 exemplified this perfectly. The French striker had netted 15 goals for Fulham in the opening half of that campaign and arrived to bolster United's attacking options.",
      "Whilst Saha's spell at Old Trafford was hampered by fitness problems, he still managed a respectable tally of 42 goals and 16 assists across 124 appearances for United. As one of Wayne Rooney's preferred striking partners, he delivered what was required when available and secured two Premier League titles, one League Cup and a Champions League winner's medal for his efforts.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Carrick has lifted the mood at United(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United will aim to make it four consecutive wins under interim manager Michael Carrick as they host Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford in a captivating Premier League encounter on Saturday lunchtime. This marks the first meeting between the sides since their dramatic 2-2 draw in North London back in August, when Matthijs de Ligt netted a 96th-minute equaliser for United.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim’s departure and Carrick’s appointment, Manchester United appear revitalized, collecting a perfect nine points from three matches under their new boss and extending their unbeaten league run to seven games. The Red Devils have notched impressive victories over title contenders Arsenal and Manchester City, before edging out Fulham 3-2 last weekend thanks to Benjamin Sesko’s stoppage-time winner. Confidence is understandably high at Old Trafford, with United currently sitting fourth in the table—one point clear of Chelsea in fifth and two ahead of Liverpool in sixth. A win on Saturday would see United surpass last season’s 42-point total with 13 matches still remaining.",
      "Victory against Tottenham would also give Manchester United four straight league wins for the first time since February 2024 under Erik ten Hag. However, recent history against Spurs has not favored United, who are winless in their last six league meetings with the North London side (three draws, three losses)—matching their longest such run, which dates back to 1914-1921.",
      "Tottenham, led by Thomas Frank, have struggled at home this season—only Wolves have picked up fewer home points than Spurs’ 10. After a lackluster first half against Manchester City last weekend, Spurs rallied in the second half, with Dominic Solanke scoring twice—including a fortuitous scorpion kick—to secure a 2-2 draw and a valuable point. Nevertheless, Tottenham are winless in their last six Premier League matches (four draws, two losses), their longest such streak since the end of last season, and currently sit 14th in the table—closer to the relegation zone (nine points clear) than the top five (11 points adrift).",
      "Spurs may welcome the prospect of playing away from home, as five of their seven league wins this season have come on the road. Only Arsenal (24) and Aston Villa (21) have earned more away points than Tottenham’s 19 so far. Additionally, Spurs are unbeaten in their last eight meetings with Manchester United across all competitions (five wins, three draws)—a feat only bettered by Chelsea’s 12-match run against United between 2012 and 2017. Tottenham also claimed a 3-0 victory at Old Trafford last season and have only once before won back-to-back top-flight away games against United, achieving that in January 2014.",
      "Manchester United will be without Patrick Dorgu (thigh) and Matthijs de Ligt (back), who remain sidelined through injury. Mason Mount is also a doubt after picking up a knock in training and will be assessed ahead of kickoff. Manager Michael Carrick is likely to stick with his successful starting lineup, but may consider recalling Benjamin Sesko to the attack following his decisive impact off the bench in the previous match. Should Sesko return to the starting XI, one of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, or Matheus Cunha would likely make way.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes, who leads the Premier League with 12 assists this season—a personal best equaled only in the 2020-21 campaign—is expected to continue in his advanced central midfield role behind the main striker.",
      "For Tottenham, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski (both knee), Mohammed Kudus (thigh), Pedro Porro, Richarlison, Rodrigo Bentancur (all hamstring), Ben Davies, Lucas Bergvall (both ankle), and Kevin Danso (toe) are all unavailable due to injury. Micky van de Ven (unspecified) and Djed Spence (calf) missed the draw with Manchester City, while both Dominic Solanke (fitness) and Cristian Romero were unable to complete the full 90 minutes; all four will be assessed ahead of kickoff.",
      "Solanke, who has netted five goals in his last five appearances against Manchester United in all competitions, will be hoping to recover in time to lead the line. Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel are both pushing for a recall in attack, either to partner or replace Randal Kolo Muani and Xavi Simons.",

      "Michael Carrick may have a route to bring Scott McTominay back to Manchester United this summer(Image: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick is hard at work attempting to preserve and prolong his meteoric start as interim Manchester United manager. And the Red Devils play host to Tottenham in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off, hoping to make it four wins from four under the club icon.",
      "Whatever Carrick has been doing at his old stomping ground thus far, it's working. Despite being at the club on temporary terms as things stand, the 44-year-old hasn't been afraid to tear up trees in an effort to put his old side back on top of the English pyramid.",
      "United had a quiet January transfer window, where the only business to speak of was through the departures. That bodes well in terms of a bigger budget to spend in the summer, however, at which point it may be Carrick making the decisions on a longer-term basis.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Recent examples of players returning to Old Trafford after long stints away haven't fallen in their favour over recent years. Expensive moves to bring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Pogba back to the club ultimately failed to live up to expectations.",
      "But many fans will hope McTominay could buck that trend in the event United come back in for their academy graduate in future. To that effect, recent comments made by Napoli’s global business development officer, Leonardo Giammarioli, suggest the transfer can be done for the right price.",
      "\"Yeah, of course I’m worried,\" he told talkSPORT when discussing the prospect of McTominay leaving should a suitable offer come in. \"But ultimately, especially Scott, who’s a very nice guy, we’re happy if he gets to the next level in a couple of years. Maybe not now, maybe not next year, but he deserves it.",
      "\"Look at Stuttgart, they wanted to keep Nick Woltemade [before he joined Newcastle last summer], but when such an offer comes in, there’s not much you can do, when the player wants to go and money is important.\"",
      "McTominay has been a major success since moving to Italy in 2024(Image: Image Photo Agency, Getty Images)",
      "It's common knowledge by now that Napoli got themselves a serious bargain after acquiring the Scot for around £25million in the summer of 2024. Many suggested at the time the player was underrated, and then-manager Erik ten Hag even confessed he didn't want to sell his star.",
      "One Serie A title and a Player of the Year award later, McTominay is one of the most valuable assets in Italy's top flight. Again, United would be forced to pay a premium for a player they may well regret selling in the first place, but the need to replace the outgoing Casemiro - and potentially Bruno Fernandes, too - could make him a sensible summer target.",
      "One thing that's been clear early on in Carrick's reign is that he's not worried about upsetting the status quo. And that goes just as much for established traditions at United, as well as something as ordinary as tactical tweaks.",
      "Carrick has laid down a marker both on and off the field at Old Trafford(Image: Mike Egerton/PA Wire)",
      "The ex-England midfielder has already ditched Ruben Amorim's three-at-the-back formation in favour of a more standard set-up. He's also brought Kobbie Mainoo in from his exile and found success switching left-back Patrick Dorgu into a more advanced role.",
      "However, it's now emerged Carrick has done away with Amorim and Ten Hag's practice of making players train the day after matches, per the Sun. Both his predecessors favoured the habit of making the squad attend recovery sessions the day after playing - but no more.",
      "Instead, Carrick has altered the schedule so that United's players undergo their recovery sessions two days after playing. And it's but the latest example of Carrick's more humane touch, giving his stars a more relaxed working atmosphere, at least in one way.",

      "Wayne Rooney's eldest son, Kai, has been offered a new contract by Manchester United(Image: James Gill - Danehouse, Getty Images)",
      "The 16-year-old son of Wayne Rooney, Kai, has reportedly been offered a contract by Manchester United as he bids to follow in the footsteps of his famous father.",
      "Kai has been in the United academy for several years and is an attacker, just like Rooney Senior. And after impressing in the youth ranks, Kai is among a group of 14 very highly-rated youngsters who have been offered new terms by United.",
      "According to The Sun, Kai and Jacey Carrick, the son of the Red Devils' current head coach, Michael, have been offered new deals along with others. If accepted, Rooney Jr would pen a one-year scholarship which would then become a three-year professional deal when he turns 17.",
      "The report claims said contract would see him earn around £50,000-a-year plus an annual signing-on fee, though the Rooney family have yet to green light the deal.",
      "A source told the outlet: “The group is very strong and the majority of the boys including Kai and Jacey have been offered deals. It means when they finish school they can go into full-time ‘football employment’ and then when they turn 17 are guaranteed a pro status.",
      "“They still have a long way to go to make the grade, but they can be very proud that the club thinks they have a chance of making it.”",
      "Kai could soon follow in his famous father's footsteps(Image: James Gill - Danehouse, Getty Images)",
      "However, Kai seemed to pour cold water on the reports, posting on his Instagram story: \"Don't listen to mail.\"",
      "Wayne, the club's all-time record goalscorer, spoke of his pride last month after watching his eldest son represent Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup against Derby County.",
      "He said: “Kai got moved up to the under-18s squad for the Youth Cup and it was great to see him come on. It brought back memories of when I played in the Youth Cup for Everton.",
      "“It was a proud moment and I’m delighted for him. Hopefully he continues that and he can have a good run with the team.”",
      "Kai’s mum, Coleen, has made it clear that they have not pressured their children into following in Wayne’s footsteps. Speaking to The Mirror in September 2024, she said: “We've never pressured them into even playing football. We've always just let them decide what they want to do. My eight-year-old was playing and doing really well but then decided he didn't want to, and that's OK.",
      "Kai with his parents, Wayne and Coleen(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“I think they sometimes get pressure off other people, you know. People approach them now and then if we're out, they do say, 'Are you are as good as your dad?' Kai says 'I'm a different type of player.' You've got to let them know that you don't have to follow and to be your own person.”",
      "Wayne, meanwhile, has been happy to see Michael Carrick and his coaching staff take an interest in the academy since taking charge. He said on his BBC podcast last month: “It is great to see all the coaches taking a big interest in the academy. In the next few years, some of those players might get an opportunity for the first team, so it is important they have that interest.",
      "Wayne, pictured with Kai, is Manchester United's record goalscorer(Image: Man Utd via Getty Images)",
      "“On Saturday, they were all at the under-16s game as well before they travelled to London. It is great to see that coming back into the club.",
      "“I have been quite vocal on this. It used to be the norm but it has been missing in the last few years. With my two lads in the academy, I haven't seen that and it was a bit disappointing. The lift it gives to the players and the players' parents, seeing the first team manager there. That is how the club should be run.”",

      "Michael Carrick has done a brilliant job at Manchester United so far (Image: Offside via Getty Images)",
      "Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer believes Manchester United's turnaround under interim head coach Michael Carrick has justified previous criticism of Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils sacked Amorim as head coach in January after he fell out with the club's board.",
      "The former Sporting boss arrived at Old Trafford in November 2024 and led United to 15th, their lowest Premier League finish on record, and a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. Amorim's tenure was plagued by inconsistent form and a muddled style of play.",
      "The Portuguese was heavily criticised for his tactical inflexibility, having stuck with a back-three for the majority of his tenure at M16 - despite calls for him to show greater versatility. The 41-year-old was initially succeeded by Darren Fletcher for two games before Carrick was appointed until the end of the season.",
      "And United's temporary boss has had an impressive impact so far with wins over the league's top two, Manchester City and Arsenal, before a thrilling 3-2 victory over Fulham last weekend. The Red Devils currently sit fourth in the top-flight table amid growing optimism that they will secure a return to the Champions League.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "United have not been in Europe's elite competition since the 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, when they crashed out in the group stage. There is no European football at all this term for Carrick's men, but ex-Newcastle United striker Shearer has explained to Betfair why they have every chance of getting back into the Champions League for the 2026/27 campaign.",
      "He said: \"What a job Michael Carrick is doing. The turnaround from every single player is chalk and cheese.",
      "\"I guess it was us questioning Ruben Amorim every single week and we were justified to do that because what we saw with him compared to with Michael Carrick is remarkable. Michael deserves great credit. He has everyone working.",
      "\"There's a real understanding of what he wants. He has them really well set up and has managed three unbelievable games so far.",
      "Ruben Amorim's tenure at Manchester United lasted only 14 months(Image: Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images)",

      "United return to action at home to Tottenham on Saturday (12:30pm). The Red Devils have failed to beat Spurs since October 2022, but Carrick insists he is looking forward to the challenge when asked about Thomas Frank's side in his pre-match press conference on Thursday.",
      "The 44-year-old said: \"They certainly bring a challenge. The way they finished the game the other day, they’ve had, over a period, players injured, a lot of changes to the team, which makes things more difficult.",
      "\"They’re getting players back, they have really good attackers that look to stretch the backline and play forward and attack the box an awful lot. A slightly different game to what we’ve played in recent weeks, but we’re looking forward to it.",

      "Ronaldo, 41, sat out of Monday's 1-0 win against Al-Riyadh due to his frustration with PIF, who own the 'Big Four' in Saudi, over a lack of transfer movement at the club.",
      "His anger escalated when he saw title rivals Al-Hilal, who sit one point and one place above them in the Saudi Pro League, make Karim Benzema their fifth signing of the January transfer window.",
      "Al-Nassr, meanwhile, did little in terms of recruitment in the winter market. They made just two incoming transfers with Abdullah Al-Hamdan signed from Al-Hilal and Haydeer Abdulkareem brought in from Al-Zawraa.",
      "Although Ronaldo has trained with his Al-Nassr teammates this week, he won't be back available to face Al-Ittihad in their next game on Friday evening, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "It's added there are no issues between Ronaldo and Al-Nassr's staff or management, as well as no injury or fitness problems. The Portugal international remains 'upset' about PIF's management with some Saudi clubs.",
      "Senior Al-Nassr officials were confident that Ronaldo would end his strike to play against Al-Ittihad and were shocked that the United and Real Madrid legend has been left displeased with PIF.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo's recent fallout at Al-Nassr reopens the discussion regarding the Manchester United icon's next move(Image: Abdullah Ahmed, Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United supporters are bound to be on high alert whenever there's chatter about Cristiano Ronaldo potentially changing clubs. And it seems the Old Trafford legend might be set for another move amid rumours of unrest at Al-Nassr.",
      "Reports have surfaced indicating Ronaldo is on strike in Riyadh and refusing to take to the pitch for his current club. The alleged protest is apparently due to Ronaldo's dissatisfaction with Al-Nassr's lack of transfer activity as he strives to secure his first league title in Saudi Arabia.",
      "If this door does indeed close, it could open a window of opportunity for other clubs. Even after celebrating his 41st birthday on Thursday, Ronaldo will not be lacking in options.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "There are those at Old Trafford who would gladly welcome Ronaldo back, even if it wasn't in a playing role. This comes after former team-mate Wes Brown suggested the Portugal captain could be \"perfect\" for a boardroom position.",
      "Some are sure to remain sceptical about whether the iconic striker possesses the nous required for a boardroom role. Particularly as the Red Devils are finally beginning to demonstrate signs of coherent planning following years of baffling recruitment decisions off the field.",
      "Yet having shared a dressing room with Ronaldo, Brown reckons he's got the credentials for such a transition. However, he acknowledges much will hinge on what the Portuguese superstar wants to do next, especially after his second spell at the Theatre of Dreams fizzled out disappointingly in 2022.",
      "Ronaldo's United link could be revived this summer(Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"You never know what Cristiano Ronaldo wants to do, but you can't doubt him after everything he's achieved,\" Brown told 10bet Casino. \"I think first of all, it depends how he's doing in Saudi Arabia, because it's not clear he'll be stopping any time soon - he's still banging them in for Al Nassr.",
      "\"But he could definitely move into the boardroom, he's got the ability to swerve away from coaching and into the executive level, 100 per cent. Why not? If he's enjoying it, it'll be perfect for him.\"",
      "Regardless, it's tricky to picture Ronaldo hanging up his boots just yet. The five-time Ballon d'Or champion sits just 39 strikes shy of the mythical 1,000-goal milestone he's been chasing for years, making it virtually guaranteed he'll extend his playing career for at least another season.",
      "Among all the leagues beyond Saudi Arabia where Ronaldo might reach that milestone, Major League Soccer appears an ideal destination. Deep down, supporters globally would simply relish the prospect of another showdown with Messi.",
      "The most legendary individual rivalry in the modern sport seemingly reached its finale in January 2023. It was then that Messi's Paris Saint-Germain triumphed 5-4 over a combined Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal side in a friendly exhibition.",
      "Yet the former Barcelona and Real Madrid adversaries might orchestrate one final chapter stateside. Messi remains in brilliant form for Inter Miami and is tied to David Beckham's club through 2028, providing ample opportunity for the pair to face off several more times should Ronaldo relocate to America.",
      "The greatest rivalry in modern football could be resurrected if Ronaldo moves to MLS(Image: AFP/Getty Images)",
      "Some might even fantasise about Ronaldo and Messi playing alongside each other. Though fitting Ronaldo into Inter Miami's already stretched wage structure would likely prove impossible.",
      "That said, nothing prevents another MLS club from exploiting similar Designated Player regulations to accommodate Ronaldo's substantial earnings. The league's track record of providing elite strikers the perfect platform to boost their scoring records could prove irresistible.",
      "Should Ronaldo depart Al-Nassr in the near future, he'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to his next destination. A sentimental return to Sporting CP, where his journey began, could be a possibility, though such a move might be driven more by nostalgia than practicality.",
      "Ronaldo joined Sporting's academy aged 12 and had barely begun his professional career when Sir Alex Ferguson swooped in. That said, the appeal of stepping up the competition at this stage of his career might not be particularly strong.",
      "Ronaldo is bound to have his pick of moves if he decides to leave Al-Nassr(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Alternatively, a switch within Saudi Arabia could provide the modest change he's seeking. This is particularly feasible given several clubs backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) could realistically make such a transfer happen.",
      "Al-Hilal especially have demonstrated their financial muscle in the transfer market and recently secured Ronaldo's former Real colleague Karim Benzema. However, that reunion could bring its own complications after ESPN reported Ronaldo tried to prevent his move from Al-Ittihad, because he believed it would hand Al-Hilal excessive advantage in this season's title race.",
      "But if you can't beat them, join them. Not only would a potential partnership between Ronaldo and Benzema generate significant interest, but it could offer Ronaldo the most straightforward path to finally claiming the Saudi championship he's longed for.",

      "Napoli chief Leonardo Giammarioli has admitted that he is concerned that the club will be forced to cash in on Scott McTominay. The Scottish midfielder has thrived in Serie A since choosing to leave Manchester United in 2024.",
      "He has made 69 appearances in all, scoring 22 times, while he also helped Napoli to the Serie A crown last term. There have been suggestions that he could leave the club now however, with former club United urged to re-sign him.",
      "And Napoli’s global business development officer, Giammarioli, says he is worried about the club being powerless to turn down a lucrative bid. Speaking with talkSPORT, he said: “Yeah, of course I’m worried.",
      "“But ultimately, especially Scott, who’s a very nice guy, we’re happy if he gets to the next level in a couple of years – maybe not now, maybe not next year, but he deserves it.",
      "“Look at Stuttgart, they wanted to keep Nick Woltemade, but when such an offer comes in, there’s not much you can do, when the player wants to go and money is important.”",

      "He added: “It’s a bit complicated for Serie A and our competitive clubs…the league is still making losses in revenue. Of course, it’s hard to keep up with the other big four leagues, but we’re trying to improve and be competitive.",
      "“Keeping players is difficult, it wasn’t easy to get them, it’s even harder to keep them. We need to be smart about our signings…every bit of money we spend must count.”",
      "Among those to have urged United to make a move for McTominay is former star Teddy Sheringham. He recently suggested that the Red Devils simply cannot allow the midfielder to sign for another Premier League side.",
      "McTominay's contract runs until 2028(Image: Getty Images)",
      "He said: \"If he comes back to England, then there's no way Manchester United can miss out on him. He simply cannot come back to the Premier League without going to Manchester United. That would be a travesty. That cannot happen.\"",
      "Napoli and McTominay will be back in action this weekend as they travel to Genoa. The reigning Serie A champions currently sit nine points off the pace in the race for this season’s title.",
      "It has been suggested that they could yet tempt another former Premier League player to move to Naples. Reports have suggested that Napoli are in talks over a move for Raheem Sterling following his exit from Chelsea.",

      "It remains to be seen when Cristiano Ronaldo returns to action with Al-Nassr(Image: Getty Images)",
      "A third spell at Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo has been rubbished by his former team-mate amid his conflict with Al-Nassr. Ronaldo, who celebrates his 41st birthday on Thursday, has been the centre of global headlines following his his controversial strike in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The Portuguese icon refused to play for Al-Nassr in their 1-0 win over Al-Riyadh on Monday due to his fury over former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema's move to title rivals Al-Hilal.",
      "The Frenchman, 38, departed Al-Ittihad after having his contract terminated before making the move to the league leaders, who are a point ahead of Ronaldo's side in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Given Al-Nassr, Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal are all owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Ronaldo has been left furious that a deal to sign the 2022 Ballon d'Or winner was completed because of the damage it does to Al-Nassr's title charge.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "With no guarantee he'll return to the squad for their clash against Al Ittihad on Friday, speculation on whether Ronaldo's time in Saudi will come to an end has been heavily discussed. According to The Athletic, the 41-year-old has a £44million release clause in his contract.",
      "Reports have linked Ronaldo to a sensational return to Old Trafford to play under former Red Devils team-mate Michael Carrick but the chances of the striker donning the red for a third time were dismissed by former team-mate Wes Brown.",
      "The former United defender told BettingLounge: \"He's not happy but would Cristiano Ronaldo come back to Manchester United for a third go? I would say no. I can't see how that could happen. A move to MLS? Maybe. Maybe he goes back to Portugal and plays there. I'm sure he will still have so many options.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo was said to be irked by Karim Benzema's move to Al-Hilal(Image: Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)",
      "\"The main thing is that he still wants to play in the World Cup and we would have to keep playing and making sure he keeps himself fit to do that. It's a shock to everyone to see Ronaldo on strike but I honestly think it will get resolved. We'll have to wait and see where it goes from here.\"",
      "Indeed, given the way he left the club in 2022, it feels incredibly unlikely that Ronaldo would return in a playing capacity at any rate.",
      "The Athletic added that Ronaldo feels let down by the Al-Nassr hierarchy for failing to adequately improve the squad during the January transfer window. The club only managed to sign Abdullah Al-Hamdan, a Saudi Arabia international centre-forward, from Al Hilal, and Haydeer Abdulkareem, an Iraqi midfielder, from Al-Zawraa SC during the winter.",
      "The lack of big-name signings, coupled with Benzema's move to Al-Hilal has reportedly led Ronaldo to believe that the levels of ambition differ at the clubs owned by PIF. However, in an update that could please Al-Nassr fans, Ronaldo posted an image of himself training with the first team on Thursday.",
      "Despite this, no confirmation has been made from the club on whether he'll feature as part of the matchday squad on Friday. Ronaldo has scored 17 goals in 18 games this season in the league, with only England striker Ivan Toney scoring more (18 goals).",

      "Ruben Amorim and Erik ten Hag's rule of making Manchester United players train the day after matches has been torn up by Michael Carrick. The former England midfielder is enjoying the perfect start to life as United interim manager.",
      "His second temporary spell has began with an emphatic 2-0 home win over Manchester City, a dramatic 3-2 triumph away to Arsenal and a last-minute win over Fulham. Carrick, 44, has made many alterations since he was given the reins until the end of the campaign.",
      "He has already overhauled Amorim's stodgy 3-4-3 formation and brought United academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo back into the starting eleven. But there are many other rules Amorim introduced, which are being reversed.",
      "One thing Amorim and Ten Hag had in common was their insistence to train the day after matches. Both former United bosses were adamant players who participated in a match had to report to the training ground for a recovery session.",
      "This has been thrown out by Carrick who has instead signed off on allocated days off in the 24 hours after a match. Instead, the recovery days have been moved to two days after the final whistle of a game.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "It's another example of Carrick ushering out Amorim's old ways and bringing in his own rules and beliefs. He may have been in situ for barely a month, but he has already reversed five bans the ex-Sporting Lisbon manager imposed.",
      "Amorim forbade players from taking holidays during international breaks, banned food from being taken into the dressing room and even prevented his own staff from giving United stars complex tactical instructions.",
      "Carrick has lifted the mood at United(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Carrick has also made training sessions shorter - but increased the intensity of drills - and also altered the time his team arrive for matches. It's fair to say his changes are already bearing fruit.",
      "United's last ditch victory over Fulham lifted them into the top four. They are one point ahead of Chelsea and are only six points away from second placed Manchester City.",
      "Carrick's side host Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford this weekend before travelling to face West Ham on Tuesday February 10. With United out of all the cup competitions and not in Europe, Carrick has a clear path for an assault on the top four.",
      "At present, he's not expected to be handed the position full-time. However, if he keeps on putting together victories, it will be harder and harder to not hand him the job.",
      "Amorim was sacked at the start of the year(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Carrick's former team-mate Ben Foster even believes there is a slim chance he will be named as the next United boss at the end of the season. The former goalkeeper, speaking on his Fozcast podcast, said: \"The weight of the badge is phenomenal for Manchester United, but then a new manager comes in, somebody that they know, somebody that they trust and they get on with as a friend.",
      "\"That's the kind of the situation that they're in at the minute with Carrick, it's all friendly. He's only the interim and it's not full time. I would worry that if it goes full time, then that changes that dynamic a little bit.",
      "\"We've seen it before with plenty of teams, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and it changes the dynamic a little bit. But he's so far beaten Man City and Arsenal. What a start and he's got 15 games left for Manchester United now. If he wins ten of those 15 games, you've got to give him the job.\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has stopped playing. Not for good, of course, but the Manchester United legend is currently on strike at Al-Nassr and refused to play in their most recent game on Monday.",
      "Ronaldo, who turned 41 on Thursday, wasn't celebrating much after Karim Benzema controversially joined Al-Nassr's title rivals, Al-Hilal. Having seen his contract with Al-Ittihad terminated, Benzema signed for the Saudi Pro League leaders on a free transfer.",
      "That's because all three clubs are owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF). Sources insist that no rules have been broken but the move has left Ronaldo furious, with Al-Hilal one point clear at the top.",
      "A fallout with PIF isn't Ronaldo's first rodeo. Like most public figures of his standing, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has made plenty of enemies along the way.",
      "Ronaldo infamously didn't see eye-to-eye with Erik ten Hag during his troubled second spell with United. In a bombshell interview with Piers Morgan after what proved to be his final game for the Red Devils, the Portugal captain burned his bridges by slamming Ten Hag, ex-manager Ralf Rangnick and the Glazers.",
      "\"You can't rebuild a club you don't understand,\" Ronaldo later said of Ten Hag in September 2024, less than two months before the Dutchman was sacked.",
      "Not everything was rosy under Sir Alex Ferguson, though. In the summer of 2008, Ronaldo accused United of making him a 'slave' by blocking his proposed move to Real Madrid.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo and Erik ten Hag's relationship lasted six months(Image: Matthew Ashton - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Ferguson held peace talks and ultimately delayed the transfer by 12 months. \"I flew to Portugal some weeks ago and we cleared the air and he spoke to some of the players,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"The boy has been through a troubled time in terms of the approaches from Spain but once he knew my stance, he then settled down.\"",
      "In December 2022, Ronaldo's departure from United saw him part ways with long-time agent Jorge Mendes. It's reported that Mendes opposed the acrimonious nature of Ronaldo's exit, having had a good relationship with the Old Trafford hierarchy.",
      "After his contract was torn up following the interview with Morgan, Ronaldo's mega-money transfer to Al-Nassr was chiefly overseen by his personal manager, Ricardo Regufe. However, this wasn't so much of a furious row, as he and Mendes remain 'close'.",
      "\"Cristiano will always be in my heart,\" Mendes explained in 2023. \"He is a special player and a special person for me. If I, a few years ago, thought that I could have a player with half the value of Cristiano, I would sign for less! And all of us Portuguese should be proud to have had and still have a player like him.\"",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson had to convince Cristiano Ronaldo to stay in 2008(Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Time catches up with everyone, and although Ronaldo has done his best to defy it, even he admits that he's close to the end. First of all, the former Real Madrid superstar has already confirmed won't hang up his boots until he scores his 1,000th career goal - he's currently on 961.",
      "Once he passes that milestone, Ronaldo will evaluate his future. One theory is that he's waiting to play a match alongside his son, Cristiano Jr. \"I would like it, I would like it,\" the forward said on his YouTube channel last year. \"It's not something that keeps me up at night, but I would like it.",
      "\"We'll see. It's more in his hands than in mine. The years are starting to pass and obviously Cris will have to, one day, leave football, because the years I'm extending... There will come a time when it's no longer possible.\"",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo Jr is making his name at youth level(Image: Orhan Cicek/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Currently playing for Al-Nassr's under-15 side, it's possible that we could see a father-and-son partnership as soon as next season. That'd line up with Ronaldo's contract which expires in June 2027.",
      "This summer will also mark his final World Cup campaign, as he bids to win one of the few trophies that he's never lifted. \"I feel very good in this moment,\" Ronaldo affirmed in November, admitting that he'll be retiring 'soon'.",
      "\"I score goals, I still feel quick and sharp. I'm enjoying my game in the national team. But of course, let's be honest. What I mean by soon is probably one or two years.\"",
      "If Ronaldo were to leave Al-Nassr before retirement, there's one outstanding club that he'd be tipped to sign for: Sporting Lisbon. It was with the Portuguese giants that he broke through as a wonderkid, famously impressing United in a 2003 pre-season friendly.",
      "His mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in 2021 that she's desperate for Ronaldo to return to Sporting one day. \"Ronaldo has to come back here,\" she told club media. \"If it were my choice, he would already be here.",
      "\"He likes to watch Sporting games. I've already told him: 'Son, before I die, I want to see you return to Sporting'. He says: 'Let's see': But if it can't be him, then Cristianinho (his son)!\"",
      "Dolores Aveiro wants Cristiano Ronaldo to play for Sporting Lisbon again(Image: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images)",
      "What's next for Ronaldo after football, then? Certainly not coaching if his 2024 comments in an interview with Rio Ferdinand are anything to go by.",
      "\"For me will be difficult one day to be a coach,\" Ronaldo admitted. \"Because I don't have passions for this generation, it's difficult especially in football, because they don't take advice by our experience. They think they know everything, they think the phones will give you good education, the TikTok, the Instagram.",
      "\"I have other things to worry about, another chapter of my life that is a business part that I'm excited about. It will be a challenge to me and learn other areas I don't know, be more involved in my business and I think will be good.\"",

      "Michael Carrick has been a breath of fresh air on his return to the club, winning all three games so far.

      "Manchester United are set to open talks with Kobbie Mainoo over a new contract",
      "Manchester United are set to open contract talks with Kobbie Mainoo and are hopeful of agreeing a deal with the academy graduate before the end of the season. Mainoo has returned to the team under Michael Carrick, starting all three games for the 44-year-old head coach after a spell in the wilderness under Ruben Amorim.",
      "With the 20-year-old shining in the victories against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham, United have made it clear they intend to resume talks over a new long-term contract with Mainoo, with the hope that an agreement can be reached relatively smoothly.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "While United were willing to sanction a loan move in January if Mainoo felt he had to leave to aid his development, Old Trafford sources insist a permanent option was never on the table and they wouldn't have considered any loan that included an option to buy.",
      "But the decision to sack Amorim has changed Mainoo's fortunes and he has quickly rediscovered his best form under Carrick, leading United to inform him and his camp of plans to commence contract talks.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Mainoo is still on the contract he signed as a 17-year-old in February 2023 and he is one of the lowest-paid players in the first-team squad. That deal saw the Stockport-born youngster sign terms on a low base rate, as is normal for academy graduates, with significant bonuses for success.",
      "While he was hitting plenty of them during his early time with the squad, he wasn't triggering them when he was benched by Amorim. His return to the team has again led to his salary rising due to the bonuses in his contract.",
      "Mainoo still has a year left on that contract, as well as the option of another year in the club's favour, but United want to tie him down for longer and on terms that better reflect his status. That was difficult to do when he fell out of favour under Amorim, but he has again proved his worth over the last three weeks.",

      "Elsewhere, it was a quiet deadline day. As expected there were no incomings and no first-team departures either, setting the club up for a busy summer, which is the subject of some of the questions today.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "We run weekly question and answer sessions, so click here to submit your questions, and we'll answer them next week. Here are the answers to some of this week's questions:",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Is Sandro Tonali a real option for the summer?",
      "I've not heard anything to suggest he is yet, but then the situation around Tonali developed quickly on deadline day. His agent threw the cat amongst the pigeons, suggesting there is some long-standing interest from Arsenal.",
      "United want a couple of midfielders, but if they go for one of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton or Carlos Baleba, I think they will look abroad for a second. Signing players from Premier League rivals is an expensive business and given the interest in Anderson, that could be a very big deal to do.",
      "Will more youngsters like Shea Lacey be given a chance?",
      "It's hard to see that happening at the moment. Lacey is the one knocking hardest, but the first-team squad is in good shape again in terms of fitness, and there aren't enough games to go around to give those players a chance, never mind a youngster.",
      "Lacey might get games on the bench still, but Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko are already four players for three spots.",
      "The other youngster to maybe keep an eye on is Jack Moorhouse. He returned from a loan spell at Leyton Orient on deadline day and has trained with the first team this week. If there is an injury in midfield, he might get a chance.",
      "Why didn't we sign a midfielder this summer?",
      "Because no long-term target became available. United were adamant they wouldn't make any short-term moves and they stuck to their word.",
      "It might be a risk not to sign a midfielder, but there are only 14 games left and any deal would have been to add back-up. I'm not sure it was really needed.",
      "There are some long breaks coming up between fixtures and Carrick has his work cut out to keep everyone happy as it is. If Casemiro or Mainoo get injured, then maybe it will look like a mistake, but for now, I don't think it was really necessary.",
      "Will Carrick get the job full-time if he gets us into the top four comfortably?",
      "You would have to think there is a chance. United insist the process is going to be thorough and Carrick is keeping his feet on the ground, but a top-four finish makes a strong argument for him.",
      "It's not impossible that United even reel in Aston Villa for third. If Carrick continues to impress, then he will probably give himself an excellent chance of a Premier League job next season, whatever his Old Trafford bosses decide.",
      "The question then might be whether they are prepared to let him go and shine elsewhere. There is a lot more football to be played this season, but Carrick's start has put him firmly in the frame.",
      "Is there a young midfielder who could replace Casemiro?",
      "I don't think there is, to be honest. There are some good youngsters coming through, but nobody in midfield that you would say is on Kobbie Mainoo's level and ready to make an impact.",
      "Moorhouse might get a chance and Jack Fletcher has already, but I'd be surprised if either was in the first-team squad next season. Sekou Kone is someone whom United have high hopes for, but the 20-year-old needs to do plenty of developing in Lausanne in the second half of the season.",
      "What are the chances that if we continue like this we can take the title?",
      "Who says people are getting carried away? In truth, I'd say the chances are non-existent. The gap is 12 points and even if United win their remaining 14 Premier League games, Arsenal would need to lose four. They have had a wobble recently, but that just isn't going to happen.",
      "A more realistic target would be to try and catch Villa. That gap is now five points and Unai Emery's side still have to come to Old Trafford, while Thursday night football is also still on the agenda for them in the Europa League.",
      "Villa are statistical outliers this season when it comes to their data and you can see their results starting to match up with their performance levels at some point.",

      "Michael Carrick looks at home at Old Trafford and is putting himself in the frame for a Premier League job next season",
      "Michael Carrick had never previously met Thomas Frank until they sat down together for a chat in front of the Amazon Prime cameras in September, spending more than half an hour discussing their football philosophies and swapping coaching advice.",
      "The meeting at Spurs Lodge was to preview Frank's first Champions League game in charge of Tottenham against Villarreal, but the 52-year-old Dane and the 44-year-old from the north east struck up a bond as they got into the weeds of coaching.",
      "Frank had just swapped Brentford for Tottenham, while Carrick was doing TV work after leaving Middlesbrough last summer. At the time, there seemed to be no immediate prospect of the latter returning to the dugout anytime soon.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "But then came the call from a club he can't say no to. Carrick might have grown up near Newcastle and spent two years as a player at Tottenham, but it is Old Trafford that he now calls home, and when Manchester United made contact in January about the prospect of returning as head coach to replace Ruben Amorim, he jumped at the chance.",
      "Carrick signed a contract until the end of the season, but after three wins in his first three games, including victories against Manchester City and Arsenal, he is now the favourite to be in charge next season as well. There is enough football left in this campaign for that to change, but another win on Saturday against Frank's Tottenham will further strengthen his case.",
      "And whatever happens at Old Trafford, the more Premier League games that Carrick wins, the stronger his own case of getting a job in the top flight becomes. Victory against his former club could even open a door back in north London.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Frank has steadied the ship at Tottenham recently, but he remains under pressure. Supporters are unconvinced by his style of play, and although they finished fourth in the league phase of the Champions League, they are 14th in the Premier League.",
      "Defeat at Old Trafford would be unlikely to be terminal, but as things stand, it's hard to see Frank regaining enough credit to survive beyond the end of the season. If Tottenham do pull the trigger, could they turn to Carrick for 2026/27?",
      "That will become a possibility if he continues to be successful at United. Guiding a team that looked flat under Amorim into the Champions League places would look good on Carrick's CV, and it's not beyond the realms of possibility that they could yet catch Aston Villa or Manchester City.",
      "The question for United could become whether they are prepared to let Carrick leave and walk into a different Premier League job. If the football hierarchy at Old Trafford looks elsewhere despite Carrick's success, only for him to then thrive at a different club - such as Tottenham - it could be an awkward look.",
      "For Carrick, there is no doubt where he would rather be. He made 75 appearances for Tottenham and is still popular there, but speaking on Thursday about leaving White Hart Lane for Old Trafford, he made it clear United struck a different chord for him.",
      "\"It was pretty instant,\" he said of his love affair with United. \"I've got really fond memories of Tottenham and being at the club. I was there for a short time, or what feels now like a short time when you look back, but I really enjoyed it. It was a good team, Martin Jol was the manager, and there were a lot of things that I learned at the club in that short period of time.",
      "\"But I've said it enough times. I think coming here was a jump, and a big jump at the time, and I certainly felt that pretty quickly, and then I think once you step inside this place as a footballer, then it kind of turns you. So pretty much from the first day walking into the dressing room, meeting the manager from then on in, that was me.\"",
      "Carrick's near-three-year stint at Middlesbrough had come to a natural end in the summer and he looked in no rush to return to coaching until the offer from United came. In just over three weeks, he has rediscovered a love of being on the grass and working with players.",
      "He has also enhanced his job prospects, and this weekend he could open up another opportunity for himself in the Premier League.",

      "Benjamin Sesko celebrates scoring for Manchester United against Fulham(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United's disappointing 2024/25 season meant wholesale changes were guaranteed when the summer transfer window opened. The priority for United was to reshape their forward line. United scored a measly 44 goals in 38 Premier League games and those figures contributed to a 15th-place finish.",
      "Since Ineos' arrival, the priority for United has been to sign players with resale value who could either stay at Old Trafford for most of their career or be sold for a profit. Following this blueprint, the first target of the summer was Ipswich Town's Liam Delap.",
      "Delap was always destined to remain in the Premier League having enjoyed a good season with the Tractor Boys. The Suffolk club may have been relegated back to the Championship at the first time of asking, but Delap's 12 goals in the Premier League showed signs he could make the step up and retain his place in the top flight, even if his team didn't.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He also had the right profile for the attack Ruben Amorim was looking to build: tall and athletic, with the ability to hold the ball up and an eye for goal. A £30m release clause saw United try to persuade him to move to Old Trafford, but in the end Chelsea were seen as a more enticing option and United had to go back to the drawing board.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo joined to strengthen United's attack but the Reds were still missing a focal point at the top of the pitch. Viktor Gyokeres chose Arsenal so with options running out, United turned to Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Younger than both Delap and Gyokeres and without experience of English football, it was a gamble to spend an initial £66m, which could rise to £72m, to bring the forward in. Indeed, it may still be a gamble that doesn't pay off, but there have been signs of promise.",
      "Liam Delap has struggled since joining Chelsea(Image: PA)",
      "Both Delap and Gyokeres have proven to be unwise additions for Chelsea and Arsenal respectively. Delap has struggled with just two goals in 21 appearances for his new club.",
      "Sesko has six in 21. While this is by no means golden boot form either, the Slovenian has at least shown more promise than Delap and has a higher ceiling for improvement.",
      "His goal on Sunday against Fulham could be a huge turning point. Bouncing back from hitting the post shortly after coming on, Sesko showed brilliant composure to win the game for United in stoppage time. He may have cost them £36m more than Delap would have done but in the long-term this could be money well spent.",

      "The 16-year-old son of Wayne Rooney, Kai, has spoken out with a four-word message after it was reported that he has been presented a contract by Manchester United.",
      "Kai has spent several years in the United academy and plays as an attacker, just like Rooney Senior. After showing promise in the youth system, Kai is amongst a group of 14 exceptionally talented youngsters who is said to have been presented with new terms by United.",
      "The Sun first reported on Thursday that Kai and Jacey Carrick, the son of the Red Devils' current head coach, Michael, have been presented with new deals alongside others. If accepted, Rooney Jr would sign a one-year scholarship which would then convert to a three-year professional contract when he reaches 17.",
      "It was added that the contract would see him earn approximately £50,000 per year plus an annual signing-on fee, though the Rooney family are yet to approve the deal.",
      "But just a matter of hours after the report was ran by The Sun and then the Daily Mail, Kai responded. Indeed, in an Instagram story, Kai said: \"don't listen to mail [three laughing face emojis].\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "A source told The Sun in the initial report: \"The group is very strong and the majority of the boys including Kai and Jacey have been offered deals. It means when they finish school they can go into full-time 'football employment' and then when they turn 17 are guaranteed a pro status.",
      "\"They still have a long way to go to make the grade, but they can be very proud that the club thinks they have a chance of making it.\"",
      "Wayne, who holds the record for the most goals scored for the club, expressed his pride last month after watching his eldest son play for Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup against Derby County.",
      "He said: \"Kai got moved up to the under-18s squad for the Youth Cup and it was great to see him come on. It brought back memories of when I played in the Youth Cup for Everton.",
      "Kai Rooney will hope to make many more appearances at Old Trafford(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "\"It was a proud moment and I'm delighted for him. Hopefully he continues that and he can have a good run with the team.\"",
      "Kai's mother, Coleen, has emphasised that they have not pushed their children to follow in Wayne's footsteps. Speaking to The Mirror in September 2024, she stated: \"We've never pressured them into even playing football. We've always just let them decide what they want to do. My eight-year-old was playing and doing really well but then decided he didn't want to, and that's OK.",
      "\"I think they sometimes get pressure off other people, you know. People approach them now and then if we're out, they do say, 'Are you are as good as your dad?' Kai says 'I'm a different type of player.' You've got to let them know that you don't have to follow and to be your own person.\"",
      "Kai Rooney in action at Old Trafford(Image: Getty)",
      "Wayne has expressed his satisfaction with the interest Michael Carrick and his coaching team have shown in the academy since taking over. Speaking on his BBC podcast last month, he said: \"It is great to see all the coaches taking a big interest in the academy. In the next few years, some of those players might get an opportunity for the first team, so it is important they have that interest.",
      "\"On Saturday, they were all at the under-16s game as well before they travelled to London. It is great to see that coming back into the club.",
      "\"I have been quite vocal on this. It used to be the norm but it has been missing in the last few years. With my two lads in the academy, I haven't seen that and it was a bit disappointing.

      "Jose Mourinho signed Diogo Dalot in the summer of 2018",
      "It feels like simplicity has been the watchword for the major decisions Michael Carrick has made in his short time in charge of Manchester United. He has restored a system that suits the players available to him and put them back in positions where they can thrive.",
      "He has restored the Premier League's best attacking midfielder to the position of attacking midfielder. He's brought in one of the country's best young midfielders and seen him shine. England's best left-back of the last decade is now playing at left-back.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Luke Shaw are three of the obvious examples to benefit from Carrick unpicking some of the tactical decisions made by Ruben Amorim, but the list could go on and on.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Diogo Dalot is another who is finding his best form of the season, and the reasons for that are common sense. Dalot and Amorim had a close relationship, but over 14 months, the plan to turn the Portugal international into an elite-level wing-back never came to fruition.",
      "The position didn't suit his natural strengths and the regular switches from right wing to left wing didn't help. Often asked to play like a winger, Dalot never truly convinced as the answer if United were to stick with wing-backs.",
      "But the tactical change under Carrick has restored the 26-year-old to right-back, and he has immediately looked more comfortable back in his natural position. He looked as good as he has this season against Fulham, finding a better rhythm going forward and seeing so much of the ball that he ended up having more touches than any of his teammates.",
      "That can sometimes be a misleading stat. Fulham might have been happier to see the ball funnelled wide to Dalot than elsewhere on the pitch, but he did create a couple of chances, and his confidence looks to be returning.",
      "It certainly took a hit earlier in the season and it's noticeable that the crowd has turned against him at times during this campaign. There is no doubt Dalot's performance level for sections of this season has been below the standards expected. But with a strong end, he could yet secure his future in the team. It was interesting to hear Gary Neville discuss Dalot last month and suggest he felt he could yet have a role to play long-term.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"He gets a really harsh view at times [from] quite a few United fans. I do think there’s a half-decent full-back in there, and I watch full-backs so closely,\" said Neville.",
      "\"I think he’s actually good in the air. I think he’s got good athleticism about him. I think he’s decent on the ball. I don’t think he’s a world-class full-back, but neither was I.",
      "\"I think he’s got something about him. I think he’s got 7/10[s] in him every single week, Dalot, but because we’ve seen him at left wing-back, we’ve seen him at right wing-back, we’ve seen him exposed so many times.",
      "\"I think if he just played right full-back and played there all the time, I wouldn’t be getting rid of him in a hurry.\"",
      "It's not an unqualified endorsement from Neville, but it is balanced. Dalot would certainly aspire to be more than \"half-decent\", but given a run in his favourite position for the rest of this season, he will get a chance to prove he can be.",
      "United have been linked with right-backs in recent years, but it could drop down the list of priorities this summer. They want two central midfielders and a left-winger, while a centre-back might be needed if Harry Maguire leaves. Another goalkeeper will also be on the agenda.",
      "Depending on the budget, director of football Jason Wilcox and whoever the head coach is next season might decide that right-back options Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui would suffice.",
      "That would take Dalot into a ninth year at Old Trafford. When he joined the club in 2018, Jose Mourinho called him the best young right-back in Europe and said he could be in the United side for \"10 years\". That has looked unlikely at times, but Dalot is edging closer to fulfilling that prophecy.",
      "He hasn't always been first-choice and he has had times when he has been significantly out of favour, noticeably under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. There are also supporters who would say the fact that he is still the club's first-choice right-back is evidence of recruitment failures.",
      "But from what we have seen in the last couple of weeks, United might well have bigger issues to fix this summer than right-back. If Dalot can keep up a better run of form from now until May, his status at the club is probably in his own hands.",

      "De Ligt meanwhile is getting back towards full fitness but has not featured for the Reds since the victory over Crystal Palace last year. United's interim head coach suggested there was still a possibility the club could play some mid-season friendlies to keep the squad fresh due to gaps in their schedule.",

It has been expected for most of the campaign that United would go abroad at some point and their early exit from the FA Cup opened up a window this month and two more in March.

As soon as you come you’re made aware and you can’t help but know and understand the history. It’s a responsibility to know what came before us and the behaviours and responsibilities we need to carry through. Munich is the biggest part of the history of this club, the tragedy itself and how the team and the football club bounced back. And the success which carried on. Sir Alex mentioned it when I came, it was important to him and us, it’s a way of life for the club. It’s important we carry it on, I was here for the 50th, 60th, we will see about the 70th. Being aware of it and around it, you really feel that emotion. Inside the stadium on Saturday we’ll feel it as well.",
      "The players have been spot on and fully focused. We’re all aware of the bigger situation and what might happen. As a player, you focus on what’s ahead of you, trying to achieve what you can at this moment in time and the rest of the season. I’ve got no concerns. The lads have been better than you can imagine. We’re focused on being better, improving and getting ourselves and this club to where we want to be. Small steps but it’s a big end to the season.",

      "Coming in at the very start and the games so quickly, it was kind of step by step. I wasn’t looking too far ahead. People were saying at the time the first two games were standout and we expedited a tough start and in some ways that helped get the whole group focused and alive. I didn't look too far ahead. Over time we got a vague idea of what we wanted to look like and since we’ve been here that becomes a lot clearer of what direction we want to go in and how we want to play. The three wins have been fantastic in different ways. We’ve got a lot of growth in the team and squad.",
      "They certainly bring a challenge. The way they finished the game the other day, they’ve had, over a period, players injured, a lot of changes to the team which makes things more difficult. They’re getting players back, they have really good attackers that look to stretch the backline and play forward and attack the box an awful lot. A slightly different game to what we’ve played in recent weeks but we’re looking forward to, we are in a good place, the boys have worked well again this week. Feet on the ground, let’s not get carried away. It’s about what’s next. Big challenge ahead.",
      "It was pretty instant. I have really fond memories of Tottenham, I was there for what feels like a short time but really enjoyed it. Good team, Martin Jol was manager, a lot of things I learnt at the club in a short period. Coming here was a big jump and I felt that pretty quickly. Once you step inside this place as a footballer it turns you, from the first day walking into the dressing room and meeting the manager, that was me.",

He has restored a system that suits the players available to him and put them back in positions where they can thrive. He has restored the Premier League's best attacking midfielder to the position of attacking midfielder. He's brought in one of the country's best young midfielders and seen him shine. England's best left-back of the last decade is now playing at left-back.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Luke Shaw are three of the obvious examples to benefit from Carrick unpicking some of the tactical decisions made by Ruben Amorim, but the list could go on and on.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Young Manchester United striker Chido Obi has had a personal training session with former Premier League striker Papiss Cisse, with the 18-year-old keen to continue adding elements to his game. Obi broke into the United first team when injuries hit last year, but his development has continued at academy level this season, where he has eight goals in 21 games across various competitions. The former Arsenal youngster was videoed speaking to Cisse in a session arranged by personal skills coach Kwaku Ohemeng, who works with several players in the north west, including United winger Patrick Dorgu.",
      "Cisse scored 44 goals in 131 appearances for Newcastle United and also had spells in Germany, China and Turkey. Now 40, he has settled in Cheshire and occasionally turns out still for Wythenshawe Vets.",

      "United's interim head coach has been nominated for the Premier League's manager of the month for January. Despite only being in charge for two matches in their opening month of 2026, Carrick masterminded victories over City and Arsenal to put the Reds firmly in the fight for Champions League qualification. Also nominated are:",
      "Fans can vote for the winner here.",
      "United are interested in RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande as they consider attacking reinforcements this summer, but they will face serious competition for the Ivory Coast star. United missed out on a January move for Antoine Semenyo, with the forward joining Manchester City for £62.5million, and opted not to pursue any other targets during the window. While central midfield is a major priority heading into the summer, United will also try to sign a left-winger and Diomande is a player they have monitored and someone who is of interest.",
      "The 19-year-old has had a breakthrough season for RB Leipzig, registering eight goals and six assists in 21 games in Germany. Diomande only turned 19 in November but is already attracting the attention of some of Europe's biggest clubs. The right-footed attacker can play on both wings but would be seen as an option on the left at Old Trafford.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "The injury Patrick Dorgu picked up against Arsenal made Michael Carrick's decision a simple one last week, but had the in-form winger remained fit, it would have been interesting to see how the Manchester United head coach would have dealt with a predicament that is threatening to become a regular occurrence. After two goals in two games against Manchester City and Arsenal, Dorgu looked to have nailed down the spot on the left wing in Carrick's 4-2-3-1 system. The headache was Matheus Cunha, who came off the bench in both matches to register an assist and a goal.",
      "Carrick was interesting when speaking about the Brazilian at the Emirates Stadium after he scored the late winner, explaining how disappointed he had been not to start either game, but that he had channelled that frustration in the right way to make an impact off the bench.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "United will invest in their midfield in the summer transfer window. Casemiro will leave at the end of the season, bringing down the curtain on four years in Manchester. United agreed to Casemiro’s request to confirm his summer departure, and a video with the Brazilian explaining his decision was released on club channels. United sources said the decision not to renew Casemiro's contract had been made well in advance of the announcement.",
      "Michael Carrick recently said his opinion would be canvassed on potential replacements for Casemiro, and the conversation about who should succeed the 33-year-old is ongoing among supporters.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Those of you who follow our press conference blogs regularly may be wondering why Carrick will be speaking to the media today instead of tomorrow. This is because Friday marks the 67th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster and United will be paying their respects to those who died at Old Trafford tomorrow. Therefore, to avoid a clash with the service, Carrick will be speaking a day earlier.",
      "The United interim head coach will be speaking to the media this afternoon at 2.30pm. An embargo will be set on those quotes until 3pm. Once that lifts, we shall be bringing you everything Carrick has had to say.",
      "Good morning and welcome along to the United pre-match press conference blog.",
      "Carrick will be speaking to the media this afternoon to preview the clash with Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday lunchtime. Spirits in the United camp will be high thanks to that late victory over Fulham on Sunday. The Reds have now won three on the bounce and are keeping pace with Chelsea and Liverpool, who are also challenging for the top four.",
      "Spurs enjoyed an impressive comeback against City at the weekend but Thomas Frank remains a man under pressure and United will hope they can pile some more on him at Old Trafford.",

      "Following a summer that saw them bring in players like Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, United chose not to spend during the winter window. These acquisitions were made for head coach Ruben Amorim, but he was dismissed in January after a 14-month period at the club.",
      "Carrick has taken over as interim manager and following victories against Manchester City and Arsenal, his team secured a dramatic 3-2 triumph over Fulham to maintain a perfect record of three wins from three. Meanwhile, loanee Marcus Rashford continues to impress at Barcelona, with reports suggesting a decision has been reached about his future.",

      "Despite such a productive loan spell, United legend Nani still believes Rashford doesn't measure up to one of his Blaugrana team-mates, Lamine Yamal. In a video posted on social media for Goal, Nani was asked to compare some of Europe's leading attackers.",
      "Initially, the Portuguese icon was asked to choose between Barcelona's Yamal and Chelsea prospect Estevao. He selected the former. Next, Rashford and Bukayo Saka were presented to Nani for his judgement. He picked Rashford before making several other choices.",
      "In the following round, it was Rashford alongside team-mate Yamal who were compared. At this point, Nani overlooked the United loanee and said: \"Right now? Lamine Yamal.\" To be fair to Rashford, the 39-year-old went on to select Yamal as his top choice from all the players he was asked about, adding: \"He's my type of player.\"",

The England star had to wait for an opportunity to turn out at Barca's iconic home ground after their return to the redeveloped venue was delayed but the best could be yet to come.",
      "Rashford has already been handed his first minutes at the ground after it reopened - initially with a reduced capacity. There's a chance he could play there on the biggest of stages, though, with Barcelona announcing a desire for the stadium to host the 2029 Champions League final.",

      "\"Atmosphere-wise, I’d probably say I enjoyed Nou Camp,\" Rashford said when asked on The Overlap in 2023 about his favourite stadium. \"The first time we played there we got beat 3-0. We had a couple of chances and I hit the crossbar early on.",
      "\"I think Paul [Pogba] had a shot that clipped the post and this was all at 0-0. Once they got the first goal, the crowd was different.

      "Rashford could soon get the chance not just to play a final at a stadium he admires but to do so as a Barcelona player. That would require Camp Nou to be awarded that 2029 final, while the player himself would need to do enough between now and the end of the season to earn a permanent transfer.",

      "Lammens is having an underrated debut season in Manchester. The goalkeeper has brought calm and stability, transmitting confidence when his predecessors had made Old Trafford uneasy.",
      "The 23-year-old made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland in October, and fans celebrated Lammens claiming a cross into the box like a goal. That reaction was a statement from matchgoers, who had become exhausted watching Andre Onana, and then Altay Bayindir.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The bar was low for Lammens to make a strong impression, but the ease with which he's adapted to the Premier League, having come from the Belgian top-flight, has been impressive. There have been times when Lammens should have done better. Danny Welbeck's free-kick for Brighton in October and Kieran Dewsbury's goal for Everton in November were both saveable, but that is nitpicking. There have been no major errors, no blunders that have cost United a game.",
      "Lammens consistently delivers 7/10 performances, with the odd excellent display chucked in for good measure. The Belgian's demeanour has helped him remain unfazed in one of the most scrutinised No.1 roles in the world. He was happy to speak in the mixed zone after the win over Liverpool at Anfield, and he spoke again after the victory at Arsenal. On both occasions, he took the initiative to speak to reporters.",
      "Some players ignore requests for a chat as they leave grounds on matchdays, which is their prerogative, but Lammens has thought 'why not' after two big wins. He seems like a good egg, someone impossible not to get along with.",
      "\"I try to keep my best friends and family close. The rest is a bit like outside noise. It's all praise, I know, and I'm realistic, if it does not go so well, it will be all bad commentary,\" he reflected at Anfield.",
      "The ability to remain level-headed after wins and defeats is a common trait shared by the most successful professionals. Lammens celebrated the Liverpool win by spending the evening with a close friend.",

      "But United have another goalkeeper on the books who is ready to challenge Lammens. Radek Vitek is enjoying a wonderful season on loan in the Championship, where United send young players who they believe have potential to feature for the first-team.",
      "Vitek is thriving with Bristol City and he made a save of the season contender against Ipswich Town last month, instinctively stretching a hand to tip the ball over the crossbar when he was on the ground.",
      "Vitek's highlights reel will be worth a watch at the end of the campaign. He's produced a handful of top saves, but he's not just stopping shots for the cameras - he's delivering consistently.",
      "United are delighted with how Vitek's loan spell at Ashton Gate is unfolding. He has made 25 starts in the Championship - he missed five games due to a small knee injury - and looks destined for bigger things.",
      "In November, Vitek said: \"It would be a dream to play for Manchester United, but I will take it game by game, and I know there's a big challenge in front of me, but I want to improve every week.\"",
      "Vitek delivered a man-of-the-match performance in United's opening pre-season friendly against Rosenborg in 2024, but he didn't join last summer's tour of the United States because he was due to leave on loan.",
      "It would be a surprise if Vitek isn't assessed in pre-season this summer. Lammens has made a superb impact, but Vitek has earned the opportunity to be considered to challenge for the No.1 role.",
      "Vitek is ready for another step up.(Image: 2025 CameraSport)",
      "How United's goalkeeper situation will develop remains to be seen. Vitek would be a superb second choice and great competition for Lammens, but would a talented 22-year-old settle for a No.2 role? It seems unlikely. Vitek will be hungry to play every week after such a successful loan spell.",
      "He's had previous loan spells with Accrington Stanley and FC Blau-Weiß Linz, so it would be a shock for him to be happy to play in cup competitions for United, with a view to challenging Lammens.",
      "The Czech knows what it's like to fight for points each week and won't be short of interest from Europe in the summer. He will feel he can succeed elsewhere if he's seen a No.2 in Manchester.",
      "\"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them,\" Vitek said a few months ago.",

      "United have not made a signing and there have been no departures from the first-team squad. The most exciting United-related transfer story, interest in Antoine Semenyo, was effectively put to bed before the window opened.",
      "The £62.5million needed to release Semenyo from his Bournemouth contract was bound to be met and Manchester City won the race for his signature.

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The message from United sources after missing out on Semenyo was consistent: United were unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets were not expected to be available in the winter window. That's not what fans have wanted to hear, though.",
      "Semenyo has scored four goals in five games for City. He is one of the most in-form forwards in the Premier League and would have provided a huge boost in the pursuit of Champions League football.",
      "Carrick has made a dream start to his interim role, winning three games on the bounce, a run that has seen United climb to fourth. The Reds are just 12 points adrift of Arsenal, despite the possibility of being dragged into the bottom half being touted in the final weeks of Ruben Amorim's tenure.",
      "Amorim's sacking did not change much regarding transfers in the window. United had a plan and they have stuck by it. They have not acted because long-term targets were not available.",
      "Semenyo was on the losing side at Old Trafford two weeks ago.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "Carrick revealed at a press conference that he would be consulted on summer plans, though. When asked whether his opinion would be sought on a new midfield signing to replace Casemiro, Carrick said: \"I'm certainly in this position to do that. And as I said, I think, making decisions for the club moving forward, whatever that may be, I'm fully committed to that.",
      "\"Naturally, as a midfielder, then there's a big tendency towards that anyway, but taking that away from it and now being where I am in the position I am, certainly would be part of those conversations and moving forward because it's important when we get the next steps right in terms of moving forward as a team and there's a squad and putting the right things in place. So yeah, I'll be part of that in the right way.\"",
      "Casemiro announcing that he would leave at the end of the season has been one of the biggest headlines. The Brazilian wanted to avoid speculation about his future during the remainder of the season, and his representatives can engage with potential suitors now that confirmation is out.",
      "The announcement was classy, befitting of a player who has enjoyed a magnificent career, and Casemiro will try to bow out by steering the club back into the Champions League.",
      "United splashed £215million in the summer window and were not in a position to sign a Casemiro replacement, who could cost in the region of £100million, in the winter window.",
      "Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are all admired by United, but they will not be prised away cheaply from their respective clubs. It will be fascinating to see how the summer window unfolds.",
      "Although Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee were marked down for possible loan exits, they will continue to contribute at United for the remainder of the season. Mainoo's situation has improved since Carrick's appointment. The youngster was hopeful of leaving on loan before Amorim was sacked.",
      "Roma were interested in signing Zirkzee, but United did not seriously entertain their enquiry. \"United said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago, and they have not changed their minds,\" said Roma's football director.",
      "Tyrell Malacia was ready to travel to Turkey on deadline day, but the plug was pulled on his move to the Super Lig by Jason Wilcox, who decided Malacia was needed at United after Patrick Dorgu's injury.",
      "Wilcox told Malacia on Monday morning that he would be needed as part of the first-team squad for the rest of the season. The Dutchman will be frustrated at missing out on a move away again.",
      "Casemiro scored against Fulham on Sunday.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "The MEN were the first to report Rhys Bennett's move to Fleetwood Town, while Joe Hugill is the only other academy export to have left the club on a permanent transfer in the window.",
      "United have banked nominal fees for Mather, Bennett and Hugill, but the club have started to insist on inserting sell-on clauses to benefit from future success. The challenge for Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is to start obtaining higher transfer fees for youngsters when they leave.",
      "Torpey has overseen the club's loan deals since Jonny Evans stepped back from his role as head of loans and pathways in December. Sources with knowledge of the situation indicated the pace of the role was too slow for Evans.",
      "There were loan departures confirmed on deadline day. Ethan Wheatley's move to Bradford City was formally announced, while James Scanlon and Jacob Devaney joined Swindon Town and St. Mirren respectively for their first taste of senior football.",
      "There is no rush to confirm Sekou Kone's move to Lausanne-Sport because the Swiss transfer window shuts on February 15 - the expectation is that Kone will stay with Lausanne-Sport for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Academy transfer activity was as exciting as it got in the final hours of the window.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo's future has come under intense scrutiny following his contentious stand-off in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ronaldo, who celebrates his 41st birthday on Thursday, declined to feature for Al-Nassr in their 1-0 win against Al-Riyadh on Monday after becoming incensed by Karim Benzema's transfer to title challengers Al-Hilal. Benzema, Ronaldo's former Real Madrid colleague, had his Al-Ittihad deal cancelled before securing a free transfer to Al-Hilal, who sit one point clear of Al-Nassr at the top of the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The Public Investment Fund (PIF) owns all three sides, and Ronaldo is frustrated that the transfer was approved, believing the acquisition of the French forward has unfairly strengthened Al-Hilal's championship challenge. The circumstances have triggered questions about whether Ronaldo will complete the remaining 18 months of his £488,000-per-day agreement with Al-Nassr.",
      "Could the five-time Ballon d'Or recipient make a remarkable third return to Manchester United? Not according to his former colleague, Wes Brown, who told BettingLounge: \"He's not happy, but would Cristiano Ronaldo come back to Manchester United for a third go? I would say no. I can't see how that could happen.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"A move to MLS? Maybe. Maybe he goes back to Portugal and plays there. I'm sure he will still have so many options.",
      "\"The main thing is that he still wants to play in the World Cup, and he would have to keep playing and making sure he keeps himself fit to do that. It's a shock to everyone to see Ronaldo on strike, but I honestly think it will get resolved. We'll have to wait and see where it goes from here.\"",
      "Neither Ronaldo nor any of his teammates and coaching staff have issued public statements following Monday's victory. Head coach Jorge Jesus had his post-match press conference cancelled, with the squad told not to engage with journalists.",
      "Al-Nassr are next in action on Friday, welcoming Al-Ittihad, though Ronaldo's participation remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Al-Hilal will take on bottom-dwellers Al-Akhdoud on home soil.",
      "The table-toppers have offered Al-Nassr a glimmer of opportunity in recent weeks, sharing the spoils in their previous two outings. A failure to overcome Al-Akhdoud would give Al-Nassr the chance to claim top spot, having last lifted the trophy in 2019, well before Ronaldo's switch from United in 2022.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "You’d better believe it’s a big weekend, kicking off with the inevitable bringer-of-chaos that is Man United v Spurs and then finishing with the enticing possibilities of what Liverpool and Man City might conjure up at Anfield.",
      "And there’s plenty of good stuff in between and around the country and indeed continent.",
      "We’re really looking forward to this one.",
      "",
      "Who said Liverpool wouldn’t be involved in the title race? They can be front and centre here in confirming there will not in fact be a title race at all.",
      "We make it now five times Arsenal have been confirmed as champions and six times the title race has been declared back on, but it really would be hard to see how we get anything other than Arsenal ending all those years of hurt if this weekend goes wrong for City.",
      "With Arsenal slumming it in a Saturday 3pm slot for the second weekend in a row, by the time City arrive at Anfield for Super Sunday’s headliner they could be staring at a nine-point deficit and firmly in must-win territory.",
      "That’s not ideal when you’re going to Anfield and in your last away game you failed to win from 2-0 up against a team who at the time had fewer home points than anyone bar Wolves and had almost entirely run out of available adult footballers.",
      "City got themselves back on track a bit with a Carabao paddling of Newcastle in the second leg of their semi-final, but you’d imagine they are at least a little bit trying to work out what happened in that second half at Spurs.",
      "The concession of two goals was bad, of course, but in many ways more troubling was the fact that as things got so very far away from a team that had been in such effortless first-half control, Erling Haaland and co. managed not one second-half attempt on target against a defence of Archie Gray, Joao Palhinha, Radu Dragusin and Destiny Udogie. Or put another way, a Tottenham defence that has struggled all season was able to repel City’s advances with its third-choice right-back and fourth and fifth-choice centre-backs.",
      "It’s not a great look for City. Or for Newcastle’s defence in the first half of that Carabao clash, now we think of it.",
      "Liverpool may not have title deeds to think of for themselves this weekend, but they do still have plenty to think about having found themselves embroiled in what will likely but not definitely distil into a three-into-two Champions League squabble with Chelsea and Man United for fourth and fifth.",
      "And Liverpool are already the ones on the outside looking in knowing those two can both increase that gap on Saturday. And both are up against relegation stragglers, with Chelsea travelling to Wolves and United hosting Spurs.",
      "",
      "Which brings us neatly to our team to watch. Although frankly it’s both of them, because Man United v Spurs is a lovely little Saturday lunchtime treat for us all.",
      "Spurs against A Manchester Club is about as close to a guarantee of nonsense as the Premier League can provide. The game against City last weekend delivered in grand style, and there’s no reason to think this one won’t do likewise.",
      "United themselves remain pleasingly absurd even when in good form, so long may that continue. They have developed a particular habit this year for late twists. Emphasis on plural. There are few more extreme emotions in football than joy and relief following hot on the heels of despair, and United have perfected the art this season.",
      "Their last two games have been 3-2 wins in which they’ve conceded a late equaliser then scored an even later winner, something they also did this season at Anfield, while in the reverse fixture at Spurs they were ahead at 83 minutes, behind at 91 and level at 96.",
      "Michael Carrick has them on a three-game winning run that has prompted inevitable chatter about his interim role becoming a permanent one, because there’s no way promoting an under-qualified club legend in such fashion could ever backfire.",
      "But this is in many ways his biggest test, because he’s up against a team so stupid. More stupid even than his own. He’s beaten the two best teams in the country and in Fulham an extremely competent one. He has therefore yet to face a challenge like Spurs, a team who City can once again attest are impossible to get your head around, and who United haven’t beaten in the last nine attempts. Including, of course, United suffering just about the most embarrassing fate it’s possible for a professional football team to suffer by contriving to lose to Spurs in an actual final.",
      "Luckily for United and everyone, Spurs have already ensured they will not be using that trophy win as any kind of launchpad. That’s not the way they do things, and we’re already just a Champions League last-16 exit away from confirming year one of the next decade-plus trophy drought, one in which simply remaining in the Premier League might become a stretch target.",
      "But for now what Spurs do still have is some kind of bizarre hold over the Manchester clubs, and one that United could really do with putting right this weekend. For football reasons, with Champions League qualification very much in sight, but perhaps just as importantly for their own sanity.",
      "",
      "Brentford have been the Premier League’s surprise package this year, with a widely predicted relegation fight having never remotely materialised in a season that has instead turned into an unlikely tilt at Europe under rookie boss Keith Andrews.",
      "A large part of that has been the spectacular way Igor Thiago has emerged from the shadows of the now departed Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa to score seven more Premier League goals this season than that pair combined.",
      "With Haaland having endured one of his oddly familiar mid-season slumps in front of goal, Thiago still retains genuine hope of being crowned the least likely Golden Boot winner for many a year, trailing by just four and seemingly facing Newcastle at a very good time here.",
      "Two of his 16 Premier League goals this season came in the 3-1 win over Wissa’s new team back in November, and Newcastle hit this return fixture at a low ebb.",
      "Since a three-game winning run in the Premier League at the turn of the year appeared to have turned them back into European contenders, it’s all gone wrong again. Newcastle’s only wins in eight games since have been against PSV in the Champions League and Bournemouth on penalties after a wild 3-3 draw in the FA Cup.",
      "Even in that winning run they also conceded three goals to Leeds. Aston Villa and City have both beaten them 2-0 at St James’ Park in recent weeks, and in the last week alone Newcastle have conceded seven goals in two games at Liverpool and City.",
      "Eddie Howe is coming under pressure and could really do without the sight of the Premier League’s second-best striker right about now.",
      "",
      "We already know this will be Glasner’s last time managing Palace in the not-local-but-very-real Brighton derby; what’s less clear is how many more games he’ll be in charge of Palace altogether.",
      "It does all feel rather futile trying to sustain this visibly, grumpily broken marriage through to the summer, especially while every game for which the relationship continues Palace tumble closer and closer to mortal peril.",
      "They probably won’t go down, but it would be nice to be able to say it with any kind of confidence about a team that has simply stopped winning football matches altogether as the infighting takes over.",
      "Even Palace’s fellow relegation-tumblers Spurs are managing to kick the sh*t out of some ragtag collections of poor old German farmers every now and then.

      "After Brighton, Palace’s next four games are against Burnley and Wolves in the Premier League and the two legs of their Conference punishment-round tie against Zrinjski Mostar. So Glasner and the lads don’t necessarily have to get that long-awaited win in this weekend’s formbook-out-the-window caper. But if they still don’t have one a couple of weeks from now, then things are very bad indeed.",

      "But never mind that. Yer da will say that these are proper teams because their first three Premier League seasons together were the first three seasons of the Premier League – the Premiership glory days. These are the sorts of teams who if they do find themselves in the second tier will be managed by someone like Steve Bruce and he will describe them as “Premier League teams in all but name”.",
      "Except right now they absolutely are not. They are much closer to being League One teams in actual name, and this is another huge six-pointer in a Championship relegation scrap that has developed a strikingly Premier League Years look to it.",
      "Leicester’s six-point punishment this week leaves us with West Brom, Blackburn, Leicester, Portsmouth and Norwich all either in the relegation zone or within a point of it approaching the finishing straight.",

      "They may still be reeling from the astonishing way they were bounced out of the Champions League via their own shambolic 3-0 defeat at Club Brugge and Benfica’s injury-time goalkeeper nonsense against Real Madrid, but a second win of the season over PSG would get them back on the fringes of the title race and certainly help lift that slightly darkening mood.",

      "It’s Manchester United v Tottenham this weekend and that makes us very excited.",
      "The reason isn’t complicated; it’s because it’s almost guaranteed to be absurd but even more importantly with absolutely no guarantee about which specific way(s) it will be absurd.",
      "That’s the real fun. It will be ridiculous, sure, but not one of us can possibly know exactly how it will be ridiculous.",
      "Only a certified idiot would attempt to predict what would happen in this latest clash between the two stupidest big Premier League clubs over the last couple of years.",
      "Here then are our predictions for what will happen in this latest clash between the two stupidest big Premier League clubs over the last couple of years.",
      "",
      "Emphasis very much on the multiple here. That’s the key to this bit. Obviously every team has games that feature late drama. It is an integral part of the game for everyone, for both good and bad.",
      "Nobody goes through a season without at least a bit of late drama.",
      "What we have here, though, are two teams whose penchant for the ridiculous often extends to the best kind of late drama, where one late sucker punch is followed by another even later sucker punch, increasingly the comedy levels of the whole thing.",
      "The reverse fixture between these two earlier in the season was a classic of the genre. United were leading until Spurs equalised in the 84th minute and then went ahead through Richarlison in stoppage time.",
      "Cue a typical quiet and restrained Richarlison celebration and further proof that the Brazilian taking his shirt off is one of the most reliable harbingers of doom this universe has yet devised.",
      "After Spurs went ahead in the first added minute, United equalised in the last, leaving neither side remotely sure whether or not they should be happy about what they’d won or annoyed at what they’d spaffed away. Which for us is the perfect outcome to any football match.",
      "FUN FACT: This match took place just 90 days ago and a now relegation-fearing Spurs were 30 seconds away from going SECOND IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE.",
      "But while it’s a wonderfully pure example, as you’d expect from a game featuring both these idiots, it is far from a rogue outlier in either side’s season.",
      "Just last week, United lost and regained the lead against Fulham in stoppage-time. At Arsenal they responded to an 84th-minute equaliser with an absurd winner three minutes later. In their other big cathartic win over a historical rival in Liverpool the timings were slightly earlier but still valid, with Liverpool’s 78th-minute leveller countered by Harry Maguire’s giant cheat-code of a head six minutes later.",
      "In a wild 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in December, United trailed after 76 minutes and led after 79 before being pegged back again.",
      "In addition to the United game, Spurs have this season managed to fall behind twice and hit back twice all within the final 20 minutes of a 2-2 draw at Newcastle, and experienced the absurd delights of watching Joao Palhinha score his second overhead kick of the season (more on that later) to drag them level at Bournemouth only for Antoine Semenyo to score a winner with his last kick before joining Man City, for whom he would inevitably also score against Spurs a few short weeks later.",
      "Spurs have drawn 2-2 against PSG in a game they led 2-0 with five minutes remaining, and have drawn three games in which they have trailed 2-0 (Brighton, Bodo/Glimt, Man City).",
      "Three of Tottenham’s last four Premier League games have featured result-altering stoppage-time goals, and the one that didn’t contained one of the least likely comebacks from 2-0 down you could possibly imagine.",
      "And let’s not forget either that these two teams also had a 4-3 caper in last season’s Carabao in which a 3-0 Spurs lead was cut to 3-2 before Son Heung-min scored direct from a corner with two minutes to go, which still left time enough for Jonny Evans to score United’s third and keep Spurs honest in the closing seconds.",
      "",
      "United have scored some very good goals this season, with Matheus Cunha at Arsenal a fine recent example. But this category has surely been more of a Spurs speciality and does feel particularly on-brand.",
      "What we like best about the sheer number of genuinely ridiculous goals Spurs have scored this season is that they’ve had these frequent oases of genius and/or ridiculousness dotted around in a barren wasteland of what is unanimously agreed to be some of the worst and most joyless, uninspired and uninspiring attacking play this or any other club has ever produced. It is genuinely unwatchable at times yet very occasionally utterly unmissable at others.",
      "Spurs have so far this season scored: four overhead kicks (one of them by a centre-back – an equaliser deep into stoppage-time, naturally – and two from a workhorse, tackle-loving defensive midfielder), a box-to-box individual effort sure to get a Puskas nomination (also scored by a centre-back, but a different one), a completely pointless goal from 45 yards out in the middle of what otherwise appeared to be some kind of anti-football dirty protest of a performance in a humbling at Arsenal, and a scorpion kick to provide what was, in multiple ways, the single most unlikely equalising goal on record.",
      "So we will accept nothing less here than Destiny Udogie running the length of Old Trafford before scoring an overhead rabona from 37 yards. In the 98th minute. Before Bruno Fernandes scores a penalty in the 101st.",
      "",
      "Not, admittedly, a novel idea. But surely never a stronger claim than now.",
      "We make no apologies for the fact Romero is one of our absolute favourites. There’s always something about any player who combines genuine elite talent with what at times borders on a kind of actual madness.",
      "It also means he is often unfairly punished because there are few players more conspicuously preceded by their reputation, but never mind that now because on this occasion it helps us because we are actively predicting it.",
      "Romero is an emotional sort, prone to head-loss and at all times capable of losing the entire run of himself. It can happen at any time.",
      "But consider the current state of things and it’s easy to see why this is a perfect storm of a game.",
      "First of all, Romero can go rogue at any moment but does tend to preserve his red-card shenanigans for the biggest games. His three Premier League red cards have come against Manchester City, Chelsea and this season against Liverpool. His other two Tottenham red cards have been against Milan in the Champions League and, well, Vitesse Arnhem in the Conference League so forget about that last one.",
      "Four out of five in all and three out of three in the Barclays is still a trend, okay. Shut up.",
      "There is also his current frame of mind to consider. We’ve all seen the switch flick in games with Romero and realised what might come next. “Oh, he’s ticking,” Gary Neville will caution on co-commentary with all the faux-concern of David Brent fearing a September wedding could be a washout.",
      "Romero is going to start this game already ticking loudly after lashing out and going in two-footed, studs-ablaze on the Spurs suits after a deadline day squib.",
      "He’s also been ill, which restricted him to 45 lethargic and painful minutes against City last weekend, and none of us is at our best mentally or emotionally when we’re poorly, are we?",
      "It all has us wondering what’s the earliest in a game anyone has suffered the ‘save him from himself’ pre-red-card substitution? Because it could happen in the warm-up here.",
      "",
      "Okay, so a bit cake-and-eat-it this one, but what we’re saying here is that it’s not going to be like 1-1 or 2-1. It’s either going to have all of the goals or none.",
      "United’s last two Premier League games have been 3-2 wins and Spurs’ last two Premier League games have been 2-2 draws so we’re very hopeful it’s the former. Spurs have conceded at least twice in their last five games against Premier League opposition (one of those was Villa in the FA Cup)",
      "For Man United, it’s four of the last five (again including a 2-1 home FA Cup defeat, in this case against Brighton).",
      "Both clubs’ runs include conceding twice against Burnley, who have only managed to score twice in eight Premier League games this season. For added fun, one of the other six was also against Man United in one of what are now the Red Devils’ trademark 3-2 wins.",
      "We also of course have the 2-2 draw between these two sides from earlier in the season, as well as that 4-3 Carabao caper last season.",
      "But we must also prepare ourselves for the fact that these two sides are also capable of taking a game that appears to offer a near guarantee of goals – and also brilliant ones – yet instead provide none of that.",
      "The Europa League final remains one of the funniest things ever to happen because imagine losing to Tottenham in an actual final, but it was also one of the most wretched football matches ever staged in which Spurs scored the scrappiest imaginable version of their favourite goal under Ange – cross from the left, converted from close range by Brennan Johnson – and then defended for their lives against a United side with absolutely no idea how or what to do to prevent the banter apocalypse about to befall them.",
      "And you might say well that was such a high-stakes game for both sides it was bound to happen. But Spurs also beat United 1-0 in a crap league game last year where an early James Maddison goal was enough.",
      "Spurs famously beat United four times last season, and United failed to score in three of those games. Remember, this was a Spurs team being managed by Ange Postecoglou, a man who considered the entire concept of ‘defending’ to be an act of craven cowardice that bordered on cheating.",
      "Goals appear so inevitable here that, sure, it might be 4-4 after one team is 4-0 up after 17 minutes. But it’s also just possible these two teams are capable of stupidity that cancels the other’s out so entirely that it instead ends up the worst 0-0 draw you’ve ever seen.",
      "",
      "The boldest shout, because Spurs these days specialise in beating teams from daft little farmers’ leagues from unlikely-sounding countries such as ‘Germany’, while losing to pretty any proper (i.e. English) team.",
      "But there are a few reasons to suspect it could happen here. Firstly, a Spurs win is funnier than a Man United win and that is a powerful force in the universe.",
      "Spurs have also just emerged from a five-game Premier League run against Brentford, Sunderland, Bournemouth, West Ham and Burnley in which they took only three points and no wins. It’s vital and inevitable they outperform that pathetic return against mainly bad sides in the run of five games against mainly good sides currently underway against City, United, Newcastle, Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "A win at Old Trafford to clinch it just two games in would be powerfully Spurs and enormously United.",
      "There is also the perplexing fact that these days United don’t ever actually beat Spurs. We all know the four defeats from four games antics of last season, but they form just part of what is now a nine-game winless run for United against Spurs in all competitions.",
      "Imagine that. Imagine going nine straight games against the stupidest team in the world without a single win; it would be enough to make you think that maybe you are in fact the stupidest team in the world. Now there’s a thought.",
      "The last time Man United beat Spurs, Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick and Harry Kane was on the scoresheet. It was a long time ago, is what we’re saying here, and seems even longer than it actually is, which is a less impressive-sounding ‘just under four years ago’.",
      "We also think Spurs will win because we think United will lose. Obvious, but there you go. Simple reason being that recent history tells us that United will always lose in ludicrous fashion at the precise moment they think they’re on to something.",
      "No club turns more corners only to end up right back where they began than United, and three straight wins is just about perfect. We all obviously thought the Fulham game was ideal ‘come unstuck’ territory after beating City and Arsenal but think about it. That was too obvious. That was such an obviously different game from those first two of the Carrick Era that it would’ve been too predictable for it to go wrong there.",
      "No, far better to scrape through that by the skin of their arse and then actually come unstuck a week later against Banter FC.",
      "We do, admittedly, have some time for the counter-argument that what United will actually do is keep winning games until they eventually give in and, against their better judgement, give Carrick the job permanently only for results to then fall off a cliff.",
      "Which leads us to the safest conclusion of all. The funniest outcome here is for Spurs to win, or at least not lose, or for Man United to win.",
      "We can’t wait.",
      "The Newcastle fan sentiment towards Eddie Howe has turned: he has done a phenomenal job but no longer is he the definitive best man for it. Is Jesse Marsch?",
      "The Premier League weekend begins and ends with a couple of highly promising opportunities for nonsense, with more good stuff in between.",

      "Angel Gomes was being heralded as the possible solution for Manchester United and England a little over a year ago, but now the diminutive midfield conductor finds himself at rock-bottom Wolves after a summer move to Marseille failed to pay dividends. But might a brief spell in the Premier League open up a back door to his boyhood team?",
      "“Coming here, I’ll try and show what I can do, what I’m about, try and be a positive addition to the team, and try to be as positive as possible to help in all aspects,” Gomes has said having made the loan switch to Wolves, aware that the rest of the season will act as a four-month shop window for alternative suitors.",
      "Given his “excitement” at returning to the Premier League, he’s not about to agree to a permanent move to a Championship-bound side, should Wolves take up the option from Marseille, if there are top flight sides keen on signing him in the summer.",
      "After Jose Mourinho nearly made him cry at Manchester United amid a crisis of confidence which threatened to derail his career entirely, Gomes opted to leave for France despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s attempts to keep him at Old Trafford. Some hugely impressive displays at the heart of Lille’s midfield led to a shock England call from Lee Carsley for the Nations League games at the end of 2024.",
      "At that stage, when Manchester United were knee-deep in a midfield crisis which has now abated but not yet been solved, Gomes was heavily linked with a return to his former club, for whom he made his senior debut alongside a certain Michael Carrick.",
      "“I came on and Michael Carrick did everything possible to allow me to touch the ball,” Gomes told The Guardian about his United debut in 2018. “Every time he had it, I could see that he was looking for me.”",
      "Carrick named Gomes, along with Marcus Rashford, Romelu Lukaku, Luke Shaw and Jesse Lingard, as “real, real talent” which made him feel as though he could retire with the club in safe hands. There’s clearly a mutual respect.",
      "Whether there’s enough respect to push Carrick into vouching for Gomes in a discussion with the INEOS bosses over midfield additions in the summer remains to be seen, which when added to the uncertainty of Carrick’s long-term future at the club and if the United chiefs will take any notice of his thoughts on transfers if he is handed the reins on a permanent basis combines to make Gomes to Manchester United feel a whole lot of unlikely.",
      "But amid talk of the Red Devils analysts processing the stats of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba with a view to picking their ideal new midfielder, very little has been made of the very high likelihood that they’ll need two of them, if – as we’re led to believe – Manuel Ugarte is set to follow Casemiro out of the club having failed to meet the mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Unless they have £200m to spend on two of those three top candidates, and they don’t, United are going to need to source a low-cost option to bolster the squad on top of that marquee addition.",
      "Truth is it’s going to be hard for Gomes to prove he’s that option in one of the worst teams in Premier League history, just as it will be hard for commentators to cover Wolves games featuring Angel Gomes alongside namesakes Joao, Rodrigo and Toti, but at least he’s been handed the chance to knock on that back door to Manchester United, which Carrick may be more amenable than others to open if he’s still in the job."

      "We’ve ranked the top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025/26 season. The biggest takeaway? Sunderland have absolutely smashed it.",
      "Arsenal spent big on Zubimendi and it’s instantly paid off, with those around him taking their game to another level, namely Declan Rice.",
      "Sunderland, meanwhile, were ambitious enough to convince Xhaka to return to the Premier League. They immediately gave him the captaincy, and his leadership and quality have elevated the Black Cats.",
      "Anyway, signings of the season ahoy. Here’s our Premier League top 10. Click here for those signings who might just be a bit sh*t.",
      "",
      "From Bertrand Traore for only £2.1m to Habib Diarra for £27m via Granit Xhaka for £13m, Sunderland’s summer business has aged tremendously. We honestly can’t believe how successful their signings have been.",
      "With the exception of Simon Adingra, Sunderland didn’t waste a single penny. Reinildo on a free transfer has been a revelation and Sadiki has made £15m look like an absolute bargain as well.",
      "The former Union St-Gilloise midfielder gave up Champions League football to join the ambitious Black Cats and will not regret that decision. Of all the players Regis Le Bris brought to the club last summer, he feels the most likely to land a huge transfer to a Big Six club.",
      "",
      "Summer signings Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are proving to be very good, very important Manchester United players.",
      "The Red Devils missed Mbeumo during his Africa Cup of Nations exploits and his return has added new life to an attack enjoying their football under Michael Carrick.",
      "Naturally a right-winger, Mbeumo has been played through the middle for United and looks a handful for defenders. His link-up play is good and while he doesn’t win many aerial duels, he is competing for the ball and allowing his team-mates to gobble up second balls. He has been crucial.",
      "",
      "Sunderland dominate this ranking, with Alderete coming in as the second of five Black Cats summer signings.",
      "This guy is a dog. His player-of-the-match performance against Manchester City epitomised everything he’s about. He has that South American bravery that sees him put his body on the line time and time again. He’s just fantastic.",
      "We’re not sure how Sunderland have nailed their summer business to this extent, but they’ve made some absolutely outstanding signings for very modest fees.",
      "",
      "Manchester City signed arguably the best goalkeeper in the world for just £26m. That’s probably all that needs to be said.",
      "Yes, Donnarumma isn’t entirely convincing with the ball at his feet, but he’s hardly clumsy and is arguably underrated in that regard. Pep Guardiola wouldn’t sign him if he didn’t fit the plan, even as Pep adapts to a more direct style in his latest football revolution.",
      "The Italian’s presence has brought calm to City’s backline and he is a monster of a signing in every sense.",
      "",
      "Another monster Man City signing.",
      "Cherki has shown he can win City points on his own and, aside from the goals and assists, he’s simply an incredibly exciting player to watch.",
      "The Frenchman’s flicks and tricks are a joy to behold – a breath of fresh air in an otherwise robotic sport.",
      "",
      "Leeds made some solid additions last summer but none have been better than brilliant German midfielder Stach.",
      "He has added a threat to set-pieces with his ability to take them and his incredible height. Stach brings control to the Leeds midfield and dominates most of his individual battles. Simply put: he’s brilliant.",
      "Stach’s team-mate Dominic Calvert-Lewin deserves an honourable mention.",
      "",
      "If we’re being brutally honest, the signing of Mukiele looked nailed on to be a waste of time and money. It’s been anything but.",
      "Arriving from Paris Saint-Germain after a loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen, he seemed destined to flop.",
      "Instead, the Frenchman has adapted seamlessly to Premier League football, excelling in both a back four and a back five under Regis Le Bris.",
      "",
      "Premier League pacesetters Arsenal look excellent and Zubimendi is a big reason why.",
      "The Spaniard has slotted perfectly into the No.6 role, freeing Declan Rice to push forward and setting off a domino effect that’s lifted Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard too.",
      "He keeps things ticking over beautifully, with the defensive steel Mikel Arteta craves. It will take something special to reach Rodri levels of control, but Zubimendi might be the final piece of Arsenal’s title-winning puzzle.",
      "",
      "Sunderland’s summer business has been a roaring success, and Roefs has been at the heart of it.",
      "The young Dutch goalkeeper has brought calm, composure and confidence between the sticks. We can’t quite believe how good some of Sunderland’s signings have been, and having five of them in this ranking says it all.",
      "",
      "Premier League signing of the season: Granit Xhaka.",
      "We couldn’t believe Xhaka wanted to swap Bayer Leverkusen for Sunderland, especially given the record of newly promoted sides. But his arrival has gone a long way to ensuring the Black Cats buck that trend.",
      "Le Bris’ side remain unbeaten at home since returning to the top flight, with the only game they’ve failed to score in coming in the 0-0 draw against Man City on New Year’s Day.",
      "The Switzerland and Sunderland captain has clearly raised the levels at the Stadium of Light and looks one of the best No.6s in the league, underlining just how vital that position has become.",
      "It’s no coincidence that Zubimendi, Sadiki, Stach and Xhaka are all in this top 10, and that Rodri won the Ballon d’Or last year. The defensive midfield role has become the position every manager wants to build around.",
      "Eddie Howe told Newcastle that they ‘can’t rely on one player’ as their miserable form without Bruno Guimaraes continued. But Sunderland should listen too.",
      "Martin Zubimendi is one of three defensive midfielders in our top 10 Premier League signings of 25/26, highlighting the importance of having an elite No.6.",
      "Man City v Liverpool headlines a very tasty Big Weekend indeed that also offers the slapstick charm of Spurs v Man United and some relegation six-pointery.",
      "Xhaka has recalled how Arteta used chairs to illustrate the “chaos” at Arsenal on his first day as Gunners manager ahead of their reunion on Saturday.",
      "It’s hard to think of a better summer signing by a newly promoted Premier League team than Granit Xhaka to Sunderland. He was outstanding against Everton.",
      "Liverpool’s summer of spending had many predicting another easy league title but their difficulty to settle is in stark contrast to other teams."

      "Manchester United are prepared to replace Marcus Rashford in their squad next summer, with the club having targeted two potential options to replace the on-loan Barcelona man as they look for a new attacker who can bring a new edge and greater creativity.",
      "Rashford is expected to complete a permanent move to Barcelona, and his departure would help open the door for United to add a new attacking option as part of the next phase of their rebuild.",
      "While midfield remains the top priority for Man Utd heading into the summer window, the club have already signalled their intent to strengthen out wide.",
      "Their earlier attempt to sign Antoine Semenyo, who eventually ended up at rivals Man City, was viewed internally as an indication that a winger would be added, even if it was not the immediate focus. Now, with Rashford’s permanent exit increasingly likely, sources believe United will revisit the winger market.",
      "One name emerging strongly is Yan Diomande. Indeed, there is a growing feeling within recruitment circles that Diomande could be the first option United explore as a replacement.",
      "Other clubs who have enquired about the RB Leipzig winger have come away with the understanding that United are very much in the picture and could lead the race for his signature when the summer window opens.",
      "Diomande, who could cost as much as €100m (£86m / $118m), has scored eight goals and added six assists in 21 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig so far this season and remains one of the most talked about attacking talents in Europe.",
      "We have also reported how United will look towards Everton’s Iliman Ndiaye as a target from within the Premier League. The Senegal international, who is capable of playing on both wings but largely operates on the right, has a combined goals/assists tally of six this season in 20 appearances for the Toffees.",
      "His current market value is £39m (€45m  / $53m), as per Transfermarkt, although Everton will almost certainly demand more to sell to a Premier League rival, especially with the 25-year-old under contract until 2029.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "Meanwhile, my TEAMtalk colleague Graeme Bailey can also reveal, via sources, how Rashford “has not spoken to anyone at Manchester United about the possibility of returning to Old Trafford, despite ongoing negotiations between the two clubs over his long‑term future”, as there appears to be no way back for the player.",
      "Bailey revealed: “Senior United sources insist that nobody at the club – including interim boss Michael Carrick – has contacted Rashford regarding a comeback. The message from the player’s camp is equally clear: Rashford has no intention of returning to Manchester and remains fully committed to Barcelona.",
      "“Rashford and his representatives are aligned with Barca’s vision for him, and the Catalan giants have assured the England international that he will continue at the Camp Nou beyond this season. Barcelona hold a £26million option to buy, and we are told Rashford is so determined to stay that he has even indicated he would be willing to give up part of his salary to help reduce the overall cost of the move.",
      "“With two-and-a-half years remaining on his lucrative United contract, such a gesture underlines how strongly he feels about continuing his career in Catalunya.",
      "“As our sources previously revealed, United are keen to avoid a scenario in which Barcelona attempt to negotiate another loan deal next season. Discussions are ongoing over how a permanent transfer could be structured, but Rashford’s stance leaves little room for doubt: his future lies in Spain, not in Manchester.",
      "“Despite being pleased to see United’s recent resurgence under Carrick, sources close to the forward insist that Barcelona is the only club he wants to play for going forward. Indeed, Rashford is described as ‘very happy’ with his life in Catalunya, both on and off the pitch, and there is no desire whatsoever to return to Old Trafford.",
      "“For United, the situation is becoming increasingly clear. For Barcelona, the path to a permanent deal is open. And for Rashford, the message is unmistakable: he sees his future at the Camp Nou, and nowhere else.”",

      "Man Utd are playing a back four under interim boss Michael Carrick with Maguire partnered by Lisandro Martinez at centre-back as he looks to go with experience.",

      "Hamann said: “Micky van de Ven is doing really well for Spurs and there’s a player at Dortmund, Nico Schlotterbeck.",
      "“He’s in talks with the club on whether he’s going to extend his contract.",

      "“He’d be a player. He’s got one year left on the contract. I’m sure that Liverpool inquired about him. He wouldn’t be the worst choice. He’s a left-footed player as well.”",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester United “immediately” turned down the opportunity to sign a long-term midfield target in January who was “keen on the move” to Old Trafford.",
      "Michael Carrick will have to make do with the squad he has at his disposal for the rest of the season after United decided not to open the chequebook in the transfer January window to bolster his options.",
      "Reports suggest a new midfielder is the club’s top priority and after they made a bold late move in a bid to prise Carlos Baleba away from Brighton in the summer, only to be told he would cost them £100m, The Athletic report that the Cameroon international is ‘hugely admired’, as is Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, but Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson is ‘considered their first-choice target’.",
      "The report has listed four potential next transfers for Man Utd, with a second midfielder to be targeted as Manuel Ugarte’s ‘future is uncertain’, while the ‘left-wing could also be looked at’.",
      "The report explains: ‘Each of Nottingham Forest, Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace were always unlikely to allow one of their best and most valuable players to leave mid-season, but are expected to be more open to business come the summer.",
      "‘Left-wing could also be looked at. During talks with Antoine Semenyo, the 26-year-old was told he would not play as a wing-back in Amorim’s system but as a left winger in a 4-3-3.’",
      "But Romano has revealed that United were handed the opportunity to sign a new midfielder as former Leicester star Wilfred Ndidi, who was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford when he instead made the switch to Besiktas in the summer of 2024, was ‘offered’ to the Red Devils and was ‘keen on the move.",
      "Romano revealed on the Here We Go podcast: “I can tell you that Wilfred Ndidi, former midfielder from Leicester, now at Besiktas, was offered as an opportunity to Man United.",
      "“A low-cost opportunity, the player was very keen on the move but Man United decided immediately not to proceed.",
      "“They had the chance to do something like a low-cost opportunity but they decided against it.”",
      "Former United striker Teddy Sheringham believes Wharton is “exactly the type of player United should be buying”.",
      "He said: “Manchester United need to sign players who are going to make a difference and, for me, Adam Wharton is one of those players.",
      "“He’s broken into the England squad at a young age alongside the likes of Elliot Anderson and Morgan Gibbs-White – these kind of players are there to prove something and make a difference to the sides they feature in.",
      "“Crystal Palace are a weird one in the sense that they probably don’t get as much publicity as they deserve especially after winning the FA Cup last season, so players like Wharton sometimes fly under the radar with their performances. Wharton however is exactly the type of player United should be buying.”",
      "Man Utd have been ‘offered the chance’ to sign former Chelsea star Ruben Loftus-Cheek as they weigh up signing a midfielder, according to reports."

      "Have INEOS stumbled into a potentially very bright future for Manchester Utd? Or did Wilcox and co. learn their lesson about letting an inexperienced manager bring in an equally inexperienced staff and instead, through their own connections and discussions with Carrick, put together their ideal team, a balanced mix of experience and youth with genuine ties to the club and national team?",
      "With every top-level manager insisting on bringing his own team, the cost goes up and the club ties disappear, while the risk barely drops and the hope barely rises. That type of appointment also seems to contradict the board’s long-term plan. From the beginning, they talked about a unified, cooperative structure that brings back the so-called “United DNA”: get results, improve players, connect with the fan base, promote young coaches and local players, all built on hard work and technical quality.",
      "All of INEOS’s decisions so far have been made with an eye on the future, with a transfer and manager policy of buy younger and develop over time. Handing control back to a bigger name would contradict that. The gamble also then becomes whether that big name eventually cedes some control or doubles down, potentially leaving us right back where we were with Amorim. Of course, if Carrick were to stumble across the finish line instead, it might be the only option left.",
      "Timing is often the missing ingredient when chasing success. Wilcox and Barrada were labelled inexperienced but highly rated. Is this recent upsurge ability or luck?",
      "Their transfer policy of “no dickheads” seems to be paying off. The squad looks better, happier and harder working. New leaders are emerging and old ones are reasserting themselves. We’re hearing stories of players like Dorgu staying behind after training, Sesko and Cunha taking recovery more seriously, and players generally looking after themselves better. Compare that to the missed sessions, nights out and late-night Xbox marathons of the last few years and it’s night and day.",
      "That’s why I hope there’s a pinch of salt to the Rashford return stories. As much as the romantic in me likes the prodigal son narrative, it probably makes more sense to shake hands and move on.",
      "But football is about romance. Isn’t that why we’d want Carrick to take the job full time? Not out of sentiment alone, but because if he earns it with a second or third place finish, it means something special has happened. Another big-name appointment might do fine, but when did we become so hardened that we’re scared of getting carried away by something potentially lovely?",
      "Speaking of lovely: Kobbie Mainoo. This surely has to all lead to him becoming club captain when Bruno eventually leaves. He’s a one-off. Young, talented, academy developed. He’s overcome adversity and disappointment to establish himself as the leader in midfield. Tough year, head down, took his chance. Never bitched or moaned once. His simple brother did, but you can’t be surprised by simple people doing simple things.",
      "Before that though, hang on to Bruno for another four or five years. Man’s a genius. The usual criticism is that he disrupts shape with his one-man heroics and needs more discipline. But his game has never been about speed, it’s about speed of thought. As his legs naturally slow, he’ll be forced to be stricter positionally. And as the team around him becomes more structured, with a younger, fitter Casemiro replacement behind him, and Kobbie continuing to develop, we might actually see an even better version of Fernandes.",
      "With Mbeumo now starting as a 9 and more goals coming from the supporting cast, we’re finally affording Sesko the time and support Højlund was never given. We criticised the club for asking a young, unproven striker to shoulder the burden alone. Now Sesko can come off the bench full of beans this season, then feature more next year when the games stack up, allowing him to develop properly. Regardless of the price tag, this is how you treat a 22-year-old new to the league.",

      "– They ARE dull to watch. Hugely effective, very strong defensively, but just not exciting for neutrals. Winning is of course the name of the game, and it brings its own buzz for their fans, but you can be successful without setting pulses racing. That’s the case with Arsenal this season, and that’s fine. Plenty of previous league winners have been similarly solid. Their fans are right not to particularly care how they go about ending a title famine of 20+ years.",
      "– Comparisons to Liverpool’s stroll last season are also pretty valid, in the sense that none of the other contenders are performing at the level they would have expected. City are horribly inconsistent compared to previous seasons. Liverpool, Chelsea and United are all some combination of work in progress/shambles/regression. Villa lack depth, largely thanks to PSR. Arsenal have so far taken advantage of all that, very similar to Liverpool’s serene run last season. It doesn’t mean it’s a terrible league, or that they’d be bad champions, but the margin for error is far higher than they could have anticipated.",
      "– If they fail to get over the line, it will be objectively hilarious for everyone else. Arteta’s cartoonish intensity rubs a lot of fans up the wrong way, which I think Arsenal fans probably understand. The players sometimes mirror it too – he has them wound up like springs, hence some of the insane celebrations we’ve seen from them in the past.",
      "The derogatory narratives have of course been set in stone by rival fan groups, getting their rationalisations for their own teams’ failure prepared nice and early. “They won it by playing crap football”, “It was handed to them”, “They had to win it sooner or later by the law of averages”, etc. It must be fantastic for level-headed Arsenal fans to recognise that this all stems from the increasing likelihood of them making it over the line in the next few months.",

      "If Arsenal win the league I think we will see the best football under Arteta NEXT season.",
      "Arteta knows the pressure is on this season to win something hence the pragmatical and stifling football in the league this season to ensure we try and get over the line.",
      "People forget what he did when he first came into Arsenal. He played with a back 5, ensured we were difficult to beat and got Aubamayang to score the goals that led to an FA cup win. He was more George Graham (or Mourinho) than the Pep everyone though he would be.",
      "Over the years he gently evolved the team to be more Pep. Unfortunately due to a lack of squad depth he was unable to get over the line (while still punching above his weight in my view).",
      "This season the squad has been beefed up to cope and he has realised he needs to play to what they are best at – Defensive solidity. Any Arsenal fan under the later Wenger years watched Arsenal between fingers knowing they could concede at any time, particularly against the big teams. That anxiety is gone under Arteta. Only replaced with the cautious anxiety of trying to win games to be champions.",
      "But one thing I have noticed is that Arteta has an ego. He likes being lauded by foreign coaches for Arsenal’s displays in Europe. He will not enjoy any boring tag associated with his team. He knows it has to be this way for now. However, once the pressure is off. The ego in him will demand a more expansive playing style which he will aim to deliver now he has the squad and hopefully the confidence of Champions.\nMichael O, Chingford",

      "The truth is last night was men against boys. Like the big lad in an 80s film we held our arm outstretched on the little boy’s forehead while he swung his arms wildly and hit nothing. Chelsea are the biggest spenders in the league and still only look like top four material at best. They’re also completely unlikeable imo but at least that’s on-brand for Chelsea.",

      "Elliot Anderson is undoubtedly one of the busiest central midfielders in the Premier League – but how do his grades compare with the best in class?",
      "Manchester United are said to have identified Anderson as their top summer target as they prepare to wave off Casemiro, leaving a gaping void in their midfield.",
      "The Red Devils have scoured the league and appreciate the work of two others in particular, but Anderson is reportedly the player they want.",
      "So how does the Nottingham Forest star compare with his contemporaries?",
      "Across a vast range of metrics, football data analysts Gradient Sports grade every player out of 100, measuring execution and outcome to offer the most insightful and accurate view of individual performance.",
      "Anderson’s basic numbers look impressive, his prominence and energy helping him pass the eye test with flying colours. But, in context, the stats suggest the 23-year-old doesn’t stand out in any specific area. Are United in danger of being dazzled by Anderson’s all-action nature?",
      "Here is how the England international’s relevant grades compare to the Premier League’s best in his position…",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Guimaraes – 95.3\n2) Moises Caicedo – 89.8\n3) Alex Iwobi – 89.4\n4) Adam Wharton – 89.3\n5) Enzo Fernandez – 88\n…11) Elliot Anderson – 87.1",
      "Anderson’s grade may not be good enough to make the top 10 but no central midfielder has attempted more passes (1565) or completed more passes this season. Martin Zubimendi is the next highest in both metrics and 164 behind Anderson for passes attempted and 114 behind for passes completed. But the grades capture both the detail of any pass (accuracy, pace, trajectory) and tactical intent, putting Bruno Guimaraes way ahead of the rest of the field.",
      "",
      "1) Adam Wharton – 91.7\n2) Moises Caicedo – 91.6\n3) Bruno Guimaraes – 91\n4) Enzo Fernandez – 89.7\n5) Elliot Anderson – 88.9",
      "The raw data highlights Anderson’s involvement, with no player completing more pressured passes than the England midfielder’s 822, while Guimaraes is the next closest 122 behind. Across the Premier League, no one can touch a Manchester City star here.",
      "1) Mikkel Damsgaard – 86.4\n2) John McGinn – 85.3\n3) Enzo Fernandez – 84.9\n4) Sander Berge – 84.4\n5) Bruno Guimaraes – 82.9\n…29) Elliot Anderson – 71.2",
      "Again, Anderson leads all central midfielders in the Premier League for line-breaking passes but much of his work comes from deep. Over half of the line-breaking passes attempted by Anderson are intended to break the opposition’s midfield lines, while 10% attempt to play through defensive lines. Which is fine for United if Anderson is finding Bruno Fernandes.",
      "",
      "1) Adam Wharton – 92.9\n2) Bruno Guimaraes – 90.1\n3) Alex Iwobi – 86.1\n4) Mateus Fernandes – 84.7\n5) Nico Gonzalez – 82.7\n…15) Elliot Anderson – 77.7",
      "In this metric, Anderson is operating around the same level as Declan Rice, attempting and completing similar numbers to the Arsenal captain. This is another field, though, of which Bruno Fernandes is the king, with Jordan Henderson and Adam Wharton the only players to get within 15 of the United skipper’s 37 completed balls over the top.",
      "",
      "1) James Garner – 86.8\n2) Joao Palhinha – 85.6\n3) Declan Rice – 82.8\n4) Amadou Onana – 82.1\n5) Martín Zubimendi – 81.7\n…17) Elliot Anderson – 73.9",
      "Anderson is certainly busy off the ball, competing in more challenges (includes ground duels, aerial contests, and tackles) than any other central midfielder, but 33 of his contemporaries have won a higher percentage of  their challenges. Still, his 40% is a higher success rate than any United central midfielder.",
      "1) James Garner 88\n2) Moises Caicedo – 87.8\n3) Vitaly Janelt – 87.7\n4) Boubacar Kamara – 84.4\n5) Yegor Yarmolyuk- 83.8\n… 48) Elliot Anderson – 71.7",
      "Only Joao Gomes has competed in more 50/50 duels but only five central midfielders have a lower success rate than Anderson’s 41%. Of course, the highest-graded player for 50/50s and challenges came through at United but the Red Devils saw no pathway for James Garner.",
      "",
      "1) Ryan Gravenberch – 90.4\n2) Nico Gonzalez – 83.7\n3) Dominik Szoboszlai – 83.3\n4) James Garner – 82.9\n5) Moises Caicedo – 80.7\n… 29) Elliot Anderson – 72.7",
      "Only Gravenberch (76) has attempted more ball carries than Anderson (62), and only the Liverpool star has more carries that have broken a defensive line. But among all central midfielders, the Forest man has the highest number of ball carries leading to a loss of possession while he tries to drag Forest up the pitch.",
      "1) Joelinton – 86.8\n2) John McGinn – 86.5\n3) Ryan Gravenberch – 86.1\n4) Bruno Guimaraes – 86\n5) Moisés Caicedo – 85.1\n… 35) Elliot Anderson – 72.5",
      "Anderson has faced more tackles than any other central midfielder and came out on top most often too. He has won 75% of the tackles he has faced, with only five CMs having a higher success ratio, but all faced considerably less than half the number of total tackles. Still, he’s no Bruno Fernandes.",
      "",
      "Manchester United reportedly ‘want’ to sign two Nottingham Forest stars in a potential £147m double deal, with summer exits for these players inevitable…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have chosen their ‘first-choice’ summer signing between three potential replacements for Casemiro.",
      "Man Utd have decided on three players they want to sign in the summer transfer window as they look to ‘revamp’ their squad, according to reports.",
      "Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are ranked in the Premier League’s top 10 for pressurised passing which highlights a weakness for Man Utd…",
      "Teddy Sheringham has warned Manchester United over a potential £100m move for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson.",

      "Manchester United held ‘formal discussions’ with Wolves over a surprise January move for Mateus Mane and the ‘key factor’ in a summer battle with Liverpool has been revealed.",
      "After spending over £200m in the summer to revamp their forward line through the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, United made no further signings in the winter window.",
      "But a report from Sports Boom claims both the Red Devils and Liverpool made an approach to Wolves to enquire over the availability of Mane, who’s been the shining light for Rob Edwards’ rock-bottom side.",
      "After scoring for Wolves against West Ham in January, their first and only win of the Premier League season, Edwards insisted it was important that the club “look after” Mane, “a very bright talent”.",
      "“He finished his performance with a fantastic goal,” Edwards said. “He once again delivered a very bold display, playing with real commitment.",
      "“He’s 18, but he’s almost like a little leader on the pitch. I think that’s contagious. I believe he influences others – with his energy, his enthusiasm.",
      "“He’s truly a very bright talent, someone we should really admire. At the same time, we want to make sure we look after him.”",
      "The report claims ‘scouts from several top-tier clubs, most notably Manchester United and Liverpool, have been tracking the youngster’s every move for the past month’ and that ‘dossiers compiled’ are ‘filled with “extraordinary” ratings’ of the 18-year-old.",
      "Both clubs held ‘formal discussions’ with Wolves but were put off by an ‘asking price in the region of £45-£50m’.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365…\n* Man Utd choose ‘first-choice’ summer signing to replace £120m pair as PL star is ‘Manchester-bound’\n* Man Utd decide on three summer signings in £173m ‘revamp’, including Newcastle star\n* Cristiano Ronaldo stance on Man Utd return revealed by ex-colleague with ‘progress towards agreement",
      "There is still hope of a move though as the report suggests he ‘could be available for a reduced fee in the summer, should Wolves suffer relegation to the Championship’. Cut-price fee it is then.",
      "On the reason for Wolves’ very high price tag, the report states:",
      "‘Wolves’ firm stance was underpinned by the fact they had already cashed in on striker Jørgen Strand Larsen, who joined Crystal Palace for a record club fee earlier in the window. With significant funds already secured, the West Midlands club had no pressing need to sell Mateus Mané and were comfortable resisting advances.",
      "‘That confidence was reflected in a late move to line up Girona forward Vladyslav Vanat as a potential Strand Larsen replacement, but despite groundwork being done, a deadline-day deal ultimately failed to materialise.",
      "The report further claims that Mane ‘remains focused’ at Wolves for now, but with Liverpool and Man Utd both ‘making enquiries through his representatives’ the summer could ‘prompt record-breaking transfer attempts for Mane’, with Wolves’ final position a ‘key factor’ in his future."

      "“The next key step will be discussions with Newcastle United between February and April, because any decision will depend on the club’s position and future plans.”",
      "Former Premier League full-back Danny Simpson, who began his career at Manchester United and played a key role for Leicester when they won the title in 2015/16, says his boyhood club should be going after Tonali, who he believes would dovetail “really nicely” with Kobbie Mainoo in the Red Devils’ midfield.",
      "“I think Tonali would work really well in that United midfield,” Simpson told Metro via Meta Spins Casino.",
      "“I think he would complement Kobbie Mainoo really nicely, because he gets about the pitch so well.",
      "“Obviously, he’s been a top player for Newcastle. He’s good on the ball, he’s strong, he’s physical, he’d be a brilliant player in there in many regards.",
      "“Also, he’s the type of player that I think could wear a Man Utd shirt. It’s not easy, that, and I feel like he could wear it with the pressure and deal with it.",

      "According to reports, Real Madrid have ‘made a firm decision’ on whether to re-sign Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo from Al Nassr.",
      "Ronaldo‘s future at Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr appears uncertain after it emerged that he ‘refused to play’ for them against Al-Riyadh on Monday.",
      "The Man Utd and Real Madrid legend joined Al Nassr at the start of 2023, with this move following the termination of his contract at Old Trafford by mutual consent.",
      "The 40-year-old has 133 goal involvements in 127 appearances for Al Nassr across all competitions, but everything has not been rosy between the forward and the club.",
      "Last year, Ronaldo was heavily linked with an exit from Al Nassr ahead of the expiry of his contract, with rumours suggesting that he was unhappy following their failure to win the Saudi Pro League and/or AFC Champions League and could join a club competing in the Club World Cup.",
      "READ: A bonus famous F365 England ladder as Man Utd players climb and Arsenal stars tumble",
      "Ronaldo eventually opted to sign a new two-year contract with Al Nassr, though his most recent dispute with the club reportedly relates to a lack of backing from the board in the transfer market.",
      "Naturally, this has fuelled fresh reports of a potential exit from Al Nassr, with a potential return to Europe via his 50 million release clause mooted as an option.",
      "It also comes as no surprise that Ronaldo’s former clubs are being touted as possible next destinations for the veteran striker, who will be hoping to play regular football ahead of this summer’s World Cup.",
      "However, it is hard to see Man Utd being willing to sanction another spell at Old Trafford for Ronaldo, and the same can be said for Real Madrid.",
      "Now, a report from an outlet in Spain claims Real Madrid have ‘made a firm decision’ on whether to re-sign Ronaldo as they have ‘ruled out’ this transfer.",
      "This said to be because head coach Alvaro Arbeloa has opted to ‘block’ his return.",
      "The report explains: ‘Ronaldo feels competitive, continues to score goals regularly, and believes he can still contribute to European football. In this context, he offered Real Madrid a very different return than in previous spells, accepting a secondary role and making no demands in terms of sporting achievements.",
      "‘However, the club doesn’t see it that way. Alvaro Arbeloa has been clear with the sporting director that Cristiano Ronaldo’s return would pose an unnecessary risk internally. Even if the Portuguese player is willing to accept a substitute role, no one in the dressing room believes his presence could coexist with that without creating tension.’",
      "Alternatively, Ronaldo could secure a move back to boyhood club Sporting Lisbon, and a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims this ‘return’ transfer is ’emerging strongly’ as an option.",
      "The report claims: ‘A return to Sporting would have an immeasurable historical and emotional impact. For the player, it would mean closing the circle of an unforgettable career, while for the Lisbon club it would be one of the most high-profile signings ever made.",

      "No coincidence that his own form has improved in direct relation to West Ham coming back from the dead, and with Noni Madueke struggling for playing time the Bukayo Saka understudy gig does once again seem to be up for grabs.",
      "Tuchel’s selection policy has always been an interesting and we think rather clever balance of rewarding both current club form and previous England form. With this longer gap between international squads, our thinking is he will lean slightly more heavily on the former than latter. If he does, Bowen is definitely ahead.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick replacing Ruben Amorim has already reshaped Manchester United, but what might it mean for England? Maguire is back playing regularly and knows his way around a summer tournament better than almost any other England player. With Stones a doubt and nobody else beyond Marc Guehi and Ezri Konsa having locked down a squad place, why not Maguire?",
      "We already know from Henderson’s return that Tuchel values and requires members of the playing group with those battle-hardened leadership qualities, and it’s quite a green defensive group if Stones isn’t in it.",
      "",
      "Has always been very good when Tuchel has called upon him, and we know this is a manager for whom that counts for an awful lot. But if you were picking a squad right now on current form it would be extremely hard to justify Madueke over, say, Jarrod Bowen.",
      "",
      "Scored a hat-trick against Spurs straight after the international break, which was good, but hasn’t scored or assisted a Premier League goal since, which is bad. Simply does not have the England record to remain secure in the squad while becoming as peripheral as he has at club level.",
      "",
      "Every chance, you know. Left-back is the most up-in-the-air position of the lot, and Shaw is playing there again now Man United are free at last of Ruben Amorim’s back-three tyranny. There’s a certain irony in the fact Shaw and Reece James also now appear to be England’s most injury-resistant full-back options, having managed 47 out of a possible 48 Premier League appearances this season between them.",
      "Would bring a wealth of experience to a defence that could use that if it is indeed a perfectly capable but not particularly tournament-hardened Guehi-Konsa central pairing, as well as providing an experienced LCB option in a back three.",
      "",
      "Did absolutely nothing wrong when called upon in October but usurped by Nico O’Reilly in November and now as injured as all Spurs players must be. Ability to play both flanks still works in his favour but also now, through no real fault of his own, probably in a position where he needs to play himself back into the 26.",
      "",
      "Four goals in four games since returning from a frustratingly persistent injury and coming into a genuinely terrible Tottenham team at a horrifically low ebb.",
      "Scoring an outrageous scorpion kick as one of your two goals against Man City in front of the watching England manager is certainly not a bad idea.",
      "What’s interesting about Solanke is, while obviously not approaching Harry Kane’s class, he is probably the closest England have available in terms of all-round playing style. So it could come down to what, exactly, Tuchel is looking for in his Kane back-up: a point of difference, or an inevitably inferior but passable facsimile.",
      "",
      "A badly timed injury cost him in November. A goalkeeper who is playing week in, week out for a Champions League club should logically be a better choice as third-choice keeper than someone who is not doing that, but we’re just not sure it’s something Tuchel is going to be spending much time faffing about with this close to tournament time.",
      "",
      "Played right-back in England’s last qualifier, and ‘back-up right-back’ does look like it might be a position available to a versatile, utility-player sort – whether that’s a full-back who can play either side (a Spence, a Livramento) or a Jarell Quansah/Joe Gomez type who can shuffle across from their preferred centre-back spot.",
      "",
      "Whether it makes Tuchel more likely to pick you we’re not so sure, but you’re certainly going to get talked about more as a possible England selection if you’re playing in England. Gallagher is now doing so again, and will have done himself no harm at all with that all-action effort against Man City in front of the England coach at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Is a player Tuchel knows from Chelsea, which we’ve already seen count for something, but also one of the accursed gang whose sole England appearance under the current manager came in the Game We Don’t Like To Talk About against Senegal.",
      "",
      "Couldn’t even nail down the right-back spot when he was one of Liverpool’s best and most visible players and Reece James was pretty much always injured. Is not about to do so while he is struggling to get a game for Real Madrid and Reece James is pretty much always available.",
      "In terms of the squad, we still rule nothing out because there is no current compelling back-up right-back and a fresh Alexander-Arnold with a point to prove is a very tempting wildcard in a 26-man group.",
      "The facts are, though, that he hasn’t been part of an England squad since last summer. If he were already in the squad, his Real Madrid struggles might be overlooked; but he’s in the position of trying to force his way in and just isn’t doing enough.",
      "",
      "Bellingham, Rogers, Palmer is already a difficult pack to burst through for one of the No. 10 spots, and that’s before you consider the likes of Foden or Eze who could play there or elsewhere. Looks like a losing battle at this time.",
      "",
      "Needed to pull up trees at Everton. A Premier League record since the last international break of one goal, two assists, one foot injury, one mysterious Christmas ‘illness’ isn’t really that.",
      "",
      "Still hasn’t played for England since That Senegal Game, but was in the last squad and remains an automatic pick for Chelsea.",
      "Problem for Chalobah that he cannot do anything about is that he may now find himself in a scrap with some enormously experienced big-tournament players for the squad centre-back positions, and Tuchel clearly values that know-how.",
      "",
      "Were there such a thing as a January international break, then he would have been a shoo-in after scoring seven Premier League goals in six games between November 29 and December 28. But there isn’t so he wasn’t.",
      "And now he’s scored one goal in his last six. Never underestimate the importance of timing. But Watkins’ injury does certainly leave a door potentially ajar for a Calvert-Lewin, Solanke or Toney.",

      "Dominik Szoboszlai may never replicate Steven Gerrard’s legacy at Liverpool, but his intangibles signal that he is next in line.",
      "England are short on E numbers but there’s enough to make an XI, including the country’s greatest player to have never featured in a major tournament.",
      "It’s Man Utd v Tottenham this weekend and recent evidence tells us that spells chaos. No point trying to predict what kind of chaos, so we’ve done just that.",

      "Thursday 5 February 2026 23:00, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight ahead of a busy Premier League weekend.",
      "Having been working and punting on the Premier League for 15+ years now, there are some go-to betting strategies that have shown to be very sustainable when implemented right. And one of them is to respect Sean Dyche teams when they're on a good run of form.",
      "Once the message from Dyche lands and the squad fully commits to the physical, disciplined, no-nonsense approach, performances stop fluctuating and become consistent. This is a key aspect of finding trustworthy teams to bet on.",
      "Across their last six games in the Premier League and Europa League, Nottingham Forest are looking like a classic Dyche team having conceded just two goals.",
      "This is going to be a horrible game with lots of duels, lots of set-pieces - and this is where his teams thrive.",
      "Leeds are excellent at playing this style too but there is a bit of nervousness starting to creep into their season again. Similar styles are on the table here but Forest are the more experienced and have the better quality of player and manager to execute a winning game plan. Forest on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet stands out.",
      "A record number of goals are being scored from dead-ball situations this season, corners are such dangerous avenues for goals and centre-backs with aerial dominance have never been more valuable from a betting perspective. Yet one of the best set-piece attackers in world football has barely been on the pitch for most of it.",
      "Harry Maguire is back in the Manchester United fold, though, and looking in fine fettle in both boxes. Since returning, he has registered four shots in just 281 minutes, generating an expected goals figure of 0.62, which is of course a chunky output for a centre-half. That includes hitting the crossbar against Manchester City.",
      "There is value to be had on Maguire and it is in his shots prices - most notably his headed shots price of 10/11 with Sky Bet. Across the last six Premier League seasons, only Virgil van Dijk is recording a headed shot at a higher rate than Maguire - one every 177 minutes.",
      "Whenever this bet is 10/11 or bigger it's an automatic back for me if Manchester United are the favourites to win the game.",
      "Like most Arsenal home games against anyone outside the elite, this is a challenging betting heat where the Gunners are 1/5 with Sky Bet to land the odds. Other traditional markets like the over/under 2.5 line are priced up correctly too so we have to get creative here for an angle.",
      "Trai Hume's fouls committed prices are worth a look at Evens for 2+ with Sky Bet.",
      "Hume has made 16 fouls in his last eight starts, averaging out perfectly at that two fouls line with a switch of position helping to keep those fouls numbers bulky. He's playing more as an inverted wide midfielder rather than a full-back and being in the heat of the battle against the Gunners will see him threaten that fouls line.",
      "Bournemouth to make the most fouls in each half at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a wager that's cashed in each of the last five head-to-head meetings.",
      "That's no fluke.",
      "This fixture is consistently foul heavy because of the tactical clash between the managers as Villa under Unai Emery are happy to play fast and vertically, forcing Bournemouth into reactive defending, broken play and ultimately, fouls, to stop transitions. The numbers back it up too as the head-to-head record shows Bournemouth average 17 fouls per game, compared to just 10 for Aston Villa.",
      "At odds-against, backing Bournemouth to win the foul count in both halves looks a smart way to play a match-up that keeps telling us the same story.",
      "Crysencio Summerville is thriving under Nuno Espirito Santo, not only in terms of his overall attacking output but also in the way he is terrifying defenders.",
      "The only way to stop him is to foul him which is leading to cards. Under Nuno, Summerville has drawn 12 cards off the opposition - that's the most of any player in the Premier League this season. Kyle Walker will be the man responsible for stopping him - a player who has been carded eight times already this season. The 100/30 with Sky Bet for a Walker card is very generous.",
      "James Garner to have 2+ shots at 11/8 with Sky Bet makes appeal.",
      "Garner's development this season has been a real success story for David Moyes, who has pushed him higher from midfield which has allowed him to get himself into shooting positions rather than just recycling possession. The raw numbers tell the story as no Everton player has attempted more shots this season than Garner (39), which underlines just how licence-heavy his role has become. This match-up suits that trend too. He fired off four shots in the reverse fixture against Fulham.",
      "Yerson Mosquera to score for Wolves at 16/1 with Sky Bet is firmly on the radar against a Chelsea side that continue to look alarmingly vulnerable from dead-ball situations.",
      "Only Crystal Palace have conceded more expected goals from set-pieces than Chelsea this season (12.67 xG), while 10 actual goals shipped from those scenarios underlines that this is a structural problem, not bad luck.",
      "And one that hasn't been solved since the change of manager.",
      "That will be music to the ears of a Wolves side who are unapologetically set-piece orientated under Rob Edwards, with delivery and movement clearly drilled on the training ground. Mosquera is becoming increasingly prominent in those situations too. He's gone close in recent weeks, racking up 11 shots across his last six games and was desperately unlucky to hit the post against Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "Rico Henry to be carded at 9/2 with Sky Bet looks a lovely angle to attack because of what's brewing down that flank in terms of fouls in this game. Henry is likely to spend large periods dealing with Anthony Elanga and that's a match-up that tends to end with the defender running the risk of a card.",
      "Since the start of last season, Elanga has drawn 20 yellow cards from opponents, using his pace and direct running to force last-ditch challenges when he shifts the ball past his man. The timing looks right too. Elanga showed signs of hitting form again in his last outing against Manchester City, scoring a beauty of a goal and carrying a real threat in transition when repeatedly engaging his full-back one on one.",
      "Crystal Palace have not won in their last 12 games in all competitions but everyone knows about their current plight. But it's pretty gloomy at Brighton too, who have finally started to prove me right in how much of an overrated team they are. Just one win in 11 games means Fabian Hurzeler is facing huge pressure now.",
      "And, this is exactly the type of opposition they struggle against: low block, long quick vertical football and a head-to-head record of winning just two of the last 13 games with their rivals. Looking at the match odds, where Brighton are around Evens, market forces are also now becoming cold on this Brighton team which is quite a big pointer that Hurzeler is going to struggle to turn this around.",
      "Trusting Palace though isn't viable either, meaning the draw makes lots of sense to back at 13/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "Liverpool at 11/8 with Sky Bet? Sign me up.",
      "Since drawing at Leeds, their defensive numbers are back to where they were last season, offering up very little to the opposition in terms of big chances. Across their last 13 games, they've conceded just 0.75 goals per game to a backdrop of 0.8 expected goals against per game. Arne Slot has fixed the leak.",
      "Yet, Man City's defensive structure and out-of-possession play has quietly become a cause for concern. They are showing signs of the same problems of last season where teams were finding it so easy to play through the City midfield and defence to create big chances.",
      "Since they drew with Chelsea, in six games where they've gone off bigger than 1/3 to win, they've been repeatedly badly exposed defensively, shipping an expected goals against tally of 1.6 per 90 and facing 4.8 shots on target per 90.",
      "Liverpool may run riot if City don't tighten up, meaning the home team handicap market at -1 at 7/2 with Sky Bet is a lovely way to back Slot's men to win by two or more goals."

      "Man Utd won't U-turn on the decision to allow Casemiro to leave when his contract expires in June despite improved Premier League form under Michael Carrick; the club are forward planning and expected to chase a number of midfield targets in the summer, with Elliot Anderson top of list",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is in his richest vein of form since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth £70m in 2022. So why would the club let him go now?",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday, heading in the opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a sublime no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro has started all three games under Carrick, but made his impending departure official last month while Ruben Amorim was still in charge. United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",
      "\"Manchester United are determined not to have a short-term approach to signings and managers. That's what has got them into trouble in the past. It's left a lot of big-name players on big wages who are not part of the plans.",
      "\"Casemiro is flying right now. Player of the match against Fulham. I can understand why a lot of fans are saying: 'we're trying to find a midfielder but willing to let Casemiro go?'",
      "\"He turns 34 later this month, he's one of the biggest earners at the club, £325k a week, and Man Utd know that can't go on forever. He's playing out of his skin right now but they have to have a longer-term plan.",
      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "Tuesday 3 February 2026 08:47, UK",
      "Going into the window, the feeling was Arsenal were going to be quiet. And so it proved.",
      "They did their business in the summer - and were only likely to dip into the market if a long-term target or unique market opportunity presented itself.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta maintained they would be alive and alert.",
      "However, he also called for the numbers in a matchday squad to be increased in line with Europe. He is begging for 23 in total - and 20 outfield players. The reason? He is having to disappoint two or three players every game.",
      "With that in mind, the chance of a new signing was always going to be slim.",
      "A serious injury to Mikel Merino gave Arsenal food for thought - and they tentatively explored a potential deal. However, that's as far as it got and Arsenal will continue their fight on all four fronts with the squad they have.",
      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",

      "Benjamin Sesko came off the bench to score a 94th-minute winner as Manchester United survived a Fulham fightback to make it three wins in a row under Michael Carrick and move into the top four.",
      "Fulham substitute Kevin followed up Raul Jimenez's late penalty with a super strike to level things up in added time but, in another classic under the new boss, Sesko struck as Carrick matched Ruben Amorim's longest Premier League winning streak at Man Utd in dramatic fashion.",

      "After impressively beating Arsenal and Manchester City, Carrick's United passed another test that had its fair share of refereeing controversy.",
      "The first incident came in the build-up to Man Utd's opener as they were initially awarded a penalty after Matheus Cunha was judged to have been brought down by Jorge Cuenca. However, after a VAR check, the decision was overturned, with Cuenca clearly winning the ball, although the hosts were given a free-kick for a shirt pull instead - much to Marco Silva's fury.",
      "Manchester United were awarded a penalty for a trip by Jorge Cuenca on Matheus Cunha. However, a VAR review showed Cuenca won the ball - but a free-kick was given for the defender pulling Cunha's shirt outside the box.",
      "In that case, the VAR could intervene by declaring the decision a factual error and award a free-kick instead.",
      "From the resulting free-kick, Casemiro headed home a Bruno Fernandes delivery for his fifth of the campaign. After announcing his departure at the end of the season, the midfielder is enjoying a farewell tour.",
      "Cunha, who made a return to the starting line-up in the only change to the side in place of the injured Patrick Dorgu, thundered in to double Man Utd's advantage in the second half.",
      "Fulham thought they had pulled one back when Cuenca tapped in a deflected Samuel Chukwueze shot that fell kindly into his path. However, after a VAR check that lasted around four minutes, the goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.",
      "But after being brought down by Harry Maguire in the area, Jimenez scored from the spot, before Kevin's stunning equaliser looked like it had rescued a point for Marco Silva's side.",
      "But Sesko, set up by Fernandes, had different ideas, thumping in his fifth goal of the season. A resurgent Man Utd are now five points off third place in the Premier League. Fulham drop to eighth.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva expressed his frustration at Man Utd's opening goal after the game, suggesting he had been given different communication on the touchline about the decision.",
      "\"A big, big mistake. It was the first time we had seen in the Premier League that the referee gave a penalty from a tackle and after the VAR came back with a free-kick.",

      "Man Utd boss Michael Carrick was delighted his side successfully managed a different test after question marks were raised despite winning his first two games since returning as head coach.",

      "\"Credit to the boys for the late goal last week that we conceded, then go again and win, and especially today, which was even tougher to take, probably to then find a winner for Benji.",
      "\"I'm just so delighted for him [Sesko], and he totally deserves it.",
      "\"It's a huge moment for all of us but for him especially, he deserves it. He's been fantastic since I came here. He will remember that feeling for quite some time.\"",

      "Fulham lost 3-2 at Manchester United on Sunday after Benjamin Sesko's late winner; United went ahead from a free-kick after John Brooks' penalty decision  was overturned; Fulham boss Marco Silva believes the penalty was given for a different foul  than the one VAR decided on",
      "Sunday 1 February 2026 17:54, UK",
      "Marco Silva claims VAR overturned Manchester United's penalty in their 3-2 victory over Fulham for a different foul because the original decision by referee John Brooks was \"so bad\".",
      "Brooks awarded United a first-half penalty at Old Trafford after Matheus Cunha went down in the area under a sliding tackle from Jorge Cuenca, but replays showed the Fulham centre-back had won the ball.",
      "VAR James Bell overturned the decision and awarded a free-kick instead for a shirt pull on Cunha by Cuenca, with Casemiro heading in the opener from Bruno Fernandes' cross at the resulting set-piece.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre said Cuenca's holding offence had ended before entering the box, which is why the decision was overturned, but Silva says he was told Brooks awarded the penalty for the tackle.",
      "Silva, who was booked for his protests against the decision, added: \"The game started with a horrendous, terrible decision from John Brooks with the penalty he gave. A big, big mistake.",
      "\"It was the first time we have seen in the Premier League that the referee gave a penalty from a tackle, and the VAR came back with a free-kick [for a different foul].",
      "\"Because the decision was so bad, they found a different foul, like the pull.",
      "\"I know why the penalty was given. The VAR went in a completely different direction to find something and be able to give a free-kick.\"",
      "Fulham also had a second-half goal ruled out for offside on Samuel Chukwueze after a nearly four-minute VAR check.",
      "Silva added: \"The main thing from VAR is to correct things and make it right. Definitely not to over-referee the game or go in a different direction. They are there to help the referees make good decisions.",
      "\"The offside goal is by a [small] margin. It happened with us already this season, where goals were disallowed by [small] margins. The idea of automated offside is to be quicker than it was, but sometimes it's not easy. We have to accept it. We cannot control it.",
      "\"The first one is much more difficult to accept because of the feedback we got. All of the people in the stadium felt the penalty was given because of the tackle.\"",

      "Casemiro starred as Man Utd beat Fulham 3-2 in the Premier League; the Brazil midfielder, who turns 34 this month scored one and set up another; Casemiro announced he will leave Old Trafford this summer after four years at the club",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 11:46, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher says Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is now a \"completely different player\" as he approaches his Old Trafford farewell at the end of the season.",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday. Casemiro headed in Man Utd's opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro, who's started all three games under Carrick, announced his Old Trafford departure last month, bringing a four-year stay to an end. Carragher famously criticised Casemiro after Man Utd were beaten 4-0 at Crystal Palace in May 2024, suggesting the midfielder was no longer good enough to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"I think Casemiro should know tonight that he should only have another three games left at the top level,\" Carragher said then.",
      "\"The next two league games and the cup final, then he should be thinking, I need to go to the MLS or Saudi.",
      "\"This has to stop because we are watching one of the greats of modern times. I always remember the saying 'leave the football before the football leaves you'. The football has left him. At this top level, he needs to call it a day at this level and move.\"",
      "Now, following an apparent renaissance from the five-time Champions League winner, Carragher says Casemiro deserves huge credit for his turnaround.",
      "\"It is now fair to say the football has not left him,\" Carragher said on Super Sunday Extra Time.",
      "\"Considering what he's producing this season in the Premier League, and not just Fulham at home, you think what he did last week against Arsenal away and Manchester City at home.",
      "\"Casemiro is well within his rights to, if he wants to come back at me and say, 'leave the punditry before the punditry's left you!' He could definitely get one of those back in. Credit to him, he looks a completely different player.",
      "\"He looks like a different player physically as well. Even when I said that, you looked at him and he looked like an old man coming to the end of his time as a player.",
      "\"And whether he let himself go a little bit, or now he's being ultra professional, physically, he looks completely different.\"",
      "\"Casemiro is just one goal from matching his return from his best-ever goalscoring season in a league campaign.",
      "\"He's very much on his farewell tour, after announcing he will depart at the end of the season and he's rolled back the years under Michael Carrick.",
      "\"His opening goal set the tone and his no-look assist to set up Matheus Cunha was reflective of the confidence he's playing with. Carrick noted the \"presence\" he's been since he took over as interim coach and how his experience has been significant.",
      "\"A five-time Champions League winner, his reputation has taken something of a hit since arriving on these shores; however, the Brazil international has maintained the favour of his coaches.",
      "\"As he approaches his 34th birthday, any suggestion that he should have been a part of Man Utd's plans beyond this season are misguided. But on the flip side, alongside Kobbie Mainoo, he remains an important cog in Carrick's machine.",
      "\"Casemiro is often profiled as the anchor in midfield and that owes to his time at Real Madrid, where he was the proverbial water carrier for Toni Kroos and Luka Modric.",
      "\"However, for Man Utd, he's proving to be much more of a completer package, showing a willingness to break lines with forward passes, hence his seven into the final third against Fulham.",
      "\"Beyond the goal contributions, suddenly, Casemiro appears to be a player United can once again rely on. It's a call back to the player Man Utd signed from Real in a deal worth £70m in 2022.",
      "\"There's been a lot of talk about United's reported midfield overhaul this summer but the hole Casemiro is going to leave and the boots that will need to be filled grow every passing day.\"",
      "\"It's the right move.",
      "\"He's been a top player. But he's 34, and before you know it, he'll be 35.",
      "\"He hasn't got the legs to play alone with Bruno in midfield, and Kobbie Mainoo has helped that massively.",
      "\"We're talking about the future of Man Utd - they're right to do what they're doing.\"",
