      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is not yet convinced by Jadon Sancho(Image: David Horton/Getty Images)",
      "Jadon Sancho is playing for his future at Aston Villa because Unai Emery remains undecided whether to sign the Manchester United winger permanently. Sancho in on loan from United with Villa and has enjoyed a decent period of form of late.",
      "The 25-year-old began the season as part of the bomb squad at United, with Ruben Amorim freezing out Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony. Villa decided to sign him on a season-long loan deal in the hope he could repeat his form at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "That did not materialise in the early stages of the season, with zero goals or assists coming until January 22, when Sancho broke his duck by scoring in a 1-0 win over Fenerbahce. He then assisted Morgan Rogers in the 1-1 draw against Bournemouth on the weekend, prompting reporters to ask Emery about Sancho's future.",
      "The Villa boss said he \"expects more\" from Sancho after the draw against Bournemouth. And speaking ahead of Villa's Premier League game against Brighton on Wednesday, Emery said he remained undecided on a permanent transfer for Sancho in the summer.",

      "“Not yet (not decided). But he’s a fantastic player,” he said. \"He will need another contract and maybe it could be here. In case he’s playing his best football, we will want him. Maybe other teams could be involved in the interest for him.\"",
      "Emery added: “The first part of the season was not enough. He was working, he was trying, but he was not achieving the performances needed. I spoke to him a few times about the challenge he has and he must be very demanding in himself, like he is now.",
      "\"There’s no time to wait for anyone. We need everyone to be focused, with their qualities and preparation to play helping the team. We believed in him at the start of season, we believed in him in December and we believe in him now and I believe he’s getting better.”",

      "Jadon Sancho has improved his form in recent weeks for Aston Villa",
      "Speaking on the weekend, Emery said: \"Hopefully he is getting better and he can help us in this process like he is, getting better. I expect more from him, and because I am positive, hopefully he will give us it.\"",
      "Sancho's contract with United expires at the end of the season, meaning his future almost certainly lies away from Old Trafford. His £73million move from Dortmund to United in the summer of 2021 did not work out, with the club getting just 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for their money.",
      "He has spent recent seasons away on loan with Dortmund, Chelsea and Villa. Chelsea ended up paying United £5m last summer so they didn't have to go through with a £25m deal to sign him permanently and his future is once again in the balance.",

      "Harry Maguire has highlighted the biggest improvement Manchester United have made since Michael Carrick took over - and his comments hint at where Ruben Amorim went wrong. Carrick has won all four of his matches since replacing the sacked Amorim last month.",
      "The United interim manager has changed the formation from Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1 to a more simplistic 4-2-3-1 and has reaped the benefits. United have beaten Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham to turn around their fortunes and solidify fourth place in the Premier League.",
      "Carrick has stuck with a settled side, using Kobbie Mainoo in midfield alongside Casemiro and allowing Bruno Fernandes to play as a No.10. Maguire has re-established his partnership with Lisandro Martinez in central defence and is delighted with the upturn in form.",
      "He believes that the defensive structure and organisation that Carrick has drilled into the players has made all the difference as they go in search of their fifth straight win against West Ham on Tuesday night.",
      "Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings.",
      "\"He's been brilliant. We know what Kobbie can do - he can take the ball under pressure, he's brilliant on the ball, he can get out of tight spaces. I always say as a footballer, when the structure is good, you can perform and be a good player. But the structure has got to be good all around you. I think we've seen with Cassy (Casemiro) too in the last few games, when the structure is good he's still a magnificent centre midfielder.\"",
      "United sometimes struggled in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation, with players not comfortable in unfamiliar positions. Carrick has made a point of placing players in their natural positions and that has helped United find solidity, according to Maguire.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has thrived under Michael Carrick(Image: Mike Morese/Getty Images)",
      "\"We've got to be comfortable to dominate with the ball, but also without the ball,\" he added. \"We always know we're going to be a threat on the counter-attack with our players. Against Man City, we took the lead and were happy to soak up a little bit of pressure and to be comfortable defending our box.",
      "\"I think that's the main thing that's improved over the past three games: we've defended our box a lot better with a lot more urgency. Previously, we defended our box nowhere near good enough. Every time the ball went into the box, they had a chance.",
      "\"But the last three games, loads more urgency - and not just from the defenders, from the midfielders and the wide men getting back in and the striker protecting the edge of the box. It's so important that we do it as a team and we've got to make sure we get the spaces right and that we're compact all over the pitch.",
      "\"Michael will bring that. There will be times where you'll see us go man to man all over the pitch and try to be really aggressive and there will also be times where we're happy and content in keeping the spaces short and punishing teams on the counter-attack. I think it's important to be tactically flexible in that aspect.\"",

      "Gary Lineker has predicted Marcus Rashford will play a prominent role for England at World Cup 2026 amid rumours of a Manchester United comeback(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Gary Lineker has predicted Marcus Rashford deserves a starting spot in England's XI at this year's World Cup. The former Match of the Day host made the assertion while addressing speculation surrounding Rashford's future at Manchester United.",
      "Reports have surfaced suggesting interim United manager Michael Carrick is keen to bring the forward back to Old Trafford following the conclusion of his loan at Barcelona. However, it's believed Rashford is hesitant about returning to his boyhood club, where he hasn't featured since December 2024.",
      "Speaking to Spanish football expert Alex Aljoe on The Rest Is Football, Lineker praised Rashford for his latest Barcelona performance. The Englishman was in the starting line-up as the Blaugrana demolished Mallorca 3-0 on Saturday, with Robert Lewandowski, Lamine Yamal and Marc Bernal providing the goals.",
      "\"I want to start with someone who didn't score but got a lot of plaudits, and that's Marcus Rashford,\" he said. \"Because he's been in the news a little bit, that there's a rumour that Michael Carrick wants Rashford to go back.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"And the rumour was that he actually doesn't want to go back. He's pretty happy. I saw a post this morning saying, 'Well played, Marcus. What a performance.' If you look at England [and] who plays on the left for England. I think at the moment, Rashford's miles ahead.\"",
      "Anthony Gordon was put forward as another option, with the Newcastle ace poised to compete for Thomas Tuchel's left wing position. Morgan Rogers and Noni Madueke might also be viewed as contenders for that berth, but Lineker reckons Rashford holds the advantage.",
      "\"Rashford's been really, really good,\" he added. \"And of course, it's a big advantage the way they play in Spain, that it's not so physically demanding. That come the World Cup, he won't be knackered like most of the players playing in the Premier League [laughs].\"",
      "Lineker continues to be impressed by Rashford's exploits at Barcelona(Image: The Rest Is Football)",
      "His most recent appearance in La Liga ended Rashford's run of finding the net in consecutive matches. He delivered the club's consolation goal in a 2-1 loss to Real Sociedad last month before scoring in a 3-1 triumph at Elche.",
      "The 28-year-old has netted 10 goals and registered 13 assists in 34 appearances for Barca in all competitions. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether Hansi Flick has been persuaded to activate the permanent clause to acquire the player for roughly £26million as of yet.",
      "Should Barcelona decline to exercise the buy option, Rashford will head back to Manchester in comparable circumstances to last summer. However, the crucial distinction is that it might be Carrick, rather than Ruben Amorim, making the decisions this time round.",

      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Having previously called Rashford his team-mate, Carrick might possess the expertise required to persuade the player he has a future back at the Theatre of Dreams. Yet Rashford's remarks indicate he may be keen to move on.",
      "Regardless, his spell at the Camp Nou has demonstrated at least the quality he is still capable of producing at the highest level. And should Barca opt against securing his signature permanently, his period in the spotlight may well persuade another club to launch a bid.",

      "Neymar is at risk of missing out on a place in the Brazil squad for the World Cup(Image: (Photo by Ana Julia Guerreiro/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images))",
      "The World Cup is where many of the greatest players in history have cemented their legacies. But for every Leo Messi at Qatar 2022, there is a George Weah, Ryan Giggs or Eric Cantona - players who never appeared on the biggest stage during their glittering careers.",
      "With many domestic seasons in full tilt, there will be players cruelly axed from the biggest ever World Cup in North America due to injuries and lack of form. And the play-offs in March provide further jeopardy for more high-profile stars who could potentially miss out on the 48-team tournament.",
      "Here's a look at some of the biggest stars who risk missing out on the tournament, or have already missed their chance to book tickets for the World Cup.",
      "Neymar has been lauded as one of the best players of his generation, and for good reason. The forward could light up a game with the sort of trickery that has become well associated with the top stars coming out of Brazil.",
      "However, now at 34 years of age, there is growing uncertainty over his place in the national team ahead of what could be his final World Cup. Neymar has been struggling with injury issues over the past few seasons, and while a return to Santos came with the hope of rebounding, it hasn't quite had that effect - yet.",
      "Carlo Ancelotti has made it clear that he won't be carrying players through the tournament, however, as the barrage of questions over the star's possible inclusion in the squad continue. It means Neymar has an uphill battle to be among those on the plane to the World Cup this summer, just 12 years on from making his bow in his home tournament.",

      "Sweden are facing a battle to book their place at the World Cup, after a disappointing qualification campaign that ended in turmoil. The side finished bottom of their group with just two points to their name, as Switzerland, Kosovo, and Slovenia all finished above them.",
      "With Graham Potter in interim charge, Sweden have a lifeline for the World Cup, thanks to the UEFA Nations League, which has put them in the mix for qualification. They take on Ukraine in March internationals for a place in the final of their bracket, which will be a crucial match.",
      "Alexander Isak faces a race to get back fit and firing in time, after picking up a serious leg injury. Meanwhile, other high-profile teammates such as Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres and injured Tottenham forward Dejan Kulusevski also face the possibility of not going to the World Cup, unless their form changes dramatically.",
      "Cameroon missed out on qualifying for the World Cup, after a surprise exit from QAF qualifiers. The African nation have featured at six World Cups, with a quarter-final appearance in 1990.",
      "That means stars such as Bryan Mbeumo and Carlos Baleba won't be featuring at the tournament, despite their impressive campaigns so far this season for Manchester United and Brighton.",

      "It would be inconceivable to suggest that a nation with the history of Italy would miss another World Cup, and yet, that is a distinct possibility. The Azzurri haven't played in the tournament since 2014, missing the 2018 and 2022 editions through the qualification stages.",
      "Here they are again, looking at the need to get through a play-off round to get through to the tournament for the first time in 12 years. Manchester City star Gianluigi Donnarumma, who signed from PSG for £25million last summer, gives them a chance, but the pressure that comes with needing to win the upcoming matches will test even their most notable stars.",
      "Robert Lewandowski is a modern-day great, having shown his quality on both the club and international stage. The striker has often faced a battle to drag Poland through some tough moments, but they have managed to qualify for the past two tournaments, appearing in 2018 and 2022.",
      "At 37, this is more than likely the final chance for Lewandowski to show his quality at the World Cup, but he risks missing out altogether. Poland will need to get past Albania in their first play-off game, before having the possibility of a one-off knockout match to book a place at the finals.",
      "Liverpool star Dominik Szoboszlai has made himself a household name in England, ever since making his move to the Premier League. Despite his moments of individual brilliance, he won't be making an appearance with Hungary at the World Cup this summer, following a tough qualification group.",
      "A 3-2 defeat at the hands of Ireland in the final kick of their final match ensured they won't be able to qualify, and will have to try again for 2030. Szoboszlai admitted the experience was \"very tough\", with the Liverpool ace left thinking what could have been for the upcoming tournament.",

      "Kvicha Kvaratskhelia and his Georgia side excited plenty of fans during the European Championships in 2024, but there will be no repeat of that this summer. The national team failed to book their place at the World Cup this summer, after finishing third in their group.",
      "It was a tough ask for the PSG star and his compatriots, who had Spain and Turkiye in their group, along with Bulgaria, as they picked up just three points. With no route through the play-offs available, Georgia will have to put their World Cup dreams aside for another tournament.",
      "England have struggled to get the best out of Trent Alexander-Arnold so far, while finding a space to fit him in the team on a regular basis. The right-back was deployed in midfield at times by Gareth Southgate, who often preferred other full-backs during his tenure as the head coach.",
      "While Thomas Tuchel is now in charge, the Real Madrid star has only received one call-up to his squad so far, coming in June 2025. With a mixture of injury issues and form concerns, there is a real chance that the 27-year-old misses out on the squad altogether for the summer.",

      "Wales are once again reliant on the qualification play-off route if they are to compete at the 2026 World Cup. They took it close, picking up an impressive 15 points from eight group games, but finished two points shy of the eventual winners, Belgium.",
      "The task ahead for the home nation is a clash with Bosnia and Herzegovina, before a possible tie that will be a one-off final for a place in the tournament. Premier League stars such as Brennan Johnson, Harry Wilson, and Ethan Ampadu will be keen to fire Wales to their second consecutive World Cup, with those play-off games taking place in March.",
      "Johnson may be the nation's main hope of qualifying, having made the move from Tottenham to Crystal Palace for £35million in the January transfer window. With an opportunity for more minutes and a return to form, he could take that momentum into the March internationals with Wales at an important time.",
      "Mikel Merino has been a mainstay for the Spain national team, having shown quality in the midfield, and a finishing touch in the opposition box. That has translated over to his form for Arsenal, where he has played as an auxiliary striker at times, alongside his usual role as a midfielder.",
      "While there is some hope that he will feature at the World Cup, there are doubts over his availability. Merino has picked up an injury, with a fractured bone in his foot, causing some discomfort, which will require a procedure to ensure that he can return to action as quickly as possible.",
      "Despite those hopes, some reports in Spain have claimed that Merino could miss the rest of the season, and will be facing a race against time to get fit and available for the World Cup.",

      "Northern Ireland earned themselves a chance at booking a place in the World Cup this summer by finishing as one of the best third-placed teams in the UEFA qualification stages. They managed to pick up nine points in six games in a group that included Germany, Slovakia and Luxembourg.",
      "Their reward for that achievement... a clash with Italy in the first round of the qualification play-offs. It'll be a tough test, but one that can be done, as the Azzurri have shown through their recent downfalls in these play-off rounds.",
      "That challenge is made tougher, however, through the absence of Conor Bradley. The defender picked up a serious knee injury that will see him out of action until next season at the earliest, with the Liverpool star only able to watch on and hope that his national team can pull off a miracle.",
      "Turkiye have been viewed as potential dark horses in recent competitions, but they haven't quite been able to turn that into results. There is a chance to do so at the World Cup, but they will also need to get through the qualification play-offs to give themselves an opportunity to do so.",
      "They take on Romania first up, with hope that they can lean on some of their best talent to step up and do the business. Kenan Yildiz is certainly one of those for his national team, with the youngster proving his quality for Juventus, while attracting attention from clubs across Europe.",
      "Translating that onto the national stage would be the next step on his way to stardom, but he risks missing a World Cup if he cannot.",
      "Denmark suffered heartbreak late on in their qualification clash with Scotland, which saw them lose their grasp on a place at the World Cup. An almighty collapse in their final two games resulted in the unlikely drop into the play-offs, where they will now face North Macedonia.",
      "Some familiar faces are in the Denmark camp, such as Rasmus Hojlund, Christian Eriksen, and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. They will be leaning on that experience and quality to get them through the upcoming matches, while burying the demons that were left from their defeat to Scotland.",

      "He departed following his final broadcast of the 2025 Champions League final between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan. He was previously a regular face of the channel’s European, Premier League and domestic cup coverage.",
      "And he has now opened up on why he chose to depart the channel, with Ferdinand keen for a new challenge, having seen his ideas for a freshen up with the broadcasters ignored.",
      "Speaking to Men’s Health, the former defender said: “I like being tested. I like pressure. I had it fine at TNT. I could have signed a new contract at TNT. Easily. But that ain’t who I am really. It’s time for something new.",
      "“And with all due respect, I’d been trying to push [a new] side of things within the team and the group at TNT, and they weren’t really as receptive as I would’ve liked.",
      "“So that was another big reason why I go, ‘Okay, if you’re not going to jump in two-footed with me and hold hands, then I move on. We’ll see how I do when I go on my own’.",
      "“Because I saw the new world is that linear TV and live football are always going to be there, but there’s also another world outside the 90 minutes that intrigues me, which I look at like a fan.",
      "“So I want to know what the f*** these guys are eating, how do they sleep, how do they recover? I want to get the public closer to that and I want to be at the forefront of that.",

      "The former defender rounded off his career in football in 2015 following a brief spell with Queens Park Rangers. Before that, he spent 12 glittering seasons with Man United, winning six league titles and the Champions League under legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson. Ferdinand also earned 81 appearances for England during his playing career.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has started four games under Michael Carrick(Image: Photo by Mike Morese/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United's rumoured willingness to loan out Kobbie Mainoo for the remainder of the campaign has reportedly stunned several Premier League sides, as well as Napoli. Mainoo struggled during the opening months of the season under former boss Ruben Amorim and failed to earn a single Premier League start before the Portuguese manager's exit in December.",
      "At one point, Mainoo appeared destined for a loan move, until interim boss Michael Carrick stepped in. Napoli were particularly eager to bring the 21 year old in on a temporary basis for the rest of the season, whilst the midfielder also caught the eye of Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton.",
      "Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have both joined Napoli - McTominay on a permanent transfer and Hojlund on loan - and the duo have flourished since departing Old Trafford. Napoli manager Antonio Conte was keen to add another United player to his ranks following their impressive form.",
      "According to The Telegraph, there was 'genuine disbelief' in Naples that United were even considering allowing Mainoo to leave. Similar sentiments were reportedly echoed by 'many Premier League clubs' who had expressed interest in securing the youngster on loan.",
      "Throughout Amorim's tenure, the 41-year-old frequently emphasised his desire for players to 'stay and fight' rather than abandon ship at the first hint of difficulty - taking aim at what he perceived as an 'entitlement' mentality amongst certain academy graduates.",
      "He had also pointed to Casemiro as a prime example of a player who changed his attitude and battled his way back into the starting XI, stating: \"When I see Casemiro training, if everyone trains like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in training, in set-pieces training, even when they are playing ten versus goalkeeper, and the movements that he made, imagining the game, we will be a top team.",
      "\"If everyone works like Casemiro, and when I say work it's not just running, it's that focus. You can understand why that guy won five Champions Leagues, because if you pay attention to everything that he does with contract, with no contract, he's top player.\"",
      "Many interpreted this as another thinly-veiled dig at Mainoo.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo in action for Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The Mirror also revealed that, following Carrick's appointment, Mainoo was informed he would feature in the squad for the rest of the campaign.",
      "This came with explicit instructions to concentrate on winning back his place at his boyhood club, whilst demonstrating that Amorim had made a mistake in sidelining him.",
      "Since Carrick took charge, Mainoo has been named in the starting line-up against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham.",
      "He is also expected to be in the frame to start their fixture at relegation-battling West Ham on Tuesday night (8pm).",

      "Ruben Amorim could replace Jose Mourinho at Benfica in the summer(Image: Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images)",
      "Jose Mourinho will reportedly be offered the Portugal manager's job after Roberto Martinez steps down following the World Cup. Mourinho is currently in charge of Benfica but has previously made it clear that he would love to manage his country, opening up the possibility of another high-profile role for the 63-year-old.",
      "Martinez is preparing to lead Portugal at the World Cup, which kicks off in Canada, the United States and Mexico on June 11. Like many international bosses, including Thomas Tuchel with England, his contract will expire at the end of the tournament.",
      "The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) is therefore planning ahead and has reportedly made Mourinho the top choice to replace Martinez. Mourinho signed a two-year contract when he joined Benfica in September following his exit from Fenerbahce, but ESPN says the FPF will try and lure him into international management for the first time in the summer.",
      "That possibility would open up the Benfica role for Ruben Amorim, who is currently without a job after being sacked by United at the start of January. Amorim's reputation has taken a hit in the Premier League, but he remains highly regarded in his home country and would be the top pick for Benfica if they lose Mourinho, given his success at Sporting Lisbon and the fact he spent nine years there as a player.",
      "Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google search.",
      "Mourinho has been at the top level of club management for over 20 years, taking charge of Porto, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Manchester United, Tottenham, Roma, Fenerbahce and Benfica. But he is yet to taste international management and has made it clear that he would only consider doing so with Portugal.",
      "\"I want to play a European Championship or a World Cup and unite a country around a team, as I have already done many times with the clubs,\" he said in an interview with Corriere Dello Sport in January last year while still at Fenerbahce. \"I want to do it for football and what this sport represents. It will be incredible.\"",
      "Then, when linked with the Brazil job - which eventually went to Carlo Ancelotti - he said: \"My destiny, in terms of internationals, is to play in a World Cup with the Portuguese national team. I never considered coaching the Brazilian national team.",
      "Jose Mourinho was appointed by Benfica earlier this season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"My first experience has to be with Portugal, and then people have to understand that I'm a professional and that I can coach other teams, but always teams with which I have something that connects me.",
      "\"Brazil, obviously, because of the historical relationship between our countries, England because it's my home, Italy, I worked there for several years, but my first experience with the national team has to be mine.\"",
      "Benfica are currently third in the Portuguese top flight, seven points adrift of leaders Porto and three behind Sporting. They face a two-legged play-off against Real Madrid for a place in the last 16 of the Champions League following a dramatic 4-2 win over Los Blancos in the final game of the group stage last month.",

      "Michael Carrick was once on the wrong side of Sir Alex Ferguson's infamous hairdryer treatment at Manchester United - but showed his mettle by staying silent and not letting the harsh criticism get the better of him.",
      "The current Man United interim boss received his dressing-down while the Red Devils were in action against Ecuadorian side Liga de Quito in the Club World Cup in Yokohama, after beating Chelsea in the 2008 Champions League final in Moscow.",
      "Throughout the final, legendary United boss Ferguson had been on at Carrick to move the ball forward more regularly. The midfielder, whose playing career started at United's opponents this Tuesday, West Ham, insists all but one of his passes were played forward - the one that Ferguson remembered.",
      "The Scot lost his temper on the touchline, and Carrick came in for one hell of a talking to at half-time. Writing in his autobiography, Between the Lines, Carrick said: \"The moment I entered the changing room, the boss launched into me. 'Pass the ball f***ing forward, I f***ing told you'. Sir Alex was raging.",

      "\"On the inside, I was fuming, saying to myself, 'I must have played 40 passes forward here, and he's picked the one where I've gone back'. But the boss was so wound up that I didn't dare voice my defence.\"",
      "A Wayne Rooney goal saw United win the match 1-0, despite centre-back Nemanja Vidic being shown a red card. And Carrick remained an important player for Ferguson, with the Scot later admitting he always thought highly of the midfielder.",
      "A big reason for this, as the Scot would explain, is that Carrick showed incredible maturity early on in his career when leaving the north east for West Ham at such a young age.",

      "Michael Carrick has had a great impact at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The debate around Michael Carrick’s Manchester United future continues to roll on. The former Red Devils midfielder was appointed last month as Ruben Amorim’s replacement on a deal until the end of the season.",
      "The idea was for Carrick to stabilise the ship ahead of stepping down in favour of a more high-profile name. But he has outperformed that original remit, leading the club to four consecutive wins, with many now clamouring for him to be given the role on a full-term basis.",
      "A number of former United stars have offered their take on a potential appointment, with some suggesting he should be a shoo-in. Other ex-Red Devils have claimed that club chiefs should stick to the original plan.",
      "With that being said, take a look at what every former United star has said when it comes to Carrick’s future at Old Trafford:",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Let’s start with the man himself. Carrick has regularly been asked about his take on the long-term Man United hotseat.",
      "And while he might have ambitions, he has kept them close to his chest. Speaking last week, he said: “I'm fully aware of the role I'm doing here and the responsibility I've got.",
      "“We want to be successful, and I want the club to be successful beyond the end of the season - if that's me, if that's somebody else.",
      "“At this stage, I can't control that and we'll see what happens, but it's certainly about trying to improve the team and making Manchester United stronger. Results over a short period of time don't change that.”",
      "Carrick has regularly spoken out on his role(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Pundit Gary Neville has never been afraid to share his opinion on the goings on at Old Trafford - and Carrick’s future is no different. Speaking just after the midfielder was given the job, he claimed that he should only fulfill his original remit.",
      "\"I hope he does really well,\" Neville said on the Stick to Football podcast. \"There cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond this season, for Michael and for the club.",
      "\"If he wins every game, look, we could be sat here in the season where he's done unbelievably well, and we're always thinking the fans are up and they're in the Champions League places, fifth or whatever. It could happen if there's a good run and we could all be getting swayed with it.",
      "\"I honestly feel like [you have to look at others] at the end of the season when you've got [Mauricio] Pochettino, [Thomas] Tuchel and [Carlo] Ancelotti.",
      "Gary Neville has shared his insight on United's search for a new manager(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"I've said Ancelotti. I just feel purely because he's 66 years of age, he's got probably the best job in the world right now. He's probably got one job left at club level.",
      "\"If there's one person who's got the patience, the composure, the experience of the Premier League.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Neville has since revealed that the Red Devils have already gotten the process of finding Carrick’s eventual replacement underway. He said: \"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else.",
      "“I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.”",
      "With Neville being against Carrick’s long-term appointment, he can count Roy Keane among the colleagues to agree with him. Speaking after his initial arrival, the Irishman said that United needed the ‘best of the best’.",
      "He has since softened on that stance, but still believes that United should look elsewhere. He said: “I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it. Yeah, but, I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go ‘listen, good luck to him’, but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be",
      "“I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud (Van Nistelrooy), he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.",
      "“But just cause you're doing well at United, it doesn't mean he'll do well at another club. He's got the players back, it's all been sliding doors moments. Great for him, and he's took advantage of it.”",
      "Roy Keane has taken a brutal stance when it comes to Michael Carrick(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Former defender Ferdinand has responded to those claims and suggested that he can’t wrap his head around Keane’s comments. He said: “No matter what Michael Carrick does, how well he does, and if he got the job on the back of a great ending to the season, there's still risk.",
      "“There's an element of risk, but with every one of the names that get thrown into the hat, there an element of risk with all of them.",
      "“I don't know in any walk of life, where someone comes in given the opportunity to do well, and put their first foot forward for a job opportunity, they smash it - and hopefully he carries on, at the moment he’s smashing it, four wins out of four, and people are going ‘no, he shouldn’t get it though’.",
      "“I don't understand that with Roy, I've got to be honest. I don't know how you can be so against it.”",
      "His former defensive colleague Stam has also shared his thoughts on the Red Devils’ search for a new manager and suggested that former Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi would be an excellent candidate instead of Carrick.",
      "He said: \"I like De Zerbi very much, you know, because of how he performed at Brighton and also now in Marseille. How he's playing with his teams, because he plays possession-based football, he's very good on the ball.",
      "\"He also sets the players in certain positions that it makes it really difficult for the opposition to press them. You know, he's going forward, he attacks. Scores a lot of goals, sometimes concedes, but you know that as a manager.",
      "\"But I think he's also a good man-manager. I think he's also good with the players and giving them the confidence, giving them the attention they need - and not only the starting XI, but also the other players within the squad. And that's what you need in a big club like that. So I would be very happy if they don't go for Carrick, and that they go for him.\"",
      "Jaap Stam and Dimitaor Berbatov have shared their thoughts on United's managerial decision(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Having enjoyed a successful period playing together at Old Trafford, former striker Berbatov is among those keen to see Carrick succeed - but has called for patience before any rash decision is made.",
      "\"I am a bit biased of course, because I used to play with him [Carrick] and I want him to get the job but let's wait until the end of the season and if they go the way they are right now, of course, why not?\", Berbatov said to ESPN FC.",
      "\"We have seen what happened before with Ole Gunnar Solskjær, I think it was the same story so let's not jump to conclusions yet, let's just enjoy game by game how United is improving and at the end of the season we will wait and see what happens.\"",
      "\"He [Carrick] is in this position to show that he is capable of doing these things. So far in the games that we have watched, everything is just happening for the team and for him. Until the end of the season will be a test, and then we'll see if Michael can get the job permanently.\"",
      "Meanwhile, fellow former striker Louis Saha is keen to see Carrick retained on a permanent basis.",
      "He said: \"I would love to see Michael given the chance. He's done very well. He's a very hardworking guy but humble as well. The results are going for him at the moment but not only the results, the way the team is playing and performing, we all can see the change straightaway. He's had the biggest impact since Sir Alex Ferguson.\"",
      "\"He does provide an answer to the question about the next manager. Necessity, I do think they need to think about Carrick very, very, very seriously there.",
      "\"We know the expectation is so big and sometimes both have certain types of conversations and they want to see a long term plan. Do they see this is a spell where everything is going well for Carrick? Who knows how he reacts when he's under more pressure.",
      "Louis Saha believes Carrick should be appointed permanently(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"So maybe he needs to be challenged in that sense to be considered for the full-time role. I don't know.",
      "\"What I see is that he understands the DNA of the club, he's been under pressure, maybe not as a manager but as a player, he understands how those managers have reacted before as he was part of the coaching staff. So he understands. He's not a rookie. So I do think he deserves his position but when names like Ancelotti, Zidane come into play, it's a kind of a different ball game.\"",
      "The final ex-United star to speak out was former midfielder Owen Hargreaves and he claims that the run of form under Carrick makes it impossible not to give him the role permanently.",
      "\"I don’t see how you couldn’t give it to him,\" said Hargreaves to MEN. \"What would have been the point of working that hard? You can get elite managers in, but that doesn't guarantee success.",
      "\"What Michael’s doing is very impressive. The fans are happy, which is important. The players are happy and that’s important, but the most important thing is that the team wins.",
      "\"United have had big-name managers on the bench. They had two of the greatest in the last 10 years, up there with Pep and Ancelotti: Van Gaal and Mourinho. A huge name comes with more expectation.\"",

      "His switch to Spain came half a year after he sealed a temporary stint with Aston Villa. Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan with the Midlands club after falling out of favour at United, but a deal wasn't made permanent.",

It is understood that Rashford favours a departure from United in the summer window, regardless of whether a permanent switch to Barcelona materialises.",
      "He reportedly wants his long-term situation sorted before linking up with England for the summer's World Cup in North America. If this proves to be the case, it would provide United with a welcome financial injection early in the transfer window as they seek to strengthen their squad.",

      "Rio Ferdinand says he sometimes requires the use of a wheelchair(Image: Andrew Kearns - CameraSport via Getty Images))",
      "Years of playing football have left Rio Ferdinand needing a wheelchair on occasion. The toll of the Manchester United defender's lengthy and successful career has led to significant injuries, resulting in hospital stays even over a decade after his retirement.",
      "Now 47, former England centre-back Ferdinand confessed to Men's Health UK: \"I've had a bad back for a long time. I've got injuries that I had from my career... I was on tablets and injections for six years to play games. That's affected me. I get some bad moments of back pain where I have to be in a hospital for a couple of days or in a wheelchair for a couple of days. It's mad, but it just comes out of nowhere.\"",
      "Ferdinand and his family now reside in Dubai, which he describes as a new 'adventure', and he's picked up new techniques to better maintain his body. \"I've been seeing a physio for the first time since I retired,\" he disclosed.",
      "\"He's been doing loads of manipulations and whatnot, and within his building there's also my personal trainer, so he feeds him information about my training. There's a holistic approach to what I'm doing now and hopefully that's going to put me in good stead. Rather than fixing when it's broken, you actually prevent [injuries]. I know my sh*t now. But I'm 47 years old. It took me all that time.\"",
      "With 14 major honours under his belt, including six Premier League titles, Ferdinand could easily kick back now. However, inspiring his children remains important to him. He explained: \"I've got kids that need to see a work ethic.",
      "\"My kids need to see me getting up and going to work. They need to see me and [my wife] Kate going to the gym. I want them to have a healthy lifestyle and to think that going to the gym or just moving is the norm.",
      "\"And I'm not about telling my kids that; they need to see it. But also, if I'm being honest, I have to go to work for my mental sanity as well. I like work; my mum and dad worked. They were grafters. That's all I've known.",
      "\"When my kids talk about me, as much as it is, yeah, 'Daddy loves me' and 'Daddy's done everything for me.' It's 'Daddy worked hard. He was a hustler.' You know what I mean?\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand and wife, Kate(Image: Getty Images for Atlantis The Ro)",
      "Living in Dubai with wife Kate and the family offers a completely different way of life compared to the demanding football training regime in Manchester. \"My life has been governed by the fixture list while playing football and then, post-career, being a pundit,\" he explained.",
      "\"There aren't many opportunities in life where you get time to make a big change, have an adventure, step out of your comfort zone and explore something new. So this is it. This is what we wanted to do.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"I had it fine at TNT. I could have signed a new contract at TNT. Easily. But that ain't who I am really. It's time for something new because I saw the new world is that linear TV and live football are always going to be there.",
      "\"But there's also another world outside the 90 minutes that intrigues me, which I look at like a fan. So I want to know what these guys are eating, how do they sleep, how do they recover? I want to get the public closer to that and I want to be at the forefront of that.\"",
      "Ferdinand's legendary status amongst United supporters is cemented from his playing days, though his journey beyond the pitch remains very much ongoing. \"[I want to be remembered] as someone who worked hard and has been successful in multiple sectors,\" he reflected.",
      "\"Whether it's my [Rio Ferdinand] Foundation, which has been going for 15 years, helping underprivileged kids, or whether it's my [Rio Ferdinand Presents] media company or other successful businesses that I've got. I just want to be someone who is a doer...who ain't scared of change or failure. Who always stood up for the right things when need be. And if I can inspire other people doing that type of stuff, then it's like, 'Okay, I've done all right.'\"",

      "Rio Ferdinand has offered his take on Michael Carrick's future(Image: Rio Ferdinand Presents/YouTube)",
      "Rio Ferdinand has taken a swipe at former Manchester United teammate Roy Keane for his view on Michael Carrick’s future. The ex-Red Devils midfielder has endured a dream stint at Old Trafford, leading the club to four consecutive wins.",
      "That has triggered a huge reaction from fans, with some demanding that Carrick be handed the job on a permanent basis. His contract is only set to run until the end of the season.",
      "Keane, however, is not yet convinced and claimed that club chiefs should stick with their original plan of appointing a more established name ahead of next term. Ferdinand has responded to his opinion and claimed that he can’t quite wrap his head around it.",
      "“There's risks with anyone that goes in there,” he said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. “No matter what Michael Carrick does, how well he does, and if he got the job on the back of a great ending to the season, there's still risk.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“There's an element of risk, but with every one of the names that get thrown into the hat, there an element of risk with all of them.",
      "“I don't know in any walk of life, where someone comes in given the opportunity to do well, and put their first foot forward for a job opportunity, they smash it - and hopefully he carries on, at the moment he’s smashing it, four wins out of four, and people are going ‘no, he shouldn’t get it though’.",
      "“I don't understand that with Roy, I've got to be honest. I don't know how you can be so against it.”",
      "While Keane has taken a hard-line stance on Carrick’s future, he appears to have softened over recent days. Having completely ruled out a permanent appointment originally, he recently claimed that he could understand if United chiefs choose to stick with him even though it wouldn’t be his call.",
      "Michael Carrick has had an eye-catching impact at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "He said: “I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it. Yeah, but, I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go ‘listen, good luck to him’, but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be",
      "“I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud (Van Nistelrooy), he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.",
      "“But just cause you're doing well at United, it doesn't mean he'll do well at another club. He's got the players back, it's all been sliding doors moments. Great for him, and he's took advantage of it.”",

      "Christian Pulisic left Chelsea for AC Milan(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United and Arsenal are reportedly interested in signing ex-Chelsea star Christian Pulisic following a standout season. The American winger, currently with AC Milan, has shone in Serie A over the past few campaigns following his exit from Chelsea.",
      "He has 10 goals in all competitions for the Italian giants - that form following seasons in which he has hit 15 and 16 goals respectively. And it appears those displays have not gone unnoticed, particularly in the Premier League.",
      "As per CalcioMercato, top-flight trio Man United, Arsenal and Tottenham are all keeping a close eye on the 27-year-old. It is suggested that any interested suitors could take advantage of Pulisic’s contractual situation - his current deal with AC Milan expiring in 2027.",
      "It is believed that an offer of around €55m (£48m) would be enough to tempt the Serie A side into selling. Chelsea originally signed him for £57m from Borussia Dortmund back in 2019 but he struggled for consistency at Stamford Bridge, scoring just 26 times across 145 appearances.",
      "They eventually sold him for around £20m. Pulisic has also been backed for a move to MLS in the near future but former Tottenham goalkeeper Brad Friedel has suggested that he should only consider that switch later in his career.",
      "Speaking to Goal, he said: \"In the future, yes. It’s like this – just from a U.S. fan standpoint, I want as many of the best players for the national team playing at the highest level of competition they can, because that will make sure that the national team competes stronger against the world ’s elite.",
      "\"I like it when players don’t know when their next contract is coming, they always have the next young player pushing to take their spot, they have to always get better.",
      "\"If somebody came in like your Weston McKennie and your Christian Pulisic, they would have so much power at an MLS club, I would worry that they wouldn’t be focused on just getting better.",
      "Pulisic has been in brilliant form for AC Milan over recent seasons(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"Eventually I would love to see Christian and Weston and Tyler [Adams] come back and all these guys finish their careers in MLS. That would be great. But in the peak of their career, I don’t think MLS is there yet.\"",
      "Pulisic is however expected to be one of the poster boys for the upcoming World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico. The winger has collected 82 caps for the US and scored 32 goals since his debut in 2016.",

      "Manchester United manager Michael Carrick celebrates",
      "The London Stadium will stage an intriguing Premier League clash on Tuesday night as West Ham United host Manchester United, with both sides enjoying recent revivals. The Hammers are aiming for a fifth win in six matches after a 2-0 victory over Burnley, while Manchester United, under Michael Carrick, kept their strong run going with a 2-0 win against 10-man Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Carrick, a former Hammer himself, has had nothing but a positive impact on the visitors, guiding United to four straight wins—including triumphs over Arsenal, Manchester City, and Fulham—and keeping them firmly in the hunt for a Champions League spot. The Red Devils have scored at least twice in every match under Carrick and are now just three points behind third-placed Aston Villa. Their attack has been prolific, with goals in each of their last 14 games in all competitions, and only one defeat in their last nine away fixtures.",
      "West Ham, meanwhile, have also turned their season around, collecting nine points from their last four league games. Recent goals from Crysencio Summerville and Taty Castellanos secured a crucial win at Burnley, lifting the Hammers to within three points of safety. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have now won four of their last five matches, a significant improvement after a difficult start to the campaign. However, home form remains a concern, with just one win in their last 16 home league games against established Premier League teams. Despite this, West Ham have beaten Manchester United on each of the Red Devils’ last three visits to the London Stadium.",
      "Manchester United’s injury list remains unchanged following Saturday’s win, with Patrick Dorgu (thigh), Mason Mount, and Matthijs de Ligt (back) still sidelined. The quick turnaround could prompt Michael Carrick to rotate, with Benjamin Sesko and Noussair Mazraoui possible options, but the absence of European fixtures means the same starting XI is likely. Bruno Fernandes, now involved in 200 goals for United, is one assist away from breaking the club’s record for most away assists in a Premier League season, currently tied with Ryan Giggs at eight.",
      "For West Ham, Nuno Espirito Santo is expected to have the same squad available, still missing suspended Jean-Clair Todibo and injured goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski (back). Todibo’s suspension allowed Axel Disasi to debut against Burnley, and he should feature again at home. Captain Jarrod Bowen will look to add to his three goals in his last five league games against United, while Crysencio Summerville aims to score for a sixth consecutive match in all competitions.",

      "Manchester United are now just one victory away from the challenge coming to an end(Image: @TheUnitedStrand/INSTAGRAM)",
      "Michael Carrick is keen to make if five straight wins for Manchester United, but says the fan who has gone viral for not cutting his hair won't be mentioned in his pre-match team talk. United travel to in-form West Ham in the Premier League on Tuesday night hoping to continue their perfect start under Carrick - and another win would have a knock-on effect.",
      "Supporter Frank Ilett has vowed not to cut his hair until United rack up five victories on the spin. He started posting on social media about the idea in October 2024 and is currently over 500 days without a trim.",
      "Known as The United Strand, he has amassed over two million followers on social media, with his bushy hair going viral during the difficult times under Ruben Amorim. But Carrick's arrival as interim manager last month has raised the prospect of it coming to an end.",
      "Carrick has overseen wins against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham and it's now just West Ham who can stop Ilett from getting his wild mane chopped. \"I can say I'm aware of it, yeah,\" Carrick said when asked about Ilett in his pre-match press conference.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"My kids have made me aware of it, if anything, but it certainly won't go into the team talk from a professional level. I can understand what's going on with it and it does make me smile but it won't have an impact ultimately in the end.\"",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes was asked a similar question after scoring in the 2-0 win over 10-man Spurs on Saturday, but gave it short shrift. \"I need to book for myself, I don’t look at other people,\" Fernandes said. “I don't look if they need to go to the hair dresser or not, that is not important for me.”",
      "United have been transformed under Carrick's leadership and sit fourth in the Premier League after their winning run. West Ham, by contrast, occupy the final relegation spot in 18th place, but three wins in their last four matches will make them a tricky prospect at the London Stadium.",
      "Frank Ilett has not cut his hair in over 500 days(Image: @TheUnitedStrand/INSTAGRAM)",
      "But a haircut could be around the corner",
      "\"You definitely take the confidence and the feeling from the games that you've had knowing you can go into the next game with a little bit more feel-good factor about it,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"I guess the big challenge is knowing what's got you there and all the hard work and the preparation and then what it takes to win a game of football at this level is tough, so never assuming the next one's just going to be alright.\"",
      "Carrick confirmed that his side will be without Mason Mount and Matthijs de Ligt, who are still recovering from injuries. United will have a 12-day break after the West Ham game due to their exit from the FA Cup.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Manchester United's Premier League trip to West Ham.",
      "Michael Carrick's dream start to life in charge of United continued at the weekend with a 2-0 home victory over Tottenham, extending his perfect record to four wins from four. The victory consolidated United's place in the top four as they target a return to the Champions League.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "A win at relegation-threatened West Ham tonight will move Carrick's side above Aston Villa and into third ahead of Villa's match with Brighton on Wednesday.",
      "United remain without Mason Mount, Patrick Dorgu and Matthijs de Ligt for the trip to the capital but otherwise have a fully fit squad to choose from.",
      "Kick off at the London Stadium is 8.15pm and you can follow the build-up, action, reaction and analysis right here with our blog, so stay with us.",
      "You’ve probably been under a rock if you haven’t heard about the fan who isn’t cutting his hair until United win five games in a row. Frank Illet, AKA The United Strand, has gone viral for the stunt, attracting media attention from around the world. There was a press conference yesterday to give reporters a chance to ask him questions. Carrick has overseen four wins since his interim appointment, and he has good opportunity to claim a fifth on the bounce this evening. .",
      "United are the favourites to win a fifth game on the bounce.",
      "West Ham vs United odds",
      "Betfair Spokesperson, Sam Rosbottom said: \"At full time tonight, one Man United fan will either be shaving his hair off, or pulling his hair out. The United Strand can be confident going into the match away at West Ham, there are no split ends in the betting, the Reds are the odds-on favourites at 8/13.",
      "\"While United are fancied to win away from home tonight, Michael Carrick’s side have repeatedly defied the odds, winning as outsiders against Manchester City at 2/1 and Arsenal at 9/2 during their current four-game winning streak.",
      "“If they make it five wins in a row tonight, the wins over Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham, Spurs and West Ham would equate to an extraordinary run at around 63/1 based on pre-match odds.”",
      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up.",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "Again, there aren't many selection decisions for Carrick to make here. I certainly wouldn't be making any changes defensively and the back four that has impressed recently can go again.",
      "There will be a question mark over Casemiro, who has sometimes struggled when the games come thick and fast. The problem is that Manuel Ugarte is a significant drop-off from the Brazilian. I'd take the risk with Casemiro and hope his legs hold out before an 11-day break.",
      "One player who deserves a start is Benjamin Sesko. He has made an impact as a sub and this game looks ideal to bring him in. I would take Amad out, purely because Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have looked a little more threatening in front of goal.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Carrick will surely be tempted to pick another unchanged starting XI after a fourth win on the bounce, but I would make two changes to the team: Ugarte for Casemiro and Sesko for Amad.",
      "The Ugarte selection may be controversial, but Casemiro was really poor against Burnley at the beginning of January because he'd started two games in the space of four days. I'd pick the Brazilian if there was a guarantee he could perform, but his inclusion would mean another two starts in four days.",
      "Ugarte should benefit from coming into a team playing with confidence. The Sesko decision doesn't need much explaining because he deserves a start after a positive spell. Mbeumo simply can't be dropped and Amad has played more football than Cunha, so he should move to the bench.",
      "Teenager Tyler Fletcher travelled with the squad for tonight's game after coming off the bench to make his debut in the win against Tottenham at the weekend.",
      "United took the train from Stockport to London on Monday afternoon ahead of the fixture at the London Stadium tonight, when Carrick will be looking to continue his perfect start to life as the club's latest head coach.",
      "See the players who have travelled here >>>",
      "United have enjoyed a brilliant start to life under Michael Carrick and after masterminding a victory over one of his ex-clubs in Tottenham on Saturday he will look to repeat the trick at West Ham tonight. The short turnaround after the win at Old Trafford opens up some questions over rotation.",
      "Keeping Kobbie Mainoo in the starting line-up seems a must if United want to continue their good form. Since his recall, he has not missed a beat and against Spurs he was brilliant linking play through the middle.",
      "There could be a temptation to bring Leny Yoro into the starting XI in place of Harry Maguire should the experienced centre-back need a rest but the preference would be to keep the back four the same.",
      "Here's how we think Carrick could set up the Reds",
      "United take on West Ham in the Premier League tonight looking to record a fifth successive win in the top flight after claiming a 2-0 victory against Tottenham last weekend.",
      "Michael Carrick has won each of his games in charge in his role as interim head coach so far, but West Ham are fighting for survival this season and will be tricky opponents in London.",
      "The Irons have won three of their last four games in the league.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up",
      "The 45-year-old has earned a reputation as one of the most articulate pundits in the business, and believes it would be a no-brainer for United to give Michael Carrick the job if he steers the club into the Champions League.",
      "\"I don’t see how you couldn’t give it to him,\" said Hargreaves. \"What would have been the point of working that hard? You can get elite managers in, but that doesn't guarantee success.\"",
      "Read more from our big interview with Hargreaves here.",
      "Mason Mount will be back in contention for United's Premier League fixture against Everton in two weeks, but tomorrow's trip to West Ham is likely to come too soon for the midfielder. Mount picked up a minor injury in training before the win against Fulham and remained absent when United beat Tottenham at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Although Mount is now close to a return, Carrick is reluctant to risk him at the London Stadium as he goes in search of a fifth successive victory.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt faces a race against time to be fit for the trip to Everton as he continues his recovery from a back injury that has now kept him out for more than two months. The Dutch centre-back hasn't played since United won at Crystal Palace on November 30, when Ruben Amorim initially said his absence would be short-term.",
      "Here's the full team news ahead of tonight's game",
      "Does anyone recall the reverse fixture between these two sides in December?",
      "A game United drew 1-1 having led and one of several examples of the kind of performance we were used to seeing from Ruben Amorim's side. An inability to hold onto leads and a lack of courage and confidence to go and win games they should be winning.",
      "A month or so on and United look a team transformed under Michael Carrick and will be third in the table if they win tonight. What a difference."

      "Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire are developing a promising partnership at United",
      "Things got off to a pretty inauspicious start for Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez when they teamed up at Manchester United, so much so that their partnership as a pair of centre-backs was put on the back burner for three-and-a-half years.",
      "There is a certain irony that in what could be the twilight of Maguire's Old Trafford career, Michael Carrick has put them back together and watched them establish an impressive pairing that had been there all along, hiding in plain sight.",
      "Remarkably, Saturday's win against Tottenham was only the 15th time Maguire and Martinez had started together as central defenders in a back four since the Argentine joined United for £57million in the summer of 2022. Eight of those 15 games have ended with United keeping a clean sheet.",
      "There are various reasons this partnership has never had the chance to flourish. They started the first two games of the Erik ten Hag era, but were damned by association to a 2-1 defeat to Brighton and a 4-0 defeat at Brentford. Martinez was replaced at half-time in the second of those games as pundits piled in on his height, but it was Maguire who was dropped from the team.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Since then, Martinez has suffered a couple of serious injuries that have kept him sidelined for long periods and there was the 14-month spell when Ruben Amorim went for a back three. They only started together in eight games during the Amorim era.",
      "Maguire's return to fitness under Carrick has thrown them back together and they are playing like a pairing with years of experience. They have the right-foot and left-foot balance, the passer and the more physical centre-back, the one who loves an aerial duel and the other who relishes a ground duel. They look almost perfect together.",
      "Jaap Stam knows a fair bit about playing centre-back for United, having made 127 appearances for the club between 1998 and 2002, and he likes the way Maguire and Martinez have developed a partnership that plays to their strengths.",
      "\"But every time he played, he showed his quality and he's been very important for the team because it's not only in how he can play, but also, I think, in his personality to be a leader, to talk to the players, to guide them in a certain way.",
      "\"So he's been very important for United and together with Martinez. Martinez is more the player who wants to build up, who wants to have the ability on the ball to find that right pass into midfield or to the forwards so they can go and attack. I think it's a great partnership up till now. They've shown their ability and which is very important for United.\"",
      "United have kept as many clean sheets in four games under Carrick (two) as they did in Amorim's 21 games in charge this season and it has made winning games easier.",
      "There was no shame in conceding two at Arsenal and although there would have been frustration at seeing Fulham score twice at Old Trafford, there were shut-outs against Manchester City and Tottenham that set the basis for 2-0 wins.",
      "\"It's pleasing for sure,\" said Carrick. \"It's easier to win games without having to score so many goals every week. We do seem to be a team that can cause a lot of problems and create opportunities and score goals, so it's definitely getting the balance right.",
      "\"There are still things to improve on, it's definitely something we've focused on, trying to be better as a team collectively when we don't have the ball, but in three or four weeks, you're not going to fix everything and all of a sudden look perfect.",
      "\"I think the boys have responded really well to what we've asked them and the clean sheet [on Saturday] was important for us.\"",
      "The question now is how many more times Maguire and Martinez will play together. They look like the starting centre-backs every week at the moment, especially with Matthijs de Ligt struggling with a back injury, but Maguire is into the final few months of his United contract.",
      "He turns 33 next month and United are taking the time before deciding whether to offer an extension, which may require the player to take a pay cut from a salary of just under £200,000-a-week.",
      "His experience could also be invaluable. Casemiro will leave in the summer and this is now a young squad, so Maguire, having been around the block, could have a role to play, especially as two of the centre-backs waiting in the wings are younger in Leny Yoro (20) and Ayden Heaven (19).",
      "\"When you play with older players, it's very important,\" added Stam. \"These older players, when they have the ability, they can guide them into the right positions and how to take up certain positions so it makes it easier for the team but also for them to play.\"",
      "That might be another reason for United to consider keeping Maguire, but for now the primary motivation is his performances on the pitch and a partnership that has been a long time in the making.",

      "Michael Carrick has put his faith in Harry Maguire(Image: PA)",
      "Harry Maguire looks incredibly likely to see a new contract with Manchester United in the coming months, as Michael Carrick continues to put his faith in the centre-half. The England international will be 33 years old when his current deal expires this summer, as he enters the twilight years of his career.",
      "Given that he is understood to currently receive around £180,000-per-week in compensation, United could look to slim down his salary. The club could also be hesitant to offer Maguire a long-term deal considering his age.",
      "Whether the defender would accept said terms remains to be seen, especially considering he continues to be a key-player in Carrick's set-up at Old Trafford. Maguire has played a part in each of the interim head coach's matches in charge of United since his arrival last month, starting alongside Lisandro Martinez in victories over Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham.",
      "Should Maguire secure a new contract with his club of seven years, it would mark an incredible turnaround from the scenario he faced just a number of years ago - stripped of his captaincy by Erik ten Hag before floating in and out of Ruben Amorim's starting XI.",
      "It comes as Maguire's circumstances differ vastly from those of team-mate, Casemiro, who has announced that he will part ways with Manchester United when his own contract expires this summer. The Brazilian defensive midfielder has thrived at the Theatre of Dreams since his arrival from Real Madrid in 2022, racking up 149 appearances in the engine room.",
      "However, the 33-year-old announced earlier this year that he will part ways with the Reds this summer, taking to Instagram to share the saddening news. He wrote: \"Knowing when stages come to an end.",
      "\"Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever. Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",
      "The decision came despite the fact that Casemiro holds a contract extension clause in his current deal, should he start 35 matches or more this season.",
      "Both Casemiro and Maguire will be looking to make it five wins in five matches under Carrick on Tuesday evening, when the Reds travel to the London Stadium to take on a resurgent West Ham United.",
      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United this summer(Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "At the time of writing, the Reds sit fourth in the Premier League standings with 12 wins, eight draws and just five losses this season. A win will see the club leapfrog Aston Villa into third on goal-difference, although the Villans could reclaim their position on Wednesday when they take on Brighton and Hove Albion on home turf.",

      "United have won all four matches since Carrick went into the dugout, with victories over Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "“There’s an element of risk, but every one of the names that get thrown into the hat, there’s an element of risk with all of them.",
      "“I don’t know in any walk of life where someone comes in, given the opportunity to do well and put their first foot forward for a job opportunity, they smash it.",
      "“And hopefully he carries on, at the moment he’s smashing it - four wins out of four - and people are going, ‘No, he shouldn’t get it, though’. I don’t understand it.”",

      "Michael Carrick talks and carries himself like a Manchester United manager. He has overseen wins against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham since his interim appointment. Carrick has outfoxed Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta during that run, while getting the better of Marco Silva and Thomas Frank, two managers who United considered hiring in 2024.",

      "The 45-year-old has earned a reputation as one of the most articulate pundits in the business, and believes it would be a no-brainer for United to give Carrick the job if he steers the club into the Champions League.",
      "\"I don’t see how you couldn’t give it to him,\" said Hargreaves. \"What would have been the point of working that hard? You can get elite managers in, but that doesn't guarantee success.",
      "\"What Michael’s doing is very impressive. The fans are happy, which is important. The players are happy and that’s important, but the most important thing is that the team wins.",
      "\"United have had big-name managers on the bench. They had two of the greatest in the last 10 years, up there with Pep and Ancelotti: Van Gaal and Mourinho. A huge name comes with more expectation.\"",
      "Carrick received support from matchgoers even before his appointment was formalised. His name was sung at Turf Moor when Darren Fletcher was caretaker, and \"it's Carrick, you know, hard to believe it's not Scholes\" was aired by fans after the victory over Tottenham last weekend.",
      "United sources have insisted that nobody is getting carried away. Carrick has played down questions about his future, but Hargreaves believes he would be worthy of landing the job permanently.",
      "He said: \"I’ve known Michael for 24 years. I played with him for 21. He’s not a 'me' guy. He’ll ask, 'What’s the solution? How can I make him play better?' He’s good with people. He’ll put players in positions to succeed. He’s got Bruno, the best creator in the division. Kobbie is back in the team.",
      "\"Casemiro playing as the six. Everybody’s in a good spot. The back four is super good. Every player is playing different roles compared to before. Wing-backs are full-backs. Centre-backs went from a three to a two. Midfield two is now a three. Tens playing wide or as strikers.",
      "\"Even Bryan Mbeumo has played on the right or as a 10. To change that many players with no pre-season and still make the team function — I don’t see how you couldn’t give him the job.",
      "\"You know what it’s like when it’s not good and when everyone’s happy, and you’re winning. Why stop that just to bring in a name? If you could get Luis Enrique, obviously. But the only thing going against Carrick is experience. The most important thing is the team functions, and it is functioning well.",
      "\"Pep got an opportunity as a young coach and took it. Zidane got an opportunity and did remarkable things with Madrid. Everyone said 'young coach', but he needed an opportunity. He ran with it. If Carrick finishes third or fourth, I don’t see how you don’t follow it through.\"",
      "\"He’s been faultless. Even his subs have been great. The starting XI looks good, everyone looks settled,\" added Hargreaves. \"Michael has done a good job of finding solutions and not being rigid. I don’t understand when we got into this position where every manager says, 'This is how I play and I’m not going to change it.' Why? I never played in a game of football that looked the same. I never played in two games that looked the same.",
      "\"So why would I always have the same plan or formation? Against Tottenham, there was so much rotation. Players popped up in different positions. Bruno was rotating all over the place. Shaw was pushing high. Casemiro was dropping between the centre-backs. Players found solutions out there and weren’t wedded to one style.\"",
      "Carrick has given fans something to smile about.(Image: MI News/NurPhoto)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been at the centre of Carrick's success since his appointment. The youngster was left in the cold during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but Carrick has made Mainoo integral to his plans. He has rewarded Carrick's faith in him by delivering four excellent performances.",
      "\"I’ve never seen him have a bad game. That’s mad for a young kid,\" said Hargreaves. \"He didn’t play for a year and walked into the two hardest games in the league. Kobbie’s a ball player. He’s not going to win loads of tackles but can do enough, especially with who he plays with.",
      "\"If I were a coach, I’d think: 'I’ve got this kid and a guy who’s won so many Champions Leagues. He probably needs another hand.' Imagine Kobbie in between that. Kobbie is elite in terms of being able to pass anywhere.",
      "\"I mentioned at the weekend - not comparing George Best to Kobbie - but talking about the Munich Air Disaster and the Busby Babes, and George Best coming through shortly after and winning a European trophy. This club is built on promoting academy players. Look at The Class of 92', then Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Scott McTominay, and now Kobbie.",
      "\"After not playing for a year, to play as he has - I don’t know many players in the world who could do that. He’s not doing loads of interviews, not too up or down. Just a great player. I’m so happy for him because he deserves it.\"",
      "Mainoo has not played for England since starting in the Euro 2024 final against Spain, but he could force himself back into the squad for the World Cup if he maintains his current form.",
      "Mainoo is back to his best.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Harry Maguire is another United player with hope of representing the Three Lions this summer. The defender has been excellent alongside Lisandro Martinez, however, Maguire will not be a United player by the World Cup if an agreement is not reached over a new contract with his current deal expiring in the summer.",
      "\"From a leadership standpoint, if you want to defend your box as they did in the first two games, which you have to because teams have gone more old school, then Harry’s one of the best at that,\" said Hargreaves.",
      "\"He’s got a partner in Martinez who can play. All the great Premier League teams started with a centre-back partnership: United with Bruce and Pallister, Vidic and Ferdinand; Chelsea with Terry and Carvalho; Arsenal with Adams, and Liverpool too. Look at Arsenal now with Gabriel and Saliba.",
      "\"It’s all built on that. Since they’ve gone to a back four, that’s perfect. One of the biggest mistakes United made when things started to go wrong in the transfer market was losing leadership.",
      "\"They lost so many leaders within a few years: Van der Sar, Gary Neville, Rio, Vidic, Evra, Scholes, Giggs, Rooney, Ronaldo. You can sign players all you like, but they lost leadership.",
      "\"You only really know players when it’s difficult. Other than Bruno, they didn’t have enough leaders. With Harry’s leadership and everything he’s been through, he can mentor younger players. I hope he stays. Credit to him for how he’s come through and kept playing well.\"",

      "The Scot erupted on the sideline, and Carrick bore the brunt of a severe dressing down at the interval.

      "Marcus Rashford's Barcelona future could \"face a sudden collapse\" depending on the outcome of this year's presidential elections at the Nou Camp. The Manchester United loanee has shone in Catalonia this season for Hansi Flick's side.",
      "Rashford was loaned out to Barca for the season after being considered surplus to requirements by then Reds boss Ruben Amorim. The La Liga giants have the option to make the transfer permanent for £26million this summer, with reports from Catalonia indicating that Barcelona have been working to \"outline an agreement\" with United.",
      "The 28-year-old has made a strong impression in Spain - notching 10 goals and 13 assists across all competitions whilst wearing the Barcelona colours. But the Times report that Rashford's future in the Catalan capital could now depend on whether current president Joan Laporta is re-elected.",
      "It is said that a deal for Rashford is at the centre of Laporta's manifesto to seek re-election. And in a boost to Rashford's chances of staying in Catalonia - Laporta is the favourite to extend a mandate that began in 2021.",

      "\"It's still early. What we're saying today won't apply tomorrow. Newcastle couldn't let him go now, and there's no point in moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.\"",
      "\"I don't think so, but lots of things happen without my knowledge,\" Howe said when asked if the speculation around Tonali's future would unsettle the midfielder. \"As far as I'm aware, we've got player who is an outstanding footballer, an outstanding person.",

There was certainly no intention from our side to lose Sandro at all. He's such an integral player to what we're doing. He's very happy here.",

Bryan Mbeumo then gave Tottenham a mountain to climb when he opened the scoring at the end of the first half.

      "Anyone who has kept a close eye on Carrick during matches will have noticed his calm demeanour. He rarely shows emotion and stays remarkably composed, but there is a release when United score.",
      "Carrick passionately fist-pumped when Mbeumo fired United into the lead at the end of the first half, and he turned around on the touchline to look at his family celebrating in the directors' box.",
      "The 44-year-old has season tickets at Old Trafford with his family, meaning he attended a few games before his appointment, but his wife and children now have a better view in the directors' box.",
      "Carrick's son Jacey was spotted in the away end at Arsenal last month. Carrick has spoken about how much United means to him. He was raised in Newcastle and spent time in London with West Ham and Tottenham, but he has spent his most cherished years in Manchester.",
      "There may be more special years to come at Old Trafford for Carrick. It's still too early to say whether he should be given the job on a permanent basis, but he couldn't have made a better start.",
      "Casemiro enjoyed the goal",
      "Casemiro was so chuffed with Fernandes' late goal to wrap up the victory that he attempted to persuade Senne Lammens to celebrate with the team in the corner by the Stretford End.",
      "Casemiro shared a warm embrace with Lisandro Martinez before waving his hands to gesture to Lammens to join in with his teammates. The goalkeeper briefly thought about it, jogging to the halfway line, but decided to resist the temptation.",
      "Lammens is sensible and level-headed. He knew the job wasn't done yet and didn't want to get ahead of himself by joining in with the celebrations. Andre Onana, his predecessor, did not have that perspective.",
      "The unsung analyst",
      "United are the strongest team from set-pieces this season, having recorded the highest number of goals scored per 100 set-plays. Arsenal have earned a reputation as being prolific from set-pieces, but United have a better record from fewer of them, and they scored from a beautiful routine against Spurs.",
      "Fernandes played the corner short to Mainoo, who found Mbeumo in the box. There was still plenty for the Cameroon international to do - and his finish into the bottom right corner was sublime.",
      "Carlos Fernandes looked after set-pieces when Ruben Amorim was in charge. Fernandes came onto the touchline every time United won a set-piece, but Carrick's backroom staff remained seated.",
      "It's understood set-pieces are a collective responsibility among the current coaching staff, however, perhaps Kaita Hasgawa deserves another mention for doing important work behind the scenes.",
      "Amorim namedropped Hasgawa as someone who deserved praise for improving set-pieces and helping to tactically prepare for the opponent. Hasegawa's position has not been described as senior, but he was recruited from Everton after seven years in Merseyside, and is thought to play an important role.",
      "Hasgawa sat with the analyst team beside the press box against Tottenham. The analysts would have taken great satisfaction from another set-piece goal, especially after a corner routine that was so well-worked.",
      "Stretford End jeers",
      "The Romero red card changed the complexion of the game. The contest had flowed well and Tottenham looked dangerous, but Romero could have no complaints when Michael Oliver showed him a straight red.",
      "The challenge on Casemiro was reckless and the Brazilian looked in a world of pain when he slumped to the turf. Thomas Frank tried to reason with the fourth official, but had no serious case to overturn it.",
      "The Stretford End chanted Casemiro's name while he received treatment, but their attention turned to Romero as he returned to the dressing room. \"Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio,\" fans taunted as Romero walked off.",
      "Romero slammed Tottenham's board for their lack of investment when the January transfer window closed, but the Spurs captain only had himself to blame for his side's defeat.",
      "The classy Munich tributes",
      "It was the 68th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster on Friday. United held a memorial service at Old Trafford, and there were further tributes from fans in the Stretford End before the Totttenham game.",
      "United fans unfurled a \"Busby Babes\" banner in the upper tier of the stand, which was followed by a \"we'll never die\" banner being unfurled in the lower tier. Carrick laid a wreath on the pitch alongside Frank.",
      "The players wore black armbands, and Fernandes wore a special captain's armband to pay tribute to the tragedy. Most wouldn't have seen the Munich clock attached to Fernandes' arm. \"Stand up for the Busby Babes,\" was aired in the first half, and thousands of supporters rose to their feet.",
      "United show their class with their tributes each year to the Munich Air Disaster. Fernandes attended the memorial service on the day before the game, and the armband he wore was a nice touch.",

Fletcher, who is the son of Darren and the twin brother of Jack, has been in and around the first team this season.",
      "While his brother has made three appearances for the Reds this season, Fletcher has had to remain patient to get his own chance in the Premier League. With the game entering its final moments on Saturday, interim head coach Michael Carrick gave the youngster the opportunity for his first senior minutes as he replaced Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Reflecting on the experience at full time, Fletcher told MUTV: \"It's a mad day. I'm absolutely buzzing. The best day of my life, it's a dream come true. I've just got to thank everyone for supporting me, throughout the way.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "We’re starting to think that banishing Kobbie Mainoo from the Man Utd starting XI might not have been the smartest move the very stubborn Ruben Amorim made during his ill-starred reign at Old Trafford.",
      "But it’s not the only pig-headed foolishness to engulf the Premier League this season. It’s one of precisely five pig-headed foolishnesses to engulf the Premier League this season.",
      "And these are they.",
      "",
      "The numbers are hilariously stark.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo started none of Manchester United’s first 21 Premier League games this season, of which they won only eight.",
      "He has started all four of Manchester United’s last four Premier League games, of which they have won all four.",
      "Mainoo has already played more Premier League minutes this season for Michael Carrick than he did for Ruben Amorim. The longest appearance with which he was trusted by the former boss was a whole second half against Burnley in August when he replaced the injured Mason Mount at the break.",
      "Other than that, he subsisted on cameos. Thirteen minutes here. Seven minutes there. Twenty-four minutes against Brentford if he was lucky.",
      "It never really made a lot of sense, especially as a) United’s results were frequently cack and b) their midfield was a notable point of weakness with Manuel Ugarte struggling and Casemiro still often playing from (an admittedly impressive) memory.",
      "Had Amorim not gone up in flames and torched himself out of the Man United job, it’s likely Mainoo wouldn’t even be at United right now. He’d be off on loan somewhere in Serie A or Ligue 1 or some other such indignity.",
      "Instead, he’s been perhaps the key ingredient in Michael Carrick’s astonishing straightforward United revolution in which his masterplan has, distilled to its essence, involved picking his best available players in their best positions.",
      "It always sounds like a back-handed compliment when put like that, but it really isn’t. The fact what Carrick has done looks simple and obvious isn’t his fault; he deserves credit for spotting that overcomplication was the problem here and seeking to remedy it.",
      "But watching Mainoo get better with every passing post-Amorim game, to the point on Saturday lunchtime when he was effortlessly running the game against an admittedly awful and self-sabotaging Spurs, it was impossible not to feel that all of it just damns Amorim entirely.",
      "United fans should at least be grateful that Amorim huffed his way out of the job before it was all too late. Thomas Tuchel probably feels similarly.",
      "",
      "In a rare moment of foresight, we saw this one coming. The way Forest ended last season. The way Mr Marinakis spent the summer bristling with main character energy over the European competition saga and the Morgan Gibbs-White saga and winning out in both those sagas always spelled trouble for Nuno.",
      "Anything other than a fast start to the season was going to see Mr Marinakis search once again for that unmatchable high of being front and centre in everything.",
      "An opening-day win over Brentford sent entirely misleading signals about both teams’ trajectories, but it mattered not. The die had been cast over the closing months of 24/25 and the summer, despite Nuno signing a new contract in June.",
      "Two winless games and further disgruntlement and disagreement over transfer dealings and more was all it took. Nuno didn’t survive the first interlull of the season, and was replaced by Ange Postecoglou in Mr Marinakis’ second refusal to accept the objective reality of the world around him.",
      "He does score some points for at least wising up to that one pretty quick-smart and taking his Dycheball medicine.",
      "But it could all still end in relegation and has already led to a needless squandering of so much progress, momentum and goodwill built up last season.",
      "",
      "We’re tempted to include Frank himself and the media here, because while Spurs fans have been noisily sh*tting themselves for several weeks now it really does only now seem to have hit home with some that this is a club on its arse and facing a very real relegation battle for which it seems ill-suited and entirely unprepared.",
      "Matt Law in today’s Telegraph has breathlessly declared that if Spurs don’t beat Newcastle tonight they might ‘soon’ have to accept relegation is a realistic prospect. If by ‘soon’ he in fact means several weeks ago, perhaps during a window in which it is possible to procure more players for a squad ravaged by injuries and its own stupidity, then he’s absolutely bang on.",
      "Spurs have won two Premier League games since October. We really aren’t at all sure how the reality that has been clear for so long is only now sneaking up on Frank’s adoring media fanboys.",
      "He’s also spent at least the last two months talking complete and utter bollocks about windmills and encouraging performances and saying things like “if you keep the ball out of the net then you have a better chance of winning” to nods of appreciation from the waiting press pack.",
      "We don’t know how he’s fooled them, but we have a better idea about how he’s fooled the new broom at Spurs. Because the people now in day-to-day charge of a post-Levy Spurs appear to be – and we don’t wish to be unkind here – idiots, nepo-babies and fools.",
      "They had their wallets thoroughly inspected by Fabio Paratici, who was supposed to be staying on at Spurs for the rest of the January transfer window (no further signings) before starting his new job at Fiorentina (five further signings).",
      "We’ve already seen this season that on-field results can be truly catastrophic without bothering big-club suits, as long as you’re willing to accept your place and not speak out. Neither Ruben Amorim nor Enzo Maresca can have too many complaints about being cast out by United and Chelsea, but the offences that ultimately did for them were incredibly small and twatty.",
      "Frank has cast an increasingly foolish figure this season, frequently not on top of his brief in press conferences at all, failing to spot he was using an Arsenal-branded coffee cup at Bournemouth and, yes, just saying increasingly stupid things.",
      "But he’s smart enough never to criticise the fragile egos of the clown-car operation now in charge of this football club.",
      "The extraordinary thing isn’t that Spurs could very possibly get relegated; the extraordinary thing is that they’ve done absolutely nothing to address a prospect that has grown alarmingly more real with every passing game.",
      "We’ve stopped even calling Spurs games El Sackicos now. We don’t even think defeat to Newcastle tonight would be enough. Nor would defeat to Arsenal in their next league game.",
      "We’re not even certain that dropping into the bottom three itself – a prospect that is now just three games away – would do it.",
      "We feel like we’re taking crazy pills.",
      "",
      "Can Dominik Szoboszlai play right-back? Yes. Should Dominik Szoboszlai play right-back? Ideally no.",
      "He’s an excellent footballer and, like many excellent footballers, he is capable of doing a serviceable job in an unfamiliar position.",
      "But it’s become far too much of a go-to option for an increasingly unmoored Arne Slot in an increasingly strife-addled Liverpool season.",
      "There’s a real sense here of Slot trying to bottle lightning, trying to recapture something that has been lost.",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold was brilliant at being a right-back-cum-playmaker so it’s understandable for Slot to try and recreate that magic by putting another supremely talented playmaker there.",
      "But it really isn’t that simple. If it was, then everyone would do it.",
      "The situation came to a head, of course, on Sunday. But this has all been brewing up for some time now.",
      "Slot’s hand has been forced slightly by a shortage of available options, but crowbarring a very capable attacking midfielder into the right-back role has been a double victory for silliness, lessening Liverpool’s attacking capabilities while increasing defensive vulnerability.",
      "Sure, being right-back doesn’t stop him treating 30-yard free-kicks as penalties and that’s all well and good until he’s caught out of position to play everyone onside for an equaliser before brainlessly getting himself suspended to prevent a goal that was never going to matter.",
      "He has at least turned a few more people against VAR, so it wasn’t a complete waste. But playing him at right-back absolutely is.",
      "",
      "Palace were right to put their foot down at the end of the summer transfer window and tell Liverpool ‘Sorry, time’s up’ when they came knocking late for Guehi having been distracted for far too long by the shinier if far less necessary Alexander Isak.",
      "Palace’s mistake was in then burying their heads in the sane for the next four months and acting surprised when Glasner was pissed off at the lack of support he and his team were receiving from above.",
      "There are limits to what Palace can do. They were never going to keep Glasner forever any more than they were going to be able to keep Guehi. But for reasons inside and outside their control they have let a once-in-a-lifetime breakthrough season shatter into nothingness, and that all feels a bit unnecessary and careless.",
      "Maybe signing Brennan Johnson and Jorgen Strand Larsen with their three Premier League goals for fellow relegation battlers will solve everything in the end. But we have some doubts.",
      "Eddie Howe’s future at Newcastle looks more doubtful than ever before but when would the club actually decide to sack him?",
      "It’s been the greatest grift in football content history but it has to end now. It’s bigger than the World Cup, apparently.",
      "Arne Slot no longer has any defenders…at Liverpool or otherwise. It’s now just a matter of time before he is sacked.",
      "Some are excelling in jobs they were lucky to get, others stinking the place out in jobs they are lucky to retain, and they amount to half the current Premier ...",
      "Arbeloa isn’t long for Real Madrid. Here are 12 players, managers, ex-players and ‘spies’ pushing for him to be sacked.",
      "It’s Eddie Howe vs Thomas Frank in El Sackico and Sean Dyche is also on the brink, and will Kobbie Mainoo’s first ‘bad game’ come for Man Utd vs West ..."

      "It has been almost exactly three years since Manchester United wanted it known that they were adopting a ‘no dickheads policy’ as a consequence, we can only assume, of something Richard Arnold saw on LinkedIn.",
      "Generally, if you have to spell out such a mandate, you’ve already got a problem. And United certainly did. On the basis of it taking one to know one, the Red Devils should have seen them coming a mile off and, this far down the road, there ought not to be a dickhead in sight.",
      "For the most part, United have weeded them out. The tricky part was not swerving the temptation to recruit more dickheads, but dealing with the dickheads already in their midst.",
      "Defining a dickhead is tricky indeed. Many of those who bang on about dickheads in a professional sport or corporate environment tend to be, well, dickheads.",
      "What Arnold probably encountered during his doomscroll was something inspired by ex-All Blacks mental skills coach Gilbert Enoka, who more than a decade ago characterised dickheads as “people who out themselves ahead of the team, people who think they’re entitled to things or expect the rules to be different for them, people operating deceitfully in the dark, or being unnecessarily loud about their work”.",
      "Enoka, by the way, was last seen working with England’s Ashes squad in Australia, seemingly proving you can’t help them all.",
      "Give Ruben Amorim his dues, though; the ex-United manager might struggle to recognise a functioning game plan but he could pin a dickhead and, if he achieved nothing else – he didn’t – at least last summer he made four of them another club’s problem, if only for a season.",
      "That isn’t to say that the United dressing room is a dickhead-free zone. And nor should it be. All of United’s greatest teams and many of their best-ever players had a bit of the dick about them. But these were dickheads who delivered. It is the dickheads that don’t deliver who must be dodged.",
      "Which brings us to Cristian Romero.",
      "Paul Scholes, like many whose dickhead era really began when he became a podcaster, would ‘love’ United to sign the Tottenham Hotspur captain, fresh off his red card at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "“Do you know what? I love him. I love watching him play football.",
      "“He’s pissed off at Spurs, isn’t he? He doesn’t want to be there. He’s having a go at the crowd, he’s having a go at the board, I think his head has checked out a little bit. But I would love him at Manchester United. I just love his character.”",
      "We love Romero too. He’s great, isn’t he? And what’s most great about him is that he’s Tottenham’s problem when – pardon us for mixing our performance cliches – he just can’t control his dickhead chimp.",
      "The door to that cage was ripped off its hinges on Saturday, when Romero was sent off less than half an hour into Spurs’ defeat to United. His timing, of the tackle and the act itself, was just awful for all involved.",
      "Romero, as Scholes alluded, spent much of the build-up to a big game for Spurs having a pop at his paymasters. You can question his channel of choice, but he made some very fair points. Indeed, in the 29 minutes the captain spent before them, the Spurs fans sang ‘Romero’s right, the board are sh*te’ to endorse his message.",
      "Then Romero completely undermined his own authority by acting the dickhead, putting his studs through Casemiro’s ankle to leave his manager even deeper in the sh*t. And Thomas Frank was already drowning in it.",
      "Frank went out to bat for his captain in the aftermath of a defeat that leaves Tottenham on the same points as relegation battlers. Maybe it’s only a battle if you acknowledge it. Spurs, last year, just chucked in the league season, correctly assuming everyone else was terrible enough that they need not bother. Alarmingly, this season they are actually trying, but so is everyone else.",
      "That doesn’t appear to be of great concern to Romero because, as Scholes points out, the captain has already checked out. Which is sure to have ramifications for Spurs and Frank. And it should when it comes to Romero’s options this summer.",
      "For the sake of whoever is their manager next season, United cannot be among those suitors, in part because of the reasons Scholes himself listed.",
      "The temptation is understandable. Romero is a very, very good central defender with a handy knack in both boxes. And, despite all the evidence to the contrary, Frank says his captain is a ‘young leader’ who will learn.",
      "He’s not catching on quick, though, is he? Romero will be 28 by the start of next season having been a senior pro for a decade, half of which has been spent at Spurs, with 250-plus appearances across Serie A and the Premier League. He has been a World Cup winner for four years and will go to the United States in June with a half-century of Argentina caps.",
      "The penny really ought to have dropped by now.",
      "United, often for the wrong reasons, by now have too much previous when it comes to waiting for expensive dickheads to reform, so they should recognise trouble when they see it in Romero.",
      "He is not a gamble United need to take. They already have one hot-headed Argentina centre-back and partners for Lisandro Martinez are not currently in short supply.",
      "From Romero’s perspective too, it is not a move that makes sense. If the scrutiny at Spurs is a driver in his dickishness, where might the spotlight at United lead him?",
      "Romero is also being linked with Atletico Madrid and, oh yes, that’s the stuff. Diego Simone and Atletico could be perfect for Romero. And if not, it will be even more spectacular still. We will find out what happens when an unstoppable dickhead meets an immovable dickhead.",
      "Former Man Utd midfielder Nicky Butt insists that the Red Devils can win the Premier League next season amid their brilliant form under Michael Carrick.",
      "Scholes says he would ‘love’ Manchester United to sign a ‘p*ssed off’ Tottenham star who has ‘checked out’.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero is ‘hot-headed and impulsive’ – so who should Thomas Frank pass the armband on to? Richarlison…obviously.",
      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero will be banned for four matches after being sent off during his side’s 2-0 loss against Manchester United.",
      "Spurs defender Cristian Romero has been urged to “shut up and play football,” with one pundit claiming Thomas Frank should strip him of the captaincy."

      "In one of our increasingly frequent laments at the state of Premier League management, it occurred to us that half the current Premier League managers are lucky to have the jobs they have.",
      "There are all manner of different categories here. Some of these managers are sh*t, some are over-promoted, some are clearly still in what is for now nominally a Premier League job in the hope they’ll do a good job in the Championship next season, some just happened to be in the right place at the right time when the job was being dished out.",
      "And some of them are Thomas Frank, who is almost all of the above but don’t tell the UK press boys that because he is like Bambi to those lads for some reason.",
      "To be entirely clear from the outset: while some of these managers are absolutely here for being sh*t, many of these managers are very good managers doing very good jobs. They just find themselves in positions their CVs from a year ago couldn’t possibly justify.",
      "",
      "He’s had quite the managerial career already at 43. Took Luton into the Premier League, which was crazy, then took them back out of it, which was fair enough, then had them well on their way to League One (crazy again) before being removed.",
      "You kind of felt he was always coming back to the Premier League one way or another, but it did probably need more than being quite good for a few months with Middlesbrough.",
      "He got himself the cushiest Premier League gig imaginable; taking over a team already doomed to relegation that won’t get pinned on you, and a situation where you are almost guaranteed to improve things.",
      "This he has duly done by collecting six points in 14 games. Obviously appointed with next season in mind, which is fair enough but history does suggest that while it’s fair to assume he will get Wolves out of the Championship, which direction is a 50-50 chance.",
      "",
      "A slightly harsher version of the ‘only here for next season’ trope, because Parker did at least earn his way into the Premier League with Burnley. And he has a proven Championship track record now.",
      "But does appear to have spent this season focusing on doing just enough to keep himself in position for another crack at his specialist subject rather than bypassing the need for another promotion attempt altogether.",
      "We all know that players exist who are too good for the Championship but nowhere near it in the Premier League, so it stands to reason it should apply to managers as well. Which could make for an interesting career, permanently either becoming a victim of your own success or rewarded for your own failure.",
      "",
      "It’s probably fair enough that consistent punching above weight at a smaller club should eventually earn a manager a crack at a big job.",
      "But it’s also fair enough that when, after just a few months, it’s clear that a) the job has overwhelmed you and you are drowning in your own nonsense and that b) the smaller club have carried on punching quite merrily without you, it’s time to agree that, sure, it was worth finding out, but find out we have and let’s bring an end to the whole thing.",
      "When it’s been eight months and that manager is actively propelling the big club towards relegation, then it is definitely time.",
      "Look we all know Daniel Levy had his faults, but he wouldn’t have stood for this nonsense like the bumbling suits who have replaced him. He wouldn’t have learned any lessons from it either, sure, but he would have P45ed this small-timing, out-of-his-depth, anti-football-enjoying fraud into the shadow realm months ago and Spurs would now be becalmed and miserable but safe in 11th under the club-understanding interim eye of Ryan Mason.",

Even without pesky rules also thwarting plans for world domination, it would still be a struggle. So it’s desperately hard for him to achieve what Newcastle want to achieve.",
      "Howe’s bigger problem is that if all those other things just disappeared and it was possible to achieve world domination, he would no longer be the manager anyway.",

      "You can’t go around winning the league and having an entire fanbase and punditocracy declaring the dawn of a glorious new era of Liverpool dominance, drop half a billion quid on transfers only some of which you needed, and then spend the next season looking like you might not even qualify for the Champions League while pretending not being as cartoonishly dreadful as Spurs is enough.",
      "Slot’s tactics have been questionable, and he’s found it far harder to incorporate his own signings into the squad than he did simply working with what he was left by Jurgen Klopp.",
      "It was always the key question after last season. Was it, as Liverpool and their media supporters hoped and believed, the start of something new or merely the last hurrah of the Klopp era but just with a baldman at the helm.",
      "And now we know.",
      "",
      "As Thomas Frank has discovered, the big difference between big-club and small-club management is not the expectation or the pressure or the standards. It’s the attention. There is no escape and no hiding place.",

But it is nevertheless mad that another club managed to get itself in a sufficient pickle in the year of someone’s lord 2025 to hand the great man another chance at tweaking some Barclays noses and issuing gravel-throated proclamations about utter woke nonsense.",
      "",
      "Doing brilliant work once you’re in the job doesn’t mean you weren’t still lucky to get it. Carrick is the ultimate DNA appointment, whose undoubted effectiveness comes in large part due to his predecessor having whatever the opposite of club DNA is.",
      "Much of Carrick’s success has been built on righting the obvious wrongs Ruben Amorim was too stubborn to notice or correct. That’s not to knock the (for now) interim manager, but it’s increasingly clear with every passing moment that refusing to pick Kobbie Mainoo for reasons that were small and twatty should have been enough alone to have Amorim sacked and probably deemed in breach of contract for gross negligence.",
      "Carrick has done brilliantly, even if the real quiz comes if/when he’s handed the permanent job, but none of that alters the fact that United would not have looked at the former Middlesbrough manager twice were it not for his storied Old Trafford playing career.",

      "Andrews, clearly, has the right stuff and is doing a wonderful job. But the credentials with which he got that job remain staggeringly slight. Brentford deserve huge credit for the lemonade they have made from life’s lemons, but it really was a monumental gamble to entrust their Premier League survival to a man who had never managed a single game of senior football and had only even been a Premier League coach for a single season, working as Thomas Frank’s set-piece coach.",
      "Watching Tottenham play what is still we suppose technically association football this season, it occurs to us that set-piece coach might actually be Frank’s true calling. Maybe Andrews can give him a gig next year.",

      "Especially when, in the most modern football way imaginable, the right place to be to get fast-tracked into an elite Premier League job is in fact on the banks of the Rhine on the France-Germany border.",
      "We have reached a tipping point here, haven’t we? Club DNA was one thing. Knowing The Club was one thing. We’re now firmly in the territory of Multi-Club Football Group DNA, of nodding and going, ‘See, this guy just gets this Multi-Club Football Group’ despite your only permanent managerial gig before joining that shadowy organisation being the six months you spent not quite getting Hull City into the play-offs.",

      "Aston Villa and Liverpool are acceptable defeats, Brentford at St James’ Park less so; add that run of three losses to another one against Thomas Frank’s Tottenham and most of the remaining #HoweIn Toon fans would surely turn against a manager who undoubtedly has a difficult job in manoeuvring a shallow squad to compete on what was four fronts until last week, but is also definitely now failing to get anything close to the best out of the vast majority of his players.",
      "The tide Howe is fighting against has already swept Frank out to sea. Are there any Tottenham fans who still want him to manage their team? At some point soon they will stop feeling angry and start feeling sympathy for a man arguably the worst football club to be told ‘you’re out of your depth’ at: one that purports to be Big with neither the back catalogue of successes nor the player quality to make it so.",

      "Newcastle United are said to be ‘well-placed’ to re-sign Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest in the summer, but the reality is very different…",
      "Newcastle‘s recent transfer activity is proof that money can’t buy you happiness, with Eddie Howe’s side derailed by Profit & Sustainability rules and their superior Premier League rivals in recent months.",
      "Their 2025 summer transfer window was shambolic from start to finish, with the prolonged Alexander Isak setting the tone for an incredibly frustrating few months.",
      "Wantaway Isak lingered around like a bad smell until deadline day, with the Magpies risking missing out on a remarkable full XI of potential signings before overpaying to sign Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa.",
      "And the 2026 summer transfer window risks being equally traumatic for Newcastle, who could be left searching for a new manager and replacements for several key players.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: ‘Angry’ Howe in busy sack race while Arsenal force more rule changes",
      "Howe has commented on potentially “stepping down” as Newcastle have only won one of their last nine games, while it is looking increasingly likely that Sandro Tonali is going to leave after his agent clearly tried to get him a move in January.",
      "But former Premier League chief executive Keith Wyness foolishly thinks Newcastle are ‘well-placed to agree a deal’ to re-sign Anderson to replace Tonali in a ‘sensational twist’.",
      "“Well that’s exactly it, it’s having that succession plan ready now in terms of midfield, but you know I think that they’re actually pretty well-placed [to sign Anderson],” Wyness told Football Insider.",
      "“It’d be surprising what they might have to pay to bring Elliot Anderson back having filled that gap. But again, they’re stuck in this whole vice we talked about last week of the SCR formulas and the ability to spend, despite having the richest owners in the world. It’s all been rehearsed and talked about so much, and it seems so unfair.",
      "“But yes, they’ve got to find that midfield solution now. This is why clubs don’t like players moving in January. It does give them this period now to do the research and to get some time in.",
      "“But, I think that certainly if he was to go, at the right price, I think Newcastle and Eddie Howe wouldn’t mind actually refreshing the squad and the ages in that midfield and get things moving again.",
      "“They’ve still got some work to do in that squad in Newcastle, certainly I think at both ends of the pitch and in the midfield. So I think that that would be something they need to address. But I think they’ve got to start thinking about life without Tonali for sure.”",
      "Anderson’s affiliation with Newcastle as a former academy product gives them a helping hand for a potential return, but they still have very little chance of beating Man Utd or Man City to the £100m-rated ‘Manchester-bound’ star.",
      "Last summer made it clear where the Magpies, despite their vast wealth, stand in the pecking order, as they were beaten to priority signings by Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, Man City, and Tottenham, and the events of this season mean they are no more likely to pull off coups this summer.",
      "They simply do not have the same pull as the traditional Big Six, especially without Champions League football, so Anderson will ultimately end up at Man Utd or City, while fellow £100m-rated midfielder Tonali will inevitably be lured elsewhere too after the seeds of his exit were planted in January.",
      "READ NEXT: Premier League sack race: Thomas Frank favourite but Howe, Slot, Hurzeler all feel heat",

      "Elliot Anderson is undoubtedly one of the busiest central midfielders in the Premier League – but is that energy enough for Manchester United?",
      "Manchester United reportedly ‘want’ to sign two Nottingham Forest stars in a potential £147m double deal, with summer exits for these players inevitable…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have chosen their ‘first-choice’ summer signing between three potential replacements for Casemiro.",
      "Man Utd have decided on three players they want to sign in the summer transfer window as they look to ‘revamp’ their squad, according to reports.",

I’ve read conclusions, mailboxes, and Lewis Oldham’s recent piece – all rightly praising Carrick placing round pegs in round holes, but it’s much more impressive that just that. On top of deserved wins, they’ve been a quality watch too!",
      "The difference in on-the-ball style of play has been sensational. I was raised on early Wenger-era Arsenal, so I know well what entertaining football looks like, and this is it. I watch entire Utd matches a lot as most of my friends are fans. Recently I’ve enjoyed watching the calamity, but a strong and entertaining United is good for the league. Only crap part is now having to listen to your Nevilles and Ferdinands spout shite about it being Fergie’s blueprint (let the man go, lads).",
      "I mean, these fellas couldn’t knit three passes together under Amorim and were risk-averse and boring under Ten Hag. Even Ole’s counter-attacking group didn’t have the fluidity we’ve seen in the last three weeks, and relied heavily on a firing, motivated Rashford.",
      "The intensity and interchanging of Cunha, Mbeumo, Bruno and Amad has opened new doors and new ideas. The incisive passing from the spine of this Utd team is clearly an instruction that brings a welcome risk-taking element that is now almost entirely absent from the City/Liverpool/Arsenal contingent who only appear to encourage creativity in the last 20 yards of the pitch. Seeing Maguire, Dalot, Casemiro (!) and Martinez play 1-2s out of the back and flick touches into the path of penetrating teammates has been brilliant.",
      "There’s an unpredictability about this group when they have the ball. Look at some of the chances they’ve created and one-touch football that’s been on show in the entire opposition half (and even their own half at times!). It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s effective. It also gets the fans on your side. Best about it though is that the players who looked so shite under previous managers are now seemingly having more fun playing with less “structure”. If this continues, don’t be surprised if the players go to the top dogs and ask for him permanently. The thought of a Nagelsmann or otherwise being appointed to input their system on a group of players absolutely flying under a trusting manager might be met with a little derision.",

      "I’ve never written in before, but I keep reading that VAR got the correct decision in the Liverpool/City game. But two things baffle me here, and this is purely on a nerdy basis. Firstly, the order of events: Szoboszlai fouls Haaland, the ref plays advantage and then Haaland fouls Szoboslai, so the goal is disallowed. Why did City then get the resulting free kick? Surely you don’t get a free hit on an opponent just because the ref has given you advantage? The second foul must be penalised, the game has continued.",
      "Also, it seems nuts, but don’t the laws of the game say Szoboszlai should have been cautioned, not sent off, because of the advantage:",
      "If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.",
      "Purely on a technical basis, it looks like the ref was wrong to allow the goal initially, VAR could only disallow the goal, and should have reviewed and prevented Szobo’s sending off, too. Then Liverpool should have had a free in the last 15 seconds, where they could’ve lumped it up-field to 10 men in the box, and dramatically cocked up a final chance to draw level.\nDave (this is what football analysis should be), Wigan",

      "Make an exception for physical endangerment fouls (referee’s judgment) and I think we avoid yesterday’s situation while appeasing manager’s more – no more complaining about the referee not playing advantage.\nGirish, AFC (Ghana would still have gotten knocked out though – sorry), Chennai",

      "I’m never slow to criticise officials and in particular the clowns when on VAR duty, but yesterdays Liverpool/City game highlighted some of the difficulties the actual laws of the game can hamper them. This is not sour grapes (it is partially) but my god that was one of the worst officiated games I’ve ever seen.",
      "Firstly, Silva’s tug on Salah’s shoulder, when is a foul not a foul? Neville says that Silva is “clever” as he doesn’t pull Salah for “too long”, or put another way, he fouls him but grets away with it. Don’t get me wrong, Liverpool players are just as guilty as any other team when it comes to this type of offence, Konate on Marmoush is less obvious but is in the realm, so just give them!, It’s the only way to (try and) cut them out. Trippiers pull on Potter was worse and yet the VAR, despite the shirt clearly being pulled, deems it “insignificant contact”!!!! To repeat my comment from a couple of weeks ago, show me the rule where it says a shirt pull is allowed and I’ll shut up about it.",
      "Guehi’s foul on Salah, correctly given outside the box but will Dias stop Salah getting a shot off, i.e. a goal scoring opportunity, he won’t, last season’s Salah scores, this season’s hits it with the outside of his foot and it goes closer to the corner flag than the goal, but it is still an opportunity.",
      "The penalty, it’s a penalty, some are claiming “but the ball is out of play”, again show me a rule that says you can wipe a player out after the ball has gone and I’ll agree, don’t give “a coming together” either, Alisson is late.",
      "Bernardo Silva, a wonderful player but is is there a more odious little shit in the game? Clearly Rodri’s cloak of invisibility has been passed to him. I was convinced he’d already been booked so was amazed to see him not sent off. His challenge on Kerkez sums up another massive flaw in the application or context of “the laws”.",
      "It’s as cynical a challenge as you will ever see, it’s not “endangering an opponent”, it’s not “reckless”, as such, a red card cannot be issued, but what it actually does is give City more than one advantage. It has broke up an attack. it wastes valuable seconds as the time to take the free kick will not be added on and it allows City to organise and set themselves for the free kick. red cards for this would again go some way to stopping them.",
      "Finally we have the biggest clusterf**k, the Cherki “goal”, how on earth is denying a goal scoring opportunity relevant when the ball goes in the net anyway, unfortunately for everyone, the laws of the game are applied correctly, almost, but the referee gives the goal, what happened to sticking with the on field decision? I’m pretty sure, but not certain, that “goals” have bee overruled and a penalty awarded, allowing the defending team an opportunity to stop a goal being scored, madness.",
      "I say almost as there was one element which was totally ignored! Haaland’s rugby tackle is a yellow card every time, Alisson is yellow carded for his challenge for the penalty yet Haaland is not, he’s not even late, he jumps on Szboszlai with no attempt to get to the ball (well he might be, but still).",
      "One commentor (btl really is filled with numpties) said that adding “the best part of quarter of an hour on”, was to give Liverpool more time, as they have conceded more “added on time” goals than anyone else, it’s hard to see how this was to their advantage.",
      "On the game itself, a draw felt like a fairer result, other than Haaland’s chance early on, Liverpool missed the “easier” chances with Ekitike’s header and Wirtz’s weak effort. I remember Semenyo blasting one high and wide and a decent shot from outside the box, but can’t recall Alissons other “saves” whereas Donnarumma’s is recalled by everyone, I know, “it’s his job” and that’s what the best keepers pull out.",
      "All in all a game in which Liverpool once again shot themselves in the foot, but well done City, a vital win but I don’t see them catching Arsenal.\nHoward (Maguire should have had a penalty also) Jones",
      "",
      "Surprised to see nothing here or anywhere else in regarding the foul from Reinildo on Gyokeres as he scored his second goal. Flying challenge above the knee with absolutely no hope of getting the ball. These only seem to be punished with a red if there is a big injury (like Isak’s leg break). A truly awful decision.",
      "But for luck it could have been another Abou Diaby moment 20 years on; the needless tackle right at the end of the match, when a team is clearly beaten and also against Sunderland.",

It’s banter and brain farts and nonsense football club, and an air of Spurs shooting themselves in the foot at the 11th hour to the hilarity of everyone else. The reality isn’t as entertaining – it’s more slow and subtle…like the demise of Blockbuster and Nokia who didn’t see it coming.",
      "Whilst Spurs were never top of the tree in the same way those two were, they were doing ok. Go back 10 years, they’re toe to toe with Leicester in a crazy year. The year after they’re owning Liverpool, the year after that going unbeaten at The Lane. But this is where the lack of investment starts to creep in. The cloak of fiscal responsibility means they don’t sign a player in a calendar year. When they do take their hand off the cheque book, they absolutely soil themselves – they have no idea how to spend the money they’ve hoarded – Lo Celso and Ndombele were meant to be Mane and Firmino. The rot is setting in. The painful rebuild is never faced up too.",
      "Once Poch has gone, they get into a weird few years of never committing, fluctuating between big bastard names who demand money, and patsies. The ultimate of which is the current manager. At the time of writing Brentford are 500/1 to go down, Spurs are 11/1. They’re 45 times more likely than Frank’s old club to go down. Get your head round that for a second.",
      "Kane and Son have been swapped for Tel and Randall Muani. Who weren’t bought because they were the right signings. They were bought because they were cheaper and available. In the same way George Kevin Nkoudou was available. The club has been lowballing itself despite the opportunity being there for the taking, for the last 10 years. The rot is here. Not in a David Ridsdale all fur coat and no knickers way – in a horrible, slow way that’s disenfranchised everyone. From Romero through to all of us who sell their season ticket on 15 times.",

      "Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, Liverpool seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, they have won only six games of 20 as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become an 17-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have four other teams.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "We’re really starting to think that Ruben Amorim freezing out Kobbie Mainoo might not have been his smartest decision. But he’s far from alone.",
      "Eddie Howe’s future at Newcastle looks more doubtful than ever before but when would the club actually decide to sack him?",
      "It’s been the greatest grift in football content history but it has to end now. It’s bigger than the World Cup, apparently.",
      "Former Liverpool striker Emile Heskey believes the pressure mounting on Reds boss Arne Slot will only be alleviated if he guides the club to trophy success.",
      "Arne Slot no longer has any defenders…at Liverpool or otherwise. It’s now just a matter of time before he is sacked.",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot has reportedly become ‘disillusioned’ at Anfield and is already planning his next move ahead of his imminent summer exit."

      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 07:44, UK",
      "One of my favourite betting angles this season is centre-forwards committing fouls on centre-backs.",
      "This season's Premier League is a bruising product to watch. The data and the eye test are telling the same story in that the league has tilted back towards directness with far more emphasis on winning first contact. And when that happens, centre-forwards don't just score goals, they start giving away fouls.",
      "The result? Centre-backs are being fouled more often than the market expects.",
      "Joao Pedro has come to life under Liam Rosenior, putting in some electric performances as the central striker where he's also been making a healthy number of fouls. In six starts as the centre-forward under the new boss. he's made eight fouls. Joe Rodon is in the firing line then when it comes to fouls drawn where he is a bulky 4/1 with Sky Bet to be fouled +2 times.",
      "Everton midfielder James Garner looks a strong play to hit +2 fouls in this one at 11/4 with Sky Bet. Garner has hit this mark in 10 of his 20 starts in central midfield this season, showing he's no stranger to getting his foot in at key moments.",
      "Bournemouth's Alex Scott, meanwhile, has been a magnet for fouls, drawing 14 in his last eight appearances. The battle between Garner and Scott in the middle of the park should see the Everton man commit a couple of challenges as he tries to disrupt Scott's rhythm.",
      "Just two wins in 16 Premier League games has left Tottenham a mere six points from safety and suddenly flirting with the drop.",
      "Sky Bet aren't messing about either. Spurs are now just 10/1 to go down.",
      "If they don't find form fast and West Ham keep winning, that relegation scrap could get very real indeed. This is getting serious.",
      "Spurs are easily swerved here at 19/10 with Sky Bet too having won just one of their last 11 Premier League home matches.",
      "Meanwhile, when the chips are down Eddie Howe usually delivers a result for Newcastle and he'll be using the frustration within the home fanbase as a weapon in the hope the north London faithful turn on their team. That's why a fast start is expected which makes the half-time/full-time market for Newcastle/Newcastle at 5/2 with Sky Bet a smart way to boost the odds on an away win.",
      "One of the standout bets on the midweek card is Crysencio Summerville to have a shot on target at Evens with Sky Bet. The winger has been a thorn in Premier League defences lately, registering nine shots on target in his last six matches.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo's tactical system is clearly suiting Summerville, giving him the freedom to drift into dangerous positions and create big moments. Against a Manchester United side that has shown vulnerability out wide, expect Summerville to be buzzing for another attempt on goal.",
      "Brighton's wobbles are a great betting edge to exploit. Just one win in 12 games isn't a blip, that's a crisis - yet the markets still have them priced as a dangerous outfit. Villa, notoriously ruthless and efficient at home, are on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet for maximum points. That looks generous based on what Brighton are serving up.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler's side are struggling for creativity and confidence. The end could be near for him as Brighton boss.",
      "Jorgen Strand Larsen played like a man with a big point to prove on his debut. It wasn't always pretty or easy on the eye but he made his presence felt in that 1-0 win Brighton. Three fouls and a yellow card in his first appearance shows a striker visibly eager to impose himself and to make a statement.",
      "Strand Larsen averages around 1.9 fouls per game in the Premier League. That's potentially almost two yellow-card-worthy moments every 90 minutes. He carries the aura of a striker playing like it's only a matter of time before he oversteps, mistimes a challenge or lashes out in frustration. Like he did at Brighton when stopping an attack with a cynical pull of the shirt.",
      "Strand Larsen is a striker - sure - but a striker who's touchy, combative and clearly wants to make a mark. The odds are gigantic at 19/2 with Sky Bet for a card.",
      "This version of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City always gives you a chance. It's a far cry from their controlled and possession-obsessed style.",
      "Fulham, meanwhile, aren't here to make up the numbers. Both teams to score have landed in 12 of their last 15 games and they've managed that feat on their last four visits to the Etihad. That's not luck, that's a proven blueprint of being able to hit City on the counter, capitalise on mistakes and play with freedom.",
      "City will score - of course they will - but Fulham are likely to join the party. Both teams to score looks a bet at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White and Wolves. Make no mistake, there's bad blood there.",
      "Every touch will be scrutinised, every run will be jeered and if he gets on the scoresheet, the emotions are going to explode.",
      "Gibbs-White isn't shy either. He's combative, fiery and at 10/1 with Sky Bet to score and pick up a card, the value is screaming. Picture the scene: a Gibbs-White goal sparks celebrations in what has become a very big game now for Forest. The shirt may come off which triggers a booking.",
      "Combine the two through the Sky Bet BuildABet function and 10/1 looks like a steal.",
      "If you want a betting market that rewards understanding football match-ups rather than predicting perfection, the \"to be fouled\" market is as good as it gets.",
      "Bookmakers price fouls largely off averages and historical data. What they struggle to fully account for is role within a specific match-up. Like a foul-heavy centre-forward playing up against a wily centre-back. That's what we have here.",
      "This isn't about Virgil van Dijk losing control or his cool. That rarely happens.",
      "It's about Van Dijk being dragged into a very specific type of duel against his opponent in Brian Bobbey, who is not a subtle centre-forward. His game is built on confrontation.",
      "Last season at Ajax he averaged 1.8 fouls per 90, which is a huge number for a striker operating in a possession-dominant side. Even more telling is the recent trend of nine fouls across his last six games where he is bullying big-name opponents. Van Dijk is 10/11 with Sky Bet to win +1 fouls.",
      "Arsenal are scoring goals at a relentless rate, conceding here and there and making life very, very hard for anyone trying to keep them quiet. That is a perfect cocktail for backing the over 2.5 goals line when the odds flirt around the Even money mark. Their last 13 games are averaging 3.4 goals per 90 minutes and 10 of those matches have gone over 2.5 goals",
      "Even without Brentford contributing, Arsenal alone could easily cover this line. They've hit three or more goals in 10 of their last 13 matches. That's ruthless attacking form from a team who know exactly how to punish mistakes.",

      "Michael Carrick has overseen victories in his first four games as Man Utd boss, rejuvenating the club after Ruben Amorim's exit; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also made a winning start in 2018, with similarities between their approach to restore confidence and United's traditional style of play",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 13:57, UK",
      "It's four from four for Michael Carrick, Man Utd are rejuvenated and the similarities with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's instant impact in 2018 are striking.",
      "Carrick first had a taste of managing United as a caretaker following Solskjaer's exit in 2021 and any scepticism about his long-term suitability for the role is wedded to how it unravelled for the former super sub who couldn't sustain his stunning start.",
      "But Old Trafford is buzzing again and there's no doubt Carrick has recaptured that flow, feeling and freedom United enjoyed at the beginning of Solskjaer's tenure in 2018/19, when the Norwegian took the wheel.",
      "Goals are flying in, an unshackled No 10 is pulling the strings, and refound confidence is coursing through the team with a sense the traditional style of play at Man Utd has been reclaimed.",
      "Carrick's United have scored 10 in his four games in charge, having managed just one per game in Amorim's final four. That's shy of Solskjaer's total at the start of his interim spell but the calibre of opponent has been trickier and they could easily have had more, against City in particular.",
      "\"After the negative performances under Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer seemed to give his players a freedom to express themselves\" we wrote on these pages in 2018, when United thumped Cardiff 5-1 in Solskjaer's first game.",
      "The same sentiment applies to Carrick's United - a gameplan simplified yet, as he said himself, a team \"playing with purpose\".",
      "And the creator in chief? Back in 2018 it was Paul Pogba in the No 10. So often the scapegoat during the Mourinho era, who made headlines with a famously frosty training ground greeting with his manager, under Solskjaer Pogba was renewed.",
      "His four goal involvements in Solskjaer's first two games was as many as he'd managed in Mourinho's final 12 matches. His four goals across Solskjaer's games two and three were as many as he'd scored in Mourinho's final 20.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' output has been impressive throughout the season, especially given United's struggles under Amorim. But he too is now playing with added verve, restored to a No 10 role from a deeper position thanks to Carrick's tactical shake-up.",
      "It's four assists and a goal from four games under Carrick for Fernandes. \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch,\" was the United captain's assessment after adding the second to seal the win against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "That goal was from a fantastic Diogo Dalot cross but against City and at Arsenal United have also been excellent on the break. It has been high-energy, intense and end-to-end. A throwback, an echo of the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson - who managed and inspired both Solskjaer and Carrick.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville said after that derby triumph. \"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"You've just watched 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "In another nod to the grand traditions of the club, Solskjaer became the first United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his first four in charge. Now in his permanent role, Carrick has repeated the streak.",
      "But what comes next?",
      "Solskjaer went on to win his first six Premier League games on the spin and with West Ham and Everton next, Carrick could emulate that. Matching Solskjaer's return of 14 wins from his first 19 really would be some going.",
      "But infamously, after signing his contract for the permanent post, Solskjaer oversaw just two wins out of the remaining 10 games that season.",
      "Roy Keane's recent comment that Carrick shouldn't be appointed even if he wins every game until the end of this campaign sparked debate but is a reflection of the scars from Solskjaer's appointment and how he proved not to be the answer in the long run.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager,\" said Keane after the victory at Arsenal. \"The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.\"",
      "Solskjaer did go on to achieve two high league finishes and lost a Europa League final on penalties but couldn't attain the titles ultimately expected from the hierarchy after heavy transfer market investment in the squad.",
      "Carrick has made a similar start to Solskjaer but is a club which has experienced multiple false dawns since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement now seeing the foundations created for substantial long-term success?",
      "The arguments about whether Carrick can take the team to the next level will run through the final months of the season to the end of his current deal in the summer, when United will be weighing up their alternatives. But no doubt, Carrick has hit the ground running and raised expectations again at Old Trafford.",

      "The move to the Hill Dickinson Stadium has not yet paid off for Everton, whose European hopes have been boosted by the fifth-best away record in the Premier League, leaving them just two points behind sixth-placed Liverpool.",
      "Everton are still adjusting to their new surroundings, with just four wins at home since leaving Goodison Park, their last coming in early December, but Bournemouth have only two victories on the road.",
      "The visitors have recently eased relegation concerns with a five-game unbeaten run. They should have earned a third consecutive victory on Saturday against Aston Villa, denied by Emi Martinez's seven saves, but new signing Rayan showed more promise on his first start since signing from Vasco da Gama for £30.3m.",
      "The 19-year-old Brazilian, who is seen as a long-term replacement for Antoine Semenyo, followed up his assist at Wolves the week before by ghosting past Lucas Digne on the right before firing past Martinez. Bournemouth are still providing plenty of attacking threat without Semenyo and the injured Justin Kluivert and Marcus Tavernier.",
      "Everton haven't lost in five either and their late turnaround win at Fulham added to goals in the final 15 minutes against Brighton and Leeds in their previous two games. David Moyes' side are grinding out results and now they need one on home turf to really worry Liverpool and the top seven.David Richardson",

      "Thomas Frank and Eddie Howe have been forced to field questions about their managerial futures amid worrying runs of results and performances from their teams and this is a game they dare not lose.",
      "Howe can at least lean on a favourable record against Frank - he's won six of their nine meetings. His points-per-game record against the Dane is Howe's best against any manager he's faced at least five times.",
      "But with just two wins out of their last 15 on the road in the Premier League, Newcastle will be just as nervy as the home side going into this one.",
      "Spurs supporters were right behind their side at Old Trafford on Saturday, despite the handicap of Cristian Romero's early red card. But, without their captain on Tuesday, it would not be a surprise to feel the atmosphere sour if Newcastle do make a positive start in the game. Tottenham fans have seen their team win just four of their last 26 at home in the league.",
      "Being sucked into a relegation battle is not out of the question for the Londoners, while European qualification is looking increasingly tricky for Newcastle. For both, a win would be precious. For both, a defeat would be devastating.Peter Smith",
      "West Ham vs Manchester United - 8.15pm, Tuesday",
      "It's two years since Manchester United last beat West Ham. Crysencio Summerville is on a five-game scoring streak. And Nuno Espirito Santo has revived the Hammers' survival hopes with three wins in four Premier League games.",
      "But the momentum Manchester United will bring to east London on Tuesday night under Michael Carrick's management would be daunting for any opponent right now.",
      "Last time in the capital, they pulled off a thrilling win at Premier League leaders Arsenal, and with four wins on the spin, former Hammers midfielder Carrick is marshalling a team filled with confidence.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been at the heart of Carrick's fast start, scoring against Spurs to reach 200 goal involvements for the club - and with 10 in his last eight Premier League away games Nuno will need a gameplan to limit him.",
      "But after beating one of his old sides on Saturday, the expectation is that Carrick will do the same to West Ham this midweek, regardless of the Hammers' recent resurgence.Peter Smith",
      "Aston Villa vs Brighton - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Home losses to Everton and Brentford have curtailed momentum and there really will be panic on the Holte End if they succumb to defeat against Brighton. Manchester United and Chelsea are catching Villa. Liverpool are not far behind.",
      "The fear is that it is not only the teams below them who are catching up with Villa but the schedule too. Emery's side could yet play 60 games this season compared to United's 40 - and are without Youri Tielemans, John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara.",
      "None of that midfield trio are expected back until April and that presents a challenge for Emery to find solutions within the squad. With Leeds at home next up in the Premier League followed by Wolves away, any slip would be a major blow to their top-five hopes.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler's concerns are even more immediate given the chants of, 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'you're getting sacked in the morning' during Brighton's home defeat to rivals Crystal Palace on Sunday. A result at Villa might be required.Adam Bate",
      "Crystal Palace vs Burnley - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Some may argue that the pressure has been on all season for Scott Parker and Burnley - it's always a tough ask for promoted teams to be competitive in their first season back in the Premier League.",
      "But for a club that has often stuck with managers in difficult moments, the board's ears might begin to prickle after boos on Saturday as the Clarets lost 2-0 to relegation rivals West Ham - that is despite having 18 shots, their most in a Premier League game this season.",
      "It leaves them 11 points from safety and with no win in 16 league outings since beat bottom side Wolves on October 26. Until recently, they might have earmarked a trip to Crystal Palace as one where points could be gained.",
      "The Eagles were rarely out of the headlines in January amid a tumultuous period, but picking up their first Premier League win in nine games against rivals Brighton will give them a boost.",
      "It has taken the sting out of the tail at Selhurst Park when one wondered if a superb period of success was spectacularly unravelling before our eyes.",
      "That seems to have been halted for the time being and at home against teams near or below them, Crystal Palace have a good record.",
      "The form guide says it will be another tough Premier League match for Burnley, as Parker continues to look for ways to avoid the drop back into the Championship.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Man City vs Fulham - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Manchester City have been involved in some nonsensical games in recent weeks - the win at Liverpool and draw at Tottenham just two of them - and yet their position in the title race seems to make perfect sense.",
      "City might need something special to topple Arsenal but the prospect is yet to be rendered inconceivable. The statement at Anfield will have done as much to convince the City players themselves as it has to remind those of us who merely pass comment that the race is still open.",
      "Gary Neville believes Pep Guardiola, Erling Haaland and Gianluigi Donnarumma to be central to this rival plan. But that's too simplistic and overlooks the importance of Bernardo Silva, Rodri, as well as the returning Ruben Dias - the spine of strength. They all know how to win titles.",
      "Coupled with that is the immediate impact of January additions Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo; compelling reinforcements at this stage of the season. They both bring fresh ambition.",
      "Moving to within three points of the Gunners with victory over Fulham would ensure the scoreboard pressure mounts and Arsenal have proven to be unreliable leaders when chasers make their move to overtake in the past. City may have to leave it late again against Fulham, who have lost eight games this season after the 80th minute.",
      "It might just be enough to divert Arsenal's attention. If City wrestle enough initiative, they won't back down until they get what they want. Pep will make sure of that.Laura Hunter",
      "Nottingham Forest vs Wolves - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Every day of the weekend brought a fresh blow for Nottingham Forest. Their insipid defeat to Leeds on Friday gifted three points to a relegation rival, before West Ham won well on Saturday and Crystal Palace ended their poor run with a victory on Sunday.",
      "The upshot is that Forest risk being in the bottom three before they even take to the field against bottom club Wolves on Wednesday night and with former boss Nuno Espirito Santo having improved West Ham's fortunes, the scrutiny on Sean Dyche is increasing.",
      "Four of the last five Premier League wins for Forest have come away from home where the counter-punching style can be more effective. Dyche's style of play is yet to convince the supporters and expectation could create tension by the Trent in midweek.",
      "While Wolves' own relegation has long since felt inevitable, and they threw the game away early at home to Chelsea on Saturday, they have been in games more than one might expect of a team adrift at the bottom and that can unnerve fragile opponents.",
      "Forest's FA Cup exit means there's an 11-day break before their next fixture against Liverpool and the mood during that period will be shaped by the outcome of this game. Failing to beat Wolves would be unthinkable, and yet many fans are already dreading it.Adam Bate",
      "Sunderland vs Liverpool - 8.15pm, Wednesday",
      "Sunderland are unbeaten in all 12 of their Premier League games played at the Stadium of Light this season, a record that puts them fourth in the home form table, and is the longest run by a promoted side since 1977-78. No team wants to travel to that outpost in north-east England, least of all Liverpool, having only managed to win two of their last 10 on the road.",
      "This fixture has got the potential to make things infinitely harder for Arne Slot after a troubling weekend. Things could go from bad to worse with no right-back to speak of (after stand-in Dominik Szoboszlai was sent off in defeat to Manchester City) and a crisis of confidence that just won't shake. Liverpool have conceded 21 goals away from Anfield this term - more than bottom side Wolves (20).",
      "But the desperation to keep up with their rivals in the top-four race might just be enough for Liverpool to rediscover some spark. Slot's side still boast some of the best attacking numbers in the league, and the Reds boss will be equally aware of the position they will find themselves in if they don't win. The gap to the European spots is already four. It can ill-afford to get any larger.Laura Hunter",
      "Brentford vs Arsenal - 8pm, Thursday",
      "Arsenal seem to be running away with the Premier League title, while Brentford are up to seventh after their first win away at Newcastle since 1934. The Gunners are top of the form table over the last 10 matches (W7 D2 L1) and the Bees are just behind (W6 D2 L2).",
      "Brentford's home form remains - as it has done for several years - among the best in the division, but Arsenal's away form is the best, bar none. If those stats aren't enough to whet the appetite, this is a battle between two set-piece specialists.",
      "Brentford - led by their former set-piece coach Keith Andrews - piqued interest with their success from long throws, so much so that, in October, Erling Haaland said playing them \"reminded me a bit of Stoke City with [Rory] Delap\". Michael Kayode and Mathias Jensen are the men tasked with delivering the monstrous deliveries that have been the source of three goals so far - the joint-second most in the division.",
      "In all, they have scored 11 goals from set-pieces and conceded nine, making them one of only eight teams yet to enter double figures in that regard.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side, on the other hand, are in a league of their own. Twenty of their 49 league goals have come from set-pieces (40.8 per cent), with 14 of those scored from corners. Both totals are unmatched in the Premier League this season. They have also only conceded five of 17 so far in that manner, which is also the least in the Premier League.",
      "If this game is to be decided by fine margins, few fixtures are better equipped to deliver.Dan Long",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's impressive return to the Manchester United team shows what Ruben Amorim was missing. Also in The Debrief: More Bruno Fernandes numbers, Bernardo Silva's influential display, Enzo Fernandez's 'new' position and Angel Gomes' debut",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 07:22, UK",
      "The questions about Kobbie Mainoo had become a running joke of press conferences under Ruben Amorim. It was clear that the former Manchester United boss was less than convinced that the young midfielder was worth all the fuss. But Amorim was wrong.",
      "Having not been trusted with a single Premier League start prior to Michael Carrick's arrival, Mainoo has been picked four times out of four under him and United have won the lot. Beat West Ham on Tuesday and a certain supporter can finally have his hair cut.",
      "The partnership with Casemiro, one that Amorim sensed was not feasible, has been impressive in of itself let alone the fact that the formation change has freed up Bruno Fernandes to flourish in his favoured position. Mainoo has slotted in there seamlessly.",
      "The youngster deserves credit for getting up to speed so quickly given that he had been so starved of minutes. The balance he brings the team is one thing, the boost it brings for fans to see an academy graduate is another. But fundamentally he is just a fine footballer.",
      "Against Tottenham, Mainoo completed 33 passes in the final third of the pitch, 12 more than he ever had in a Premier League game before. That was also the most by anyone on the pitch and the most by any player in the competition over the course of the weekend.",
      "Casemiro was not far behind, the pair described as \"a big part of controlling the team\" by Carrick. It helped that Spurs were down to 10 but when Carrick talked recently of liking \"the way Kobbie takes the ball\" and calling him \"a joy to watch\" it is easy to see why.",
      "\"Credit to him, he has come right in and found his rhythm, which is not easy after a period of time out. We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I am sure he will keep improving. We have got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.\"",
      "Mainoo, still only 20 years old, was in danger of becoming a talent lost to United had the previous regime been allowed to continue much longer. Instead, Carrick has helped him to remind people of his quality. Perhaps he could have been useful to Amorim, after all.",
      "Regular readers of this column will know there is a risk of it becoming devoted to the boy Fernandes. But such are his statistical accomplishments, it is difficult to ignore the Portuguese playmaker. He was at it again in Manchester United's win over Tottenham.",
      "Fernandes scored United's second goal and had six shots from outside the box but his creative contribution stood out once more. Fernandes should have had another assist with his final kick of the game when the unmarked Benjamin Sesko misdirected his header.",
      "That was the sixth chance created by the United captain, the most of any player over the Premier League weekend. It is the third time this season that Fernandes has created six chances in a game. Rayan Cherki is the only other man to have done that even twice.",
      "Two of the three matches in which Fernandes has created that many chances have come under Carrick and that should be no surprise. He has been restored to his best position, playing in the fun part of the football pitch, making things happen for his team.",
      "In truth, even under Ruben Amorim, he was putting up spectacular numbers. He has created 74 chances this season when nobody else in the Premier League has brought up their half century yet. It is 200 United goal involvements in all competition for him now.",
      "Fernandes remains a polarising figure, routinely given the treatment by opposition supporters. Even some United fans speculate that he might be part of the problem rather than the solution given that his time at the club has coincided with their struggles.",
      "That talk should stop. Fernandes has been a victim of United's malaise. While their 16th-place finish last season was a little artificial given their resources, if he propels them into the Champions League, he has a persuasive case to be named as the player of the year.",
      "Pep Guardiola is rarely shy to laud his players but the smile beams a little wider where Bernardo Silva is concerned, the player whom he has picked more times than any other outfield player during his managerial career. He delivered again for him at Anfield.",
      "While Erling Haaland scored the winning goal in Manchester City's come-from-behind victory over Liverpool, Guardiola had been unimpressed with the big striker's efforts for much of the second half, gesticulating at him and wanting much better body language.",
      "\"I know it's an incredibly difficult task [for Haaland and Omar Marmoush against Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk, to win those balls, but in the second half [they did] not even try,\" claimed Guardiola. \"That ball goes quick, it comes back quicker.\"",
      "It was Bernardo who drove City on to victory, not just with his equalising goal but his whole demeanour. While others were wilting, shoulders hunched and belief sapped, he sensed the moment. He was the inspiration to his teammates - and his own coach.",
      "\"Guided by our incredible player, one of the best players I ever trained, our captain Bernardo, we followed him. I follow him too. Because when a player always puts the team in front of himself and does things through example, everybody follows him.\"",
      "Bernardo completed more passes in the final third than anyone else on the pitch but, now playing in a deeper role, he has shown that the location of his work is less significant than his presence. Guardiola still wants his man out there setting standards.",
      "The City boss said recently that he would love Bernardo to stay and that whatever happens this season his legacy at the club is secure. But don't rule out more glory just yet. \"We will fight to the end,\" said Bernardo himself afterwards. He always does.",
      "With eight goals in 24 Premier League games this season, Enzo Fernandez is only one behind Joao Pedro as Chelsea's top scorer in the competition. But the Argentina international was moved to the left to accommodate Cole Palmer in the win at Wolves.",
      "At least that is what the team graphics showed. Liam Rosenior rejected that argument when discussing Fernandez's positioning in the press conference following the 3-1 victory in which Palmer scored a first-half hat trick. \"It's amazing,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Enzo is playing in exactly the same position he has been playing in probably 80 to 90 per cent of the season, which is in the left pocket. That is where he plays. Actually, he has got more freedom because we're interchanging a little bit more from our structure.\"",
      "\"Without the ball, he is on the left. That is probably why it looks different today because of the way Wolves play. He has not changed his position, to be honest. It looks that way, but his position in possession is the same.\" The touch map illustrates this point.",
      "It was Marc Cucurella who provided the assist for Chelsea's excellent third goal - a move that started with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez - and it was the left-back who offered width on that flank. No Chelsea player had more touches in the opposition box than Cucurella.",
      "Fernandez was free to roam into more central zones, having three shots of his own, including an ambitious rabona attempt that would have been the goal of the Premier League weekend. He had more final third entries than any other player on the pitch.",
      "With Pedro Neto staying wide on the right, Fernandez was often alongside Palmer, the pair operating in the pockets. While his duties shifted a little out of possession, on the ball it seems this might be the way for Rosenior to get his best players in the best areas.",
      "Angel Gomes' loan move to Wolves was a surprising one. The midfielder made four appearances for England as recently as 2024 and has an intriguing profile. Leaving Marseille for a team doomed to relegation from the Premier League raised eyebrows.",
      "But this is an opportunity to show what he can do in English football, a first Premier League start at the age of 25 after five substitute appearances for Manchester United in the competition as a teenager. It was a promising debut even in defeat against Chelsea.",
      "The quality of his work in possession was certainly an upgrade on those around him at Molineux. He was the only Wolves starter to win possession more times than he lost it. His passing accuracy was 94.3 per cent, while no other Wolves starter hit 90 per cent.",
      "But what was particularly impressive about the playmaker was that these numbers did not stem from him playing safe, he was progressive in his use of the ball too. Asking Rob Edwards about that in the press conference, he identified it as Gomes' key strength.",
      "\"That was the reason for him coming in. I think he can link, obviously, as a six and give us something in the build-up but once he gets turned and is facing up as well, hopefully then he has got more of a killer pass, maybe something that we have not quite had.",
      "\"You saw a little bit of that today, didn't you. He has got that nice sort of spinning one, where he is seeing those runs. He has got those forward passes in the locker and hopefully we will see a lot more of it now, the fitter and the more integrated he gets.\"",
      "Gomes went off with cramp late on, an indication that the physical challenge of the Premier League will be tough after four-and-a-half seasons in France. But his touch gave him time on the ball against tough opposition. Wolves will not be staying up. He just might.",

      "Monday 9 February 2026 15:10, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United will not be \"bounced\" into making a decision to give Michael Carrick the manager's job after a run of great results.",
      "Carrick masterminded a fourth-straight United victory as his side secured a 2-0 Premier League triumph over 10-man Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "The win moved United to within three points of third-placed Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "It also took Carrick's overall record as boss at Old Trafford to six wins in seven matches, including a three-game spell in 2021, but as the clamour builds in favour of giving him the job beyond the end of the season, Neville warned United will not be rushed into a decision.",
      "He told The Gary Neville Podcast: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "\"It's a very difficult situation, you've got a massive movement now with what's happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered.That's only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "\"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "\"That's good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "\"At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that's fair.\"",
      "The arrival of Carrick has certainly lifted the mood at Old Trafford after United were winless in four and with only one victory in seven matches in all competitions before their former midfielder was hired following Ruben Amorim's exit at the start of January.",
      "And Neville was full of praise for the job his former team-mate has done in turning around Man Utd's fortunes, saying the position they are in now was unthinkable a few weeks ago.",
      "\"I can't believe where Manchester United are,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I watched them six out of those seven games before Ruben Amorim was sacked, and after that against Burnley when Darren Fletcher took over, it was terrible. It was really was shocking, and what Michael Carrick has done, he's rebuilt trust instantly and faith. The players, straightaway, are listening. They're trusting in what the message is and it's a complete about turn.",
      "\"He's done more than that, though, the results are excellent, the performances are fantastic and I like what I see. He's rebuilt faith in the system of play in the 4-4-1-1, and the way in which United should always play.",
      "\"Everything at the moment for United is looking really, really good.",
      "\"They do look like they really have got an incredible chance [of qualifying for the Champions League], because of the fact they haven't got the confusion, and the chaotic fixture list that some of the others have.",
      "\"You would think that they've got a massive chance now, with the way in which Carrick has set about the job of getting into the Champions League. It was unthinkable only four or five weeks ago, unthinkable.",
      "\"If they win another four or five games then they're almost emphatically in the Champions League, and that would be incredible.",
      "\"It'd be a great position to be in by the way [for appointing a new manager], if you think about where probably Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox thought they were going to be maybe a few weeks ago.\"",

      "Man Utd have won four Premier League games on the bounce for the first time since 2024; Michael Carrick has overseen wins against Tottenham, Fulham, Arsenal and Manchester City; he believes the team are now playing with \"expression and excitement\"",
      "Sunday 8 February 2026 07:02, UK",
      "It's four Premier League wins in a row for Manchester United under Michael Carrick and a season that was unraveling just weeks ago now looks full of potential and promise.",
      "A 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Old Trafford extended Carrick's 100 per cent start as head coach and will further strengthen his case to be given the job on a long-term basis. At the very least, his impressive impact surely puts him in the conversation.",
      "Saturday's win also marks the first time in two years that United have won four Premier League games on the spin, with hopes of a top-four finish and a return to the lucrative Champions League now looking more realistic than not.",
      "Carrick was particularly pleased with the purpose of his side, encouraging \"expression and excitement\", as Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes scored the goals that extended their unbeaten streak to eight games overall - their longest run since 2022.",
      "\"The first goal is normally vital, to get ahead, but I think it's just encouraging the expression, the attacking play,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"Not so much enjoyment where you can do what you want and it's a playground, kind of flicks and tricks, but more playing with a purpose and confidence.",
      "\"The connection with everyone has been as good as anything. The feeling, the emotion and connection with players, staff and fans - it feels good. We've had to win games in different ways. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the stadium this way, to look forward to the excitement.",
      "\"I'm pleased with the buy-in. We're in a good emotional place and that helps you. The four games we've had look different, we've not cracked it. I'm aware of that.",
      "\"We're just moving on to the next one and not settling for what we've got. Not taking things for granted is something we speak about a lot and the boys have been really good for that so far.\"",
      "Carrick has transformed United's fortunes since he was parachuted in to replace Ruben Amorim last month. As well as beating Spurs and Fulham, he has also masterminded wins over the division's top two sides Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "Captain Fernandes believes Carrick has added 'something special.' He said: \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch.",
      "\"It's very good. I was sure he would be a great manager and he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more.",
      "\"Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club, everyone knows the expectations around it. He knows what it means for this club to win. It adds something special to the team.\"",
      "Fernandes himself has been at the heart of United's revival. Asked if the midfielder is among the most in-form players in the Premier League currently, Carrick added: \"Listen, it'd take a long time to sum it up [his contribution here].",
      "\"I think he's offered the club so much in the time he's been here, since he walked in the door. He played different roles today for us and ended up on the left. The second goal was from the left as we changed things around a little bit.",
      "\"He's a team player, he gives so much to the group. He's got big moments in him but we know the quality he has. He cares a lot for this football club and the team and that is clear to see.\"",
      "There was plenty of hyperbolic conversation in the press room at Old Trafford on Saturday. The question most were asking: 'Are Manchester United back?'",
      "Not to rain on the parade, but it's perhaps a little too early to declare United as fully reformed. They do, however, look imposing in Carrick's mould, fluid in attack and organised defensively.",
      "He was true to form post-match, calm and controlled in his exchanges with reporters, emphasising that nothing has been achieved yet. Tangibly it hasn't. But for these long-suffering United fans, the gift of four on the bounce will feel like a lottery win. These are heady times given what came before.",
      "Carrick's United have already eclipsed last season's points total with over a third of the season remaining. It's impossible to overstate the underperformance in the 18 months preceding his appointment, but equally important to highlight the impact since. What I like most is the coordination in each attacking phase; so well balanced.",
      "Carrick is also showing impressive maturity and composure in-game. His decision-making is drawing praise. This looks to be the start of something with huge promise - and maybe even longevity.",
