      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim returned to winning ways against Newcastle on Friday evening. The club are now just three points behind third-placed Liverpool.",
      "In a scrappy affair, it was Patrick Dorgu's sumptuous volley that proved the difference when Amorim's side hosted the Magpies. The win saw the Portuguese coach revert to a rarely-seen back four in the absence of captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Dutchman Zirkzee only touched down in Manchester in the summer of 2024 and was the first addition secured under new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Erik ten Hag was the manager upon his arrival from Bologna.",
      "The £36.5million forward failed to make any impact under Ten Hag and with Amorim in charge, he has been limited to appearances off the bench. He has mustered only a single assist so far this season.",
      "With new forwards purchased in the summer, Zirkzee's name began to be linked with a transfer away, though nothing materialised. With the January window soon open, those same rumours are persisting and new reports suggest he has made up his mind regarding his future.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Zirkzee has reportedly agreed to a move to Roma. The Italian side have long been mooted as potential suitors for the Dutchman.",
      "Zirkzee has now supposedly met with Roma's sporting director Ricky Massara and has been assured by boss Gian Piero Gasparini that he will fit into their system. The report states that a move is expected to be complete by mid-January.",
      "With the men's team seemingly braced for Zirkzee's exit, the women's team has been handed a boost. Japanese midfielder Hinata Miyazawa has signed a new contract with United that will keep her at the club until 2029.",
      "Miyazawa arrived in Manchester two years ago and helped the club lift the Women's FA Cup during the 2023/24 season. She is also a regular for her national side.",
      "Director of Women's Football at United Matt Johnson expressed: \"We are really excited to have Hinata extend her time at Manchester United.",
      "\"She has become a critical component to the way we play. Her footballing intelligence and technical ability enables her and the team to control and dictate play from central areas.\"",
      "United's Miyazawa stated: \"I am really enjoying playing football at Manchester United and I am really happy to be continuing my journey here.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "John Terry is auctioning the kit he wore during his infamous penalty slip and miss in the 2008 Champions League Final against Manchester United. The former Chelsea captain is clearing out his wardrobe of some iconic pieces of memorabilia in order to raise money for charity.",
      "In addition to the strip from that notorious moment, a more difficult goodbye may come as he parts ways with the kit which he wore when lifting the 2011/12 Champions League trophy. Terry was in his full Blues kit despite being suspended for the penalty shootout win itself.",
      "While Chelsea fans may be queuing up for a Champions League-winning top, perhaps there will be some United fans in search of the grass stains left in Terry's 2008 shirt after his slip. After being called upon to take the decisive penalty following Cristiano Ronaldo's miss, Terry slipped as he hit the ball and struck the post in Moscow. The Red Devils went on to win in sudden death.",
      "The bidding will begin at $5,000 (£3,700) for that shirt. Others have a cheaper entry with the tops from the final game of his Chelsea career and his last career match listed at $1,000 (£740). They are among more than 20 items that the 45-year-old is putting up for auction with proceeds going to charity.",
      "The funds will be directed to the John Terry Foundation, which supports a range of charities nationwide. \"My foundation is going to benefit with two very close to my heart foundations that are in desperate need of the money,\" Terry said. \"It's going to a great cause, so all the support is going to be welcome.\"",
      "More high-ticket items will also be available. Terry is also set to let go of his first Premier League winners' medal.",
      "The Chelsea icon captained his team to a dominant title win under Jose Mourinho, ending the club's 50-year wait for the title. The medal could raise up to £75,000.",
      "Shirts that Terry has claimed in some of his biggest battles will also be available. Match-worn tops from Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will all go under the hammer.",
      "The sale will take place on Wednesday, December 31 via an online auction house, Goldin. A spokesperson said that the collection was a testament to Terry's truly 'remarkable' career.",
      "\"When considering the greatest defenders in the history of English football, John Terry's name can often be found at the forefront of the conversation,\" a statement read. \"A stalwart and imposing presence on Chelsea's vaunted back line, a position he held with the club for nearly 20 years, Terry quickly was anointed as the club's skipper under newly arrived manager Jose Mourinho, a decision that proved wise beyond measure.",
      "\"Among the lots is Terry's Premier League medal from his first win in 2004-05 and some of the shirts exchanged with opponents, including Lionel Messi",
      "\"In addition to his domestic achievements, Terry established himself as an accomplished lynchpin on the backline of England's National Team, appearing in 78 international competitions while representing the Three Lions and scoring six goals total.",
      "\"Goldin is proud to present a remarkable array of memorabilia sourced directly from John Terry's personal collection, testaments to various stages of Terry's illustrious and accomplished career.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has been a hit during his Barcelona loan spell - and the majority of the Catalan club's fans want the club to sign the Manchester United man permanently next summer according to a vote held by a Spanish outlet.",
      "Rashford joined the La Liga giants in the summer, with United and Barca agreeing to a deal that includes an option for Barca to sign him permanently at the end of the season. The Spanish giants will have to pay around £26million to keep Rashford in Catalonia beyond May 2026.",
      "The 28-year-old has scored seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances under Hansi Flick. Such form has placed him in contention for an England call-up for the World Cup next summer Flick, according to reports in Spain, wants to retain Rashford's services, and the club are actively working towards a deal.",
      "Mundo Deportivo hosted a poll which revealed 54.6 per cent of Barca fans would be in favour of keeping Rashford at the club, by activating the purchase option in his loan. A total of 6.3 per cent reckon that sporting chief Deco should hold off until the end of their season.",
      "That leaves almost 40 per cent of fans in opposition to signing Rashford permanently.",
      "For his part, Rashford appears content at Camp Nou. The Manchester United academy product has discussed his future ambitions with the club. He told SPORT in an interview: \"I'm adapting very well to the club and the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt that everyone welcomed me very well.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has offered words of encouragement to Tyrell Malacia following the full-back's first outing for the club since the beginning of the year. Malacia entered the pitch as a substitute during United's 1-0 Boxing Day victory against Newcastle United.",
      "He came on for Luke Shaw in the 88th minute and assisted Ruben Amorim's team in securing crucial three points, drawing them level with Chelsea in fifth place. The left-back had spent the latter part of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven after failing to impress Amorim.",
      "Despite appearing destined for a summer departure, he has since been brought back into the United fold. Following six consecutive matches on the substitutes' bench, Malacia finally made his comeback at Old Trafford against Newcastle.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has, for the first time, been considering leaving Manchester United on a permanent basis, a new report claims. Mainoo, 20, has been left disgruntled by his lack of game time under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The midfielder's only start this season came in United's humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town in August. Mainoo pushed to leave his boyhood club on loan towards the end of the summer transfer window, but the Red Devils weren't willing to let him go.",
      "Amorim was set to turn to Mainoo for United's game at Aston Villa last Sunday before he suffered an injury in training. The calf problem also ruled him out of Friday's hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Newcastle.",
      "With just a few days until the January window opens, it's emerged that Mainoo is once again weighing up a departure - but this time not on loan. The i Paper report that sources close to the 10-time England international say that he's been exploring a permanent exit, with a number of clubs across Europe registering their interest.",
      "Napoli could be one of them. Former Old Trafford team-mates Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have reignited their careers in Naples, and Mainoo has been tipped to be next.",
      "United, however, would only entertain a huge offer and are lacking depth in midfield. Bruno Fernandes is currently out injured and Casemiro has only played 90 minutes three times for United this season.",
      "Unless the Red Devils were able to sign one of their top midfield targets - Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba or Adam Wharton - selling Mainoo would leave Amorim with only Mason Mount and Manuel Ugarte as backups to Fernandes and Casemiro. Ugarte has started United's last two games while Mount picked up an injury on Boxing Day.",
      "Before beating Newcastle, Amorim said that Mainoo was the club's 'future', appearing to rule out a January exit. \"That is my feeling,\" the Red Devils boss said. \"He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "Amorim went on to say: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",

Other potential targets include Nottingham Forest's England international Elliot Anderson, who has been performing well this season. However, according to the Daily Mail, Garner is moving up the priority list and already has the backing of captain Fernandes.",

      "Everton are attempting to negotiate a new contract for Garner, who has impressed at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, but it's understood that United may try to secure his services in January.",
      "It's now emerged that captain Fernandes holds Garner in high regard and you'd expect the Portuguese star would be eager to see the Birkenhead-born midfielder make his way back to Old Trafford.",
      "During an exclusive Q&A on the Manchester United website in 2021, Fernandes discussed how much the academy graduates had impressed him throughout pre-season.",
      "\"I think we know some of them already,\" Fernandes explained. \"Jimmy Garner, I think is a really good player, I really like him and the way he kicks the ball.",
      "\"He's really aggressive off the ball too. [Anthony] Elanga was already playing with us and this pre-season he has been brilliant. He's a nice kid, works hard and is really humble and I think he's deserving of everything that's happening to him. I see a brilliant future for him and Jimmy too, and also for all the other kids.\"",
      "When asked by a supporter on X in 2022 which academy prospect he was most excited about potentially playing alongside, Fernandes singled out Garner.",

      "Christian Eriksen has taken aim at Ruben Amorim's claim that last season's Manchester United team was \"maybe the worst in history\". The Danish star has revealed the dressing room reaction to the comments, admitting that they hindered the team's morale.",
      "The former Sporting CP boss made the statement in January after a 3-1 loss to Brighton and Hove Albion. This marked their fourth defeat in five home games, and a meagre haul of 11 points since Amorim took over from Erik ten Hag.",
      "This season, United have bounced back and are vying for a European spot, sitting just three points shy of the top four following their 1-0 victory over Newcastle United on Boxing Day. This is a significant step up from last season's performance, where they ended up 15th in the Premier League and suffered a loss in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Eriksen feels that the public criticism of the team only added to the pressure on the players during an already challenging campaign.",
      "Speaking to The Times, he said: \"That didn't help. Yeah, that didn't help at all. I mean, that was not... I don't think that helped the players at all.",
      "\"Some stuff you can say inside and it's not too clever to say outside, to put extra pressure and put an extra label on the players who were already trying to do their best.",
      "\"I don't think that helped at all, no. Then if he's right or wrong, whatever, but I think for us it was a bit of like, 'Oh, here we go again. Another headline.'\"",
      "Amorim's remarks followed a disappointing display against the Seagulls at Old Trafford in mid-January. Bruno Fernandes managed to equalise, but the suffering persisted as Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter compounded their woes.",
      "The United boss has come under fire for his side's displays this season, but last term it was the players who bore the brunt of criticism after struggling to reverse their fortunes despite a managerial change.",
      "Amorim made waves with his assessment when he branded his squad as \"maybe the worst\" in the club's 147-year existence.",
      "He said: \"In [the past] 10 games in Premier League, we won two. Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me.",
      "\"We are getting a new coach who is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that.",
      "\"We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you [media] want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.\"",
      "Eriksen's deal at Old Trafford ran out in the summer before he joined Wolfsburg on a free transfer.",
      "He featured 22 times under Amorim during his 107 matches at United, netting once. Fifteen of those appearances came in the Premier League, though he was named in the starting XI on just six occasions.",
      "Eriksen said: \"Yeah, he came in with his ideas. He tried to change things as you still see, tried to get it his way.",
      "\"Certain players for certain positions, for a certain style of play, that's how he sees success. He has to change a lot because the players were not used to that system.",
      "\"Also, historically, United always liked a different system. And yeah, he's been very honest and also, yeah, honest with me from the beginning. Very, very, very honest, I would say.\"",

      "The life of a football manager can be a lonely one, especially when the threat of the sack looms large. So Wayne Rooney might have been forgiven for feeling somewhat abandoned when his wife, Coleen, was nowhere to be seen as he faced the axe at Plymouth this time last year.",
      "It was almost exactly one year ago this Sunday that Rooney coached the Pilgrims for the last time. The Devon outfit travelled to Oxford on December 29, 2024, in desperate need of points to improve their Championship relegation odds against a rival in similar circumstances.",
      "Many managers might expect to turn around and see a few familiar faces in the crowd for moral support on such occasions. And yet Coleen was nowhere to be seen during Rooney's make-or-break moment.",
      "Instead, she was taking in some festive football at Goodison Park, where she watched her local team take on Nottingham Forest instead. Rooney's better half posted a picture from the directors' lounge on Merseyside, almost 300 miles from her hubby.",
      "In the end, it proved to be the final nail in the coffin for Manchester United legend Rooney. A 2-0 loss at Oxford ended up being his last test as Plymouth chief, and he promptly left the club just two days later.",
      "He departed Home Park with five wins and 14 losses from 25 games in charge. And though not as bad as his stint with Birmingham City, he nonetheless departed Plymouth having failed to build any more credibility as a coach.",
      "Any legacy was only damaged further when his successor, Miron Muslic, did a superior job in his five months as a replacement. The Austrian even suggested Plymouth would have survived had he been appointed sooner.",
      "It was always established that Coleen wouldn't be moving with Wayne to the south coast. Stability for their four young sons remained the priority, though she acknowledged the long-term setup was nothing compared to his time as coach of DC United.",
      "\"We see him a couple of times a week, which is good,\" Coleen told the Sunday Mirror in September 2024. \"He went to America, so this is a bonus because even though it seems like far away, it's easier to get to than Washington, DC.\"",
      "She continued: \"We thought long and hard about it (moving to Devon) but with the kids it didn’t work. Kai’s now in Year 10 and just starting GCSE prep, and everything’s going well with football, and the other boys are all settled at school.",
      "\"So it didn’t seem fair on the children to pick them up and take them away, and start in a whole new place. It’s manageable. It’s life. Other couples and families have similar situations and have to get on with it.\"",
      "One year on from his Plymouth departure, there's no sign of a new coaching position on the horizon for Rooney. However, he may have to pick a position closer to home if he expects his adoring wife to be on hand for the big occasions.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Amorim switched to a back four and was rewarded when Patrick Dorgu scored his first goal for the club. The United boss also used academy graduates Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson off the substitutes’ bench, which also contained fellow youngsters Tyler Fletcher, Shea Lacey and Bendito Mantato.",
      "United legend Rooney was happy to see his former side hang on and claim three points, which left them sixth in the Premier League, and academy players given a chance to impress, but couldn’t hide his overall feelings. “I was worried when I saw the performance, if I’m being honest,” Rooney said on Match of the Day.",
      "“The manager changed the formation and he went with a back four, which a lot of people have been asking for. I know they didn’t concede a goal but they didn’t really look comfortable and Newcastle put them under pressure, especially in the second half.",
      "“And when I look at the squad and the bench, what they’ve got there, they really need players in to try and help them to challenge and get into the top four.",
      "“It’s great to see the young players on the bench and getting that opportunity, but it needs to be at the right time as well. It’s not sustainable at all. They need players in. They’ve obviously lost some important players and Bruno is a big loss.",
      "“They had 33 per cent possession in the Newcastle game – and I know when those fans go to Old Trafford they want to see the team with the ball, they want to see them entertaining, getting crosses into the box and getting shots off. It was a poor performance, but they found a way to win.”",
      "United are understood to be chasing a midfielder in the January transfer window, with Everton’s James Garner and Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher among the targets. The club have previously considered Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba after spending £200million in the summer transfer window to bolster their attack.",
      "Amorim has already ruled out panic-buying in January after losing captain Fernandes to injury. “What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes and then [it’s] ‘here we go again’ with a lot of mistakes,” Amorim said last week.",
      "“I’m not going to get [together] with [club chiefs] Jason [Wilcox] and Omar [Berrada] and say: ‘We need a lot of players.’ Because we have a plan.",
      "“If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in a moment where we need points but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. You can feel in this moment that we are going to struggle, but we will see. We have to deal with it.”",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson believes academy players are still the future of Manchester United despite the likes of Scott McTominay and Alejandro Garnacho being sold. Both former Carrington stars have left the club in the last year with fellow academy boy Kobbie Mainoo potentially following suit in January.",
      "McTominay graduated from the United youth team in 2013, working his way up the ranks until he made his senior debut in 2017. The Scottish midfielder made 255 appearances for the club, scoring 29 goals and providing eight assists before moving on to Napoli in 2024.",
      "Former manager Ferguson was full of praise for McTominay during his time at the club. He insisted the playmaker would go on to become one of United's biggest stars.",
      "\"Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of Man United's big players,\" Ferguson told the Scottish FA in 2021. \"When you watch Man United pick their team for a big game, McTominay's name is in it. He's a good character, a great trainer. I know a little bit about the boy and I think that's the background.\"",
      "Just three years later, McTominay left United and became Italy's newest hero as he helped Napoli win the Serie A title at the first time of asking.",
      "Now, fellow midfielder Mainoo may be following in his former teammate's footsteps and Fergie will likely be left saddened by this. Speaking at a golf event in 2024, the iconic manager insisted that the likes of Mainoo and Garnacho - who is now at Chelsea - are the beating soul of the club.",
      "Ferguson said: \"It's the foundation isn’t it? It's the heart and soul of what Manchester United has been since the days of Sir Matt Busby, who started the whole process of trusting young players playing.",
      "\"They're young. What they’re showing at the moment, the composure and confidence to play in the first-team, and not be daunted by it. In a way, it shows you the kind of courage they have.\"",
      "Ferguson's thoughts are clear on the sale of Mainoo from these comments - sell him and you are losing the true meaning of Manchester United.",
      "Despite rumours circling that the England international is set to leave Old Trafford, current boss Ruben Amorim claims he isn't the one who wants to see Mainoo go. Speaking before United's 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, the Portuguese boss insists the midfielder will not leave.",
      "Amorim said: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions - we talked about the position of Casemiro, he can do that.",
      "\"If you play with a three, he can play like we did in the last game with the position of Mason Mount, he can play there. He is going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling, he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "Reflecting on United's depth in midfield, the 40-year-old added: \"If we are not getting someone, it’s hard to [let Mainoo leave]. We are shorter.",
      "\"Even with a full squad, we are shorter with something that can happen here. We are a club with a big responsibility. We are dealing with all these issues and in everybody’s head, we need to win every game, there are no excuses. So it’s going to be hard to leave the club if we don’t get a substitution.",
      "\"A few days before [his injury], we were talking about Kobbie doesn’t have the minutes he deserves or needs. Then there’s an opportunity, and Kobbie is not there.",
      "\"Sometimes, it is bad luck and during this year, we have some moments with a bit of bad luck.\"",

      "Next year could be another one of change at Old Trafford, with the futures of numerous players up in the air. With the transfer window looming, here's a round-up of the latest United news…",

      "While a loan offer is believed to have been received, United are said to be taking their time to mull over their options before making a firm decision on Zirkzee's future. The 24-year-old came off the bench against Newcastle but struggled to get into the game as United tried to protect their lead.",
      "Mbeumo of Cameroon and the Ivory Coast's Amad are due to meet in a group match on Sunday, having won their opening games. It's entirely possible that both countries could go deep into the tournament, ruling them out of United action until late January, leaving Amorim and United with a tricky decision to make.",
      "Incoming signing Cristian Orozco has described moving to United as a dream come true. The Colombian teenager is due to join the club when he turns 18 in July.",
      "The Red Devils have cast their net far and wide as they seek to build for both the present and the future. They signed 18-year-old Diego Leon from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno earlier this year and have since moved for Orozco.",
      "The 17-year-old midfielder plays for Fortaleza CEIF in his homeland and captained Colombia U17s to the South American Championship final in April. The youngster recently visited Manchester and was impressed with what he saw.",
      "He said: \"It went really well, to be honest. I was looking around the city. Everything was beautiful. I was able to see the facilities, the stadium. I'm truly fulfilling a childhood dream. It was a wonderful experience.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has been served a harsh dose of reality as speculation continues around his Manchester United future. The 20-year-old has become one of Old Trafford's most discussed figures this season, despite barely featuring on the pitch.",
      "Mainoo hasn't been given a single Premier League start under Ruben Amorim this term and has only started once across all competitions in a shocking Carabao Cup exit to League Two outfit Grimsby Town back in August. Despite his limited game time, the England international continues to attract attention from European giants Napoli and Bayern Munich, who are reportedly keeping tabs on his situation.",
      "Mainoo even sought a loan switch late in the summer transfer window, raising doubts about his standing in Amorim's plans. The Portuguese manager insisted this week that the youngster remains integral to his vision for the club, even branding him the \"future of Manchester United\".",
      "But former Premier League striker Dean Saunders believes the hype around Mainoo has spiralled beyond what he's actually achieved, whilst questioning whether Amorim truly means what he says.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, the ex-Wolves and Wrexham boss said: \"I've never known a player get so much airtime and so much press without kicking a ball. He's in the back pages of the paper every day. Mainoo this, Mainoo that and he hasn't started since Grimsby away in the cup when they got knocked out.",
      "\"They were horrendous against Grimsby and I think sometimes, as a manager, you watch that game and you think, 'that's it, he's never playing again. He [Amorim] has played Fernandes in that role with Casimero and he [Mainoo] has not got the chance to play.",
      "\"It won't go on forever, because he's played for England and he's shown his potential. He scored a couple of good goals, but I don't think he does know that position. He [Amorim] has just gone, 'I've had enough of this every day. Mainoo this, Mainoo that. I'll put it to bed by just saying he's not going anywhere.'\".",
      "The harsh assessment stands in stark contrast to Amorim's public support, after the United manager dismissed any talk of a January departure.",
      "He said: \"He's going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling. He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions; he can do that [defensive midfield] position, he can play if we play with three, he can play like we play in the last game - the position of Mason Mount in this game [against Villa].\"",
      "Amorim subsequently dismissed speculation about Mainoo departing Old Trafford next month, saying: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",
      "However, despite being recently sidelined with a calf injury, there are ongoing queries about why Mainoo hasn't been able to secure a spot in Amorim's starting line-up. Saunders suggests that a short-term loan move overseas could be beneficial for the midfielder, identifying Italy as an ideal place for development.",
      "He added: \"He's shown potential, but this is Man United we're talking about. They're trying to win everything they enter. They're a massive club and in that number six position, you have to smell danger from all angles.",
      "\"I think, for a young lad to learn that, it's difficult unless he's playing every week. I think you're doing good if you go to Napoli or somewhere like that, one of these Italian teams.\"",

      "Ex-Premier League referee Keith Hackett has backed Anthony Taylor's decision not to award Newcastle a penalty for a handball by Manchester United captain Lisandro Martinez.",
      "During the match on Boxing Day, a shot from Fabian Schar hit the stand-in United captain inside the six-yard box. Despite Martinez's claims to referee Taylor, that the ball had struck him in the stomach, replays suggested his arm had made contact with the ball.",
      "Video assistant referee Stuart Attwell reviewed that incident, but decided against any further action. Hackett, who previously served as the general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has now given his verdict on the contentious decision.",
      "Speaking to Football Insider, Hackett said: \"The referee has to judge if the action by the player is deliberate when deciding that an offence has taken place, not every time the ball comes into contact, is it an offence. There is sufficient doubt in this action not to award a penalty kick.\"",
      "\"Schar hits it, his arm is up above his head, and it's stretched. Is it because he's pushing [Malick] Thiaw?",
      "\"That might just save him. He's actually wrestling with the other Newcastle centre-back; his arms are already there.",
      "\"If Thiaw is nowhere near him, then that's definitely a penalty. I think the fact that he has just had a wrestle with the other centre-back might just save him.\"",
      "Neville also revealed what the VAR officials made of the controversial moment. The pundit added: \"He's saying the context is because there's another situation whereby he's fighting with another player, and his arm's are already up there and he's just not got back down.\"",
      "Main commentator Peter Drury explained: \"They are calling it mutual contact between Martinez and Thiaw. And that's essentially the explanation for the fact that there won't be a penalty.\"",
      "Following United's triumph, head coach Ruben Amorim heaped praise on Martinez. He said: \"I think he's a guy with a lot of character. He's really good on the ball, and that came with the quality that he has.",
      "\"He played [in the] World Cup, he won [the] World Cup. He's used to that stress, and he showed today that he's a top player, and sometimes people talk about the way he defends the box because he's a small guy, but today he did really well against a team that just has tall players.\"",
      "Yet when he was in turn pressed on whether the squad would be stronger with Martinez maintaining his fitness, Amorim declined to single out individuals. He responded: \"No, I don't want to say that because - if we don't have more points - it's because of the team, not because of a specific player.\"",

      "Much has changed in the 12 months since Marcus Rashford first signalled that he wanted to move on from Manchester United. The 28-year-old is currently experiencing something of a career revival with Barcelona, but his outlook once appeared far less encouraging after a breakdown in his relationship with United head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Following 18 months of poor form and with Amorim determined to shape his team around a strong, central No. 9, Rashford found himself at a crossroads. Despite being born and raised in Manchester, Rashford had carried ambitions that stretched beyond Old Trafford.",
      "Barcelona was always his dream move abroad. However, getting to the Camp Nou was never going to come easily and demanded both patience and resilience.",
      "When the January transfer window opened, talks with the Catalan giants took place, but a deal was never reached. Instead, Rashford sealed a loan switch to Aston Villa on deadline day, viewing it as a chance to rebuild his damaged standing.",
      "He managed just four goals in 17 games at Villa Park, yet his overall contribution in the West Midlands proved sufficient to reignite Barcelona's interest later that summer. \"I just believe that things happen when they're supposed to happen,\" Rashford told ESPN in October.",
      "\"It's not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn't happen in the past and now is my opportunity to make it happen. I feel like there's no time like the present now. So I just take things day to day.",
      "\"The key thing for me is just to continue to improve because when you retire, you're going to miss everything - the good stuff, the bad stuff - you're going to miss it about the sport. Every day I just take it day by day and just try to improve from the day before.\"",
      "Those comments underline Rashford's mindset - an aspect of his career that was often examined closely during his spell at United. The England forward frequently faced criticism for his conduct on and off the field, but a renewed sense of purpose and a quieter dedication to his work appear to have transformed perceptions and produced clear results.",
      "\"I was clear on my preference from the beginning,\" Rashford explained after completing his move to Barcelona in July. \"It didn't work out in January so I went to Aston Villa and enjoyed a good period there. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to play there.",
      "\"The summer came around very quickly, it was time to make another decision. My choice was easy.\"",
      "Life at Barcelona has suited Rashford well so far. He has established himself as a near constant presence in Hansi Flick's line-up, sitting out just one of Barcelona's 25 fixtures across all competitions to date.",
      "Statistics back up his importance. Rashford has delivered nine goals and 11 assists, with his influence especially evident in the Champions League, where he has been directly involved in seven goals in six matches.",
      "That resurgence has also helped him reclaim a regular role with England. As Barcelona are widely expected to make his loan deal permanent next year, Rashford's call to leave last January - no matter where he landed - looks increasingly astute.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Patrick Dorgu will have to be on his best behaviour against Wolves next week if he wants to avoid a suspension. The full-back, who scored the winner in the 1-0 clash with Newcastle United on Boxing Day, is currently walking a tightrope.",
      "The 21-year-old has totted-up four yellow cards this season after 18 games. Collecting five before reaching the 19-match threshold of a campaign triggers an automatic one-match ban for any Premier League player.",
      "This means Dorgu - and his manager for that matter - face a tense 90 minutes against Wolves in their next fixture, with three teammates unavailable due to the Africa Cup Of Nations and Bruno Fernandes amongst those still side-lined through injury.",
      "After being dropped and openly criticised by Ruben Amorim just a few weeks earlier, Dorgu has forced his way back into their starting XI with an assist (vs Aston Villa) and goal (vs Newcastle), helping United feel significantly more secure despite their depleted squad.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim said during a press conference when asked about what Dorgu needs to work on, adding: \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety.\"",
      "After that press conference, Dorgu was dropped from the United starting line-up. He was subsequently named among the substitutes for the following five fixtures, before then being brought back into the fold against Villa.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the final whistle against Newcastle, Dorgu addressed how he's handled recent criticism. He said: \"Of course, it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player.",
      "\"And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "He added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence a few weeks ago. I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up.\"",
      "Now perhaps a guaranteed starter for the Wolves clash on December 30, Dorgu has carved out a fresh role in the revamped line-up. But one mistake against the bottom-placed team will see the Denmark international suspended for a crucial trip to Leeds United.",
      "Amorim will be desperate to have the ex-Lecce man available for the journey to Elland Road. A few weeks back, however, he might not have anticipated relying on him so heavily.",
      "Brought back into the fold out of necessity due to three teammates being away at AFCON, Dorgu has, on initial evidence, seized his opportunity. The last thing he'll want now is to lose his grip on the starting place and hand a similar chance to another squad member under Amorim.",
      "Dorgu arrived at the club courtesy of Amorim during last season's January transfer window, with United paying £30million for his services. In his time wearing United's colours, the wing-back has racked up 38 appearances.",
      "His strike against Newcastle marked his maiden goal for the club, complementing his three assists along the way. Dorgu, who has earned 12 senior caps for Denmark, is also tied to Old Trafford until 2030.",

      "Ayden Heaven was showered with praise after earning the man of the match award in Manchester United’s backs-to-the-wall win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. Heaven is just 19 years old and was making just his 13th appearance for the club in a new position, but shone at Old Trafford.",
      "United were without Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt for the game, while Mason Mount also went off injured. Meanwhile, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, forcing Ruben Amorim to adapt.",
      "The home side took the lead through Patrick Dorgu’s stunning volley from a Diogo Dalot long throw-in and then managed to weather the storm of Newcastle pressure. Key to their victory was the performance of Heaven, who slotted in at right centre-back, despite being left-footed.",
      "Amorim has been stubborn in his use of a 3-4-2-1 formation since becoming United boss, but did adapt against Newcastle, with a rare back four often resembling a back six in the latter stages of the match. It helped United keep just their second clean sheet of the season and their first since a 2-0 win over Sunderland on October 4.",
      "Former United defender Gary Neville added: “Manchester United hung in there. Heaven was absolutely brilliant. Those Newcastle players… four or five of them collapsed to the ground at the end. Heaven has been the man of the match.”",
      "“This guy (Dorgu) here helped us get there, so thankful to everyone that helped us. It was different, I was playing on the right side, obviously my weaker foot. The manager, we play loads of formations with him, whatever he does we know it’s going to work, you saw today. I’m so proud of the team.”",
      "Amorim praised his players for toughing out the win despite seeing little of the ball and was particularly happy with his young defender. “I'm really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he’s improving every game,” he said. “He's young, but you don't feel that he has a good game and then he slows the game or the thinking during the game.",
      "“No, you feel that he’s improving during the game. I think he was not playing, but he trained really well. You just need to train really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. So, in this moment, if you continue to play like that, it's going to be really hard to take his place.”",

      "It's been a tough year for Manchester United fans. The Red Devils finished 15th - their worst position in Premier League history - lost a European final and failed to win a domestic trophy.",
      "Ruben Amorim's credentials are still being questioned on a weekly basis, and on paper, many would argue that he's in charge of the weakest United squad of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. That's despite another injection of £215million over the summer.",
      "One player who's still shining, however, is Bruno Fernandes. That is until he got injured.",
      "Red Devils captain Fernandes went off at half-time with a hamstring problem during last Sunday's toothless 2-1 loss away to Aston Villa. His absence was immediately felt, as United showed little goal threat.",
      "It was the same during their Boxing Day victory over Newcastle. Although Patrick Dorgu's strike gave them a 1-0 home win, Newcastle fired off six more shots and had treble the amount of touches in the opposition box.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt came third with 36 votes while Casemiro earned 28. In fifth place, Harry Maguire got 19 - likely thanks to that special moment at Anfield.",
      "The gulf between Fernandes and his team-mates is undeniable and Amorim must find a solution when he's missing. That's not just for this season either, as the 31-year-old has left the door open to a departure from Old Trafford next summer.",
      "As for when he'll return from his injury, Amorim said earlier this week: \"I don't want to say. I have an idea but let's see.\"",
      "The United boss even told his players that Fernandes was 'impossible to replace'. \"I said that this morning to the team,\" Amorim revealed. \"We need to take the good thing - if there is a good thing on that - that a lot of people need to step up and understand we cannot rely on one player for everything.",
      "\"Sometimes we rely on Bruno for organisation and the creation. We have lost Bruno on set-pieces, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad on set-pieces, so this is massive for the team. But it is an opportunity for other players to step up and show the leadership that we need in the team.\"",

      "When Patrick Dorgu was racing around the Old Trafford pitch on Boxing Day, demanding the ball at every opportunity and determined to be involved in the game as often as possible, he didn't look like the player Ruben Amorim had been talking about four weeks earlier.",
      "At the end of November, Amorim discussed the pressure on Dorgu to perform and how it can consume young players at Manchester United. He is only 21 and yet to hit 40 appearances for the club, but doubts were beginning to form around the £25million January signing.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim said back then. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton.",
      "\"That was easier than the decision he had to make [playing for Denmark] against Scotland. He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here it is different, and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Sources close to the player insist he hadn't been flustered by Amorim's comments, retaining a sense of confidence that he had what it takes to succeed at United. His self-belief had grown from the January window last year, not just from signing for United, but also from being wanted by several clubs, with Antonio Conte also keen to sign him for eventual Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "He has done extra training since being left out of the team following that defeat to Everton and feels that put him in a position to hit the ground running when his opportunity came around again.",
      "On Boxing Day, Dorgu's tally of 58 touches in the game was second only to Manuel Ugarte's 63 for United and you could visibly sense his confidence growing after his stunning strike had given Amorim's team the lead.",
      "He joked that he didn't know he could do that after the match, and as he watched the ball fall from the sky on the edge of the area, it would have been easy for him to think back to some wayward shots earlier in his United career. He had tried 30 shots without scoring, but it proved to be worth the wait.",
      "It was interesting to listen to Amorim discuss Dorgu after the game and explain how his position as a right winger might have helped to free him up and ease the defensive nerves.",
      "\"Maybe the game today with a lot of transitions is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball,\" said Amorim. \"He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "There is plenty of sense in that, although it wasn't a one-off for Dorgu. Returning to the team as a left wing-back against Aston Villa, he produced one of his best displays in that position as well. His reading of the game and tenacity set up Matheus Cunha's goal, and delivered an excellent cross, which created another big chance for the Brazilian.",
      "When he joined from Lecce in January, director of football Jason Wilcox talked up Dorgu's versatility and he can play on either flank, but if Amorim sticks with a 4-3-3 for now, then he could make the right-wing spot his own for a few weeks, with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Maybe a run of games there, freed up of some responsibility, will help the Dane settle into life a little more at Old Trafford. He deserves credit for fighting back in the last two games after Amorim's November comments and now has the chance to really kickstart his United career.",

      "There were plaudits aplenty for Manchester United players on Boxing Day, particularly the defenders who had managed to dig in and preserve a backs-to-the-wall clean sheet that secured a 1-0 win against Newcastle. It was a win that temporarily moved them up to fifth and showed a different side to their game.",
      "United had just 24% possession in the second half and had to do plenty of defending, with Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez excellent. However, throughout the siege, there was a sense of calm that isn't always associated with Ruben Amorim's side, particularly when under pressure.",
      "The return of Martinez might have helped in that regard, but 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens has also had an impact, even if his statistics aren't yet making that clear after his £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp. This was just Lammens' second clean sheet in 12 games.",
      "His celebrations at the end showed he was desperate to get the shut-out and although he didn't have to make any outstanding saves, he was secure in goal. There was one excellent claim under a high ball in injury time that relieved the pressure and earned him a pat on the back from teammates.",
      "It was hard to imagine United defending with the poise they did had a different goalkeeper been behind the defence. Andre Onana's form fell apart at Old Trafford and his inconsistency too often spread panic and uncertainty to his teammates. Altay Bayindir has had his moments, but has shown vulnerabilities under the high ball.",
      "Lammens is still learning as a goalkeeper and has just 106 senior appearances to his name, with only 55 of those in Belgium's Pro League before his move to United. It was a signing based on potential, but he has faced little competition in goal, and the improvement when he plays is clearer in the way his teammates have reacted to him than in the saves he has made.",
      "That is something one of United's greatest ever goalkeepers has noticed. Speaking before the Newcastle game, Peter Schmeichel was full of praise for Lammens.",
      "\"He's only 23 years old, he's come in and there's calm at the back four, there's not this chaos where they don't want to pass him the ball back to him. They trust him. He seems a very, very confident young man,\" Schmeichel told Viaplay.",
      "\"And also, one more thing I like about him is he is so quick in turning the game. So when he gets the ball, he's not afraid of kicking the ball up the other end or throwing the ball up. Starting a counter-attack very quickly.",
      "\"I don't think he pays too much attention to the results of the goals he conceded. I think he's living a dream and everyday he comes in and he wants to learn and he wants to improve and I think he's done really well.\"",
      "That calmness was a trait noted by Boxing Day matchwinner Patrick Dorgu. “I think he helped with his calmness,\" he said. “He’s very calm and he’s talking a lot to the defenders and helping everyone on the pitch with his communication.",
      "“He’s just calm and he tries to take responsibility to help us defenders as well. He came in well and he’s doing really well, so he just needs to keep going.”",
      "Lammens is yet to make an error leading to a goal this season and, as Schmeichel touched on, he is happy to go long with his kicking when required. The sound of Old Trafford getting agitated as United try and fail to play out from the back has gone, with their new No.1 better at picking his moments to go short.",
      "It hasn't been a faultless start, and Lammens would have expected to do better with a couple of Bournemouth's goals in the 4-4 draw at Old Trafford earlier this month, but he is still inexperienced for the role he is now fulfilling and there has been plenty more in the positive column in his first few months at the club.",

      "Hello and welcome to the live Manchester United blog on Monday, December 29.",
      "In less than 72 hours, the January transfer window will open which will allows clubs to both strengthen and trim their squads for the second half of the season.",
      "Antoine Semenyo looked set to be a trending topic throughout the winter trading period with United among those linked. However, he looks to have already made a decision on his future with Manchester City emerging as his preference.",
      "Instead, United may look to add some needed depth to their midfield, especially with Bruno Fernandes out injured. Brighton's Carlos Baleba has been linked and United were handed a surprise boost over the weekend regarding his potential availability.",
      "AZ Alkmaar star Kees Smit is the latest midfielder to be linked with an Old Trafford switch, though several teams are interested. Elsewhere, a final Barcelona decision on Marcus Rashford looms as his positive loan spell continues.",
      "With all of that being said, stay right here for all of the latest news and rumours throughout the day.",
      "Manchester United have been issued with a clear transfer timeline for Kees Smit amid interest from across Europe.",
      "Real Madrid and Chelsea have been linked while Newcastle United have been keeping tabs on his situation.",
      "According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, the 19-year-old AZ Alkmaar star is 'one to watch' for next summer's transfer window with a deal likely to cost between €40m-€45m (£34.8m-£39.2m).",
      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has shared his thoughts on the Lisandro Martinez handball incident from Manchester United's win over Newcastle.",
      "The central defender inadvertently blocked a Fabian Schar effort with his arm in the penalty area, though no spot-kick was awarded despite some huge appeals.",
      "Jay Bothroyd did not agree though and stated: \"I don't think that's conclusive. The terminology confused me, they didn't even say it touched his chest.\"",
      "\"I don't even know what 'mutual contact' means. Martinez is grappling. It looks like he's tried to push the defender away, his hands are there and that's an unnatural position.",
      "\"But if they said it hits his body and then his arms, we don't have this conversation now. The terminology is confusing for me. They're digging themselves a hole.\"",
      "While it seems more likely than ever that United will be about to miss out on Semenyo, it is not necessarily unexpected. The Bournemouth man is in demand from across the Premier League and the Reds still have work to do to be a team which can attract the top players ahead of the likes of City, Liverpool, Arsenal etc. While that's not what United fans want to hear, they at least can be thankful Dorgu has rediscovered his form.",
      "The representatives of Antoine Semenyo are expected to be in Manchester today!",
      "Unfortunately, a move to Manchester City remains the likely outcome and is exactly that is what will be discussed.",

      "Much has been made of Ruben Amorim's view of the Manchester United academy in recent days. It was only earlier this month when the United boss was having to defend his selection and reasoning behind overlooking the potential of youth.",
      "That changed at Old Trafford on Boxing Day night with United naming five academy graduates on the bench and bringing two of them one. Tyler Fredricson was given the final few minutes as the Reds saw out a 1-0 victory while Jack Fletcher played the second half in place of the injured Mason Mount.",
      "It was a show of faith from Amorim in Fletcher given the manager could have called upon Joshua Zirkzee to fill the second striker role. But the Dutchman was introduced off the bench, just as he had been at Villa Park a few days prior.",
      "United had impressed in the first half with Patrick Dorgu's fine goal the difference at the interval but the Reds were forced to defend deep in the second period to see out the contest, meaning Fletcher didn't get on the ball as much as he would have liked. But after adjusting to the pace of the contest, the 18-year-old didn't look out of place in senior football.",
      "“I think it might take a while to adjust to the tempo and intensity,\" said Fletcher after the game. \"It was really tough out there, heavy on the legs, 45 minutes of defending, I think we did well. Hopefully, I can showcase my talent more.”",
      "His showing will provide food for thought for United, who will be looking to strengthen their midfield given the likely departure of Casemiro at the end of the season. There are question marks over Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future while Manuel Ugarte has struggled to make his mark since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher, son of former United man Darren, has a bright future ahead of him and is likely to gain more minutes over the coming weeks. He might not be ready for the rough and tumble of top flight football every week just yet, but the experiences over the next few months could mean he's ready sooner rather than later. Amorim has made a point of not promoting academy talents the sake of it, so when one does come into the fray it's all the more impressive.",
      "\"Jack did a very good job,\" said Amorim of Fletcher. \"It's a very important moment for any kid. He's going to hear from his father. He's going to talk a lot about a lot of things, but he needs to calm down and just praise the kid because he's really humble, works really hard, and he deserves this.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim would have been under no illusions as to the challenges facing him when he took on a job the size of Manchester United just over a year ago. But he was perhaps not ready for the constant headaches he would have to deal with. The nature of United means there are very few quiet days.",
      "At the moment, he is currently juggling several issues. An injury crisis is plaguing his team with absentees across the defence and midfield stretching the squad to the maximum. Speculation surrounding the future of Kobbie Mainoo continues to rattle on as does talk of Bruno Fernandes leaving.",
      "This is on top of the everyday challenges of pushing this club back to the heights they once reached. But one topic which has gone under the radar in the past couple of weeks is the contract situations of Casemiro and Harry Maguire.",
      "Both men will be free agents at the end of this season, as things stand. The Brazilian has a clause in his contract which United can utilise to extend his stay in Manchester but Maguire will need to agree to a new deal if he is to stay beyond 2026.",
      "Maguire and Casemiro can both negotiate with overseas clubs freely from the start of January as they enter the final six months of their current deals. In his pre-Newcastle press conference on Christmas Eve, Amorim was asked by MEN Sport if any further talks had taken place with the duo over their Old Trafford deals.",
      "\"No, there is no decision, we have a lot to do,\" Amorim responded. \"We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season because we need to understand there are European games, and what we are doing.",
      "\"So we have so much to do at this moment. We are not thinking about that. We will think just think about the next game.\"",
      "He added: \"I'm really happy with them, but I don't know what is going to happen, so we will see what will happen until the end of the season, what position we will be, and then we will see.\"",
      "Whether more is going on behind the scenes than we know remains to be seen, but at least in the case of Maguire, the decision could be being made easier by Ayden Heaven.",
      "The Arsenal academy graduate traded the Emirates Stadium for Old Trafford last January. A matter of weeks prior to that switch he made his first-team debut for the Gunners against Preston North End in the Carabao Cup but it was clear this would be the exception, rather than the rule.",
      "Gabriel and William Saliba are Mikel Arteta's first choices when fit, regardless of who is coming through the academy. Clearly, Heaven felt chances would be easier to come by in Manchester and so it has proved.",
      "In the first half of the year, he was called upon four times in the Premier League. An injury picked up against Leicester City scuppered his momentum and it was obvious this season would be a big one for him.",
      "When he was initially brought in to cover injuries, he underwhelmed which was to be expected given he is still only 19 and he had not played much football since the injury at the King Power Stadium.",
      "But in recent weeks, with Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt out, Heaven has impressed. Against Aston Villa he shone in the centre of the back three and again on Boxing Day, he showed maturity above his years.",
      "The Englishman is starting to look fully at home in the defensive line and his form is beginning to alleviate the pressure surrounding Maguire. Amorim will be the first to say Maguire is more than just a competent defender, he is part of the leadership group and this cannot be understated.",
      "However, Heaven is showing on the pitch he is capable of performing to the required level, even though he is still a teenager. He is a realistic successor to Maguire.",

      "Except this season has been a little different, thanks to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Pictures of a dejected Robbie Savage and a furious Danny Mills have been thrown out a little more readily in recent months, with fans debating whether Rob Edwards' Wolves side genuinely could somehow go one 'better' and record a lower points total than Derby managed back in 2007/08.",

      "United are never too far away from the headlines and pundits and rival fans alike need no encouragement to enjoy a laugh at United's expense, yet failure to beat Wolves on Tuesday would merit such treatment. No matter how much optimism fills the Old Trafford air it always feels like United are only ever a couple of games away from a crisis - they're potentially 90 minutes away from one given how dire Wolves have been this season.",
      "When the two sides met at Molineux three weeks ago the home side threatened to make a contest of the game at one point, drawing themselves level on the stroke of half-time. But United stepped it up a gear in the second half and ensured they condemned Wolves to an eighth straight Premier League defeat - that run has since stretched to 11.",
      "A win for United on Tuesday would see them make it back-to-back Premier League wins following the uplifting victory over Newcastle on Boxing Day. A string of three consecutive wins in October 2025 was the only other time United have managed to follow a victory with another three points in the Premier League during the Ruben Amorim era, 14 months on from his appointment.",
      "They could not have asked for a better opportunity to record successive league wins, but making light work of supposedly favourable home contests hasn't been a forte of Amorim's side this season. Prior to the win over Newcastle, United's most recent Old Trafford outings had seen them throw away a late lead to draw 4-4 with Bournemouth - a team that have picked up just four points in the last two months - while they drew with a struggling West Ham side after losing 1-0 to 10-man Everton.",

The central defender inadvertently blocked a Fabian Schar effort with his arm in the penalty area, though no spot-kick was awarded despite some huge appeals.",
      "United had spent much of the second half defending deeply after Patrick Dorgu's stunning volley put them in front. Ruben Amorim's side ultimately held on for a crucial three points, though things could have been very different had the Magpies been awarded a penalty.",
      "Jay Bothroyd did not agree though and stated: \"I don't think that's conclusive. The terminology confused me, they didn't even say it touched his chest.\"",

      "The incident was checked by Stuart Atwell on VAR, but it was deemed to not be a clear and obvious error. On Co-commentary, Gary Neville described the controversial moment in detail and came to the same conclusion.",
      "\"There is a massive shout, he said. \"Schar hits it, his arm is up above his head, and it's stretched. Is it because he's pushing [Malick] Thiaw?",
      "\"That might just save him. He's actually wrestling with the other Newcastle centre-back; his arms are already there.",
      "\"If Thiaw is nowhere near him, that's definitely a penalty. I think the fact that he has just had a wrestle with the other centre-back might just save him.\"",

      "If United's plan before Fernandes' injury was to test Brighton's resolve on Carlos Baleba or turn their attention to cheaper alternatives, it will now be altered. The absence of their talisman, even if it's just for a month, means a new midfielder will have to be acquired regardless.",
      "Amorim has also stated that any exits will have to be replaced, meaning Mainoo's possible loan move could open the door for another incoming player. And when news from Saudi Arabia emerges that Ruben Neves wasn't interested in extending his contract at Al-Hilal, everything points towards the ex-Wolves man being a dream January signing.",
      "After being heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford during his Wolves days, Neves left England for Saudi Arabia in 2023. Now, it's understood that Al-Hilal are hoping to receive a transfer fee in January instead of losing him in the summer for nothing.",
      "A fee of £15million has been touted, and that would be splendid business for United. At 28, the midfielder is a regular in the Portugal national team, capable of playing as a holding midfielder and playmaker and would be the dream partner to Fernandes.",
      "Data collected by transfermarkt claims that the pair have played together 62 times for Portugal. Dating back to their time together with the Under-21s, the pair are now regulars for the senior team and a move would significantly improve United's midfield.",
      "According to the reporter Fabrizio Romano, Neves still has no intentions of signing a new deal with Al-Hilal and 'several' European top clubs have made approaches over a January move. It hasn't been confirmed whether United are among those clubs, but their previous interest and current situation make them a strong candidate to be one of them.",

      "Kai Rooney says he hopes to be playing on the biggest stage with the best players and winning trophies five years from now.",
      "Rooney, 16, was asked on Instagram by The Talent Hunter where he hopes to be in five years. He replied: \"Playing on the biggest stage amongst the best players, winning trophies.",
      "The forward began playing for Manchester United's under-18s this season at the age of 15, a few months before his birthday in November. Rooney made his debut as a substitute during their 1-0 win against his father Wayne's boyhood club, Everton, at Finch Farm back in August.",
      "He then came off the bench in their next match and scored the fifth goal in a 5-0 win over Middlesbrough at Carrington. Rooney, however, sustained an injury during the opening weeks of this season and has only recently returned to the pitch for Darren Fletcher's team.",
      "The forward was back on the bench for United's Premier League Cup game against Birmingham City and scored their sixth goal in a 6-0 win. After that match, he posted a photo on Instagram with the caption: \"We back babyyyyyyy.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford liked the posted and commented with a football emoji. The likes of Chido Obi, Jack Fletcher, JJ Gabriel and Shea Lacey were also among his teammates who showed their support.",
      "Fletcher and Lacey both made the first-team bench at Old Trafford for their Boxing Day match against Newcastle United. The former replaced Mason Mount at half-time after debuting alongside Lacey during the defeat to Aston Villa before Christmas.",
      "Ruben Amorim spoke at length about the opportunities for academy players following United's win over Newcastle. He said: \"We have a squad and I try to choose the best players to play.",
      "\"I understand the history of the club. I want to be part of that.",
      "\"Sometimes, you just need to choose the best players to win. Today was the opposite of many games; we put players of the academy in because we had to do it, and they deserved it.\"",
      "Speaking specifically about Fletcher, the United head coach said: \"It's very important for any kid. He is going to hear from his father already.",
      "\"I know Darren is going to talk about a lot of things, but he needs to back up, calm down, and just praise the kid because he's really humble. He works really hard and deserves this.\"",
      "Kai hopes to hear similar things said about himself and Wayne in the years to come. His father spoke to the BBC about Kai while in Northern Ireland to watch him at SuperCupNI, an international youth football tournament formerly known as the Milk Cup.",
      "Rooney Snr said: \"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand-off approach. I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",

      "The January transfer window opens this week and Manchester United will be assessing all options to improve Ruben Amorim's team. Unlike this time last year, United are sitting high in the Premier League and aren't desperate for reinforcements on a big scale.",
      "Beating Newcastle United on Boxing Day and the subsequent results around them mean Ruben Amorim's men are sixth, level on points with Chelsea in fifth and just three behind Liverpool in the top four.",
      "On Tuesday, they welcome Wolves to Old Trafford, looking to keep their hunt for Champions League football alive. But before then, transfer talk is gathering pace quickly. Bruno Fernandes' injury means United are expected to make a move for a new midfielder next month.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is a wanted man, with a return to Italy heavily tipped. According to reports, AS Roma are keen to bring him back to Serie A, but face difficulty in tempting United with a move.",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport have claimed that the striker has held positive discussions with Roma. However, United are only expected to let him leave should they bring in a replacement. Step forward, Lassine Sinayoko.",
      "The Auxerre striker has caught the eye of football scouts with two goals in Mali's opening two AFCON games, and according to AfricaFoot, United have held discussions with his entourage over a potential move. His contract in France expires in the summer, meaning he could be available on a pre-contract or at a low price.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Sinayoko isn't a name that many would be familiar with. A striker in France, and not one of the big clubs, isn't going to be one fans would see coming, but if Zirkzee is to leave, signing a striker who will be willing to play behind Benjamin Sesko would be smart business.",
      "\"He has bagged six times in France this season, and his heroics for his country this month have put eyes on him. Zirkzee hasn't impressed massively under Amorim and with the World Cup around the corner, a move seems certain for him.\"",
      "Galatasaray are one of the teams paying close interest to Manuel Ugarte's situation at United. According to reports in Turkey, the Turkish giants are putting plans in place ahead of January with a move eyed.",
      "Despite interest from Lyon and Napoli, it is claimed that Galatasaray are set to send a package to United, which would see the midfielder join the club on loan for the remainder of the season before he moves permanently for €25million (£21.7m) in the summer.",
      "The report also adds that Ugarte's Uruguay teammates, Fernando Muslera and Lucas Torreira, could be key in making a move happen.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"United's priority in January has to be a midfielder, so allowing Ugarte to leave would mean they would have to replace him. And while the move from Galatasaray is only a loan, it would guarantee them a fee in the summer.",
      "\"There are different ways to look at this from United's point of view, and the best-case scenario for them is to bank the cash and prioritise their incomings. For example, they could use the money to sign Ruben Neves at the reported £15million fee he's available for.",
      "\"Better yet, the sale of Ugarte in the summer and removal of Casemiro's wages, should he depart on a free, could open up room in the kitty to spend big at the end of the season.\"",

      "Hojlund moved to italy on a season-long loan on deadline day after United opted to spend big on Benjamin Sesko. The deal includes an obligation for Napoli sign the Denmark international on a permanent deal if they qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Following the win in Cremona, Hojlund took to Instagram to post a message to his fans. Posing with the Serie A Man of the Match trophy, he wrote: \"Christmas came late this year.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Patrick Dorgu, Andre Onana and Ethan Wheatley were among the thousands who liked the striker's post within the first hour. Napoli boss Antonio Conte went on to praise his striker following the win, in comments that spoke volumes about the player's standing in his side: \"Hojlund is a player who, first of all, is very young, but above all, has a lot of room for improvement.",
      "\"He's becoming a dominant player in that position. He's very connected to the team. In my style of football, everyone knows that strikers have a very important and unique role.",
      "\"The road to success? Annibale said that there isn't a road, it has to be built. We are doing it despite the great difficulties.\" He added: \"We're celebrating a wonderful year where we achieved something extraordinary and unexpected.",
      "\"We crowned the Scudetto with the Super Cup, where we beat Milan and Bologna. It was a wonderful year, full of emotions. Napoli, when you win, makes you celebrate in a different way. We're up there in the league and we're trying to stay close to the top spots. This season, we're facing several challenges, and we're always facing them with courage.\"",
      "Hojlund form comes amid doubts about United's current attacking options. Sesko has managed just two goals since his move from RB Leipzig, and Joshua Zirkzee has been tipped to secure a return to Italy in January.",
      "However, Amorim has admitted that a move for any of his players next month will only be completed if they can bring in a replacement. \"It's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution,\" he said.",
      "\"We are a club with a big responsibility. We are dealing with all these issues and in [the media's] heads, in my head, in everybody's head, we need to win every game. It doesn't matter. There are no excuses.\"",

      "Manchester United defender Patrick Dorgu believes he has responded to Ruben Amorim's criticism with his recent performances. At the end of November, Amorim said he could feel \"anxiety\" from Dorgu when he picked up the ball, and suggested the Denmark international needed to perform better.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" said Amorim to a question about what Dorgu needs to improve. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety.\"",
      "Following that press conference, Dorgu lost his starting place. He was named on the bench for the next five matches, but he was recalled to the starting team against Aston Villa last weekend.",
      "The 21-year-old assisted Matheus Cunha for United's goal in the Midlands and delivered another improved performance against Newcastle, scoring in the first half with a brilliant volley to claim three points for United.",
      "Dorgu spoke to reporters following the full-time whistle and was asked how he dealt with the criticism. \"Of course it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player,\" he said. \"And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "He added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence a few weeks ago, so I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up.\"",
      "Dorgu sought advice from the leadership group in the dressing room, which includes Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire and Tom Heaton. \"My teammates help me as well,\" he added. I spoke to Bruno [Fernandes] and some of the leader group in my team. They just try to help me on a daily basis to grow in confidence in training and stuff. \"",
      "Dorgu continued: \"We have players at AFCON and injured players, so this is my chance to show I belong in this team, and I feel like I'm doing it in the last couple of games, so I just need to keep going and try to keep the manager happy.\"",
      "Dorgu played on the right, in a more prominent position, against Newcastle. \"I've done that in my old team as well, so it's nothing new to me. I'm just happy to score the goal,\" he said. \"I've been training to shoot more in the games and I think I hit it really well. I'm really happy that it went in. I knew already a few days ago [about playing on the right], so I just tried to remember how to play there.",

      "The January transfer window is just around the corner, and Manchester United are said to have a number of names that they hope to pursuit. However, there could also be outgoing stars who have failed to make a mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Following a 1-0 win over Newcastle United on Friday evening thanks to Patrick Dorgu's first-half strike, the Reds currently sit fifth in the Premier League standings A tally of eight wins, five draws and as many losses is what Ruben Amorim's men have to show for their efforts this season, as they look to push for European qualification.",
      "It's a polar opposite state of affairs from the club's 15th-place finish for 2024/25, but further investment may be required next month to ensure a strong end to the current campaign. With the market reopening in a matter of days now, the rumour mill has been churning with regards to both arrivals and departures.",
      "As per Gazzetta, Joshua Zirkzee has had a number of \"discussions and contacts\" with Roma management as of recent, particularly speaking with sporting director, Ricky Massara, and Giallorossi head coach, Gian Piero Gasperini. The publication claim that the Dutch forward has gone as far as \"promising\" himself to Roma by saying 'yes' to a move when the window opens, as it looks increasingly likely that he will make a grand return to Serie A in mid-January, when Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui return from AFCON.",
      "However, there is a crutch with regards to United agreeing a deal without finding a suitable replacement. While Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha have all seen the nod ahead of the 24-year-old, Zirkzee has been a valuable option with regards to depth, featuring in 10 Premier League matches this season.",
      "A loan deal with an obligation to buy looks the most likely scenario for Zirkzee come January, should Roma be happy to agree to a fee of around £35million to take the forward on permanently come season's end. With United seemingly looking to strengthen their engine room next month, it will be interesting to see which names crop up as a potential replacement for Zirkzee.",
      "The MEN says: On paper, a deal with Roma would be a fantastic move for all parties involved. Zirkzee set United back a reported £36.5m last summer when he joined from Bologna, but has failed to make much of a mark in the English top flight.",
      "At the time of writing, he has scored just eight goals from 61 appearances - a stark contrast to the 14 from 58 he managed with Bologna - and should Roma agree to a £35m obligation to buy, it will see the Reds recoup most of the money they paid for him last summer to spend elsewhere.",
      "United are among a wealth of clubs who are currently said to be keeping tabs on AZ prospect, Kees Smit. The 19-year-old midfielder has impressed in the Eredivisie, having broken through the youth academy last year.",
      "This season, the Dutch U21 has racked up two goals and two assists from 15 appearances, instrumental in his club's success as they sit sixth in the league standings. And as a result, a number of teams across the world have had their heads turned.",
      "It's no secret that the Reds are looking to strengthen their engine room in January, given Bruno Fernandes has dropped into a deeper role alongside an ageing Casemiro who sees his future with the club beyond 2025/26 cast into speculation.",
      "However, they will face stiff competition in securing his signature from the likes of Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Newcastle United and Real Madrid, to name a few. Furthermore, AZ are understood to hold a valuation of around £52m on the talent at present, which could prove risky considering he is fairly unproven.",
      "The MEN says: It's a major risk to fork out such a substantial sum on a rising prospect, especially given United's track record with regards to splurging on wonderkids as of recent. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are examples, with neither player truly living up to expectations at Old Trafford despite their reputation.",
      "Instead, the Reds may be better suited tailing a slightly older player with Premier League experience such as Elliot Anderson, considering the centre of the park is make or break in terms of team success.",

      "Manchester United won 1-0 against Newcastle in the Premier League on Boxing Day. United opened the scoring in the 24th minute through a brilliant Patrick Dorgu goal, which was the difference at the break. Newcastle started the second half as the better team and came close to equalising, hitting the crossbar, but United defended bravely to see out a victory, which means they move to fifth in the table. Here are the moments you might have missed....",
      "Amorim sprang a surprise with his system in the 4-4 draw against Bournemouth earlier this month and he tweaked his tactics again on Boxing Day, starting the match with a 4-2-3-1 shape.",
      "The biggest surprise was Dorgu's position, as he started practically on the right wing. The Newcastle analysts in the press box sounded and looked confused as they deliberated among themselves.",
      "Amorim has been wedded to the 3-4-3 formation for most of his tenure, but he is finally tweaking his approach depending on the opponent, which can only be a positive. The United boss has shown a willingness to change, and the reaction from Newcastle's analysts proves why it's worth being adaptable.",
      "Newcastle struggled to get to grips with the shape in the opening exchanges. They eventually adapted and warmed to the contest, but it's encouraging to see Amorim tweaking his tactics game by game.",
      "Amorim altered his system again when he made a double change in the second half. Then Newcastle's analysts were overheard questioning whether Dalot was the right-sided winger. Amorim famously said not even the Pope could persuade him to change his tactics, but that stance has softened.",
      "Dorgu had scored just 12 goals in his career before facing Newcastle, so it's likely his wonderful volley from the edge of the box to fire United into the lead was his finest strike so far.",
      "The Denmark international savoured every second of the celebrations, but he was hungry for more after the restart, demanding the ball from his teammates at every possible opportunity.",
      "Dorgu frantically waved his arms to receive the ball in the 27th minute before looping a shot over the bar. Just moments later, he wildy gestured at Luke Shaw to pass it to him from the opposite wing.",
      "It's funny what confidence can do to a player. Dorgu looked like a new signing and delivered the kind of performance that he must produce consistently to nail down a regular starting role.",
      "Matheus Cunha had an opportunity to extend United's advantage with 10 minutes remaining, but his shot was sent wide of the post at the Stretford End, to the relief of Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "Cunha was slumped on the turf and looked like he had nothing else in the tank. The forward had worked tirelessly throughout the game, and he took his time to get back to his feet.",
      "There were suggestions that Cunha's work rate could be an issue before his arrival from Wolves in the summer transfer window. Some pundits suggested he would not provide adequate defensive cover. Cunha has made that look stupid in just a few months in Manchester - he runs his socks off each game.",
      "Dorgu didn't just contribute in the final third against Newcastle, he worked back and provided defensive cover, which saw him make one of the tackles of the game on Lewis Hall.",
      "It was a brilliant challenge, which provoked a roar from the Stretford End. Dorgu also received appreciation from his teammates. Diogo Dalot slapped his back, and Casemiro pushed him as if to say 'more of that'.",
      "The crowd lapped up Casemiro's interaction. The Brazilian received praise from Amorim during the pre-Newcastle press conference and it will be difficult to find a replacement with a similar mentality next summer, but logic dictates it's the right decision to allow Casemiro to leave after the expiry of his contract.",
      "United included brothers on the bench for the first time in 12 years against Newcastle, with Amorim naming Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher in the squad. Jack was handed his debut against Aston Villa, and he was joined by his twin brother, Tyler, who made his first Premier League matchday squad.",
      "Darren Fletcher, their father, looked proud as punch in the directors' box. It was a special moment to have both brothers in the squad, and the occasion became even sweeter when Jack came onto the pitch.",
      "Mason Mount was brought off at the interval - seemingly due to an injury - and Fletcher was introduced. His father was on his feet and applauding following the final whistle.",

Dorgu, who was a match-winner for United against Newcastle on Boxing Day, is walking a disciplinary tightrope amid his marked improvement.",
      "Dorgu, 21, has four yellow cards to his name this season. Picking up five before the 19-game mark of a term in turn results in a one-match suspension for any Premier League player.",
      "That means Dorgu - and his manager - have 90 anxious minutes to get through against Wolves next up with three teammates unavailable due to AFCON and Bruno Fernandes among those still injured. After being cast aside and publicly criticised by Amorim just a few weeks ago, Dorgu has returned to the line-up with an assist (vs Aston Villa) and goal (vs Newcastle) to help United feel a lot more comfortable without so many options.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" said Amorim when he was asked about what Dorgu needs to improve. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety.\"",

      "Dorgu spoke with reporters following the full-time whistle vs Newcastle and he was asked how he dealt with the criticism. \"Of course it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player,\" he said. \"And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "He added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence a few weeks ago. I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up.\"",
      "A sure-fire starter against Wolves (December 30), Dorgu has found a new place in the reshuffled line-up. However, one slip up against the rock-bottom side will see the Denmark man banned for the next Premier League after that, which just happens to be against Leeds.",
      "Amorim will want - and need - to have the former Lecce player available for that trip to Elland Road. He might not have thought that would be the case a few weeks ago.",
      "Recalled out of necessity due to AFCON selection for three others, Dorgu has - at first viewing - taken his chance. The last thing he will now want to do will relinquish his hold on the shirt and present a similar opportunity to other player in Amorim's squad.",
      "Dorgu was signed by Amorim during last season's January transfer window. He cost £30million.",
      "So far in United colours, the wing-back-turned-forward has totted-up 38 matches. The goal against Newcastle was his first for the club, while he also has three assists to show for his efforts.",
      "Dorgu has been capped 12 times by Denmark at senior level. He's under contract at Old Trafford until 2030.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Patrick Dorgu's superb volley midway through the first half proved to be the difference as Ruben Amorim's side secured a precious three points. The Reds were the better side in the first half but came under huge pressure in the second with a resolute rearguard action keeping the visitors out.",
      "Lewis Hall hit the bar for Newcastle, as did Benjamin Sesko for United while Diogo Dalot missed a glorious chance on the counter for the home side. Newcastle were far superior in the second period but lacked quality in the final third and United earned just a second clean sheet of the campaign and a first home win in two months.",
      "Catch up on the action and follow the reaction with us on the blog",
      "A few months ago, Ruben Amorim said even the Pope couldn't convince him to change his system at Manchester United, but on the second day of Christmas, he gave in to popular demand. If a back three is United's past, then could this back four be their future?",
      "Amorim had been teasing the idea of a change of shape in recent weeks and had worked on it in training, so the ghosts of Christmas hadn't visited him in his sleep and brought about an epiphany, yet however it came about, Old Trafford delighted in the reversion to a flat back four and the end of wing-backs.",
      "There is enough material from the past 13 months to give Amorim nightmares, but this change in formation delivered a change in fortunes as well. After six weeks of blowing chance after chance to go fifth in the Premier League, they finally took it. It might last for less than 24 hours, but it shows that this side is in the hunt for a Champions League spot, even if they spent almost the entire second half on the back foot.",
      "Read Tyrone Marshall's on the whistle analysis here",
      "United were pinned back for much of the second half and had to produce a defensive rearguard to hold on to the lead given them before the break.",
      "That goal came from an unlikely source. A half-cleared long throw fell invitingly for Patrick Dorgu, who hit a first-time left-foot volley into the bottom corner from 16 yards.",
      "That's the final whistle at Old Trafford.",
      "United are defending bravely in these final minutes.",
      "Malacia and Fredricson ON.",
      "Shaw and Martinez OFF.",
      "United are absorbing the Newcastle pressure and counter-attacking when they win the ball.",

      "Hall hits the crossbar from the edge of the box.",
      "Zirkzee and Yoro ON.",
      "Sesko and Casemiro OFF.",
      "United are sitting back in their shape and defending well against Newcastle's probing.",

      "Dorgu's goal is the difference at the break.",
      "Amorim will be delighted with this first half performance from United.",
      "Great ball from Murphy into the box but Woltemade is a yard too slow to meet it.",
      "Sesko can be pleased with his work so far. That was an excellent leap to win a header against Thiaw and start another United attack. He has looked more comfortable leading the line in this shape, as has players around him and is holding the ball up well.",
      "Dorgu is full of confidence and asking for the ball at every single opportunity.",
      "Amorim was just starting to get agitated on the touchline before that goal. United had been on the back foot for a good 10 minutes and were looking ragged. That came out of nowhere, but what a hit it was. Nobody will be anxious when Dorgu is on the ball again anytime soon.",
      "Dorgu has just scored a screamer from the edge of the box to fire United into the lead.",
      "That was an incredible technique to volley and find the bottom left corner.",
      "Newcastle just won a free-kick but that was a strange decision because Ugarte won the ball.",
      "After being caught by surprise due to the system, Newcastle have grown into this game.",
      "Newcastle came close to scoring through a Guimaraes header at a corner.",
      "The Newcastle analysts in the press box have been trying to work out new pressing patterns for United’s unexpected shape. There is a fair bit of shoulder shrugging going on. Nobody expected Dorgu to start on the right wing. Howe and Tindall have been deep in discussions as well, with messages passed on to players who were clearly expecting a more familiar United set-up.",
      "Newcastle's analysts in the press box sound and look confused by how United have lined up tonight.",
      "It was a hybrid back four/back three against Bournemouth but this looks like a back four. Dalot and Shaw the full-backs and Heaven and Martinez in the middle. Dorgu has started very high on the right and is up with Cunha and Sesko at times.",
      "Casemiro had a completely free header in the box but he's unable to get it on target.",
      "It looks like a back four tonight. Dorgu has started high on the right side, similar to where Amad played in the draw against Bournemouth. Amorim is tweaking his tactics due to missing key players."

Amorim has made two changes from Villa Park last weekend, dropping Leny Yoro to the bench in favour of starting Martinez, who is skipper in the absence of Bruno Fernandes. Casemiro also returns from suspension.",
      "\"We need to perform well. We need to be physical. They [Newcastle] need to feel uncomfortable. We need to be smart - we cannot lose the ball in our half when we are too exposed or open. We know what they want and we will try to do the opposite, but we also need to play with our strengths.\"",
      "When asked about Martinez wearing the armband, Amorim said: \"We made a list at the beginning of the season, Lisandro was on that list. He is going to wear the armband but everyone needs to step up because Bruno is not here.\"",
      "He added about the youthful bench: \"They are ready to help the team. We have a short squad to give the kids an opportunity. They are really proud to be here. If we need, they will be on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim was without multiple key players at Villa Park last weekend, but Newcastle have a dismal away record this season although they did win 2-0 at Old Trafford last December, in what was a miserable month for Amorim.

Mainoo has not started for United in the Premier League this season. The youngster was potentially in line to receive his first start against Aston Villa last weekend, but he picked up a calf injury in training and was ruled out of that match in Birmingham.",
      "The 20-year-old requested to leave on loan in the summer transfer window and could request to leave again in the January window when he returns from the sidelines. However, Bruno Fernandes picked up a muscle injury against Aston Villa and United's midfield options will be lighter during his absence.",
      "Amorim admitted the moving parts could mean a potential request to leave on loan from Mainoo would be rejected. \"If we are not getting someone [in], then we are shorter,\" he said.",
      "\"Even with a full squad, we are shorter when something can happen here. We are a club with a big responsibility, we are dealing with all these issues and in your head, my head, and everyone's heads, we need to win every game, it doesn't matter, there are no excuses, so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution [new signing].\"",
      "When asked whether Mainoo could kick on when he returns to fitness in the absence of Fernandes, Amorim said: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity that he has all the time.",
      "\"He played in different positions and we talk about the position of Casemiro - he can do that. He can play, if you play with three, like we did in the last game, the position of Mason Mount in this game, he can play there.",
      "\"He is going to be the future of Manchester United. That is my feeling, so he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football, even in two days.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Rashford has contributed six goals and eight assists in 23 matches in all competitions for the Catalan giants with the England international doing okay for Hansi Flick’s side.",
      "Man Utd are committed to selling Rashford, with transfer expert Fabrizio Romano claiming in mid-November that Barcelona will take their time over their decision over whether to take up their buy option.",
      "Romano said: “Marcus Rashford has a €30m buy option for Barcelona. Barca will not decide now in November. Barca will not decide in one month, in December. Barca will take their time.",
      "“They are very happy with Rashford. The numbers are very good. The attitude is very good. So Rashford is doing very well in Barcelona, but Barcelona will take their time.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Villa ‘genius’, ‘irrelevant’ Howe, Raya, Nuno sack, Man Utd and Liverpool",
      "“At the same time, for Barcelona or anywhere else, Rashford is expected to leave Manchester United on a permanent transfer in 2026. So Rashford is expected to go out, also Hojlund is expected to leave on a permanent transfer.”",
      "But now Spanish website Fichajes insists that the Catalan giants ‘will not exercise its €30 million option to buy Marcus Rashford, an amount they consider beyond their reach in the current economic climate’.",
      "It is understood that his impact on the pitch ‘have been valued internally’ but that Barcelona have ‘decided to end its relationship with Marcus Rashford and focus its efforts on a more sustainable alternative’ with Man City winger Savinho linked.",
      "Another story from the same publication claims that Rashford now has a ‘new destination’ with Atletico Madrid ‘prepared to pay’ the €30m that Man Utd want to complete his departure.",
      "With Rashford ‘keen to stay’ in Spain, a move to Atletico could be the perfect transfer, the report adds: ‘The Atlético de Madrid coaching staff highly value Marcus Rashford’s profile. His ability to attack space, his physique, and his experience in high-level matches fit perfectly with the demands of Simeone’s system.",
      "‘Furthermore, Atlético de Madrid believe that paying 30 million euros for a proven player is a reasonable investment and consistent with the club’s sporting ambitions.’",
      "By choosing Atletico Madrid, it ‘would allow him to compete for important objectives, play in European competitions and assume a relevant role in a stable and competitive project’.",
      "According to reports, one potential Manchester United signing in January is already ‘off’, while three players ‘could quit’ the Premier League giants.",
      "Barcelona have the option to sign the player for €30m and are reportedly becoming more keen to do so.",
      "Marcus Rashford could be in line for a big switch to Atletico Madrid, with the La Liga giants ready to go after him amid “significant doubts” at Barcelona.",
      "Marcus Rashford could reportedly return to Man Utd in the summer transfer window as Barcelona hit a ‘major problem’ over a potential permanent deal.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has suggested Spurs are “scraping around for players” amid links to Marcus Rashford, who he wouldn’t sign given a lack of loyalty.",
      "A very silly report has claimed that FC Barcelona have decided to include Marcus Rashford in a swap deal with La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid."

      "The Christmas fixtures delivered one particular theme which tied Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United together, with Eddie Howe and Nuno for the sack.",
      "There are also bountiful words for Aston Villa, Everton, David Raya and a great deal more.",
      "",
      "When the match-winning substitute can give a lucid and precise description of his manager’s “tactical genius” immediately after such a euphoric and ludicrous victory, it really does underline how ridiculous a job Unai Emery has done at Aston Villa.",
      "“He changed it,” Ollie Watkins said, “because Chelsea were going man for man but they had the extra centre-back when we were going long.",
      "“So when I came on second half he brought Sancho on the wing and Morgan [Rogers] and I think it gave us a little bit more space and then put Youri [Tielemans] in the No. 10 so we had an extra body up there.”",
      "It was the response to a simple enough soft ball of a post-match question – “what did the manager say to you when you were brought on, and what kind of impact did he want you to make?” – but it emphasised how deeply Emery has imprinted his thoughts, words and ideals on this squad.",
      "The most points from losing positions. The most goals scored by substitutes. And a longer winning streak than all but seven clubs have ever put together in Premier League history. All engineered by one of the biggest manager upgrades ever.",
      "",
      "Attack wins you games; defence wins you titles; goalkeepers do the rest and probably aren’t noticed until they drop anything resembling a clanger.",
      "Raya will know that from the criticism he faced after what remains the only game this season in which he has failed to save any of the shots he has faced.",
      "Those are the standards set and maintained by the keeper who has faced the fewest shots on target of any who have started more than one-third of their club’s Premier League games this season, but whose save percentage is the fourth-best in the division.",
      "Few have such a reduced margin for error and as unforgiving a role as the final barrier for such a defensively phenomenal side which rarely gives up chances. Raya’s mentality and focus in that sense is as important as his ability for Arsenal.",
      "And that save from Yankuba Minteh, his second and last of the game in that brief window during which his side otherwise lost control, underlined it: Raya needed elite reflexes, level of concentration and even speed of thought in choosing which hand to use to optimise his chances of keeping the ball out.",
      "The only thing processed quicker was the replay which was immediately added to his remarkably highlights package of equally impressive and important saves in the last few seasons.",
      "“The first shot that they had, they scored the goal and then David had to make another save to maintain the result,” said Arteta of a player who thrives in “the key moments” like few others.",
      "",
      "There is currently no better Premier League club at developing and platforming raw attacking talent.",
      "The three biggest sales in Brentford’s history were all of forwards they signed either specifically in the Championship or before they played their first game in the Premier League. For the £24.35m spent on Ivan Toney, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, they received 191 goals and £160m.",
      "But even after a third remodelling of their frontline in consecutive seasons, Brentford’s overhauled output continues to excel. The only club with two players in last season’s 10 top Premier League scorers sold both and can still match Manchester City with a pair of representatives in 2025/26’s top 14.",
      "Neither Kevin Schade nor Igor Thiago are perfect. The former is infuriatingly consistent, while the latter often makes the wrong decision in his final action. But their basic ingredients are tantalising, as was showcased as they summarily dismantled Bournemouth.",
      "The patience Brentford have shown with two club-record signings is being rewarded once more in the continuation of a cycle every bit as impressive as their ability to simply promote an assistant to become first-team manager every few years at no apparent cost to results.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim has often referred to restoring “the feeling of winning” as being something elevated beyond the actual art of victory itself over the past year.",
      "And for a club which has lost 21 of his 61 games, that is pertinent. It is a sensation many at Manchester United might find completely alien; Amorim himself said they were “just trying to survive” against Newcastle and needed “to feel that we can win sometimes without playing so well”.",
      "The Portuguese appears to have at least inherited the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag knack of absurdly elongating a reign by spacing his wins impeccably, like a nurse overseeing a deliberate deterioration in a patient’s health specifically to keep them on life support while explaining to their loved ones that there’s nothing they can do because the ludicrously expensive medication has to be administered in one needlessly exact, sub-optimal and inflexible way.",
      "Manchester United have not been beaten in consecutive games all season – in either the Premier League or all competitions – and have not lost from a winning position since May.",
      "Amorim, who managed separate losing streaks of two, three and four in his first six months, has already watched his Manchester United win more Premier League matches (eight to seven) and score as many goals (32) in 2025/26 than 2024/25 despite being in charge for nine fewer games this campaign.",
      "It doesn’t bear thinking what atrocities would have been inflicted on a defence of Dalot, Yoro, Fredricson, Heaven and Malacia behind a midfield of Cunha, Fletcher, Ugarte and Dorgu last season. But this version of the club, for all its myriad faults, has undoubted “spirit”.",
      "",
      "A third straight win. A fourth assist to sit nicely alongside Harry Wilson’s five goals in what is rapidly becoming a standout individual season. A current top-half spot for a club which had spent the entire campaign waiting for the graphic to switch to show those 11th and below.",
      "But most impressively: Raul Jimenez is 2025’s Eric Cantona. Everyone’s saying it.",
      "",
      "If the general theme of the festive schedule’s results was of teams either reinforcing or rediscovering how to win in any circumstance, it is one Liverpool followed so faithfully as to almost squander a two-goal lead against perhaps the worst team to ever grace the Premier League.",
      "The teams in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th all won their games on December 26 and 27 by a single goal; Liverpool should take solace in doing so against a side both Arsenal and Aston Villa have struggled to beat recently.",
      "Arne Slot was right when he marked out as “progress” that his players have learned “when things go against us, we still need to find a way to win the game”. It sounds simple but for over two months adversity almost automatically meant defeat for Liverpool.",
      "As Mikel Arteta said after Arsenal narrowly beat Brighton: “You win, you learn and you go again. The knock-on effect of winning is incredibly powerful.”",
      "It is something Liverpool are beginning to remember. The steps they have made have been tentative. Three straight wins and a seven-game unbeaten run shows growth while leaving ample room for improvement.",
      "",
      "Of course, the teams in 10th and 11th also won by the odd goal. It’s Fulham’s thing but Spurs are somewhat less experienced in that regard.",
      "Their only previous single-goal win came at Elland Road in early October. For their last 1-0 triumph in the Premier League, Spurs must go back to February.",
      "Thomas Frank made a point of praising their “resilience” and “mentality” – and it should be said that after having nine shots to 16 and 38% possession you only really can focus on the immeasurables.",
      "But the Premier League’s best away team can take pride at being able to grind things out like it’s a warm May evening in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "In 2022/23 it was Kevin de Bruyne (0.86 to 1.43).",
      "In 2023/24 it was De Bruyne again (1.03 to 1.13).",
      "Then in 2024/25 the De Bruyne hat-trick was completed (0.58 to 0.82).",
      "For three seasons the closest player to matching Erling Haaland’s rate of goals and assists per 90 minutes in the Premier League for Manchester City was De Bruyne. And the only time he came within touching distance was when the Belgian played fewer than half of Haaland’s minutes a couple of seasons ago.",
      "This might not be a rate Cherki can maintain – and he has similarly been given a fraction of Haaland’s minutes. But this is the strongest challenge the Norwegian has ever had from a Manchester City teammate (1.27 to 1.34) and Pep Guardiola must be loving it.",
      "",
      "The praise should and will, of course, go to Leeds, Daniel Farke and Dominic Calvert-Lewin for one of the more absurd months of form in Premier League history.",
      "But a special mention is warranted for Aaronson, a player whose complicated relationship with the fanbase and ties to an unloved past regime have made his personal renaissance even more stunning than that of his club, manager or teammate.",
      "The American’s run and pass for the equaliser against Sunderland marked his third assist in seven Premier League games, matching the tally from his first 46. His energy carried Leeds but it is quickly becoming allied with pivotal actions to produce a skillset close to irreplicable in a relegation battle:",
      "",
      "A literal quarter of the clean sheets Parker has overseen in his career as a Premier League manager have come against either David Moyes, Everton or David Moyes’ Everton.",
      "He also sounded the “fine margins” klaxon post match so everybody wins. Except usually Burnley.",
      "",
      "Only two teams in Europe’s top five leagues have drawn more matches: Celta Vigo and Pisa with eight to Sunderland’s seven.",
      "But more pertinently, Sunderland have been level for 64.3% of their Premier League games this season. The closest side to them is Crystal Palace (56.7%).",
      "Sunderland have spent less time leading in the Premier League this campaign than every team bar the bottom three they are 15 points clear of. Regis Le Bris has created a monster of a team.",
      "",
      "Therein lies the innate problem with Eddie Howe and Anthony Gordon’s belief that Newcastle could compartmentalise the insipid defeat to Sunderland and “make it right” a few days later in the Carabao Cup.",
      "The Magpies advanced against Fulham in the continued defence of a trophy very possibly keeping the manager in gainful employment, but there is little “right” about Newcastle currently.",
      "Drawing with Chelsea having led was frustrating; a second straight 1-0 defeat away at a bitter rival is lamentable. Their own mild selection problems notwithstanding, Newcastle should be ashamed at failing to breach one of the more vulnerable Manchester United sides Old Trafford has seen.",
      "But then Howe believes the specific stadium at which Newcastle flatter to deceive on any given matchday to be “irrelevant”. He wants to “look at the performances in isolation” and focus on “what the team’s identity is on that day and how it plays”, as if that would be in any way less damning.",
      "“If it’s home or away, for me, I don’t really care,” added a man who really ought to. The only club with a greater disparity between their home and away results is Brentford, who sit above Newcastle in the table despite being hypocritically bullied by them in the summer.",
      "Their pursuit and capture of Yoane Wissa is perhaps the last time the Magpies properly threw their weight around and asserted themselves; it certainly hasn’t been evident on the pitch.",
      "",
      "That striker-based epiphany was brief but beautiful, triggering the only two wins, localised entirely within the space of seven November days, of an increasingly hilariously doomed reign.",
      "It felt like West Ham would simply kick on at that stage, having vanquished Newcastle and Burnley to draw level on points with the latter and in the relegation zone on goal difference alone, with momentum heavily in their favour.",
      "The Hammers can boast a better record than only the Clarets and Wolves since then and have thus been marooned further in the mire: that five-point gap to Nottingham Forest resembles a chasm.",
      "And this is as sustained a slump for the manager as it is the team: in a table of Premier League results since February 1, when Forest apparently sacrificed their soul for a 7-0 thrashing of Brighton at the City Ground, a bottom four of ever-presents reads: Spurs, Nottingham Forest, Nuno Espirito Santo (32 points), West Ham and Wolves.",
      "It would be grounds for a sacking if the best conceivable replacement candidate hadn’t a) been sacked by West Ham before, b) contributed to a relegation in his last Premier League post more than five years ago and c) hadn’t literally already been rejected by the club a few months back.",
      "",
      "Given the “what a team” head pat by Pep Guardiola and the physical runaround at a decisive set piece. But ultimately it doesn’t feel like making two substitutions in an exhausting game with in-form Manchester City, the first of which was in the 88th minute, should really be the precursor to an entire weekend spent blaming the officials.",
      "Did Arnaud Kalimuendo – 82 Premier League minutes across eight appearances as a £25m summer signing, 17 minutes and three appearances of which were under Dyche – bring an oil-less lamb curry in for lunch after training or something?",
      "",
      "From one of the best teams at converting leads into victories last season, Chelsea have become the joint-worst in terms of wastefulness from winning positions.",
      "Those 13 points squandered would have put them second and in the title race. Instead, this is a Champions League qualification race Chelsea’s recent setbacks suggest they don’t have the stomach for.",
      "The watching world knew what was coming when they failed to press home their advantage at home to Aston Villa. It is worrying that Enzo Maresca either didn’t or simply could not adequately react to stem the tide.",
      "Even with the innate outcome bias of judging a manager’s substitutions, Villa scoring within four and one minute of Emery sending players on from the bench can only reflect miserably on the coach who responded with an ineffective triple change and by removing his best forward when chasing a goal.",
      "",
      "David Moyes “wouldn’t have wanted to come and watch that myself,” even if he did offer mitigation in the absences of Iliman Ndiaye, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish.",
      "Remove the three foremost attacking fulcrums from any team and their subsequent creative struggles would be expected.",
      "But this should not be mistaken as a slump related only to AFCON, injury and curiously timed Christmas illnesses. Everton have laboured in this department all season: Wolves and West Ham are the only sides with fewer goals and different individual scorers respectively.",
      "The 14 players Moyes used at Turf Moor had a combined 78 Premier League career goals, to which their 55-year-old centre-half pairing contributed more than a third. Dwight McNeil, who last scored in the competition in May, accounted for more than a quarter by himself.",
      "Everton’s highest shot taker in the Premier League this season, James Garner, has three goals in 103 games for the Toffees.",
      "It is almost like exclusively speculating to accumulate in attack by spending upwards of £100m on talented but undeveloped and unrefined players might not be the best idea.",
      "",
      "This is what you get for going beyond your station.",
      "",
      "The descent beyond mere Derby 2007/08 territory continues. Wolves are five defeats away from breaking the record for longest losing streak in a single Premier League season, having already set a new bar for longest winless start and myriad other miserable markers.",
      "There have been just enough narrow defeats – 1-0 to both Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest; 2-1 to both Arsenal and Liverpool – in recent weeks to sustain the illusion of progress, but Wolves have not done so much as lead a game in almost three entire months.",
      "Rob Edwards was brought in with more than one eye on a future in the Championship, yet it has to be considered whether this is doing irreparable damage to his reputation with the fanbase, players and board.",
      "While he ranks absurdly far down the list of individuals to be held accountable for this historic failure, this has already eroded Edwards’ goodwill, leeway, patience and momentum ahead of a summer in which more players will be sold and promotion will be the expectation.",
      "Seven straight defeats with barely a whimper was basically baked into his appointment, yet the longer this goes on – and every indication is that it will – the weaker the foundations Edwards ultimately actually comes to build on will be.",
      "",
      "Time to consult the ‘Has Fabian Hurzeler Literally Ever Won A Game Of Association Football As A Manager In December’ updater:",
      "No.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",
      "Burnley were only selected once more – on the February midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (24 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £20.2m in 2024/25",
      "2nd) Aston Villa (23 games) – worth around £19.3m",

      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",

      "Six wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now 12 wins in 13 Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and now genuine title contention. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they now somehow find themselves within two points of Arsenal despite not really playing convincingly well for quite some time now.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates.

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham, for instance – a bit annoying.",

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break.

It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs. Although losing an actual Premier League match to someone as ropey as Spurs was also quite careless.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the potential novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re definitely less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "And while Chelsea aren’t the first team to see apparent control of a game against Villa turn into a painful, perplexing defeat, they are perhaps the most profound example. And it was another that raised serious questions about the players and manager.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",
      "But instead, they haven’t kicked on at all. A home win over Burnley is their only success in five subsequent games, all of which were winnable. It’s emblematic of a season stubbornly refusing to get going and could yet prove costly for Howe.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool have at least showed a bit of something.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",

      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",

      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",

      "David Raya and Robert Sanchez are vying for the Golden Glove and Robin Roefs has prevented the most goals, but the algorithms make Pope the leading goalkeeper in the Premier League this season, retaining his place in absentia at least for now.",
      "",
      "There was no right-back in the PFA Team of the Year for 2024/25 season but Arsenal’s Jurrien Timber might be impossible to ignore this season. But the numbers put Munoz ahead so far…he claimed his third goal of the season in the 1-0 win at Burnley. He is quietly (well, not so quietly) showing Manchester United’s wing-backs how to do the job.",

      "At this stage of the season, there is a bias in favour of defenders with goal contributions, and Gabriel has one goal and two assists. But he is also the best centre-half in the Premier League bar none. The Gunners will have been very pleased indeed to see him come off the bench v Brighton.",

      "As for Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers; WhoScored rate him as the 37th best player in the Premier League this season. Why? His pass completion rate is poor, he contributes very little defensively and only one player in the whole top flight loses the ball more often from a poor touch.",

      "Manchester United’s midfield will look very different by the start of next season and this is how we think their rebuild will unfold via seven deals…",
      "To buck recent trends, the Red Devils have been lauded for their transfer business in recent months after a rare positive window in the summer.",
      "As evidenced by this damning list of signings, Man Utd have got plenty wrong in the days following Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, but INEOS steadied the ship with their work on incomings and exits in the summer.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s recruitment team did an admirable job of offloading most of their dead wood on their terms, with this business raising funds for signings in priority areas.",
      "Ruben Amorim‘s side largely focused on bolstering their attack in the summer, which is understandable given how toothless they were last term, by signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. They also fixed their goalkeeping department as Senne Lammens replaced one of last season’s many weak links, Andre Onana.",
      "United’s hit rate with these signings was unusually high for their standards, with Sesko currently the only one with dud potential.",
      "All of this has set Man Utd up for an increasingly credible challenge for Champions League qualification this season, but a midfield overhaul is next on INEOS’ to-do list as they look to realise their goal of winning the Premier League title by 2028.",
      "READ: Liverpool in ‘comedy week’ as £30m star ‘better’ than Wirtz as Arsenal ‘totally vilified’, Man Utd lauded",
      "Despite the impressive form of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro, central midfield has become a problem area for Man Utd as injuries and a lack of quality options have impacted Amorim’s side.",
      "Also, for various reasons, each of Man Utd’s four main midfield options are facing an uncertain future, and a recent report claimed Fernandes, Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte could leave as part of a ‘fire sale’ next year.",
      "So, what will happen with these four players and who will be brought in to replace those who move on?",
      "Well, starting in January, Man Utd’s activity is likely to be limited due to the winter market’s instability and their lack of funds.",
      "But Mainoo would be the one to leave if there are any exits at all due to his reported insistence on having more game time, though this is dependent on Man Utd replacing the England international in the same window.",
      "This prohibited Mainoo from securing a loan move elsewhere at the end of the summer’s window, but Man Utd will have a full month to find a solution that could suit all parties.",
      "Given Man Utd’s financial situation, only a short-term solution is likely in January, and Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, preferably purely on loan, is perhaps their most realistic target to tick a box until the summer.",
      "In this context, the former Chelsea man would be the best like-for-like replacement for Mainoo they could hope for until the summer, with this deal being enough to permit the youngster’s loan to Napoli.",
      "There has also been little indication of Mainoo wanting to leave Man Utd permanently, so in an ideal world, he plays regularly for Napoli for six months and returns to Old Trafford better for the experience.",
      "By which point, he could become a starter for Man Utd alongside Carlos Baleba in what is still likely to be the club’s next long-term midfield pairing.",
      "If Man Utd had their way, Baleba would already be playing in Amorim’s side and in a similar situation to Marc Guehi with Liverpool, it has been reported that the player and club still have their hearts set on each other heading into 2026.",
      "While Mainoo remains the ideal long-term replacement for Fernandes, the same can be said for Baleba and Casemiro, who is also on borrowed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite the form and attitude of Casemiro this season, age is not on the Brazil international’s side as he is surely in the final year or two of playing at the top level.",
      "Still, Casemiro’s immense resurgence this term means it is looking increasingly likely that he could remain at Man Utd for at least one more year, with a new deal on lesser terms rather than an extension of his current deal more probable.",
      "It would certainly boost Man Utd if Casemiro sticks around to help with Baleba’s integration in a reduced role currently adopted by Ugarte, who needs to be shown the door next year.",
      "INEOS will hope that the £50m midfielder is one of Man Utd’s last major flops as their rebuild develops, with the former PSG man incredibly limited in possession and clearly not up to the required standard for the club.",
      "It would be to the benefit of player and club if they part ways in January or next summer, which is also the case with Fernandes after the captain fired shots at club chiefs over their alleged push for him to move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Fernandes has been Man Utd’s best player over recent years, but they are short of time to cash in on their captain for £60m+ and next summer is perhaps their last opportunity to do so.",
      "READ: Manchester United make hard work of putting in the hard work, but Amorim nails it this time",
      "So, with Man Utd seemingly showing their cards to Fernandes in the summer and the midfielder appearing disgruntled, a natural separation feels more plausible by the day.",
      "Mainoo is right there to fill the void left by Fernandes, but Man Utd certainly could do with another option to share the load and reported target Ruben Neves would fit the bill.",
      "United are said to be lurking over a possible cheap deal in January, but there is a greater chance of a free transfer once his Al-Hilal contract expires in the summer.",
      "With this, plus the cash to come in for Joshua Zirkzee, Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and/or Mason Greenwood, Man Utd would still have funds left over to sign another quality attacker to provide adequate competition and defensive reinforcements.",
      "It really can be that simple…",
      "The Christmas fixtures delivered one particular theme which tied Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United together, with Eddie Howe and Nuno for the sack.",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",

      "That United want to improve their midfield is evident. One of their favoured options, Casemiro, is due to exit in the summer, while his usual partner, Bruno Fernandes, is currently injured, and Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo are not often given a lot of minutes.",
      "Big names such as Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba are all on United’s radar but will prove too expensive in January.",
      "A move for former Wolves man Neves, then, could have been ideal, as he’s out of contract with Al-Hilal in the summer, when he’d be free, or they could sell him on the cheap before that.",
      "Speaking on YouTube, transfer insider Romano has confirmed contact for Neves, but nothing so serious that it will lead to a transfer.",
      "He said: “I wanted to clarify a couple of things, the first one about Ruben Neves, as I saw many of you asking me about what I said the other day here on the channel.",
      "“Let me be clear, I didn’t post anything on Ruben Neves on my social media, because there is no news on Ruben Neves in terms of negotiations, in terms of bids, in terms of talks.",
      "“What Manchester United did is to be in touch with the agent who also represents Ruben Neves. “But Man United didn’t start a real negotiation with Ruben Neves, with Al-Hilal to sign the player.",
      "“So at this stage, nothing is moving. They spoke about several players, not just Ruben Neves, several opportunities, something like ideas, opportunities, talents.",
      "“Ruben Neves is represented by one of the most powerful agents in football. So that’s something absolutely normal, but nothing has really changed so far.”",
      "It comes after a report stated that United and Newcastle were both preparing offers for Neves.",
      "That came amid suggestions that Neves wanted to leave Saudi Arabia, with United looking a suitable destination for him.",
      "He will get the opportunity to leave in the summer, but whether the Red Devils still want him by then remains to be seen, as it’s felt they’ll have a better chance at landing one of the star Premier League midfielders by then.",
      "Manchester United target Ruben Neves is reported to have made a ‘sacrifice’ which his agent, Jorge Mendes, found “crazy” in hopes of joining Real Madrid.",
      "According to reports, Al Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves wants to leave Saudi Arabia and has interest from Manchester United, Newcastle and Spurs.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘ready to act’ under the right circumstances in January and could make a bargain signing.",
      "Man Utd were reportedly the frontrunners to sign Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves in the January transfer window until Real Madrid joined the race.",

That might be one of the reasons.",

      "The two reasons for this stance is that ‘clubs are willing to offer him huge packages to complete a move next month’ and January ‘is one of the last opportunities for United to secure a major fee for the playmaker’.",
      "Last month, former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown claimed Man Utd could use Fernandes to “strengthen in midfield”.",
      "“I don’t think it’s something they’re necessarily planning to do,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "“But it’s certainly something they will consider and keep an eye on, but it might depend on what happens between now and the end of the season.",
      "“Everybody knows Man United want to strengthen in midfield, it’s no secret, it’s a position the manager feels he needs reinforcements in.",
      "“The question is more about their financial situation, whether they can afford to pay the type of money clubs are asking for when it comes to these players.",
      "“You never know at the moment with United, one minute they’re pleading poverty and the next they’re talking about spending £100million on players.",
      "“Of course, selling Bruno Fernandes would help them raise money to put towards that deal, but then you’re weakening the squad in midfield anyway.",
      "“I don’t think it would make sense to go out of their way to move an important player on, maybe if a huge offer comes in then it’s something they’ll have a look at.",
      "“But at the moment it’s not in their plans to move him on and bring somebody else in, I’m not sure it would make a lot of sense for them in terms of what they need.”",
      "Manchester United’s midfield will look very different by the start of next season and this is how we think their rebuild will unfold via seven deals…",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed a “guarantee” regarding Manchester United’s search for a new midfielder, while one deal ‘should’ get done.",
      "Man Utd are likely to be active in the next two transfer windows as they look to continue their progression under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "In the summer, the Red Devils spent around £230m on signings and offloaded most of their dead wood to improve after their embarrassing campaign in 2024/25.",
      "Senne Lammens, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have made a huge impact at the start of this season, but they still need upgrades in certain positions.",
      "This is especially the case in midfield and there could be a major overhaul in this department next year as Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes have been linked with exits in recent weeks.",
      "READ: Liverpool in ‘comedy week’ as £30m star ‘better’ than Wirtz as Arsenal ‘totally vilified’, Man Utd lauded",
      "Man Utd could look to raise funds through player sales in the coming months, with Joshua Zirkzee looking the most likely to move elsewhere.",
      "Zirkzee has only been a bit-part player for United this term and is being heavily linked with a move to AS Roma.",
      "Now, a report from Gazzetta dello Sport claims Zirkzee’s move to Roma ‘should be done by mid-January’, while Corriere dello Sport claims they are currently offering a loan with a buy option and are around 10 million euros shy of Man Utd’s 40 million euro asking price.",
      "Any funds for Zirkzee could be used to land a new midfielder after they were priced out of a move for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in the summer.",
      "Man Utd have also been linked with several potential alternatives, but Romano insists Baleba is “still seen as an ideal solution”.",
      "“In terms of midfielders, one of the names I want to maintain since August on Man Utd’s shortlist is Carlos Baleba, because Man Utd – I can guarantee – have not stopped discussing the name of Carlos Baleba internally. Baleba is still seen as an ideal solution by Ruben Amorim and the people at the club,” Romano revealed on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Together with Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace and Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, Baleba is seen as one of the ideal midfielders for Amorim.",
      "“So Baleba is super appreciated by Man Utd. A January move is still seen as unlikely, but any moment – January or summer – if Brighton decide to open the door to an exit, Man Utd remain absolutely interested in the player. They remain in contact with people close to the player.",
      "“There were rumours in December about Bayern Munich being interested in Carlos Baleba. From what I am told, Bayern, at this stage, are not working on a deal for Baleba. They feel that the player wants to stay in England. They feel that last summer he wanted to go to Man Utd, and Bayern are aware of that.",
      "“They have not started a proper negotiation for Baleba as of today. If something changes in the summer, I will let you know. But as of today, January 2026, Bayern are not seriously working on a deal to sign Carlos Baleba.”",
      "Manchester United’s midfield will look very different by the start of next season and this is how we think their rebuild will unfold via seven deals…",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists it’s now a “direct battle” between Man Utd and Man City for Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo in January.",
      "Crystal Palace, Everton and West Ham are definitely at risk as we rank the top ten non-Big Six stars most likely to secure an upwards transfer to a giant in ...",
      "According to reports, Manchester United would be willing to ‘fast-track’ a move to sign Antoine Semenyo from AFC Bournemouth on two conditions."

      "United’s positive summer transfer window has certainly helped to improve Ruben Amorim‘s side after they finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to win a trophy last term.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd certainly need upgrades in a few positions if they are to continue their progression in the next year or so.",

      "READ: Liverpool in ‘comedy week’ as £30m star ‘better’ than Wirtz as Arsenal ‘totally vilified’, Man Utd lauded",
      "“The manager changed the formation and went with a back four, which a lot of people have been asking for, I know they didn’t concede a goal but they didn’t look comfortable and Newcastle were putting them under pressure, especially in the second half.",
      "“When I look at the squad and the bench, what they’ve got there, they really need players in to try to help them challenge to get into the top four.",
      "“Listen, it’s great to see the young players on the bench and getting opportunities but it needs to be at the right time as well, and it’s not, it’s not sustainable at all. They need players in.",
      "‘They’ve obviously lost some important players and Bruno [Fernandes] is a big loss but the home games under Amorim, you look at the possession from the Newcastle game, 33 per cent at Old Trafford, I know when the fans go to that stadium they want to see the team with the ball, they want to see them entertaining, getting crosses in the box and getting shots in.",
      "“It was a poor performance but they found a way to win.”",
      "Roy Keane, meanwhile, was a tad more optimistic about Man Utd than Rooney, though he has insisted that they “have to kick on now”.",

      "“There has to be pride in your defending. An ugly win but a big win.",
      "“The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",

Tonali got booked for a less extreme version of Chalobah’s assault and battery on Gordon on Tuesday. When Chalobah did it, it wasn’t even a foul. So why was it a booking in a different match and fifty yards from goal? And as I’ve said here many times, intent should have no bearing on penalty decisions. Advantage is the proper criterion.",

      "– The referee for not noticing that Dorgu had gone down holding his head so many times? He has an obligation to protect the players on the pitch.",

      "– The Man Utd medical staff, for failing to overrule Amorim and protect Dorgu from long-term consequences?",

I suspect that only the shot to the face had any actual effect on him and the rest of the injuries were feigned. (And has Amorim encouraged him to cheat?)",
      "If a player goes down holding his head that many times, it’s clear that he’s either cheating or in danger. In neither case should they remain on the pitch. And if players and coaches continue to fake head injuries, a likely consequence is that the protections in place will become less effective.",
      "I think that when play stops for a possible head injury, the player should leave the pitch for an actual neuro exam by an actual physician. The PGMOL should also conduct post-match reviews to 1) identify players faking head injuries that stop play and suspend them retroactively, and 2) hold referees accountable for failures to protect players.

I’d argue, they would do it better. They would be paid less, there’d be nearly zero training burden and they would just sit there, keep quiet until something mind-bogglingly clear is missed by the pitch referees. Even “clear and obvious” becomes easier to define when the VAR is not a referees.

      "Man Utd legends Roy Keane and Gary Neville have picked out Ayden Heaven for special praise after their 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "The Red Devils moved up to fifth in the Premier League on Friday after Patrick Dorgu scored a wonderful volley just inside the box to give Man Utd the spoils against the Magpies.",
      "Keane still expressed his doubts post-match about Ruben Amorim and how far this current crop of Man Utd players can go, effectively ruling them out of contention for Champions League qualification this season.",
      "However, Keane was impressed by Heaven – who was signed from Arsenal’s academy last year – with the Man Utd defender putting in a great performance to help the Red Devils to a clean sheet.",
      "“He has learnt his trade. These are basic parts of defending. It gives you confidence. Outstanding.”",
      "READ: Every Prem club’s worst mistake in 2025: Gyokeres to Arsenal, Guehi transfer, Glasner exit, Frank to Spurs",
      "Neville was also impressed by Heaven’s display, Keane’s former team-mate added: “Manchester United hung in there. Heaven was absolutely brilliant.",
      "“Those Newcastle players… four or five of them collapsed to the ground at the end. Heaven has been the Man of the Match.”",
      "The 19-year-old was pleased to get the win over Newcastle on Boxing Day and was happy with his performance on the right-hand side of defence.",
      "Heaven said after the match: “Finally, clean sheet, we’ve been waiting for this, and I’m just so happy.",
      "“This guy (Dorgu) here helped us get there, so thankful to everyone that helped us.",
      "“It was different, I was playing on the right side, obviously my weaker foot.",
      "“The manager, we play loads of formations with him, whatever he does we know it’s going to work, you saw today. I’m so proud of the team.”",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim was also impressed by Heaven and thinks the youngster is “improving every game” he plays.",
      "Amorim said: “I’m really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he’s improving every game. He’s young, but you don’t feel that he has a good game and then he slows the game or the thinking during the game.",
      "“No, you feel that he’s improving during the game. I think he was not playing, but he trained really well. You just need to train really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. So, in this moment, if you continue to play like that, it’s going to be really hard to take his place.”",
      "Man Utd legend Roy Keane is still “not convinced” by Ruben Amorim’s side despite their 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Former PGMOL chief Keith Hackett has given his verdict on whether Newcastle should have been given a penalty in their 1-0 loss to Man Utd on Boxing Day.",

      "READ: Every Prem club’s worst mistake in 2025: Gyokeres to Arsenal, Guehi transfer, Glasner exit, Frank to Spurs",
      "“The bar has been set so low after last season. They spent a good chunk of change in the summer. They should be where they are in the table, qualifying for Europe. The Champions League would be a step too far. They were really good at Aston Villa.”",
      "Keane agreed, he said: “I’m not convinced.",
      "“He [Ruben Amorim] got a pre-season and signings, they have no Europe but they are still not showing it. We are still waiting. The question marks are still there for me, we talk about top four but they are not ready for that.”",

      "“If you want to make progress as a football club you have to be harder to beat. They need to improve or we will keep talking about the same problems. If they keep giving up chances and goals like they are, they will never make the next step.”",
      "Amorim claims Man Utd “cannot do the same mistakes that we did in the past”, he said: “We have space to have more players, but it is a very important thing in our club that we have a plan and we need to bring players that we know.",
      "“It’s hard to know for sure that everything is going to work, but we need to be certain of the players that we bring [in]. If we are not sure, it’s better not to bring anyone and to work with the players that we have. That is clear for me.",
      "“Maybe I should be different like so many managers, but that is my thinking and I think it’s the thinking of the board that we cannot do the same mistakes that we did in the past and we need to survive these moments because we have players coming from international [teams] and from Europe.”",
      "Amorim insists he doesn’t need much time to work out if a signing is right for Man Utd, he added: “I think I have a good feeling on that. That’s why we will not bring in a player that has that feeling face-to-face.",
      "“They can mislead me a little bit, but it’s going to be hard, so I have the feeling and most of the time, I get it right. I just look at the guy, maybe it’s the way they speak and I think I can detect the rubbish. I don’t know.”",

      "On the performance of matchwinner Dorgu, Amorim added: “Because you put him in one position that is more in front. The responsibility is not the same. He had a little more freedom, he can take more risks, and I think it helped Patrick to play better.",
      "“They just need to understand, and Manu [Manuel Ugarte] did a very good game today, they must understand that, sometimes, you can have a good day and the next day can be worse. You have to deal with that and train well and to go forward.”",

      "That covers botched transfer pursuits, botched completed transfers, botched transfer windows…and even botched wardrobes.",
      "Here are what we deem the worst mistakes by each club in 2025. You can check out our best decisions right here – after reading this, obviously.",
      "",
      "In hindsight, Arsenal probably should have gone for Hugo Ekitike.",
      "It was between Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko for Andrea Berta, who was hell-bent on signing the former. But Ekitike was right there.",
      "The Frenchman went to Liverpool after Newcastle United failed to sign him and has registered eight goals in 16 Premier League matches, scoring in six separate matches.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, scored twice (one penalty) against Leeds United, one against Burnley, one against Nottingham Forest, and one (penalty) against Everton. He’s struggling to avoid the flat-track bully allegations and has looked a shadow of the player who banged them in for fun at Sporting.",
      "There is an argument that Mikel Arteta and Gyokeres’ teammates are not utilising their new centre-forward very well. He is making all sorts of runs that are being ignored, and the service to him hasn’t been great as Bukayo Saka, Ebere Eze, and Martin Odegaard all struggle to create.",
      "He is hardly missing sitters every game, and his mere presence up top has been enough to make a positive difference. But most big-money strikers would have done the same.",
      "READ: Arsenal top, Gyokeres flopping – 10 of the 2025 storylines we DID see coming",
      "",
      "Just a s**t move for everyone involved, really. It actually looked like the perfect move at the time. Elliott was ready to assume an important role at a decent club, and Villa gave him the platform to do so, only to swiftly decide they have no intention of triggering his buy option.",
      "A return to Liverpool following the termination of Elliott’s loan in January looks on the cards. The Reds could have done with having him around during a testing first half of 2025/26.",
      "",
      "In case you weren’t aware, Iraola is out of contract next summer. That is flying under the radar, isn’t it?",
      "He has been linked with every big club in Europe during his time at little ol’ Bournemouth, but his stock is quite low at the moment. The Cherries are winless in eight Premier League games as they continue to be the streakiest of all streaky teams, and that means Iraola isn’t being linked with anyone. But the streaky Cherries will soon be on an 11-match unbeaten run, making the Spaniard the most sought-after manager in Europe again.",
      "Perhaps their poor form offers the perfect time for the club’s hierarchy to sit down with Iraola and offer him a new deal. It could come across as a huge display of faith, and then Bournemouth will benefit financially when Manchester City or someone else pays a hefty compensation fee.",
      "Finances are obviously not the biggest positive of renewing Iraola’s contract. They should be desperate to keep the man who’s led them to 12th and 9th in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "Gambling on Keith Andrews felt like a guaranteed inclusion when he was chosen as Thomas Frank’s replacement, but Brentford’s in-house style has not come back to bite them in the backside. We all tipped them to go down, and while that’s still realistic, the Bees are doing much better than most expected following the departures of head coach Frank, star players Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo, and club captain Christian Norgaard.",
      "Brentford might’ve enjoyed even more success last season if Kayode was allowed to properly channel his inner Rory Delap, and not unleashing it sooner – or at least more often last season – is their biggest mistake of 2025. Yes, we are struggling a bit.",
      "Brentford are 10th for throw-ins taken this season with 325, but Kayode is top in the player ranking with 191 – that is 58.77% of his side’s throws and the highest in the Premier League for an individual by 33.",

      "It’s obviously not a simple task for Burnley to sign a player on the level of Granit Xhaka following promotion to the Premier League, but people would’ve said the same thing about Sunderland, who did sign Xhaka and instantly handed him the captaincy.",
      "If there is a blueprint for avoiding immediate relegation, Sunderland have found it. Clubs have spent big following promotions but nowhere near as savvily as the Black Cats. Their signing of Xhaka has been the biggest factor in their success, and Burnley’s recruitment didn’t include anyone close to Xhaka’s experience and ability. Amazingly, it could’ve made such a significant difference.",
      "",
      "We are again questioning why Chelsea still don’t have an elite striker or goalkeeper after spending so much money.",
      "Joao Pedro showed us at the Club World Cup that he is capable of being a world-class No.9, but he’s not really played there this season. Meanwhile, Robert Sanchez has never been so comfortably No.1 at Stamford Bridge. Still, it’s weird that Chelsea were properly stingy with Milan in negotiations for France goalkeeper Mike Maignan.",
      "Maignan is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and was available for around £20million, yet Chelsea didn’t want to pay over £12m. Yes, he is out of contract next summer, but we’re completely baffled that a club so scattergun and trigger-happy in the transfer market were unwilling to pay an extra ~£8m to fix a problem position with a world-class signing.",
      "",
      "Palace are going to lose Oliver Glasner. That is obvious. When? Probably at the end of 2025/26. Where will he go? That’s anyone’s guess.",
      "After guiding the Eagles to their first-ever trophy and subsequently their first-ever European campaign, Glasner wanted more backing in the summer transfer window. He felt massively let down by chairman Steve Parish and let the media know as much, while Parish couldn’t fight his corner as losing the Austrian before 2025/26 started would’ve been an absolute disaster.",
      "It’s felt inevitable that Glasner would take the step up to a bigger club, and a disappointing summer is one of the biggest reasons he won’t renew his contract and walk away in June, if not sooner.",
      "",
      "Everton have lacked a prolific goalscorer for a while. It’s something they desperately needed to address last summer, and they did so by signing a top, young player with bags of potential in Thierno Barry. It’s safe to say it hasn’t worked out for him so far.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin, at his absolute best, scored 16 Premier League goals in 2020/21, the most for the Toffees since Romelu Lukaku backed up an 18-goal campaign with a 25-goal 2016/17.",
      "Everton should probably stick to recruiting strikers from English clubs. Their list of top scorers in each Premier League season goes as follows (centre-forwards only): Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison, Wayne Rooney, Lukaku x4, Nikica Jelavic, Tim Cahill, Louis Saha, Cahill, Yakubu, Andy Johnson, James Beattie, Cahill, Rooney, Tomasz Radzinski, Radzinski and Duncan Ferguson, Kevin Campbell x3, Ferguson x2, Paul Rideout, Tony Cottee x2.",
      "Jelavic and Ferguson hadn’t played in England before joining but were signed straight from Scotland. Radzinski is the only non-Brit there playing for his first English club.",
      "The moral of the story is: keep your striker recruitment a little more local, Everton.",
      "",
      "After watching Crystal Palace win their first major trophy, Fulham must’ve felt desperate to experience the same. Their summer transfer business suggests they’re happy where they are – winning sod all but comfortably avoiding relegation every season.",
      "Kevin was an exciting signing, and Samuel Chukwueze has shown promise, but it was a very underwhelming summer window for the Cottagers.",
      "",
      "As the alphabet would have it, Leeds follow Fulham, and the latter’s best decision of 2025 has created the former’s worst.",
      "Leeds were reportedly interested in signing Wilson in the summer transfer window but couldn’t get a deal over the line. Who knew that he would become a bloody revelation at Craven Cottage a couple of months later? We certainly didn’t.",
      "Daniel Farke was actually let down badly in the end after a strong start to the club’s summer business. He needed more in attack. At least Calvert-Lewin is doing well now.",
      "",
      "Choosing Jeremie Frimpong as Trent Alexander-Arnold’s replacement, picking Florian Wirtz over Rayan Cherki, and signing a player who might be the biggest flop of all flops in Premier League floppyville were big gaffes, but it’s hard to argue that they were worse decisions than waiting until deadline day to have a bid accepted for Marc Guehi.",
      "Guehi leaving could have been the straw that broke the camel’s back for Glasner at Palace, and it could have made a huge difference in an awful first half to the season for the Reds.",
      "He would’ve been able to take a struggling Ibrahima Konate out of the firing line and surely played well enough to stay in the team. Had Guehi been playing well next to Virgil van Dijk, the Liverpool captain and the two full-backs would also look a lot more comfortable.",
      "Yes, Liverpool can get Guehi for nothing next summer, but they have desperately needed him this term.",
      "",
      "This isn’t a huge error on City’s side, but a case of hindsight being a wonderful (or gut-wrenchingly frustrating) thing for young Trafford.",
      "An honourable mention is rejecting big money from Tottenham for Savinho. We’re really not sure what either side was thinking there.",
      "",
      "How long have you got with this lot? It’s pretty difficult to pinpoint the worst decision United made in 2025. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has done and said some very odd things. Ruben Amorim might’ve been sacked four or five times. Spending all of their summer budget on attackers might not have been the best move. Not signing a goalkeeper in January was also a bit silly, if not completely forced by a shoestring budget.",
      "We have landed on a specific part of their Europa League final preparation.",
      "Basically, Amorim opted for continuity and confidence by playing his strongest team in the weeks building up to the final. Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou, meanwhile, rested everyone to ensure his players were fit and well-rested for an absolutely monumental game of football.",
      "Ultimately, one decision aged well, earned the club £100m, and qualified them for the Champions League. And the other decision might’ve cost United the £100m windfall and Champions League football, which Amorim swears he didn’t really want anyway.",
      "",
      "In terms of 2025 transfers, the richest club in the Premier League have had a torrid time. The £55m they spent on Elanga surely goes down as their biggest gaffe, though.",
      "He has really struggled. Like really, really struggled. We don’t want to absolutely hammer the poor lad, so we’ll leave it at that.",
      "",
      "Eight games, zero wins, two draws, six defeats, zero clean sheets, seven goals scored, 17 goals conceded, 39 days in charge, sacked 18 minutes after losing his final match.",
      "Need we say any more?",
      "",
      "If we’re poking holes in their summer recruitment, it would be that they signed quite a few African players in an Africa Cup of Nations season.",
      "AFCON will affect the Black Cats more than any other Premier League club with regular starters Bertrand Traore, Noah Sadiki, and Reinildo all representing their countries, while another important player, Habib Diarra, has returned from injury just in time to link up with his Senegal teammates. Morocco’s Chemsdine Talbi and DR Congo’s Arthur Masuaku are also away and have featured plenty this term.",
      "",
      "On paper, Spurs have a pretty good squad. But football isn’t played on paper, and clearly something is missing. Xavi Simons and Mohammed Kudus should’ve brought an X-factor to Thomas Frank’s squad, but they’ve blown very hot and cold in their early months at the club.",
      "‘Hiring Thomas Frank’ is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s maybe harsh on him because he is a good manager who is willing to adapt, but it’s more that he isn’t the right profile for Spurs.",
      "They needed someone with a proper coaching identity, which Frank unfortunately lacks. He is chopping and changing his tactics too often. We honestly don’t know if he’s an attack-minded coach or a defense-minded coach. He does lean more towards the latter, which is fine for Brentford, but not for a ball-dominant team.",
      "Hopefully Frank is given enough time to prove us wrong and does exactly that, but his first six months at Spurs have been concerning.",
      "",
      "Feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? Well, it happened in January 2025. Potter replaced Julen Lopetegui, and despite defeat in his first game, we thought there was already marked improvement and that the Englishman’s long-awaited return to the dugout was going to go just fine.",
      "Alas, he was sacked in September with West Ham 19th in the Premier League. His win rate was an abysmal 24% during his time at the club. West Ham were the worst ever-present Premier League club during his tenure, accumulating 23 points, four fewer than Wolves, who were above Spurs and Man United by two points and one respectively.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has slightly steadied the ship, but we’re not fully convinced West Ham won’t sink into the Championship for the first time since 2011/12.",
      "",
      "Replacing star players like Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were the trickiest of tasks for any Premier League club last summer, and Wolves did so…very poorly.",
      "Ait-Nouri’s replacement, David Moller Wolfe, cost £10m but didn’t really come into the team until Rob Edwards joined. Less can be said about that because Ait-Nouri was important to Wolves, but his importance didn’t come close to Cunha’s.",
      "He basically was Vitor Pereira’s system. That does make replacing him almost impossible, but his importance underlined how vital it is for a relegation candidate to have a proper game-changer in attack. Leeds survived because they had Raphinha. Wolves survived because they had Cunha…and Ipswich, Southampton, and Leicester were atrocious.",
      "Tasked with filling the Cunha void were Jhon Arias and Fer Lopez, who joined for a combined £34m. Neither has impressed, and Wolves only have two points this season, which hints at more complex problems than ‘they couldn’t replace their best players very well’.",

      "In a way it is difficult not to admire Ruben Amorim, the dogmatic Manchester United manager appointed specifically for his unwavering faith in principles which have broken myriad negative records, delivered a 15th-placed Premier League finish and produced one of the most miserable major tournament final surrenders in modern history.",
      "The Portuguese, having realised that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have taken a Ludovico Technique-style approach to this infernal staring contest with a manager they have wedded themselves to for better or considerably worse, finally admitted he “would do 75% of things different” if offered the opportunity again.",
      "While that does beg the question of precisely how much of this year-long agony was entirely necessary, it also suggests a level of hitherto denied malleability, the sort required for any coach to succeed.",
      "But it leaves two intriguing points: what things would Amorim change? And far more fascinating: what would he not?",
      "It might ordinarily be assumed that giving Newcastle 66% of the ball at Old Trafford would fall under the 75% of things Amorim would alter but when such a sacrifice of possession is made at the altar of victory, perhaps not.",
      "And the first half especially was generally positive. Patrick Dorgu marked a fine performance on the right wing with a spectacular first goal for the club, Benjamin Sesko led the line admirably, Matheus Cunha sparkled and Lisandro Martinez helped pull it all together at the back as captain.",
      "Yet as with the other wins Amorim has overseen at Manchester United, his 25th was underpinned by questionable calls and a sense of general chaos.",
      "On the face of it, this was a Premier League win, lifting them to fifth in the table, with: a 19-year-old at centre-half partnering a player making his first start in almost a year; their three best forwards of the season either at AFCON or watching from the stands with a dodgy hamstring; a player making the second and longest appearance of his Premier League career at 45 minutes; another making his third Premier League career appearance, and first in a win; and someone playing his first game of professional football in more than seven months.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez, Jack Fletcher, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia is pure, unadulterated, found-down-the-back-of-the-sofa-in-time-for-Boxing-Day nonsense.",
      "And it just about worked. Only by technicality of the scoreline, the most important technicality of all. But those are three crucial points all the same, the sort which these players and this manager would rarely have held out for in the past.",
      "The awfulness of Newcastle helped. They had four times as many shots as their hosts in the second half and three-quarters of the ball but at no stage did they look particularly likely to decimate the deficit. Beyond the excellent Lewis Hall striking the bar it was an absurdly tiresome slog and a continuation of their away angst.",
      "Those travel travails were summed up neatly by the moment in the second half when Nick Woltemade’s clever flick allowed Jacob Ramsey time and space to move into the area, at which point he stumbled over his own feet and collapsed to the floor.",
      "Both were removed in a triple substitution around the hour mark which Eddie Howe designed to capitalise on the momentum that had long since settled in Newcastle’s favour. Yoane Wissa, Joelinton and Harvey Barnes entered as Manchester United were starting to sink deeper into their own half.",
      "Yet at no real point did Amorim’s side look like caving in. Not when Sesko – and Manchester United’s pressure-relieving forward pivot – was taken off, nor when a bemused Casemiro followed. Not when the manager substituted his two most senior defenders with backs against the wall in the 88th minute.",
      "Some of that is on Newcastle’s inability to create much of note. But it is also credit to Manchester United for digging in.",
      "And it gave Amorim an opportunity to showcase a side of himself which has been lost in the mess of the last year: his charisma.",
      "“Back four, clean sheet, Kobbie Mainoo is injured. I don’t need a press conference, we covered all the subjects, so can all go away and enjoy Boxing Day,” were his CliffsNotes from an evening in which Manchester United made hard work of putting in the hard work, only for it to actually pay off for once.",
      "READ NEXT: Pre-season predictions revisited: Just how wrong were we on Liverpool, Arsenal, Villa, Sunderland?",
      "The Christmas fixtures delivered one particular theme which tied Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United together, with Eddie Howe and Nuno for the sack.",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Bournemouth and Crystal Palace are both in dire form, perhaps at least in part thanks to a degree of managerial uncertainty which will only get worse.",
      "Arsenal are still top of the Premier League but not scoring a lot of goals. Is that part of the Mikel Arteta process?",
      "It’s starting to look more when than if for Thomas Frank as Spurs head for serious relegation trouble after his moribund leadership."

      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title. A number of players are still to return from injury, including Gabriel and Kai Havertz.",
      "Mikel Arteta has always said they will keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal are always looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less-than-convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliott's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so he cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool, but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Manchester City have opened talks with Bournemouth to negotiate the finer points of Antoine Semenyo's £65m release clause.",
      "In response, Bournemouth will want to sign a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone, given Semenyo almost left in the summer.",
      "Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, Bournemouth are looking to recruit a goalkeeper again to find someone who can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League, thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool.",
      "There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left-sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Tottenham and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing of midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing him in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season, but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer, but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Manchester City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON. They are considering an approach for Tottenham's Brennan Johnson, while Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis was a target in the summer.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right-wing back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January, he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at, but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League, especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Marco Silva did not hide his frustrations about the lack of depth in Fulham's squad after Newcastle knocked them out of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, and he will be hoping to address those problems in the January transfer window.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen after a difficult first half of the season.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham have lost to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is also at AFCON while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January, but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Farke has switched to a 3-5-2, but wants his team to be flexible, as shown when he reverted to a back four mid-game against Liverpool and Brentford - a tweak that helped Leeds come from behind to draw in both games - so their plans are not shaped around one formation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlow, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window, even after spending over £200m net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah putting his future firmly on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad, but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament, which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition that they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract, they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield, but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Antoine Semenyo's representatives are due in Manchester to finalise contract terms as Manchester City open talks with Bournemouth over his £65m release clause.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting older, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United are another club interested in Antoine Semenyo, but look set to miss out to rivals Manchester City. The biggest aspect of the decision for United is with £65m potentially hitting the summer kitty without significant sales.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires caution but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "Defenders Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are currently out injured. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo was of long-term interest but Spurs ended their pursuit of the Ghana forward. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "Spurs could also look to sign a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for players such as Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Johnson, scorer of the winning goal in last season's Europa League final, is of interest to Crystal Palace. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season. Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Randal Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",

      "Manchester United held on to beat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford to move fifth in the Premier League after claiming their first clean sheet since early October; Ruben Amorim started a Premier League game with a back four for the first time since taking charge",
      "Saturday 27 December 2025 10:17, UK",
      "\"Sometimes you need to adapt and there is no tactic in that moment,\" said Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's 1-0 win over Newcastle. He was responding after acknowledging that he had gone with a back six late in the game.",
      "His patched-up side were holding on with Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot playing ahead of the full-backs in a six-man defence. Of course, the fact that Amorim had been playing a back four at all was a fascination and an indication that his team is evolving tactically.",
      "There was a time when he would not have countenanced such a thing but he feels a little more emboldened now, able to adjust from a position of relative strength having got United up to fifth - and potentially even higher before a difficult 2025 is through.",
      "The reason for that growing confidence owes as much to the togetherness as the results, however, and that is the takeaway from this win as much as the formation. Amorim agreed that, in its own way, it was one of the most satisfying wins in that sense.",
      "\"I think it's something that we need to feel that, that we can win sometimes without playing so well, that we can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\" He talked of his young team defending every cross and putting bodies on the line.",
      "\"We were suffering a lot,\" he explained. \"We were just trying to survive.\" He was talking about those final moments against Newcastle but it might just sum up his time at the club so far. They came through it, though. Perhaps Amorim will come through it all too.",
      "Amorim finally changed formation and his back four delivered a first clean sheet in nearly three months. Many will be wondering what took him so long - and rightly so - after more than a year of stubbornly sticking to one shape.",
      "He delivered the surprise with maximum impact by having his players warm up in a back three. It was quite the shock when United lined up at kick-off. This was the first time Amorim had started with a back four.",
      "But it begs the question of why now? This can't have been the first such game.",
      "The change becomes even more curious when you hear Amorim's comments about Dorgu, the goalscorer against Newcastle, and how he benefitted from playing as winger rather than a wing-back.",
      "\"You put him in one position that is more in front, the responsibilities are not the same, and he has more freedom to lose the ball. I think it helped Patrick to play better.\"",
      "Amorim's analysis is inarguable. This was probably Dorgu's best performance in a United shirt. But that in itself and the head coach's acknowledgement of it bring us back to that earlier question.",
      "These are points that onlookers have been making ever since Amorim took the job over a year ago. What might have happened had he listened earlier? It makes you think.",
      "Dorgu's improvement will raise questions about how other, better players might have flourished in a different shape. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo spring to mind for that position on the right wing. It certainly seems a more natural fit for Amad than wing-back.",
      "But perhaps their return from AFCON will signal an end to the experiment. There has been no clear communication about how long this will last.",
      "After spending so long defending his way there is no telling what Amorim is planning long-term. It would seem almost silly in a way, albeit totally necessary, if he were to go back on his word now and move on from solely playing three at the back.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished their 1-0 win over Newcastle with a back four of Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Surely, however, the conclusion for Amorim must be that his previous position of having one shape and sticking to it, regardless of personnel or game state, is a mistake not to be repeated.",
      "There are signs of genuine improvement thanks to Amorim's flexibility. That's what he should stick to.",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet,\" the former Man Utd captain said.",
      "\"There has to be pride in your defending. An ugly win but a big win.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",
      "\"Digging out results. The teams I played in, we didn't play well every week but we dug in. They have to kick on now.\"",
      "\"It feels right for Man Utd [the change in shape]. In the last few weeks, we have seen something different.",
      "\"Tonight, with and without the ball, it's a back and midfield four. The strange thing about it, it's forced Newcastle into a back five! They've been really good.\"",

      "Amorim's tactical change to a 4-2-3-1 formation with Dorgu playing on the right wing appeared to confuse Newcastle early on, with Casemiro and Benjamin Sesko going close. And though Eddie Howe did adjust, Dorgu's wonderful volley beat Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "The 21-year-old Denmark international has had his struggles since arriving from Lecce last winter but he impressed here even beyond his spectacular goal, although it was Matheus Cunha with his driving runs from deep who lit up the first half at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Heaven (8), Martinez (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (7), Ugarte (7), Casemiro (7), Dorgu (8), Mount (6), Cunha (8), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Fletcher (6), Yoro (6), Zirkzee (5), Fredricson (n/a), Malacia (n/a).\n\n\nNewcastle: Ramsdale (5), Miley (6), Schar (6), Thiaw (6), Hall (7), Guimaraes (7), Tonali (6), Ramsey (5), Murphy (6), Gordon (6), Woltemade (6). \n\n\nSubs: Joelinton (6), Wissa (6), Barnes (6), Willock (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Ayden Heaven.",
      "Although Sesko did hit the crossbar on the counter-attack, Howe's side certainly stepped up the pressure in the second half with Lewis Hall striking the underside of the bar himself. Amorim had Dorgu and Diogo Dalot as his wingers in a 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Dalot even came close to doubling the lead but it was Newcastle pushing - Lisandro Martinez, on his return to the starting line-up, surviving a VAR call for a penalty against him. They lacked the cutting edge to break down a resolute defensive effort.",
      "Manchester United finished this game with a back four of Leny Yoro, Tyler Fredricson, Ayden Heaven and Tyrell Malacia - a trio of youngsters and a left-back making his first appearance of the season. Martinez had earlier shone on his first start.",
      "The midfield two were Jack Fletcher and Manuel Ugarte, the former having come on for the injured Mason Mount at half-time. On the wings were Dalot and Dorgu. Joshua Zirkzee was up front. That Amorim was able to fashion this into a rearguard action that kept out Newcastle was a minor Christmas miracle.",
      "Manchester United won a Premier League game without Bruno Fernandes for the first time since Ralf Rangnick was in charge.",
      "On the night that Amorim changed his formation, something he had once said he could never do, he comes out of it strengthened. By the victory, of course. But, in a curious way, the manner of it too. It was not fluent but resolute. They are battling to improve.",
      "\"We had to suffer altogether in the stadium. It was really difficult for us. We had a good first half and then the second half we just defend and tried to do something with Cunha. We had our opportunities in transitions.",
      "\"It was a good win, but I had so many games here when we played well and didn't get the three points. Today it was the opposite.\"",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet. There has to be pride in your defending.",

      "Asked if he had been caught out by the change of formation by Amorim, Howe replied: \"Caught out? I actually thought we started the game really well for 15 to 20 minutes.",

      "If anyone has spent this season reminding people just what they are capable of, it's Mason Mount.",
      "The Manchester United midfielder has been plagued by setbacks in recent years, whether that be injuries, tough results or being shown the door by Chelsea, a club he had spent 18 years at.",
      "To overcome so many hurdles is not easy, but Mount puts his resilience down to his early years of chasing his dream to become a professional footballer.",
      "\"I think in my younger years, I didn't have loads of downs. I was very lucky to play in very good teams where we won a lot.",
      "\"Then as you get older, you understand there's definitely going to be ups and downs. And the downs that I experienced was losing big games or losing a final.",
      "\"That's definitely something that you have to learn about, you have to overcome.\"",
      "Mount is a little over a year removed from what appeared to be one of his lowest moments in a United shirt. Backed by new manager Ruben Amorim to start in a Manchester derby against City, he lasted just 12 minutes before being taken off through injury.",
      "It was another fitness blow for Mount, who looked crestfallen as he walked off with the United physios.",
      "\"It was very tough because, obviously, the manager had just come in,\" he recounts.",
      "\"I was getting into the team. When I felt it, I was like 'this is not going to be a good one'.",
      "\"It takes a couple of days to kind of get your head around that. But then for me, it was always, 'I'm back on it now, focus. What can I do to get back as quick as possible and in the best shape I can be?'\"",
      "His hard work has paid off, with Gary Neville saying during the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa that the Red Devils are a better team with Mount in it. That assessment boils down to the hours Mount puts in to make it the case.",
      "\"There's a lot that people don't see, but within the group I think bringing that energy for myself and for the boys onto the pitch is super important.",
      "\"Seeing me start a press or pressing the goalkeeper when it's not on, but then it also sets a trigger for the rest of the lads to go.",
      "\"I've been used a bit higher up in a position that I'm used to. I can go forward, I can get into the box. Also, when we don't have the ball, I will drop in and help the lads in midfield.",
      "\"I think I'm getting close to really getting back to that [his best]. I think now with all my experience that I've got and experiences that I've been through, I think it [his best level] can be higher than before.",
      "\"Over the last couple of years, it's been difficult to get even close to that level. But now, I've had a really good pre-season and a lot of games. A lot of minutes in the legs. I feel like I'm getting close to being back.\"",
      "Should Mount reach the peak of his powers, some may begin thinking about booking him a ticket to North America next summer.",
      "England boss Thomas Tuchel knows Mount all too well, with the playmaker providing the assist for the winning goal as Tuchel's Chelsea lifted the Champions League in 2021.",
      "If Mount can continues to show his worth, the stars could very much align, but he isn't getting carried away just yet.",
      "\"I always say it starts with the club. If you're performing at the club, then you have an opportunity to get in the squad,\" he said when asked about his World Cup hopes.",
      "\"First and foremost, if we're doing well, if we're winning games, if we're pushing up the league, then there's always going to be that opportunity there.",
      "\"Obviously, I know Thomas. I know what he's all about. I'll be doing everything I can to get in that squad.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Kobbie Mainoo is the future of Manchester United despite the speculation surrounding the midfielder's future.",
      "Amorim has not started Mainoo in a single Premier League game this season, with his last league start coming in May during a 2-0 defeat to West Ham.",
      "An injury to Bruno Fernandes, who Amorim described as Mainoo's competition, may give the 20-year-old an opportunity once he recovers from a calf injury, and his head coach has insisted that he sees the player's future being at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He played in different positions - we talked about the position of Casemiro, he can do that. If you play with a three, he can play like we did in the last game with the position of Mason Mount, he can play there.",
      "\"He is going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling, he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "Mainoo's lack of game time under Amorim has prompted interest from clubs across the Premier League and in Europe, with both loan and permanent exits being touted for the England international.",
      "However, with Fernandes' injury and players away for the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim admits that it is unlikely that Mainoo will be allowed to leave in January.",
      "\"If we are not getting someone, it’s hard to [let Mainoo leave]. We are shorter,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Even with a full squad, we are shorter with something that can happen here.",
      "\"We are a club with a big responsibility. We are dealing with all these issues and in everybody’s head, we need to win every game, there are no excuses. So it’s going to be hard to leave the club if we don’t get a substitution.\"",
      "\"A few days before [his injury], we were talking about Kobbie doesn’t have the minutes he deserves or needs. Then there’s an opportunity, and Kobbie is not there.",
      "\"Sometimes, it is bad luck and during this year, we have some moments with a bit of bad luck.\"",
      "With numbers thin on the ground, United may be forced to be active in the January transfer market, with the club among a number of suitors interested in Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "If any signing is to happen, it is not going to be done in a panic as Amorim has insisted the club will stick to their plans with regards to any potential business.",
      "\"We are struggling in this moment but the club, we have a plan and we are going to stick with it,\" he insisted.",
      "\"If we have the opportunity to bring a player who we think is going to be the future of the club, he's going to come.",
      "\"When I look at the team, when we have the full squad, I need to take more quality from that group. If we can bring someone good, if not, then we will spend money in the summer.\"",

No player since the start of last season has hit the target more often from outside the box than Cunha (31), which tells you this isn't variance, it's design. Even more encouraging, four of those outside-the-box shots on target have come in his last two games, highlighting current confidence and freedom in his role.",
      "Away from home, Eddie Howe's side concede 1.21 shots from outside the box per game across their last 30 away league matches, the third-most of any Premier League team. That's a defensive concession profile that invites exactly the type of effort Cunha specialises in.",
