      "Luke Littler has sent a word of encouragement to Mason Mount as he attempts to rescue his floundering Manchester United career. The midfielder joined the Red Devils in a £55m move from Chelsea in 2023.",
      "But he has endured an awful time of things since then. The 26-year-old has made just 41 appearances and scored just twice having been beset by injuries.",
      "One of those strikes did come in his most recent outing as United slipped to a 4-3 defeat to Brentford - their 16th league reverse of the campaign. Darts star and United superfan Littler is hopeful of that being just the start for Mount having reached out to the England man.",
      "He revealed: \"I don't really speak to them [players]. Although I don't think anyone knows this, I recently messaged Mason Mount on Instagram just to say it was good to see him back in training again.",
      "\"We bought him and thought he'd be great, but he's had a few injuries. I'd love to see him get into the starting team and score goals.\"",
      "And while Littler insists that he does not regularly contact United players, he also revealed that he got in touch with Harry Maguire, who had an amusing response. Littler added: “When Maguire scored the winner against Lyon, I put on my Instagram, 'Can you wear the No.9 shirt?' And he replied with laughing emojis.\"",
      "While Littler is a loyal United fan, it appears that he won’t be stretching his schedule to go and watch the side should they reach the Europa League final. The Red Devils are 3-0 up after the first-leg of their semi final against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "But with a Premier League Darts evening set to take place in Sheffield the following evening, Littler has ruled out splashing the cash. Speaking to SportsBoom.co.uk, he said: \"I have been looking at flights - but I'll go only if I’m allowed. Even if I don’t go, I’ll obviously watch it. I don’t think a PJ [private jet] is worth it.\"",
      "Despite that, Littler has claimed that United have already given him inspiration this season. He suggested that the side’s FA Cup defeat to Fulham earlier this term had pushed him on to reach the UK Open semi-finals.",
      "He said: \"Obviously I am happy, I'm into the final of the UK Open at my third attempt. But in the second break I heard about the Manchester United loss so it spurred me on a bit, won the next five.”"

      "He said: \"I have no doubt that we are playing better. So we have to take all the heat. At this moment we are losing games in the Premier League. We are fighting for the Europe league and Thursday is the most important game for us.\"",
      "Amorim also added: \"We started well, we controlled quite well and then throw-ins and set-pieces was a problem for us, but that is normal for us because we didn't have the height with the team.\"",

The Professional Match Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) chief will reportedly announce new losses of nearly £1million next week.",
      "That figure comes in additions to losses suffered last year that saw a £379,000 figures adjusted to £1.8m. That means the group now have a loss of £3.4m totalled over the last three years.",
      "Webb will make it clears to those across the topflight that they will need to increase their budgets if they want to see the standard of refereeing improve. VAR's introduction back in 2019 has added greater scrutiny but has also seen a huge rise in costs.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has doubled down on his claim that United made a huge blunder by selling Scott McTominay. The Red Devils academy was allowed quit Old Trafford last summer and headed to Italy with Napoli. He cost the Serie A leaders £21m and the midfielder has gone on to be an inspired signing - scoring 12 times as he eyes a title triumph.",
      "McTominay was a favourite under Solskjaer throughout his time in charge in Manchester and he often stuck by the Scot, despite calls for him to drop the player in favour of an upgrade. Now the decision to let him go looks a shocker and the former United boss is stunned.",
      "He told the BBC : \"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%. How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\""

      "Manchester United are ready to enter the race to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo, who's been linked with Liverpool and Newcastle. Mbeumo, 25, was part of the Bees side who won 4-3 against United on Sunday and the Red Devils were watching his individual performance closely.",

There's no point in speculating now about whether he'll be there. He's had several opportunities to leave and he'll make the decision he wants, because he'll have more options.\""

Betis are unlikely to be able to afford to finance a permanent deal for the former Ajax man, however, and not only are Atletico keeping a close eye on the situation, they have already enquired about a potential summer deal according to reports in Spain.",

      "Cunha suits the system Amorim uses and he is tipped to leave Wolves despite his recent commitment to the club. Vitor Pereira has made an instant impact at Molineux but Wolves have seen some of their top players move on when the bigger outfits have come calling - Matheus Nunes being a recent example when he headed to Manchester City.",

      "And as Ruben Amorim decorated the road to Bilbao with the ruins of Manchester United ’s 16th Premier League defeat this season, former Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen’s famous soundbite proved devastatingly accurate. Don’t fall for any salesmen’s patter about this being a seven-goal thriller.",
      "Brentford put the third-youngest line-up in Premier League history to the sword to keep the Bees on the scent of pollen and honey in Europe next season. Copenhagen-on-Thames is a nice day out for a stroll along the Thames towpath or crossing the bridge to see the Great Pagoda in Kew Gardens, but for United it has often contained all the charms of a minefield.",
      "Three years ago, in a prologue to his rancorous exit, Cristiano Ronaldo threw a monumental strop when unlamented interim manager Ralf Rangnick dared to substitute him here. Seven months later, Erik ten Hag’s reign was almost stillborn when United shipped four goals in the opening 45 minutes, a debacle which led to Harry Maguire being stripped of the captaincy.",
      "And now, with one foot in the Europa League final, Amorim risked further ignominy by making eight changes. There is nothing wrong with promoting youth, and nobody does it better than the club who gave us the Busby Babes and the Class of ’92.",
      "But with an average age of 22 years and 270 days, United's starting XI was only behind Middlesbrough against Fulham in May 2006 (20 years, 181 days) and Arsenal ’s side against Portsmouth in 2009 (22 years, 237 days) for inexperience. And at 17 years 156 days, striker Chido Obi became the youngest United player to start a Premier League game as Amorim channelled his inner Star Wars fanboy: May the fourth be with you, Obi.",
      "Yet if the Premier League is an unforgiving environment for Babybel kids in a jungle of big cheeses, at least it does not diminish the audacity of youth, and after 14 minutes the Cub Devils had the temerity to go in front. Alejandro Garnacho’s low, first-time cross was turned home from six yards by Mason Mount, his first goal since March 2024 and only his second for United - both against the Bees.",
      "Mount’s career at Old Trafford has been permanently stuck on the launch-pad awaiting take-off, and at 26 he is in danger of having a bright future behind him. Much the same can be said of United’s dreadful domestic campaign, and two goals in six minutes soon disabused them of the fanciful notion that the kids would be all right.",
      "First Mikkel Damsgaard poked Michael Kayode’s header beyond Altay Bayindir at his near post, with the help of a telling deflection off acting United skipper Luke Shaw, for the equaliser. Then, with Matthijs De Ligt lying on the floor and signalling that he would need to be replaced, Christian Norgaard charged into the gap behind the stricken Dutchman and crossed for Kevin Schade to plunder his 10th goal of the season with a soaring header.",
      "United’s token protests to referee Anthony Taylor that he should have intervened fell on deaf ears and, in fairness, the law is explicit: Play is only stopped in the event of head injuries. Maybe if players didn’t roll around feigning mortal wounds, genuine cases of distress like De Ligt’s thigh problem would be taken more seriously.",
      "Bravely United waited until the last 20 minutes to fold after De Ligt’s limping evacuation, but it was pitiful stuff. Schade was unmarked on the far post to head home Bryan Mbeumo’s deflected cross, and four minutes later the remnants of Amorim’s defence were sliced open again, Yoane Wissa rolling his 18th goal of the season into an empty net from Kayode’s pass.",
      "The persevering Garnacho’s 25-yard rocket was useful damage limitation, and substitute Amad, making his first Premier League appearance since February, added another in stoppage time. But United’s window dressing was fooling nobody.",
      "They will have to keep it much tighter on the shop floor against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night."

      "United's youthful team even hit the front after 14 minutes when Mason Mount finished a neat one-touch move from six yards after being teed up by Alejandro Garnacho. But they had to weather an early storm to do so and Brentford got the leveller their play merited just over 10 minutes later when a Mikkel Damsgaard effort was diverted into the back of United's net by Luke Shaw. They then turned the game completely on its head through Kevin Schade just six minutes later to leave United shellshocked.",
      "The visitors improved after the break as Amorim turned to his bench. But a second from Schade and another goal from Yoane Wissa helped Brentford over the line as goals from Garnacho and Amad helped set up a grandstand finish.",
      "United may have struck first but it was Brentford who were in the ascendancy from the word go. They were slick and purposeful going forward and it always felt like the pressure would eventually tell on a youthful Manchester United team, even if Mount's 14th minute opener wasn't in the script for the hosts.",
      "This result keeps them in the mix for European qualification and on this evidence - plus the fixtures they have outstanding - you wouldn't bet against them. Thomas Frank has been given his flowers on more than one occasion during Brentford's top-flight tenure but he deserves so much more. Quite how one of the 'Big Six' have not come calling is beyond belief given the managerial turnover we've seen in some quarters. The only danger for Brentford is that more of the same - and a European tour - could change that.",
      "United had won just three of their previous 21 Premier League games played in London prior to their joust with the Bees. And while this loss may not be as bruising as some of the 15 they had suffered beforehand in the league given their personnel changes, their latest showing in the capital certainly won't live long in the memory.",
      "Bar the odd moment - particularly their opening goal - United look second best all over the pitch against a Brentford side who were snapping at their heels. If anything, Amorim's men were fortunate to make it to the break just one goal behind as the hosts unloaded a barrage of attacks on them towards the end of the first-half, with Altay Bayindir putting a nervy start behind him to keep the Bees at bay.",
      "But he couldn't keep Brentford at bay as the hosts gleefully set about laying down a market to their European rivals - even if they did have to survive a late scare.",
      "United can still salvage what has been a sorry season with victory in the Europa League, which would land them a golden ticket to the Champions League next year. So Amorim absolutely made the right move in shuffling his pack and resting a host of his more established stars given United are going nowhere fast in the Premier League standings between now and the end of the month.",
      "But United did not leave the capital unscathed with Matthijs de Ligt suffering an injury in the build-up to Brentford's second goal. The former Bayern Munich man did not look at all comfortable as he left the pitch and it wouldn't be a surprise to see him miss the biggest match of United's season on Thursday when they try and book their spot in the Europa League final.",
      "That will be a bitter pill to swallow for both him and Amorim, who would have been desperate to head back up the M1 with a clean bill of health.",
      "In an era where tactics are king and players are drilled to within an inch of their life, the havoc that Brentford's Michael Kayode caused with his long throws was almost refreshing.",
      "Manchester United looked vulnerable from set-pieces all afternoon and it was no surprise that their leveller came from the second phase of a Kayode special. It was the Italian who beat Harry Amass in the air to keep the play alive and Brentford bagged the ultimate reward. The 20-year-old is no one-trick pony, though: he was just as impressive in open play and will only get better as he acclimatises to the Premier League.",
      "United's recruitment is often scrutinised but Brentford more than often get it right in the transfer market. Kayode - signed on loan with an option in January - looks like another win.",
      "Manchester United are in need of a big summer if they are to banish this sorry season to the history books. Bryan Mbeumo is just one of a host of players who have been linked with United in recent weeks, and Sunday's game was the perfect occasion for him to show why.",
      "And even on a quiet afternoon, the Cameroon international conjured up some magic in the second half to put the game beyond United, awaking from his slumber to put the ball on a plate for Brentford's third goal.",
      "Mbuemo, 25, is versatile, deadly in the final third and affordable when compared to some of United's previous transfer dealings. This may not have been the complete 'audition' of sorts if United are mulling over a move, but Mbuemo's quality is undeniable. His assist underlined that and how United could do with somebody capable of conjuring up moments like that to ease the burden on Bruno Fernandes."

      "Asked about whether his selection was as a result of the Europa League, Amorim said: \"It is really hard, because we also want to improve our [position in the] table.",

Manchester United would stand to benefit financially if Greenwood were to move on again due to a sell-on clause which was inserted in the deal that took him across the channel last summer.",

      "Victor Osimhen has cooled talk of a move to the Premier League by hinting he wants to “continue” with Galatasaray. The Nigerian hitman was one of the most sought-after strikers in world football last season.",
      "Chelsea were strongly linked with a move for him but failed to thrash out a deal with Osimhen’s parent club Napoli. Manchester United were also reportedly interested in him.",
      "And with Osimhen’s loan deal with Galatasaray set to expire this summer - and little chance of him having a future in Italy - the Premier League duo could reignite their interest. He could potentially be even cheaper with a reported price tag of around £40m.",
      "But it appears that Osimhen has no interest in moving on from Galatasaray. He said: “It’s a great feeling. It’s great that they [young fans] are inspired by watching me, that they are wearing the masks. I thank God. I hadn’t seen this much before coming to Galatasaray.",
      "“Everyone showing this much love, the children shouting at the tunnel exit… I will continue to make them proud. The team winning, me scoring… I want to continue as they know me. If I can inspire my teammates’ children, that makes me very happy.”",
      "Osimhen has enjoyed a sensational season with his loan club. His brace against Sivasspor on Saturday saw him make it 33 goals throughout the campaign in all competitions.",
      "And that saw him eclipse the 31 that he netted for Napoli during the 2022/23 season as the Italian side ended their long wait for the Italian crown. Speaking about his achievement, Osimhen added: “It was important to break my record in my first season.",
      "\"I am at one of the most important clubs in the world. The biggest club in Türkiye. I would like to thank my family and friends for helping me. I would like to thank the technical team and the club staff.",
      "“They never left me alone. This season is a memory that I will remember for the rest of my life. Apart from goals and assists, I like to help the team. I want to get the ball in the future, help the midfield, do my best for the team. The team comes first for me.",
      "“When I convert opportunities into goals, it makes me happy. The important thing is not Victor Osimhen, but the team. Roland is also very important. We can say the same thing for Mario, Torreira and Sanchez.”"

      "Since moving to the Midlands, Rashford has become a key player for Villa under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and six assists. Villa do have the option to make his move a long-term one and have a £40million option inserted into the loan deal which saw him move in January.",
      "In a setback for both Villa and Rashford, the club's academy graduate has suffered a hamstring injury. It remains uncertain whether he will return to the pitch this season.",

      "Ruben Amorim had called it. \"Not the best moment\" to play the kids, he said recently. Manchester United's young guns might now also understand why their manager was cautious about chucking them in at the deep end this season.",
      "If this is a case of sink or swim, then the third youngest team in Premier League history were gasping for air at the Gtech Community Stadium. This won't be an afternoon that will wreck promising careers, but it could certainly be a setback.",
      "Tyler Fredricson had a promising start but was replaced by Victor Lindelof as he began to struggle. Chido Obi might have signed up to Rasmus Hojlund's strikers' union on his return to the away dressing rooms after this chastening effort.",
      "It's worth revisiting Amorim's comments from a couple of weeks ago about the danger of throwing the kids in during a domestic campaign that has become an embarrassment to the club.",
      "\"It's not the best moment or the best season to put some kids to play because again they need a strong base to really show what they can do, but in this moment we need to do it,\" Amorim said.",
      "You can't really argue with that, but you can also see why United's head coach was reluctant to do what he had to do at Brentford. The result was a 16th defeat of the season and another rough afternoon.",
      "Before kick-off, there had been excitement at the United line-up. At 17 years and 155 days, Obi became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for United. He was the junior member of a very junior team. With an average age of 22 years and 270 days, this was the third youngest team to start a Premier League game for any club.",
      "It didn't feel like that was the case when the team dropped, but youngsters such as 20-year-olds Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho have so much first-team experience that it can be easy to forget their tender years. Six members of the starting XI were 20 or younger, with Harry Amass, Fredricson, and Patrick Dorgu rounding off that number.",
      "The focus was on Obi, however, as it always is when a prolific goalscorer at academy levels begins to try and make the ascent to first-team football. The former Arsenal youngster has already seen just how taxing that rise can be.",
      "He has 14 goals in 15 games this season at youth level, but his cameos for the first team have shown how raw he is. He had chances against Fulham in the FA Cup but has toiled without reward otherwise.",
      "Amorim's comments about this not being the right time to play youngsters had a caveat: The head coach didn't think he had any other option. Europa League progression and the catastrophic state of their Premier League season have rendered these games exercises of survival.",
      "As soon as Joshua Zirkzee's season came to a premature end last month, it was clear Obi was going to be needed. In his first start and his longest run out yet, he got an understanding of why Amorim was concerned about exposing too many youngsters. You only need to look at Hojlund's body language to see what a thankless task playing No.9 for this team can be.",
      "Obi did scrap hard against Nathan Collins, but academy level doesn't prepare you for physical battles with 6ft 4in centre-backs with years of strength training behind them. On a couple of occasions Altay Bayindir sent long balls up for Obi to try and challenge for against Collins.",
      "That is exactly the kind of pass that Andre Onana often sends Hojlund's way, and gets a volley of abuse back in return. Obi isn't going to complain just yet but he can't have appreciated it either. He battled away manfully but got little change out of the Republic of Ireland international.",
      "When Luke Shaw then sent a free-kick spinning down the left channel, the kind of aimless ball forward that tells a striker 'chase that', it was met with an exasperated wave of the arms from Ruben Amorim. Obi was never in contention to win the race for the ball.",
      "It summed up his first half that he had just eight touches, half as many as the next lowest for United, which was Garnacho with 16.",
      "One of the problems for United's striker is that you can go through long spells of not being involved in the game, so when the chance does come, you're not ready for it. Obi had half an opportunity when Christian Eriksen's cross picked him out, but he failed to connect with his header. Even had he done so, it was a difficult chance.",
      "He deserves credit for sticking at it, however. His best opportunity came in the final minute, when perseverance saw him carve out half-a-yard of space in the box, before his shot from an angle was blocked.",
      "He won't be judged on this outing. You only have to watch Hojlund play to know how difficult it is for a striker here. Of the 39 shots United had against Bournemouth and Athletic Club last week, their striker had one.",
      "Now Obi understands his plight. At most clubs, it is the goalkeepers who stick together. At this one, it's their strikers who should have each other's backs."

      "The £60million man has quickly emerged as a favourite under Amorim but his injuries have held him back since his move from Chelsea, while the competition for places in the attacking midfield areas has also hindered him.",
      "His goal at the Gtech Community Stadium was just his second in 42 games for the club - his first came at the same stadium last season - but Amorim believes he has the qualities to get into the box and into promising attacking positions.",
      "\"It’s not just the finish, it’s the position that he has on the pitch, he’s like a third midfielder who can reach the box, he’s really intelligent, so he’s getting there,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"And he trains really hard, sometimes I have to push him back, take him out of the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We have to take care of him, I’m really happy with him.\"",
      "Mount was one of the more senior players in a youthful United side, which featured six players 20 or younger and was the third youngest to ever begin a Premier League game.",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest United player to start a Premier League game, completing the full 90 minutes, and while Amorim praised his desire to stay in the fight, he also hinted at a lack of experience in his game.",

      "\"Again, they did quite well. Chido fought all game but you can feel he’s really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body. He’s going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these kind of games, this is the best way.",
      "\"So we can take that positive, the rest we didn’t win points so just that.\"",
      "The defeat was United's 16th of the league season and leaves them 15th in the table with three games to play and Amorim sounded like he was at the end of his tether as he implored his players to learn from this setback.",
      "\"It’s really important. They have to understand this season is really important, we cannot do this any more.,\" he said.",
      "\"This kind of season, we need to change that, they need to understand what is to play for Manchester United. I think they did really well, they are not playing so much but they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change other players to save them for Thursday and we can help even more the young kids.",
      "\"Especially Tyler (Fredricson) did quite well. For the third goal he needs more help from Amad. So these small things I think we can help them more but I’m really happy for the young kids.\""

      "Brentford played on to score and United weren't happy about that, but they would have been more unhappy about seeing the Dutch defender limp off in a lot of discomfort.",

      "Back on the pitch, the defensive work drew applause from De Ligt and Shaw, who were again impressed by the 20-year-old. He had a tougher time of it in the second half but there were signs he has what it takes.",
      "Mount's favourite place",
      "A return of two goals in 42 appearances for the club is disappointing for a player of Mount's ability and it's a quirk that both of his goals have come in this stadium.",
      "He took this one well after a slick move and had a chance to get another in the second half, only to send both of his efforts at goalkeeper Mark Flekken.",

      "United's players finished their warm-up with the usual shooting drill against the third-choice goalkeeper, which on this occasion was Andre Onana.",
      "Harry Amass produced the pick of the finishes, drilling a low left-footed shot across Onana and into the corner of the goal. Manuel Ugarte went for pure power, slamming a shot down the centre that beat Onana.",
      "The wildest effort came from the striker. Chido Obi had one shot saved and then went for a powerful effort towards the top corner, only to get under the ball and send it sailing well over the crossbar and into the stand behind the goal."

They were much more forgiving than the invective aimed at the spineless players after their last four-goal humbling at the same stadium two seasons ago.",
      "United's followers sang about a second trip to Bilbao in May seconds after kick-off. They should be reassured that Ruben Amorim will judge this United squad on their preposterous Premier League campaign, rather than the possibility of a new attraction in the club museum.",
      "The numbers are stark: 15th in the league, -9 goal difference, 16 defeats and ten wins from 35 matches. United have still not hit the 40-point mark. All after investing £200million in the squad in the summer under a manager they did not want to keep.",
      "After Kevin Schade put Brentford 3-1 up, the away end broke into a chorus of \"'Cause United are going to Bilbao\". They did so again after the fourth, outsinging the Brentford denizens. United's players have earned a reprieve through their Europa League form.",
      "United are just like watching Seville in that competition. Not in the Premier League. That has been a write off since the start of the calendar year and they have the good fortune to be surrounded by West Ham United and Tottenham, two teams still below them in a loveless marriage with their manager.",
      "Even the worst domestic United team in 51 years has an aura. Brentford fans were audibly apprehensive when seven added minutes were announced with the scoreline 4-2. Amad's first goal on his Premier League return suggested they were right to be concerned. Unlike last week, there was not an added-time equaliser for United.",
      "Amorim started the third-youngest-ever Premier League side, a trick of the mind given the strength of the United squad that travelled to West London. Twenty-year-olds Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo have played for the club more than 200 times between them. The former got the goal of the game.",
      "Chido Obi was United's youngest starter in the Premier League and it was apparent why he had to wait three months for a full debut after his emergence at Tottenham. Against Brentford's imposing three-man backline, Obi looked exactly what he is: an underdeveloped 17-year-old rookie.",
      "Amorim smacked his hands together in the 50th minute in an attempt to jolt a meandering performance. The introductions of Amad and Leny Yoro upped the seniority, if not the average age yet Amorim was still dissatisfied 12 minutes later, demanding the ball be played more urgently. United never really got it rolling.",
      "1,725 United fans were tucked away in the snooker-table pocket of an away end. The game was not 25 minutes old and they had aired their paeans to Ji-sung Park, Wes Brown, Jaap Stam, John O'Shea, Andy Cole, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Roy Keane.",
      "The sequence was only interrupted by Luke Shaw's own goal. Captaining United for the first time, Shaw almost nodded past Altay Bayindir in the third minute before he deflected Mikkel Damsgaard's hooked cross into his own net.",
      "Tyler Fredricson continued from where he left off against Wolves, his commanding defending in front of the away section causing an eruption from his fellow Mancunians. Shaw and Matthijs de Ligt applauded him heartily. Eventually, Fredricson was outmuscled through Brentford's aerial prowess.",
      "Still, Fredricson had a better afternoon than his fellow centre halves. De Ligt was piqued by Brentford's goal at Old Trafford when he was ordered off to have blood cleaned from his crown. This time, De Ligt was down and out on the pitch as Brentford played on to score.",
      "Amorim shook his head. That reaction might have been reserved for Patrick Dorgu's dozy defending at the far post. Amorim checked on De Ligt, clutching his knee and leaning on physio Jordan Reece, as he limped towards the tunnel.",
      "Shaw and Dorgu followed De Ligt off at half-time. Dorgu was only scheduled to play 45 minutes in the absence of a senior right winger when he ought to have been on the bench or back in Manchester with Noussair Mazraoui. Shaw's withdrawal felt more tactical than planned as United strove to avoid another league loss.",
      "The 39-year-old Tom Heaton should feel hard done by, watching Bayindir. Brentford fans sounded optimistic whenever the ball was played to Andre Onana's deputy and the sole surprise of his first-half performance was that Bayindir made two stops to keep United only one goal behind.",
      "As iffy as Bayindir's kicking was, it was his opposite number who played his team into trouble. Mainoo and Garnacho were still only just inside the Brentford half when they collaborated incisively for Mount to tap in on his first start since December 15.",
      "Both of Mount's goals for United have come at Brentford and this was considerably earlier than his 96th-minute effort last year. United are not as chaotic as back then but they are worse. In the Premier League, at least.",

      "Ruben Amorim's United ran riot at San Mames, as Casemiro's header and a brace from Bruno Fernandes helped them secure a comfortable first leg win and Bilbao have a mountain to climb in the battle to reach this month's final. But despite the three-goal margin, Valverde is not giving up hope.",
      "The Spaniard believes his side can spark a dramatic comeback and still go through to the Europa League final, but he will be hoping he has his best players available.",
      "One player that won't be available, however, is Dani Vivian, who will be suspended for the match against United. The defender was sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity in the first leg at the San Mames and will now serve a one-match ban in a huge blow for the Basque outfit.",
      "In terms of injuries, Sancet, who missed the first leg with a muscle issue, is fighting to get back fit and could return to face United in the second leg. Meanwhile, Spain star Williams played 79 minutes in Bilbao before being substituted, though there were concerns over his fitness beforehand.",

Speaking after Athletic Club were held to a goalless draw against Real Sociedad - another team that United have beaten in the Europa League this season - the ex-Barcelona boss said: \"Sancet is doing quite well, and Nico, week by week, we're trying to get him back on his feet. We'll see what's coming next.\"",
      "Valverde then assessed his side's chances of overturning the 3-0 deficit and getting to the Europa League final, which will be played at Athletic Club's San Mames on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "He said: \"Football is unpredictable. I'm convinced you tell the Manchester United manager after the first few minutes that they're going into halftime at 3-0 and he doesn't believe it .",
      "\"We don't know what might happen. We know it's difficult and complicated, but nothing is set in stone, and we can't forgive ourselves for not trying.\""

      "Manchester United coach Ruben Amorim clarified Luke Shaw's half-time substitution against Brentford was in response to Matthijs de Ligt's first-half withdrawal.",
      "De Ligt was forced off in the 35th minute in his first Premier League start in a month, having sustained an apparent knee injury seconds before Brentford went 2-1 ahead.",
      "Shaw, who captained United, made way for Leny Yoro at the interval along with Patrick Dorgu, who was replaced by Amad. Dorgu started in the 3-0 Europa League semi-final first leg victory at Athletic Bilbao on Thursday and was only expected to play a half at Brentford.",
      "United are already without centre halves Lisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven for the semi-final second leg against Athletic and De Ligt could be unavailable again.",
      "Amorim said he had \"no idea\" if De Ligt would recover for the return leg on Thursday. \"With Mattha, we don’t know what will happen on Thursday. If we don’t have Luke Shaw available, we can have a problem and then we don’t have enough defenders for the game.",
      "\"Is Shaw injured? No, no, no. What I am saying is we have to protect some players at half-time thinking about Thursday, was just that, not thinking about the game.\"",
      "Amorim could be seen shaking his head after Brentford played on with De Ligt seeking medical treatment. Kevin Schade scored from Christian Norgaard's cross and referee Anthony Taylor was not obliged to halt play as De Ligt did not suffer a head injury.",
      "\"I will not comment on that,\" Amorim said of the incident. \"The important thing is to have Mattha, not thinking about Thursday. Not a big issue, is the only thing I ask is not to have him available for this game or whatever is going to happen in the future.",
      "\"I just don’t want a big issue because we had a problem with Licha. With Mattha, I don’t know. I’m just talking, I have no idea. He could be training in three days, I don’t know.\"",
      "United went 1-0 up at Brentford through Mason Mount's second goal for the club in the 14th minute yet Brentford went 4-1 up before late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Amad threatened another United comeback.",
      "The result marked United's 16th league loss of the season, the first time they have lost that many since 1989-90. United are winless in six league games and have won six out of 24 overall under Amorim.",
      "\"I think it’s a little bit a reflection of our season,\" Amorim added of the result. \"We start quite well, controlling the game, not creating big chances, but controlling the pace of the game.",
      "\"We suffer a lot with throw-ins and set pieces but we already knew our team would struggle against this team, we didn’t have the height necessary for this kind of game. They score twice in these kind of moments, even with Mattha on the floor.",
      "\"And in the second half, I felt we were near the draw and then we suffer a goal and like some other times we disconnect and then another goal three or five minutes later. We pushed forward and tried to score, we scored twice but didn’t have time to do better.\""

      "Amorim made eight changes to his starting team to face Brentford and Mount made his first start since returning from injury. Mount opened the scoring in the 14th minute after a superb cross from Alejandro Garnacho, but Brentford responded brilliantly and they led 2-1 by half-time.",
      "Brentford extended their advantage in the second half, with Kevin Schade and Yoane Wissa scoring goals in quick succession to give the home side a 4-1 lead with 17 minutes to play.",
      "But United didn't give up and Garnacho popped up with a stunning goal in the 82nd minute.",

      "\"We can perform better in the game. We still need to perform. There were changes, but it's Manchester United so any team that goes out there that puts on the shirt we need to perform and win games. I know there's a big game on Thursday but first and foremost was today.",
      "\"We needed to win the game but we didn't. It was too late when they scored four.\"",
      "Mount did agree that United showed some personality in the defeat. \"We've shown that before,\" he said. \"We never let the game go until the final whistle but we can't let ourselves get in that position. It's a bit of personality and character but we shouldn't get in that position.\"",
      "He was asked about the Europa Legaue and added: \"It's a massive end to the season. We have a big game on Thursday. It doesn't matter the scoreline. We attack it like it's 0-0. We know what we need to do.",
      "\"We can get into the Champions League next season and that's the most important thing. The season we've had in the Premier League is something we need to look at massively, but if we can get into final and win that it's a positive end to the season.\""

      "Despite taking a giant stride towards the final, Ruben Amorim will take nothing for granted, and he opted to rest several big-name players against Brentford. The United starting XI was: Bayindir, Fredricson, Shaw, De Ligt, Amass, Dorgu, Mainoo, Ugarte, Garnacho, Obi, Mount.",

      "Started where he left off against Wolves and sent the United fans into raptures with some commanding defending. Brentford did seize on his lack of physique for two goals. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Went down injured in the move for Brentford's goal and soon made way with an apparently separate issue to the foot injury that recently kept him out. 5",

      "Captained United for the first time as their longest-serving starter and wasn't at it. Came off at half-time for Leny Yoro. 4",

      "Brentford's long throw-ins have caused problems all afternoon and they came close to scoring there, with Wissa looming at the back post after an intelligent flick on header.",
      "Mount replaced by Eriksen, who knows this place well after spending a season with Brentford.",
      "Amad just tried to make something happen by bursting down the right side. United have lacked intensity since falling behind and perhaps the winger can inject some life into them.",
      "Garnacho booked, which is the second yellow card of the game for United.",
      "The ball fell to Mount on the edge of the box, but his shot was tame and easily gathered.",

      "The game sandwiched between their two semi final clashes with Athletic Bilbao was a trip to Brentford. De Ligt started the game at the Gtech Community Stadium having played 25 minutes of the victory over Athletic Bilbao following his return from injury, but his afternoon's work was over after just 35 minutes.",
      "The Dutchman entered into a 50-50 challenge with Yoane Wissa before signalling that he had picked up a knock. He had to be replaced by Harry Maguire and it is unclear whether he will be available for Thursday's semi final second leg.",
      "United were trailing 2-1 at the time of the incident. Mason Mount had put United ahead early on with a cool finish following Alejandro Garnacho's cross.",
      "Read the full story here.",

      "Garnacho",
      "Fine cross for the goal. 6",
      "Obi",
      "Out of his depth. 4",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Ugarte booked for a cyincal foul - Wissa was away and he pulled him to the ground.",
      "That’s the first time Brentford have properly preyed on Fredricson’s underdeveloped frame and it was some rare good goalkeeping from Bayindir.",
      "United have gone to pot now. We have barely turned our necks left towards the Brentford goal as it has been one-way traffic since Shaw’s own goal. Not many starters are emerging from this half with any credit, at this rate.",
      "Tom Heaton is hard done by not to be playing in this. Apart from two penalty saves at Arsenal, there is no evidence that Bayindir is better than him. Onana was always going to be safe with Bayindir as back-up. He has had an error-strewn half.",
      "Brentford are now playing at the level we have come to expect of them against United at home. They were dormant until that fortuitous equaliser but United have barely attacked since then.",
      "Obi might have a bit of sympathy with Hojlund after his first 38 minutes here. That free-kick from Shaw was an aimless, pointless punt into the corner that basically told a striker ‘chase that’. He never had a chance of getting there. United’s service into him has been diabolical, as it always is with Hojlund. After Shaw took that free-kick Amorim waved his arms in the air to ask ‘what’s that?’. He has a right to expect his players to take better care of the ball.",
      "The bigger issue for United isn’t the goal but the injury to De Ligt. Who would have been a nailed-on starter in a Europa League final but might now be a doubt for that game. All speculative at this stage but he seemed to know he was in trouble immediately. Maguire on for him when he was probably looking forward to a longer rest."

United are then set to play ASEAN All Stars in Kuala Lumpur on May 28 and they will play in Hong Kong two days later, before finally giving the players the chance for a break.",
      "It's understood the post-season trip will generate roughly £10million and United CEO Omar Berrada said: “We appreciate the amazing level of support that Manchester United enjoys around the world.",

      "Just three days after the Premier League ended last season, Tottenham and Newcastle played a post-season friendly in Australia and they were criticised for the strain put on their squads.",
      "Premier League clubs must comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules, meaning such trips could become the norm, despite growing concerns about an already heavy workload for players.",

      "United beat Rangers 2-1 in the Europa League and the Scottish club were supported by a sold-out away section, but their fans also acquired tickets in the home section of Old Trafford.",
      "The club said they took the \"strictest possible measures to prevent sales to away fans in home areas\" and launched an investigation. The findings of that investigation identified just over 1,500 Rangers fans in the home section, and many of those sat near O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane's season tickets.",
      "After the Rangers game, O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane were informed they had been sanctioned and they were not allowed to use their season tickets for the remainder of the season.",
      "O’Shaughnessy attended the match with his family members, including his 12-year-old nephew.",
      "United wrongly identified O’Shaughnessy, whose road surfacing company is based in Heywood, Greater Manchester, as a Rangers fan because his nephew was spotted on CCTV standing to his feet and taking photos when Rangers scored in the 88th minute. His nephew does not support Rangers.",
      "O’Shaughnessy was shocked to learn his season tickets had been suspended and appealed. He also lodged a complaint with the IFO and considered legal action after weeks of frustrating correspondence with the club.",
      "Their professionalism has been praised by a United spokesperson and their season tickets have now been reinstated, meaning they can attend the Athletic Bilbao game on Thursday night, but they have wrongly missed each game at Old Trafford since the Rangers match on January 23.",
      "That means they were forced to miss the special 5-4 win against Lyon in the quarter-finals of the Europa League last month. And to make that worse, it transpired that their tickets were resold for that game.",
      "United have not apologised to O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane, but have offered a small gift to his nephew. The experience has left a sour taste in their mouths and they have felt \"voiceless.\"",
      "\"It's been a nightmare,\" Cunnane told the MEN. \"Initially, they said we took away fans, and that away fan turned out to be a small boy who was just cheering a goal at Old Trafford. He isn't by any stretch a Rangers fan, he's actually a Bolton fan.",
      "\"When we made that point, they came back and said we didn't scan our tickets properly, as we didn't distribute them to who attended. Luke said he was going with them, they were his tickets and they went into the ground together, so they said, 'well, you didn't do it right'.",
      "\"They asked for documentation to back it up, and he had that because he made a record of the phone call he made, with the day and time. They listened back to the call and reinstated the tickets.",
      "\"They blamed us for one thing, then when that didn't stick, they blamed us for something else. I've been ill with them. To be treated like that is unbelievable and it's gone on for months.\"",
      "Cunnane is business partners with O’Shaughnessy. Their four corporate season tickets in the Evolution Suite cost £30,000 per season. \"We have promised clients games and we've had to go back on our word to them. It has made us look foolish in front of our clients,\" Cunnane said.",
      "\"It's been a farce. I've copied in the chairman and the CEO on some of the emails. I've got a list as long as my arm for the emails I've sent. It's been so frustrating. I come into work to do a job, but I've had to spend time emailing them and that's been getting my goat up.",

A goal went in, so he jumped up, but he did that because everyone around him jumped up, and everyone around him was a Rangers fan. You can see Luke on the CCTV looking angry and sitting with his arms crossed.\"",
      "O’Shaughnessy said: \"They can clearly see we haven't done anything wrong, they made a mistake and it just needed to be rectified.",
      "\"It's been an awful experience from start to finish. We were already angry at missing the Lyon game and the fact that they've sold them to other people.",
      "\"You think, hold on a minute, we're still fighting our corner here. I was told I didn't have to transfer the tickets and that was recorded on the phone, so there is no arguing that. They had to reinstate them, but they haven't officially come out and said to us 'we've got this wrong', 'we're sorry' or 'what can we do to make it up to you'. There has been none of that.",

      "O’Shaughnessy continued: \"If we were guilty of something, we'd hold our hands up and take it on the chin, but we didn't do anything wrong. I was at the game and we were surrounded by Rangers fans. They were everywhere.",
      "\"That's why we were taken aback by being told we were being sanctioned for it. We were the only real United fans in our section, so it was really bizarre. For a good couple of months, it felt like we were on our own and we had no voice to speak out. It was their decision and that was it.\"",
      "O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane now have to go through an official refund process to try to claim back the money for the games they missed, but that won't compensate them for missing the Lyon match, in particular.",

      "Manchester United are hopeful of getting £42.5million for Antony this summer, it has been claimed. The Brazilian, 25, has been in fine form for Real Betis since his loan move in January, scoring six goals and adding four assists.",
      "Although there has been some talk that Antony could attempt to resurrect his career at Old Trafford, a permanent summer exit appears to be the most probable outcome.",
      "The Mirror report that Betis believe that Antony is keen to extend his stay beyond the current season, and the forward has already given his word. However, United are holding off formal transfer negotiations until the end of the campaign, as both clubs are fighting for European glory.",
      "United are also thought to be keen to allow other clubs the chance to express an interest in Antony, with Atletico Madrid having enquired about the player's availability.",
      "It's added that the Reds are determined to drive an auction for Antony's signature, as they are aware that Betis might struggle to match their financial demands. United are growing optimistic they can recoup up to £42.5m for Antony - half the amount the club paid for him three years ago.",
      "Antony found the back of the net for Betis during their Conference League semi-final first leg win over Fiorentina on Thursday. He has made quite the impression at the Seville-based club, helping them squeeze nearer to the Champions League places in La Liga and on the verge of a European final.",
      "Speaking on Antony's future last Saturday, Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo confirmed the club are working on a permanent deal for the former Ajax man. \"It is a source of satisfaction on a personal level [to have brought Antony to Real Betis], but it is the result of teamwork,\" he said.",
      "\"Although I am responsible for the sporting management, there are many people involved in this signing. It’s still early, but we will try in different ways to do everything possible to continue enjoying Antony.\"",
      "Betis manager Manuel Pellegrini has voiced his satisfaction with Antony and is keen to keep him at the club for the upcoming season. \"I see Antony very involved in the team, in the group, in the institution,\" Pellegrini said. \"We would all be happy if he stayed, but now we have to focus on the present.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim, meanwhile, hinted that Antony could return to United and be part of his plans next season. \"All the players on loan will return and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season,\" Amorim said last month. \"When you put a player on loan, the best thing is for them to perform.",
      "\"All these [loan] players have talent and they have to put that on the team.\""

      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.2\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remain in sniffing distance of a European place.",
      "",
      "3) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +2.9\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 73.8% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, making him the favourite for the Golden Gloves award. Which he would deserve rather more than David Raya.",
      "",
      "4) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.7\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.5\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with a clean sheet v Bournemouth.",

      "6) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +2.4\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "7) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham): +2.3\nMade eight saves to protect a point v Bournemouth as the old man proved he’s still got what it takes. Was excellent v Brighton, particularly to save a deflected effort from Yasin Ayari, and then made a series of saves v Southampton before being stretchered off with a head injury. Returned to over-concede v Fulham but he was at least on the winning side. He under-conceded v Palace and lost. Now on the West Ham bench.",

      "",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",

      "",
      "12) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +0.9\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich.",

      "13) Alisson (Liverpool): +0.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",

      "",
      "15) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.8\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted.",
      "",
      "16) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): -0.8\nCulpable once again as Villa lost a crucial clash with Manchester City; that Bernardo Silva goal had a PSxG of just 0.28. Has conceded more goals than Jordan Pickford this season from a very, very similar PSxG in the same number of Premier League games this season.",
      "",
      "17) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",

      "Leeds would ordinarily be entirely reluctant to sacrifice a game of such magnitude against a bitter rival, but finding it sandwiched between Champions League first group stage games against Besiktas in Turkey and at home Barcelona three days either side, it was deemed necessary.",
      "Manchester United fully punished that insolence with a comfortable enough win at Old Trafford which featured an own goal from 20-year-old Matt Jones. But Leeds will not have regretted their decision as two draws in Europe helped them reach the second group stage, from which they would also advance before a valiant fall in the semi-finals.",
      "They even qualified for Europe again the next season – albeit the UEFA Cup – by finishing fourth in the league.",

The closest to the Brazilian in terms of age in Arsene Wenger’s starting line-up, which had an average age of 22 years and 315 days, was 24-year-old Emmanuel Eboue.",

      "As an aside, of the 11 youngest starting XIs in Premier League history, Arsene Wenger and Arsenal account for four. No other manager has named more than one, and Manchester United and Everton are the only other clubs to account for as many as two. There wasn’t even a specific reason for him to name such a young side for this match; he just did it for the love of the game.",

      "The Portuguese was justified in rotating between Europa League semi-final first legs, particularly after the accomplished vanquishing of Athletic Bilbao in Spain. But Matthijs de Ligt suffering an early injury was a setback and Alejandro Garnacho and Amad, the forwards aged 20 and 22 often tasked with carrying the team in an attacking sense, needing to claw back some dignity, pride and momentum even still in defeat was not ideal preparation.",

      "The Red Devils allowed the Brazil international to leave Old Trafford and move to Real Betis on loan until the end of the season in the winter transfer window.",
      "Man Utd spent around £87m on Antony in the summer of 2022 but he made very little impact in his two-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony contributed just five Premier League goals and three assists in 62 appearances with the 25-year-old making no league starts this season before the Red Devils offloaded him to Betis.",
      "But the Brazilian has been impressing in La Liga with the winger contributing six goals and two assists in 19 matches in all competitions for the Spanish outfit.",
      "Real Betis have been keen to make the move permanent in summer with Man Utd hoping to permanently remove him from their books.",
      "And now reports in Spain claim that Atletico Madrid are ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony with the Spanish understood to have ‘submitted a €40 million offer to Manchester United to secure his services.’",
      "Real Betis ‘hoped to negotiate a permanent purchase at the end of the season’ but rivals Atletico Madrid ‘has preemptively made a compelling offer that has convinced United’.",
      "Atletico have been ‘monitoring the Brazilian player’s progress for weeks’ and manager Diego Simeone is ‘convinced that Antony can provide the speed and directness his team needs to make a competitive leap forward in both LaLiga and the Champions League’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The 40 million euro offer from the Red and Whites, presented in the last few hours, has been welcomed by Manchester United, who are willing to part with the player for a sum that allows them to recoup part of the initial investment made when they signed him from Ajax. The deal, in financial terms, is very close to being finalized, and talks are expected to progress rapidly in the coming weeks.’",
      "Real Betis are ‘unable to compete financially with Atletico’s financial muscle’ and the Verdiblancos had hoped their ‘good relationship with the player and with the United team could facilitate a more affordable negotiation’.",
      "And now it looks likely that Atletico Madrid will complete a ‘luxury addition’ for next season and the potential signing of Antony ‘could be one of the first major moves of what promises to be a busy summer at the Metropolitano headquarters’.",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen recently advised Antony to stay at Real Betis as he “has no future” at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is eyeing two Real Betis players as the Red Devils ‘propose a swap deal’ in a £25.5m ‘discount’ for Antony.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim reportedly views Lyon attacker Rayan Cherki as a ‘key piece to make a qualitative leap in their offensive game’.",
      "With a pivotal summer transfer window ahead, Amorim has drawn up a shortlist that includes at least two new strikers, a wing-back, and a central midfielder.",
      "Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap and Wolves forward Matheus Cunha are understood to be his primary striker targets. However, both pursuits present challenges.",
      "Delap, whose £30 million relegation release clause has caught the attention of several Premier League clubs, is in high demand.",
      "Meanwhile, Cunha has a £62.5m release clause that Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reportedly prepared to activate.",
      "Cunha is viewed as one of Amorim’s preferred options for the ‘wide 10’ role – an area of the pitch where Cherki could also be deployed if signed.",
      "The 21-year-old Frenchman impressed Amorim and United scouts during Lyon’s Europa League quarter-final clash with the Red Devils, scoring in both legs.",
      "Despite Lyon’s dramatic collapse at Old Trafford, Cherki’s individual performances stood out.",
      "According to reports in Spain, Man Utd ‘have their sights set’ on signing Cherki in the summer.",
      "Indeed, Amorim views Cherki as a ‘key piece’ to his attacking puzzle as he eyes a ‘qualitative leap in their offensive game’ amid plans from Ratcliffe to conduct a ‘full sporting reconstruction’.",
      "The Portuguese head coach has a ‘strong intention to add him’ at the end of the season but there is plenty of competition for his signature.",
      "Interest from clubs in England is ‘stronger than ever’ and Man Utd are ‘willing to make a significant investment’.",
      "The report adds that the Man Utd hierarchy ‘believes that, surrounded by top-level players in a more competitive environment, Cherki could reach a new dimension in his career’.",
      "Lyon believe keeping Cherki will be ‘very difficult’ if they receive a ‘convincing offer’ and the player ‘would be open to taking on the challenge of the Premier League, especially if guaranteed a leading role’.",
      "Man Utd’s interest is ‘firm’ and ‘everything indicates that the coming months could see an intensification of discussions to finalize an agreement’.",
      "A report last month claimed that Lyon are asking for at least €30m (£25.5m) for their star player and that the Red Devils made a ‘shameful’ offer that was rejected out of hand.",
      "The report added that Liverpool are also interested in signing Cherki.",

      "",
      "Arteta and Art class…\nHaving attended Art class, I found Andy H, Swansea’s entry fairly persuasive, but I have to reject one of his premises, i.e., that Arsenal were a “pratfalling mess” when Mikel Arteta arrived.",
      "I think that Andy’s assessment of Arteta’s performance is reasonably fair in itself, but Arsene Wenger’s final league finish was sixth, not fourteenth or seventeenth. A team finishing sixth in any EPL season is hardly a team doing pratfalls. They were a club with a legendary manager who led the Invincibles and transformed English football…which, in return, grew beyond him.",
      "They had plenty of talent when Arteta arrived, if some of it had been misused. They were in no sense a mess; they just needed a new coach. Maybe they needed one a couple of years earlier, but I don’t really know, as I’m not Stewie Griffin*. Arteta has improved them, no doubt, but he hardly applied CPR.",
      "I deleted a whole nostalgic paragraph about having driven for two and a half hours to see Newcastle lose an FA Cup final and Why I Don’t Hate Arsenal, but I was only belabouring things.",
      "On the other hand, five and a half years of watching Mikel Arteta at Arsenal have taught me to detest Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. I have Mailbox form here, as it were, and won’t belabour my beef either, though I will repeat that I always liked him as a player.",
      "But the fact remains that, whatever his failings, Arteta is at the very least a good coach who can really nail it against an opponent like Real Madrid once in a while. He has beaten a lot of good coaches, whatever his transfer market failures. If I were an Arsenal supporter, I think I’d be ambivalent. The wrong upgrade could be disastrous.",
      "Perhaps handing over a bit of transfer control would benefit him. Maybe he should be telling the board and Director what he wants, not who he wants, and let the scouts, the stattos and Edu go find it.",
      "All that said, my club’s won exactly one real pot in my 30 years of support, and it still feels like yesterday. Fans of some clubs think it’s an utter shambles, a travesty of justice, the end of the world when their club don’t win at least one trophy in any given season. It’s beyond me. My expectations just aren’t calibrated the way “big club” supporters I read here or in the socials.",
      "And no offense to those Gunners, but I hope they never will be. It seems to steal a lot of joy. My philosophy has always been that losing is part of sport; if you don’t know losing, what do you really know? (Besides winning, obvs.)",

That’s pretty good, Man City were very slightly better over 38 games so they won the league. We all know Man City have been an unprecedented level of dominance in the league since well before Arteta joined Arsenal for various sporting reasons – even ignoring the 115 stuff they are strongest club by far.",

I am excluding domestic cups and European competitions apart from the Champions League because they don’t count in these conversations. Winning an FA Cup would not change people’s position – “ah but he can’t win the league” etc…besides, just ask Ten Hag or David Moyes whether these comps are enough to keep your job on their own. Critics like to tout the cups as a stick to beat Arteta but would not allow winning them as a defense. They are very nice though but small beer apparently – so onwards!",

      "Rio Ferdinand\nI don’t really like Rio Ferdinand on comms, for many reasons but you can’t question his talent as footballer. An absolute Rolls Royce of a defender. He played alongside Vidic? Yep, and they complemented each other perfectly. Rio was the best centre back of the noughties in the Premier League (lots of fashionable foreign defenders then too). Better on the ball and still less of a bellend than John Terry. He’d be equally lauded today as then if he was playing now. Ball playing centre backs are not a modern phenomenon either (Bobby Moore?). If I didn’t support United I’d say Van Dijk was better (almost as if you combined Vidic and Rio) but I do so I’ll stick by my man.",
      "I also completely agree with J. Nicholson about the embarrassment of United and Spurs pissing the Europa League. But it’s UEFA that should be embarrassed. It all started when they let runners up join the Champions League (literally adding losers ruins the name a bit). What we have now is a European Super League by stealth supported by two lesser European competitions which act as a safety net for teams like United who struggle to qualify the proper way. Much like VAR, we can never go back.",
      "And finally, there is so much nuance to some of the issues that are constantly debated in these hallowed pages and that affect our wonderful game. That nuance is above the heads of at least 50% of people that we end up in situations where trans people have nowhere to play football (or any sport really) and a young(ish) black woman loses her job for “clumsy” comments about an important issue.

      "However, Hartley in the Mailbox needs to go and wash his mouth out with soap and water for questioning him as a player. I’ve seen lots of great centre backs at United, from Bruce and Pallister, to Stam and Johnsen and then Vidic and Rio. Rio was the best of the lot and it’s not particularly close. Tall, quick, strong, great on the ball; I’d argue he’s the best centre back in Premier League history. Unfortunately, he became injury prone around 30 which is when centre halves often get the most plaudits.",
      "I’d argue he’s criminally underrated, and any United fan that knows their onions will tell you Rio covered up for Vidic, not the other way round. Vidic got mountains of praise because he’d throw himself in front of anything and came across as a warrior for the fans. That’s why he was loved. Rio did “merks” and missed drug tests, and generally came across as a bit of a knob.",
      "As was referenced elsewhere in the mailbox, likability is a really important factor in shaping public opinion, and no one really likes Rio, myself included, but you need to separate the man from the player. He was an absolutely top tier defender. See also, Terry, John.\nLewis, Busby Way",

      "Harry Maguire \nHarry Maguire. This man has been run through the mill.",

Perhaps best to say he might have been better off getting away from it all before it kicked off, but who knows. Alcohol and youth often exacerbate things, I certainly cant throw stones from my glass house on that one.",
      "From a football perspective, he’s played the game as best he can. He can’t do any more than that. People slag him for being slow ….. well that’s just him, it’s not his fault – some guy paying £80m for you doesn’t suddenly make you run faster. But – he’s given it his all every time he steps on the pitch. He’s faced the criticism head-on and come back stronger, accepting his weaknesses. He’s accepted a new system under this new manager, knuckled down and got on with it. And for that, I tip my hat and say well played, kudos to him. Seeing him score the winner against Lyon, and then dicking all over the Bilbao fullback like a top end winger was a pleasure, and I couldnt be happier for the guy. If half the Man Utd squad had the bollocks and spine that he had, the club would be in a far better position than it currently is.",
      "A little aside on Hartley MCFC. I agree Rio is by no means the greatest commentator/pundit in the modern game. But to use that as a reason to start questioning his ability as a footballer during his career, is a little ridiculous, no? I mean, Sir Alex Ferguson, one of the greatest managers of all time, saw fit to go and get him and make him the heart of his defence for 12 years.

      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s capable of playing.",
      "Amorim has at his disposal seven centre-backs at United. Currently, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof are in addition to Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Ayden Heaven, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro.",
      "However, the former pair are set to move on for free in the summer – Evans’ departure has been confirmed – so that drops the number to five.",
      "Of those five, Red Devils legend Pallister feel two walk into the side for next season, and Maguire, though in sumptuous form at the moment, is not one of them.",
      "“I’d play Lisandro Martinez as the left-sided centre-back. I would play Leny Yoro as the right-sided centre-back as he has got the pace to cover in the wide areas, and then Amorim has got a decision to make whether it will be Harry Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt,” Pallister told GIVEMESPORT.",
      "“I think they’re both more attuned to playing in the middle of the three, because I don’t think they’re blessed with great pace, but they read the game really well, and they’re confident on the ball.",
      "“I would choose from either of them two, and then I think it’s about getting your wing-backs sorted as well. Patrick Dorgu has had an alright start and Diogo Dalot has been there for a number of years and does a good job there.”",
      "At present, it would seem harsh to rip Maguire out of the side. He has had to work very hard to get his game back in a good place, after being stripped of the captaincy by former boss Erik ten Hag and regularly being left on the bench by the Dutchman.",
      "Maguire has been particularly heroic in the Europa League campaign this season. United were minutes from being dumped out by Lyon in the quarter-finals, but a Maguire header completed a fantastic comeback in a 7-6 aggregate win.",
      "He had earlier assisted United’s second goal in the second leg. In the first leg of the semi-final, the defender showed his qualities as a winger, skinning a defender twice before placing an inch perfect cross on Manuel Ugarte’s head, who glanced it across to Casemiro for the opening goal.",
      "United won that game 3-0, and Maguire helped to set the tone. His rebirth up top has been such that we believe he could rival Rasmus Hojlund for a spot there – that would end discourse about him being dropped at the back!",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Harry Maguire was the hero against Lyon while Rasmus Hojlund did sweet f-all once again. Here are ten reasons Amorim should start the centre-back up top for Man Utd.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire called out ‘inconsistent’ performances during a ‘disappointing’ season as the club prepare to face Lyon in the Europa League.",

      "United have had a woeful time of it in the Premier League this season. They’re 14th in the league, having won just 10 of their 34 games so far.",
      "But in Europe, things are heating up for the Red Devils. They were about six minutes away from being dumped out of the Europa League in the quarter-finals when Lyon were 6-4 up on aggregate, before Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire turned the game on its head in the final few minutes.",
      "Indeed, they won 7-6 on aggregate in stoppage time, reaching the semis, where they thumped Athletic Club 3-0 in the first leg, putting themselves in a strong position to reach the final. United’s advancement in Europe will only help them in terms of transfers.",
      "According to GIVEMESPORT, they have ‘moved one step closer’ to the signing of Atalanta midfielder Ederson ‘thanks to having one foot’ in the Europa League final.",
      "Indeed, winning the competition would ‘put them in a better position to meet Atalanta’s financial demands’. The winners of the Europa League will get a boost of around £11million, and the runners-up around £6million, which would help towards any signings.",
      "Ederson is said to be a ‘serious target’, and he’s about to enter the final two years of his deal. United know the lack of a financial boost would hinder their attempts to sign him, but they are ‘confident’ he can be secured for below £50million.",
      "As such, the Red Devils could potentially pay more than a fifth of the transfer fee with money they don’t currently have, but will have earned if they win the Europa League.",
      "It is also believed the midfielder – who played in nine Champions League games this season – is ‘more likely to have his head turned’ by the prospect of an Old Trafford move if they gain a spot in the elite European competition. That would be the case if they won the Europa League.",
      "There is said to be a desire from United to enter negotiations over the transfer in the coming months, and silverware could be the catalyst."

      "The Red Devils are having an awful season with Man Utd moving back up above Everton into 14th after their 1-1 draw against Bournemouth.",
      "Amorim’s side are already guaranteed to go down as the worst Man Utd side to have played in the Premier League era, even if they win their final four matches.",
      "Red Devils boss Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November, has struggled to get his players to adapt to his playing style, philosophy and tactics since arriving.",
      "And with results also failing to come, there could be building pressure on the Portuguese head coach heading into the summer, especially if he fails to guide them to Europa League glory.",
      "Man Utd, who beat Athletic Bilbao 3-0 in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final, are unlikely to sack Amorim whatever happens before the summer as they plan on backing him in the summer transfer market.",
      "And the Portuguese head coach is looking to improve his midfield and now reports in Spain have claimed that Man Utd have made a €30m (£26m) ‘offer’ to sign Barcelona’s Fermin.",
      "Despite interest from several clubs around Europe, it is understood that Man Utd are ‘the first to make a move’ but ‘the Blaugrana leadership’s response has been emphatic: no talks for less than €50m (£43m) are contemplated.’",
      "Man Utd ’emissaries’ took ‘advantage of the trip to Spain’ to face Athletic Bilbao and ‘proposed a meeting to discuss the details’ of a potential deal for Fermin – but the Catalan giants ‘told them that if the bid didn’t start above 50 million euros, there was no need to travel to Barcelona’.",
      "Despite Barcelona’s ‘fragile financial situation’, Joan Laporta is staying strong on his asking price with Man Utd now knowing what it will take to ‘close the deal’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Fermin, who emerged through the Barca youth system and gained experience on loan at Linares, has made it clear that his priority is to stay at the Camp Nou.",
      "‘He recently renewed his contract until 2029 and his only intention is to see out his contract. His attitude, commitment, and performance have resonated with both the coaching staff and the fans.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has put a hugely limiting restriction on the players he wants the club to sign this summer, adding to the already ‘strict rules’ put in place by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS ahead of the major squad surgery required to prevent the Red Devils from further embarrassing themselves next season.",
      "Here are five players who ‘won’t come’ to United this summer on the basis of this new rule set out by Amorim and the five which worked perfectly for them in Ratcliffe’s first window with his hand on the tiller.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres\n“I didn’t talk to him,” Ruben Amorim said when asked about United’s links with Gyokeres.”But if a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.”",
      "We don’t know whether Amorim believes United should be exempt from the key factor which has governed which clubs top players choose to sign for over the last two decades, but if he thinks Gyokeres is somehow abnormal for wanting to play Champions League football then he’s gravely mistaken. He’s the most deadly goalscorer in Europe.",
      "It would be great if the strength and veracity of this Amorim belief could be put to the test with a phone call to Gyokeres before and after United win the Europa League final and gain entry into the Champions League next season, with the striker’s flip-flop met with contempt and a snub by his former manager in favour of a much worse striker who wanted to join no matter what.",
      "",
      "Jonathan Tah\nWith all due respect to our wonderful news editor and headline whizz Joe Williams, we’re not sure many Manchester United fans will have clicked on a link with any hope of the Red Devils pulling off the signing of Tah having read ‘Man Utd ‘actively consider’ free transfer ahead of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona’.",
      "You can ‘consider’ as much as you want, lads. That’s a four-club battle you’re not winning. Nor should they be battling in the first place. Free transfer or not, the Germany international breaks the primary golden rule set out by INEOS of not signing players over the age of 25. He’s 29 until he’s 30 in February.",
      "",
      "Patrick Schick\n‘The manager will be asked what position he wants to sign, not what player,’ the rules report claimed, and Amorim has flouted not just that directive but another by suggesting they sign 29-year-old Schick.",
      "Amorim has had the gall to ask whether the United bosses would be willing to ‘go against their transfer strategy’ to sign the Bayer Leverkusen striker as an alternative should they miss out on Liam Delap, rather than waiting for his list of three strikers to choose from, passed down from the recruitment geniuses who bought a striker last summer who’s scored seven goals in 48 appearances.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen\nA triple whammy of rule breaks here we suspect. Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he didn’t want any ‘Galacticos’, making quite the assumption that Manchester United still have the clout to sign such players. But then again, a sojourn in the Turkish league (no disrespect) may have given United cause to believe Osimhen – whom we reckon can just about be classed as a ‘Galactico’ – would be open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But they don’t want those top tier stars, likely because of their wage demands as much as anything, with some reports suggesting Osimhen wants as much as £400,000 per week from his next club. He’s also 26 and surely has designs on Champions League football.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha\nWe can’t wait for the look on their faces when they realise 25-year-old ‘done deal’ Cunha turns 26 five days before the transfer window opens.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the calendar year on an absolutely ridiculous 52 goals. Can he do it again?",
      "Ruben Amorim named the youngest Manchester United starting XI in Premier League history to prepare for a crucial European game. How mid-2000s of him.",
      "Man Utd will make an offer to bring Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo to Old Trafford if they qualify for the Champions League, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has revealed that Patrick Dorgu and Manuel Ugarte were “nervous” before their Europa League clash against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Arsenal are leading the race for Manchester United-linked Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres, according to reports in Portugal.",

      "His first season as co-owner of Man Utd has not gone how he’d have hoped with Ruben Amorim’s side currently 14th in the Premier League after Erik ten Hag was sacked in November.",
      "However, Man Utd do still have hope of winning the Europa League after thrashing Athletic Bilbao 3-0 on Thursday night in the first leg of their semi-final.",
      "Winning the Europa League would provide Man Utd entry into the Champions League next season, which they can no longer achieve through the league, in a huge boost to their finances ahead of the summer transfer window.",

      "It is claimed that the British billionaire is ‘gearing up to sell his stake in Nice as he shifts his attention’ towards Man Utd and ‘is now said to be entertaining interest from Saudi Arabia’.",
      "The INEOS founder ‘appears set to pass the baton’ with the Saudi Private Investment Fund (PIF) – who own Premier League side Newcastle – getting ‘wind of Ratcliffe’s intentions and are pondering a bid’.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Ratcliffe has owned Ligue 1 club Nice for six years but he admits that he struggles to “get excited” for going to see matches in France.",
      "Ratcliffe said: “I don’t particularly like going to see Nice because there are good players, but the level of football isn’t high enough for me to get excited.",
      "“Nice’s best season was the one we weren’t allowed to get involved in due to timeshare rules. They were so much better without our interference! Maybe there’s a lesson to be learned from that.”",
      "Despite a poor first season in charge of Man Utd, Ratcliffe backed Amorim earlier this year by insisting the Portuguese head coach is “doing a great job”.",
      "Ratcliffe claimed: “You know, you’re a young guy, you’ve come into the Premier League for the first time in your life, you’ve come in mid-season, it’s not your natural language.",
      "“You have to give the guy a bit of a break. I mean, give me a hard time, I have no problem with that. But give Ruben a break. I think he’s a good guy; he’s working hard, and I think he’s doing a great job.”",

      "The 3-1 defeat at Chelsea will do little to trouble Liverpool as they celebrated their deserved title. But if anyone was questioning what Arne Slot's side may have looked like with a few injuries, then that performance was it.",
      "There were probably some party-related reasons for Liverpool's flat performance and a lower intensity than normal, but Arne Slot wanted to use these final four games to help him plan for the summer. Those he brought into the team at Stamford Bridge failed to impress.",
      "The entire midfield was changed and the trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott could not cope with their Chelsea counterparts, notably Romeo Lavia and Cole Palmer who ran the show.",

      "Liverpool will not stand still this summer and rest on their laurels. The club want to be busy in the transfer market and strengthen their squad to compete again next season and develop the next title-winning team.",

      "Bilbao or bust has been the mantra at Manchester United for some time. Watching them fall to a 16th league defeat of the season as they lost 4-3 at Brentford, their most for 35 years, made that abundantly clear. But there is something more behind their struggles.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the third-youngest team in Premier League history at Brentford. Considering United's recent domestic form, and the eight changes made after Thursday's win over Athletic Club, defeat was almost inevitable, strange as that sounds.",
      "Everything, understandably, is focused on the Europa League. That doesn't answer the question of why United, the only undefeated side in European competition, haven't beaten a team that will be playing top-flight football next season since January 26.",
      "Since that 1-0 win at Fulham, sealed thanks to Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike, United have played 10 teams outside the bottom three and failed to win against any of them. They still had a round left of the Europa League league phase after that win.",
      "Meanwhile, in Europe United have overcome Real Sociedad and Lyon. Barring a shock collapse, not something you would put past this group, you can add Athletic Club to that list. Then they are one game from a European trophy. Puzzling.",
      "The defeat at Brentford, although not the fairest game to draw conclusions from, served up a perfect example of the problems plaguing Amorim in the Premier League: United were simply unable to cope with Brentford's physicality, pace and direct football.",
      "Regardless of who was picked, as this season has shown us, those same vulnerabilities would remain.",
      "Amorim has inherited a squad ill-equipped to cope with the rigours of English football. Those squad-building missteps must be corrected this summer, particularly if Champions League qualification is secured, otherwise Amorim will see no improvement.Zinny Boswell",
      "Alexander Isak must have felt like his moment would never come in Newcastle's 1-1 draw at Brighton. Twice he had picked up the ball thinking he was about to have a free shot at goal from 12 yards after referee Craig Pawson had pointed to the spot. VAR ruined Newcastle's fun by spotting two incorrect calls from Pawson so it was looking like one of those days for Isak and his team.",
      "But one more chance would come on 89 minutes when Pawson finally correctly spotted a legitimate penalty and Isak was in no mood to pass it up.",
      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "United will be playing Champions League football next season if they can win the Europa League, but Amorim says that is a \"real dilemma\" for the club.",
      "\"We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition, to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League.",
      "\"Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions. So, it is a dilemma, but we want to win, of course.\"",
      "United were trailing 4-1 with eight minutes to go at Brentford, but late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and substitute Amad Diallo restored some respectability for Amorim's struggling side.",
      "There were flashes of promise, particularly Mason Mount's opener, his first league goal for 13 months, but the performance, for the most part, stood in stark contrast to Thursday's impressive 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "Amorim has failed to translate United's Europa League form into consistent performances and results in the Premier League, but insists he is seeing signs of progress.",
      "He added: \"I have no doubts that we are playing better, and we are understanding the way we play, even in this context. So, we have to take all the hits.",
      "\"We are losing games in the Premier League, we are fighting for the Europa League, so we need to accept that and to think about Thursday as the most important game for us.\"",
      "Asked about the goal for Mount, who has endured another season blighted by injuries, Amorim added: \"It's not just the finish, it's the position that he has on the pitch. He's like a third midfielder that can reach the box. He's really intelligent.",
      "\"He's getting there and he trains really hard. Sometimes I have to push him back and to take him off the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We are taking care of him.",
      "\"He wants to play more minutes, but the minutes were controlled. I'm really happy with him.\"",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest player in United's history to start a Premier League game at Brentford, aged 17 years and 156 days, as fellow academy graduates Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got the nod.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the young trio and the experience they gained, but sent a clear message to them that United's standards in their worst season in the Premier League era would not be accepted moving forward.",
      "\"It is really important to understand that we cannot do this anymore,\" he said, when asked about how important it was for the young players to learn from the defeat.",
      "\"We know the context, but this kind of season we need to change. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They [have] not [been] playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.\"",
      "Asked about the experience they would have gained, Amorim: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it is the best thing.\"",
      "Obi, on his first senior start, was tasked with leading the line against Brentford's physical centre-back pairing of Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg, whose last-minute block denied a goalbound strike from the teenage striker.",
      "The Denmark U21 international had a frustrating full debut until that moment, when he burst through a challenge in the box, and looked destined to at least test Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken but for Van den Berg's intervention.",
      "\"Chido fought for all game, but you can feel that he's really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body,\" Amorim said. \"He's going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these games. This is the best way.\""

      "Brentford increased their hopes of qualifying for Europe for the first time as they beat a much-changed Manchester United 4-3 in a thriller at the Gtech.",
      "Conversely, it was Man Utd's 16th league defeat of the season, their most since the 1989/90 season, when they also lost 16.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim took charge on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "After United won the first leg of their Europa League semi-final 3-0 against Athletic Club on Thursday, Amorim rung the changes and named the third-youngest starting XI in Premier League history.",
      "Sensing an opportunity as a result, Brentford pressed high from the off and should have been ahead when a Luke Shaw and Altay Bayindir mix-up led to the former almost heading past his own goalkeeper.",

      "There was a brief boost when Mason Mount slid Alejandro Garnacho's cross home against the run of play, but the Bees deservedly levelled when Mikkel Damsgaard poked a shot that hit the unfortunate Shaw, then Bayindir, then the net.",
      "Within five minutes, the turnaround was complete. Man Utd switched off, wanting play to be paused when Matthijs de Ligt went down with a leg injury after a tangle with Yoane Wissa, but referee Anthony Taylor played on, so Christian Norgaard was able to pick out Kevin Schade to head home.",
      "Only a last-ditch save from Bayindir to keep out Norgaard's connection on Damsgaard's free-kick prevented it becoming three before the break.",
      "United started the second half well, but found themselves further behind when Schade headed in a peach of a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, before the impressive Michael Kayode squared for Wissa to roll home and make it 4-1, with the goal confirmed after a VAR review.",
      "Garnacho hit a stunner from the edge of the box, before Amad's strike deflected off Sepp van den Berg to make it 4-3 and set up a tense finale, but Brentford held on for their third win in succession as their positive end to the campaign continues.",
      "Brentford head coach Thomas Frank:",
      "\"Basically, from the first year in the division, we respect everyone but fear no one. We believe that we can win every game.",
      "\"We try to go for that win. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we really, really, really believe it every single time. The players are fantastic. It is a fantastic group to work with.",
      "\"We spoke about it [Europe] before the Brighton game. I rarely say that to the players as it's more about performance, but [I said] this game, we need to win. We have to win this if we want to be in with any chance of maybe having a dream about Europe. And the players did that, big credit to them.",
      "\"Then we played a difficult away game to Nottingham Forest, beat them, home to Man Utd, beat them. And all three wins, well deserved.",
      "\"We've got this momentum, hopefully we can keep it up. It's all about getting the job done and it's one at a time. We had a laser, laser, laser focus throughout four seasons on the next game. It's all about the next game.\"",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim:",

      "\"And then in the second half I felt that we were near the draw and then we suffered a goal and like some other times we disconnected. And then another goal, almost three minutes, five minutes later. And then we pushed forward, tried to score, we scored twice but we didn't have the time to do better.\"",
      "On playing youngsters: \"They have to understand this season is really important also to understand that we cannot do this anymore. Of course, we know the context, but this kind of season we need to change that. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",

      "\"I think we can help the young kids even more, especially Tyler Fredricson did quite well in the third goal. He needs more help from Amad. So these small things I think we can help them more, but I'm really happy with the performance of the young kids.\"",
      "On De Ligt's injury: \"We don't know what will happen with De Ligt. If we don't have Luke Shaw available on Thursday we could have a problem and then we don't have enough defenders for the game. We had to protect some players at half-time, thinking about Thursday. So it was just that, not about thinking about the game.\""

      "Sunday 4 May 2025 16:50, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",

      "The entire tie changed within seven minutes after Rasmus Hojlund was pulled back by Dani Vivian when he tried to reach a low cross in the six-yard box. The referee sent the Athletic Club centre-back off and awarded United a penalty, which Fernandes cooly dispatched, after consulting the pitchside monitor.",
      "Athletic Club made two substitutions to try and halt United's momentum, but Fernandes added a third before the half was finished, slotting home from Ugarte's clever backheel to put the visitors in dreamland.",
      "United eased off in the second half with a controlled performance to prevent the hosts from finding anyway back into the tie.",

      "Friday 2 May 2025 12:47, UK",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim admitted \"nobody expected\" the magnitude of their 3-0 Europa League semi-final first leg win at Athletic Club but insisted the tie was still not over ahead of next week's return match.",
      "His side became only the third to win at San Mames since August and inflicted the joint-biggest defeat on their hosts at the stadium in over a decade, putting one foot in the Europa League final at the same stadium later this month - where they look likely to meet Premier League rivals Tottenham.",
      "United weathered an early storm from the hosts but took the lead through Casemiro's header, and then played much of the game with a man advantage after centre-back Dani Vivian conceded a penalty and was sent off for pulling back Rasmus Hojlund in his own box.",
      "Despite scoring three goals in the final 15 minutes of the opening period, the one criticism of the visitors' performance was that they did not manage to add to their advantage and kill off the tie as a contest.",
      "Man Utd are the only remaining team unbeaten in Europe this season, in stark contrast to their Premier League campaign where they have lost 15 of 34 league games - but even so, the head coach had not been expecting such an emphatic victory in the Basque country.",
      "\"It's the best result because nobody expected this result,\" he said. \"But you saw two games today - the first 25 minutes and then, after the goal and the sending-off, the game changed.",
      "\"In the second half, we tried to be cautious and we created chances but the most important thing is the opponent didn't get many shots on our goal.",
      "\"We've improved in the last games. I don't look just at the results. We had some games that we won that we didn't play well and some games we lost but played well. Sometimes you need a little bit of luck.",
      "\"In the first 30 minutes, they had chances to score. If they score, it's a different game. When we scored, we felt more free to play.",
      "\"It's hard to understand but sometimes it's the context. We can win this competition. In the Premier League, we are suffering game after game. We try to manage both things with some injuries. Sometimes it's hard, even for the players.\"",
      "Amorim sounded a note of caution despite the size of Man Utd's victory, and the meteoric collapse which would be required for them to be eliminated.",
      "Of 133 previous first-leg away wins by three goals in European knock-out ties, all 133 teams have progressed to the next round.",
      "Hojlund could not add to the last-gasp equaliser he netted at Bournemouth at the weekend but did put in a strong shift leading the line for United, proving an agile target man while also showing far better positional awareness than he has in recent games.",
      "Amorim has kept faith with the beleaguered striker through his prolonged struggles this season, in part due to a lack of senior alternatives, and gave him a vote of confidence following his performance in Thursday's game.",
      "\"It was the best game he had with me as coach,\" he said. \"He helped the team a lot. He secured the ball and made runs. It was a good moment for him but like Harry (Maguire) he needs to understand everything can change so let's focus on the next one. This one is in the past.\""
