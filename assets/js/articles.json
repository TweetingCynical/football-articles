      "Manchester United's transfer business could next turn to signing a midfielder after wrapping up a deal for Benjamin Sesko. The Red Devils have agreed to a £73.3million deal with RB Leipzig to sign the striker and beaten Newcastle United to his signature.",
      "Sesko will become United's fourth signing of the summer and will join on a five-year deal, with £66.3m to be paid in an initial fee and the remainder available through add-ons. The 22-year-old arrived on Thursday evening with his medical expected to take place on Friday as the club finalise the move.",
      "United's spending rises to a possible £214m but their business may not be done yet. After replenishing their frontline, a midfielder could next be on the agenda for the side.",
      "But, sales could prove important if the club want to make a further significant outlay. United are still hoping to facilitate moves for the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia this summer.",
      "The group are not in Ruben Amorim's first team plans thus far, with the latter trio being loaned out last season and Garnacho falling out with the Portuguese coach. United hope to bring in fees for each to improve their profit and sustainability standing.",
      "For the moment, United continue to be linked to blockbuster transfers however. One midfield target would appear to be Brighton star Carlos Baleba.",
      "United made contact with the Seagulls through intermediaries to register their interest in Baleba, earlier this week. The 21-year-old was signed by Brighton in 2023 for £23.2m.",
      "The south coast side's demands could yet prove off-putting however. A £104m price-tag is said to have been placed on the youngster.",
      "And United's task has been made no easier after it emerged that local rivals Manchester City also hold an interest. ESPN claim that City's manager, Pep Guardiola, is a long-time admirer of Baleba.",
      "The Premier League star is said to be content to remain at Brighton for another season with a big-money move more likely in 12 months time. No direct contact has been made for Baleba thus far.",
      "When asked about Baleba's future, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber told BBC Sussex: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me.",
      "\"So from that point of view, speculation is speculation. We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian [Hurzeler] with a very competitive squad, whatever happens.",
      "\"We don't want to sell our best players. Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Manchester United's hopes of signing Gianluigi Donnarumma remain alive, and he could join a handful of members of the squad which ended his hopes of a farewell trophy with AC Milan. The Italian goalkeeper left the Rossoneri in the summer of 2021, a few months after losing to United in the Europa League.",
      "Four years on from that game, Donnarumma is being linked with a United switch - and not for the first time. His current club Paris Saint-Germain are said to have a deal in place for Lille keeper Lucas Chevalier, and it remains to be seen whether their current No.1 will stay and fight for his spot.",
      "It was back in 2017 that United were previously linked, only for the Italian to extend his stay in Milan. When United took on Donnarumma's Milan in March 2021, though, that deal had entered its final year with no sign of an extension.",
      "At the time of the first leg at Old Trafford, Stefano Pioli's Milan had relinquished top spot after successive defeats in February, including a 3-0 derby loss to Inter. United also sat second but with a bit more momentum, coming into the first leg after winning their own derby.",
      "It was a different case in Europe, where United had dropped into the Europa League after finishing third in their group below PSG and RB Leipzig. But they came out on top against Donnarumma and his team-mates.",
      "Amad opened the scoring at Old Trafford with his first ever goal for the club. Simon Kjaer grabbed a late Milan goal, though, leaving the game delicately poised - with the away goals rule still a factor.",
      "Just three members of United's starting XI from the away leg are still at the club: Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes (along with currently out-on-loan Marcus Rashford). A fourth current United player got minutes against them that day, with Diogo Dalot able to play against his parent club during a Milan loan and playing the final 25 minutes.",
      "It was one of United's subs who scored the winner, though. Record signing Paul Pogba came on for Rashford at the break, and took less than three minutes to score the only goal of the tie.",
      "Dean Henderson, not Donnarumma, who made a key goalkeeping contribution in that second leg. His big late stop denied former United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic and ensured the Red Devils made it through.",
      "They made it all the way to the final, eventually losing on penalties to Villarreal, and clinched second spot in the league. Milan were runners-up themselves in Italy, and Donnarumma decided it was time for a move after winning Euro 2020 with the Azzurri.",
      "Four years on, though, Donnarumma's next move could take him to Old Trafford. There will be no European football available to him this term, thanks to another Europa League final defeat for United, but he has a chance to leave Paris as a Champions League winner before taking on a new challenge.",

      "After tormenting the Three Lions at Wembley last year, Greece striker Vangelis Pavlidis could be on his way to the Premier League this summer. That's after Benjamin Sesko appears to have chosen Manchester United over Newcastle, leaving the Magpies scrambling for an alternative striker signing.",
      "Benfica frontman Pavlidis, 26, embarrassed a full-strength England line-up comprising the likes of Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka in the UEFA Nations League last October. He completed a match-deciding brace in the 94th minute as Greece beat England for the first time, moments after Bellingham appeared to have rescued a result for the hosts.",
      "Almost one year on from that upset, The Sun has reported Newcastle are considering a move for Pavlidis, who is understood to have an £87million release clause, following Sesko's snub. And there's a very real chance Eddie Howe soon finds himself short of a star attacker depending on Alexander Isak's future at St James' Park.",
      "The Swede is currently training separately from the rest of the Newcastle squad after expressing a desire to explore his options elsewhere. He abstained from Newcastle's pre-season tour of Asia and then travelled to former club Real Sociedad for individual training.",
      "Liverpool remain closely linked with a move for Isak despite already spending a combined £170m on Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. The Reds recently had a bid for Isak worth a reported £110m turned down by the Magpies, but are said to be mulling a second offer.",
      "However, there's a chance that deal could be revived after Liverpool agreed to sell Darwin Nunez to Saudi side Al-Hilal for an initial £46m. That frees up another spot in the Anfield attack after Luis Diaz joined Bayern Munich in a £65.5m deal.",
      "Newcastle are said to have had scouts in attendance to watch Pavlidis in action as Benfica beat Nice 2-0 in a Champions League qualifier on Wednesday. The Greek hitman failed to find the back of the net, though it could work in Newcastle's favour that Benfica's latest striker signing, Franjo Ivanovic, did make his mark on the French Riviera.",
      "Pavlidis has scored already this season, however, after netting the only goal in Benfica's Portuguese Super Cup victory over Sporting CP. The Thessaloniki-born star scored 30 goals and laid on 13 assists in 57 appearances across all competitions for the Eagles last term.",
      "Benfica paid around £15m to sign the forward from AZ Alkmaar after he topped the Eredivisie scoring charts in the 2023/24 campaign. However, they look certain to make that figure back multiple times over if they sell this summer, even if Newcastle manage to negotiate a fee for less than his release clause.",
      "That being said, the chances of that happening may be slim considering Pavlidis has another four years left to run on his contract. The Telegraph reported Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson is still understood to lead Newcastle's list of striker targets in the event they sell Isak this summer.",
      "Jackson looks certain to struggle for minutes this season after the Blues signed both Liam Delap and Joao Pedro in the summer. The Senegal international has the benefit of having already played in England's top flight.",
      "That being said, many fans on Tyneside may prefer to see their side take more of a risk given Jackson has been far from prolific in the Premier League. Pavlidis was also understood to be a potential target for the Red Devils before they seemingly won the race for Sesko, with Newcastle now possibly eyeing his signature after being forced to pivot yet again.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee has joined Rasmus Hojlund in liking a social media post confirming that Benjamin Sesko is poised to complete a big-money transfer to Manchester United imminently.",
      "The Red Devils have already significant bolstered their attack by wrapping up deals for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer. And it emerged at the end of last month that United had identified Sesko as their primary No 9 target ahead of the new Premier League season.",
      "Sesko, 22, has had no shortage of suitors this summer, with Arsenal and Newcastle also admirers of the Slovenia international.",
      "But United have won the race for Sesko's signature after agreeing a deal worth just shy of £73million including add-ons for the RB Leipzig man.",
      "News of said agreement broke on Thursday afternoon with Sesko set to complete his move before the weekend. And some of his new team-mates have already responded to the news.",
      "Eagle-eyed fans spotted that Hojlund had liked a social media post confirming that Sesko was on his way to Old Trafford. And it has since emerged that Zirkzee has followed suit.",
      "Both players struggled for goals last season, hence United's bid to add more firepower to their squad in the summer transfer window.",
      "In total, United registered just 44 goals in the Premier League across 38 games as they recorded their lowest ever finish in 15th place. Only Everton and the three relegated teams - Southampton, Ipswich Town and Leicester - scored less.",
      "Manchester United's pursuit of Sesko has fuelled speculation that Hojlund could be sold. But the Dane insisted he wants to stay and fight for his place in the team during the club's recent pre-season tour.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said. \"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland).",
      "\"But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "Andy Dunn is the Mirror's chief sports writer.",
      "There could be many reasons why Benjamin Sesko would rather play for Manchester United than Newcastle United. Money could be one of them, obviously.",
      "Perhaps, he would rather live in Manchester - or, more likely, South Cheshire - than on Tyneside. Maybe he is not overly fussed about Champions League football, or any European football, for that matter.",
      "After all, despite not taking Newcastle's higher offer, his wages will still be astronomical but his workload not so astronomical. But the most likely reason is that, for all its difficulties on and off the pitch, Manchester United remains Manchester United.",
      "It is still a behemoth of a club, it is still a global phenomenon. It still attracts 72,000 people through the gates and could attract double that amount if it had room.",
      "And whoever plays a key role in returning United back to the top of the Premier League will be feted like few others in the game. In the case of whether or not Ruben Amorim is the manager to perform that task, the jury is still out.",
      "He has talked a good game in pre-season, although his creation of a six-man leadership group seems a bit bizarre. On the evidence of last season, he has done well to find six leaders in that squad.",
      "But it is a squad that is considerably improved by the arrival of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and, when it is rubber-stamped, Sesko. For a start, there looks to be a natural attacking balance between those three but there should also be a mutual hunger.",
      "It may sound more than a touch idealistic but United’s new signings - and there could be more before the end of the window or even the start of the Premier League season - have a lot more to play for than a very heavy pay packet. Of course, there is a very big gap to bridge if United are to have a meaningful season-long battle with the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City.",
      "But while he played down decent form in the Summer Series in the States, a full pre-season will be crucial to Amorim’s mission. One of THE fundamental flaws of United teams over the last few years has been a very basic one.",
      "They simply have not looked fit enough. And they were certainly not fit enough to achieve the sort of work-rate that Amorim’s preferred system demands.",
      "That is why Amorim made sure the individual training regimes given to every player during their break were as detailed as possible. Word has it that the numbers from personal fitness tests have impressed the sports science staff.",
      "When they get their Premier League season underway with that blockbuster game against Arsenal at Old Trafford, expect to see a fitter, leaner United. And when he does arrive in training in next week, Sesko will certainly be fit and lean.",
      "This is a player who is quick, strong, scores goals and is good in the air - all qualities that have been rare at United for too long. He will not be some sort of saviour but the fact he wants to be at Old Trafford still tells you a lot about the club.",

      "It emerged earlier this week that United had made contact with Brighton through intermediaries to register their interest in Baleba.",
      "However, it's now clear that United are likely to face significant competition in the race for Baleba's signature from their arch-rivals, Manchester City.",
      "ESPN outline that City's manager, Pep Guardiola, is a long-time admirer of Baleba, who made 34 appearances in the top-flight last season.",
      "City's interest in signing Baleba could pose a significant hurdle for United should they choose to pursue a deal for the midfielder, though Brighton will not sell one of their key players on the cheap.",
      "The same outlet claims that Brighton would demand a monster €120 million (£104m) transfer fee in order to sanction a sale to any of Baleba's suitors this summer.",
      "And with the Red Devils poised to sign Benjamin Sesko in a deal totalling £74m including add-ons, Brighton's demands would make it difficult for United to finance a swoop for Baleba in this transfer window.",
      "On Baleba's part, the player is said to be perfectly happy to stay with Brighton for another year if the chance to move before the 1 September deadline fails to materialise.",
      "United will focus on outgoings after finalising a deal for Sesko, who is scheduled to undergo a medical and sign for the club officially on Friday. A number of players, including Alejandro Garnacho, have been deemed surplus to requirements and any additional funds raised from player trading would potentially open the door to further incomings.",

      "However, Donnarumma is only under contract through 2026 and talks over a new deal appear to have stalled. According to a report from L'Equipe, PSG have agreed a deal to sign Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier.",

      "\"It'll be interesting to see what happens this summer,\" Keane said during Brighton's FA Cup run last term. \"Fantastic. Great example. The other clubs must be looking at Brighton and thinking, how are they doing it?\"",
      "United are unlikely to be able to bring in Baleba this summer without raising significant funds, though the likes of Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund could yet move on. It may end up being a case of letting the midfielder spend another year on the south coast before swooping in 2026.",
      "If and when Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, he will be entering an environment which has a new set of rules in place. Ruben Amorim imposed a number of changes since arriving in November as the permanent successor to former boss Erik ten Hag, and he was the one who put those new rules in place.",
      "Some of the rules are specific to players, including banning them from going on holiday during international breaks. This is unlikely to be a big factor for Sesko, who is one of the first names on Slovenia's team-sheet, but others have been impacted.",
      "Amorim has also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays, while ordering players to pick up equipment if they lose the mini-matches played during training sessions. The final rule concerns coaches - getting them to simplify advice - but this too will affect the playing staff.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United have spent more than £130m so far this summer to bring in Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon, while Benjamin Sesko is set to complete a £74m move to Old Trafford after flying into the UK for a medical.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim is hoping to continue strengthening his squad and the United boss is a big fan of Baleba. According to ESPN, Brighton have set an asking price of £104m for the 21-year-old.",

      "Ruben Amorim is now nearing his third significant summer signing, with Sesko now in Manchester to complete his medical and sign his contract. The Athletic reports that a deal worth €75.6million (£65.5m), plus €8.5m (£7.4m) in add-ons, has been agreed to strengthen United's attacking line-up.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo became the second summer recruit following his long-awaited switch from Brentford, while the deal to bring Matheus Cunha to the Theatre of Dreams was more straightforward as his release clause was activated.",
      "The pursuit of Sesko has been widely reported, with the saga reaching its crescendo this week. Newcastle were first to have a bid accepted for the 22-year-old, before the Red Devils launched their own offer.",
      "The Bundesliga club ultimately gave the green light to both, leaving Sesko to make the final decision - opting for Manchester over Newcastle",
      "And the social media account of United striker Hojlund was among those, despite the fact that Sesko's arrival could mean increased competition for a starting spot.",
      "The MEN reported on Wednesday that the former Atalanta striker seems resigned to being pushed out by Manchester United once Sesko finalises his move.",
      "Sources close to the Dane have hinted that while being sidelined might boost Hojlund's performance, he may ultimately need to consider a transfer before the September deadline if he remains out of favour.",
      "His limited playing time could also jeopardise his spot in Denmark's national squad. His nation are on track to qualify for next year's expanded World Cup, but Hojlund lost his place in the team in June following a spell of just one goal in 15 appearances for his country.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has touched down in the United Kingdom ahead of his £74million transfer to Manchester United. The RB Leipzig striker only saw his move to Old Trafford get the green light on Thursday afternoon, but has wasted no time travelling across Europe.",
      "Sesko will sign a five year contract with the Red Devils, having sensationally snubbed a more lucrative offer from Premier League rivals Newcastle. Eddie Howe’s side opened the bidding war earlier this week, seeing a second offer worth £71m up front accepted.",
      "However, the feeling was that the Slovenian was waiting on an offer from Manchester, which was launched on Wednesday. That deal will see Leipzig rake in £66.4m up front, add-ons of £7.6m and a friendly against the 20-time champions of England.",
      "The Bundesliga side ultimately accepted that proposal, leaving the player to pick his preferred destination. That proved to be with Ruben Amorim, despite reports that Newcastle had offered him a bigger salary.",
      "Sesko left Leipzig, in Eastern Germany at around 5.30pm on Thursday afternoon, with more than 10,000 eager supporters tracking its progress.",
      "With the player touched down in Manchester, it is now expected that he will complete his medical and sign his contract on Friday. He will then be officially presented to fans on Saturday, when his new team-mates face Fiorentina in their final pre-season match.",
      "He will join Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively, in a new look Manchester United attack worth more than £200m. Amorim made attacking reinforcements his number one priority this summer after a dismal season which saw them finish 15th and score just 44 league goals in the process.",
      "Amorim's attention can now turn towards a new midfield player, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba at the top of their wishlist. The 21-year-old is the latest Seagulls star tipped for massive things, following the sales of players like Moises Caicedo, Alexis Mac Allister and Joao Pedro.",
      "Baleba has three years remaining on his deal at The Amex, with Brighton unwilling to sell at this point. Nevertheless, contact has been made via intermediaries with the Red Devils boss desperate to add extra dynamism in the middle of the park.",
      "Sesko’s arrival could signal Rasmus Hojlund’s exit from the club just two years after his own blockbuster transfer. Hojlund, 22, arrived to much fanfare in the summer of 2023, signing from Atalanta in a deal worth an initial £64m.",
      "However, he has struggled since arriving in the Premier League and now looks destined to be on the move before the end of the window. United are said to be willing to take a big hit on the forward, who is available for around £40m.",
      "Marcus Rashford has already departed during the window after falling out of favour under Amorim. Alejandro Garnacho is also poised to exit, with Chelsea advancing in talks to sign the Argentine.",
      "Antony, signed for £85m in 2022, is another high-profile summer signing with no future under the Red Devils boss. He spent the second half of last season in Spain with Real Betis, but is yet to secure a permanent exit.",

The Portuguese has the team playing in his preferred three-at-the-back system, and has already added the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to the roster.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is next in line, with the Slovenian opting for United over rivals Newcastle. Profit and Sustainability regulations may limit what else can be done, but some high-profile exits could yet free up funds.",
      "Marcus Rashford's wages are off the books after his loan move to Barcelona, while Jadon Sancho is expected to join Juventus once the Turin club can shift some players themselves. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund are among the others potentially available for the right price, though Harry Maguire is staying put.",
      "Aside from the new-look front-line, United have looked into midfield reinforcements in the form of Carlos Baleba. The Brighton star could set them back a cool £100million, though, and that may be a tall order this summer.",
      "Despite their lowly finish last term, United actually conceded fewer goals than top-half finishers Brentford and Brighton and only three more than sixth-place Aston Villa. It may be for this reason that Amorim has decided against major surgery at the back.",
      "Andre Onana remains United's first-choice keeper for now despite some high-profile errors last term. He should be helped by the return of Lisandro Martinez after a long-term injury, with the Argentine sorely missed towards the tail end of last season, though it remains to be seen how soon he'll be Premier League ready.",
      "Martinez will be first choice on the left of the back three, with Leny Yoro on the right and Matthijs de Ligt between them. Harry Maguire will also be an option in the middle, with the former captain expected to extend his contract, while the versatile Noussair Mazraoui can expect to get minutes at centre-back or wing-back depending on the opposition.",
      "We're including those wing-back roles as part of the midfield here, for simplicity's sake. Here, the likes of Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot remain options, but United's best XI may well be one with the more attack-minded Amad and Patrick Dorgu out wide.",
      "In the middle, signings further up the field are expected to push captain Bruno Fernandes into a deeper role for the most part. Baleba would be his natural partner if a deal can be done, providing a ball-winning option alongside the Portugal star.",
      "If Baleba stays at Brighton, though, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro will battle it out for that other spot. Toby Collyer and Kobbie Mainoo will also have a role to play, though there were times last term when Amorim appeared keen to play Mainoo further forward.",
      "United scored just 44 league goals last season. Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko scored 48 between them, which our rudimentary maths leads us to believe is more than 44.",
      "The addition of £74m man Sesko could well help ease the pressure on £72m Hojlund, too. However, without European football to share the workload around, there may be questions over the minutes afforded to the Dane.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee will provide a solid rotation option, and showed last season that he could be handy when not being asked to put up the kind of goal numbers he has never put up in his career. There will also be times when Fernandes plays behind the striker to accommodate an extra defensive midfielder - perhaps even for the opening game against Arsenal if Amorim doesn't want to throw all three new boys in at once.",

      "He will join Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively, in a new look Manchester United attack worth more than £200m. Amorim made attacking reinforcements his number one priority this summer after a dismal season which saw them finish 15th and score just 44 league goals in the process.",
      "Amorim's attention can now turn towards a new midfield player, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba at the top of their wishlist. The 21-year-old is the latest Seagulls star tipped for massive things, following the sales of players like Moises Caicedo, Alexis Mac Allister and Joao Pedro.",
      "Baleba has three years remaining on his deal at The Amex, with Brighton unwilling to sell at this point. Nevertheless, contact has been made via intermediaries with the Red Devils boss desperate to add extra dynamism in the middle of the park.",
      "Meanwhile, Newcastle have been left licking their wounds again after yet another near miss in the summer window. Howe had hoped for a transformative window on Tyneside after returning to Europe's elite with a top-four finish.",
      "However, they have now missed out on a host of their top targets, with the future of star striker Alexander Isak remaining up in the air. The Magpies had initially targeted France international Hugo Ekitike, with the idea of pairing him up front with Isak.",
      "Instead, Ekitike made the move to Liverpool, with Anfield bosses now hoping to double down and snatch Isak from St James' Park as well. The Sweden international missed the club's tour of Asia and has been asked to train away from team-mates since their return.",

      "Manchester United have AGREED terms with RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko and finally given Ruben Amorim the No.9 he has craved.",
      "Sesko, 22, emerged as a priority target for United in recent weeks after they completed the signing of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. And they have now beaten Newcastle to a deal for the Slovenia international after upping their initial offer following fresh talks with the German side.",
      "United will pay £66.4m up front and a further £7.6m in add-ons to sign Sesko. The former RB Salzburg man is now poised to fly to Manchester on Thursday to undergo a medical and complete the move. It comes as the real reason Sesko snubbed Newcastle to join the Red Devils comes to light.",
      "Sesko's arrival means United could start the new Premier League campaign with a brand new front three after concluding deals for Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo earlier this summer.",
      "The striker scored 21 goals in all competitions for Leipzig last season and was always expected to seal a blockbuster transfer ahead of the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "United's work in the transfer market to secure deals for three new attackers this summer follows the club's worst ever Premier League campaign, where they finished 15th. The Red Devils scored just 44 goals in 38 games during the season: the fifth worst record across the entire top-flight.",
      "Sesko had been heavily linked with Arsenal earlier in the summer and the Gunners, like United, are long-term admirers of the striker.",
      "However, talk of a move to the Premier League was put on ice when Arsenal instead chose to pursue a move for Viktor Gyokeres, who joined the Londoners from Sporting Lisbon, having grown frustrated with demands from both RBL and the Sesko camp.",
      "Newcastle made a big play to sign the striker and actually made a bigger offer to the German club, but it quickly emerged that Sesko's preference was a move to Manchester United. United have also agreed to play RBL in a pre-season friendly next summer.",
      "Sesko's arrival should be confirmed in good time ahead of the new season, which starts next week. United face Arsenal at Old Trafford in their season opener on Sunday 17 August."

      "Eriksen has attracted offers across the world from clubs who are keen on snapping up the attacking midfielder.",
      "But with Eriksen understood to be keen on staying in western Europe, the option of joining Burnley and remaining in England could appeal to the former Tottenham man.",
      "The Mail report that the Clarets have made contact with Eriksen over a possible deal, which would be regarded as a major coup for Scott Parker's side.",
      "It's claimed that Eriksen also has interest in his services from clubs in Germany and Spain which could scupper Burnley's chances of convincing the playmaker to sign up at Turf Moor.",
      "Eriksen's agent, Martin Schoots, recently confirmed that his client wants to stay in Europe. He told the same publication: \"Christian still wants to play in a first-tier competition and he absolutely wants to stay in Western Europe.",
      "\"There are some contacts going on but it has to suit both sides.\"",
      "Those comments came in the wake of an audacious approach from Wrexham, who have just been promoted to the Championship. The Red Dragons, owned by Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds, are in the market for marquee signings after winning three consecutive promotions to reach the second-tier.",
      "Phil Parkinson, Wrexham's manager, subsequently confirmed that contact had been made with Eriksen but that things had gone no further.",
      "\"There was a call, a bit of dialogue over the summer, but it's not gone any further than that,\" he told BBC Sport Wales. \"But obviously he's a majorly talented player and very well respected throughout football.\"",

      "Roy Keane's glowing assessment of Carlos Baleba might just be vindicated this summer as Manchester United ramp up their interest in the Brighton enforcer. The former Ireland captain was one of many who heaped praise on Baleba last season, and it seems United have sat up and taken note.",
      "They've made enquiries to Brighton about the 21-year-old's availability, according to The Athletic. After Moises Caicedo's big-money move to Chelsea in 2023, Baleba filled the void at the Amex and has quietly impressed in the role. Though not often in the spotlight, the Cameroon star has become an essential part of Brighton's engine room.",
      "Despite his low profile, Baleba's ability hasn't gone unnoticed - with United legend Keane waxing lyrical about him back in March. The 53-year-old not only commended Baleba's displays but also applauded Brighton's consistently sharp recruitment, with the club seemingly set to reap the rewards of their investment in the midfielder.",
      "\"It'll be interesting to see what happens this summer,\" Keane said on ITV following Baleba's standout performance in Brighton's FA Cup victory over Newcastle. \"Fantastic. Great example,\" he added. \"The other clubs must be looking at Brighton and thinking, how are they doing it?\"",
      "Although discussions are underway, United understand that signing Baleba from Brighton will be difficult. He still has three years left on his current contract, and the south coast club have gained a reputation for driving hard bargains - having secured big-money sales for players like Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Joao Pedro and Ben White.",
      "To complicate matters further, United are still prioritising a move for Benjamin Sesko - a transfer that could consume much of their remaining budget. With approximately £130million already committed to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, landing Sesko could take their total spending close to or beyond the £200m mark.",
      "With no income yet from player sales and PSR concerns still looming, the Red Devils can ill afford to spend recklessly this summer. That said, signing a defensive midfielder is reportedly high on their agenda, and Baleba is among the leading candidates.",
      "Brighton, meanwhile, hold the advantage in negotiations. Not only is Baleba secured on a long-term contract, but the club has already brought in over £100m in sales this summer, cashing in on players like Pedro, Simon Adringa and Pervis Estupinan.",
      "Baleba, who has previously attracted attention from Liverpool, has also indicated he's content at Brighton for now. \"If they can help me, I'll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future,\" he said in May.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it's not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.\"",
      "Having arrived from Lille for a fee of around £24m, Baleba's price tag has reportedly skyrocketed, with suggestions Brighton could demand close to £100m for the promising midfielder.",
      "The Seagulls' reputation for uncovering undervalued talent, developing them, and selling at a premium has set a benchmark in football recruitment in recent years. Even as their spending power grows, they continue to generate impressive profits through strategic player sales.",
      "This summer may see a showdown between Brighton's calculated transfer planning and United's drive to land elite talent. Whether Keane's prediction proves accurate remains to be seen - but if negotiations advance, this could become one of the window's most compelling transfer sagas.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand feels Harry Maguire has practically 'risen from the dead' under Ruben Amorim. The seasoned centre-half joined Manchester United back in 2019, but his Old Trafford tenure has been far from plain sailing.",
      "Maguire played a big part in the club's eighth-place finish under Erik ten Hag in the 2023/24 campaign. As a result, the 32-year-old received a wealth of criticism for his performances on the pitch by fans, pundits and club legends alike. Maguire was phased out under Ten Hag as United kicked off last season, deemed surplus to requirements by the Dutchman.",
      "But when Amorim arrived as his successor in November, the Sheffield-born player was able to fight his way back into the team and show some incredible individual performances – despite United ultimately finishing in 15th in the Premier League.",
      "As a result, Maguire now appears to be a part of Amorim's plans for the new season. While he is out of contract next summer, and with a wealth of interest coming from three Premier League clubs – as well as two teams in Italy – it seems increasingly likely that Maguire will stay put. All five transfer approaches were knocked back by United, as per The Daily Mail.",
      "Maguire is said to be keen on signing another extension, which would see him retire at Old Trafford. While the club are said to be on the same page, no formal talks have begun as of yet.",
      "Speaking about Maguire's career resurgence on his Rio Presents podcast alongside Joel Beya, Ferdinand was quick to praise the character and resilience he had shown in hard times.",
      "The former Manchester United and England star said: \"I ain't got that bad energy energy for players or for the club, I want them to do well. But if they don't play well, I'm gonna say what I see, and I had that discussion with Harry Maguire.\"",
      "Ferdinand added: \"We had the tough questions like that, what's it like you having criticism? And someone who risen from the dead almost, shown character. He was down and out, but he's come back. So to show that character and resilience, it was nice to just get beneath the skin and talk with him about it.\"",
      "Maguire's decision to remain at Old Trafford last summer despite Ten Hag's decision has seemingly paid dividends, with Amorim since finding a role in the squad for the former club captain and rewarding him with a one-year contract extension in January.",
      "On top of that, Amorim has also included Maguire in a six-man leadership group alongside Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui, as he looks to utilise the passing down of experience of senior players to younger members of the squad.",
      "Speaking about the cohort, Amorim said: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys. They are responsible for the group. There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that.",
      "\"Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible. All these small changes, but I think it's helping the group. We have Bruno, we have Harry, Licha [Martinez], Diogo, Tom and Nous.\"",
      "Maguire has also excelled during United's pre-season tour of America, starting in the side's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "It will be interesting to see if he starts when United face Fiorentina at Old Trafford come Saturday. Their Premier League opener follows on Sunday, August 17 against Arsenal, where Maguire could face former Red Devils target Viktor Gyokeres, who Amorim knows all about from their time together at Sporting CP.",

      "Paul Pogba has launched a luxury jewellery business with wife Zulay as he looks to get his life back on track following his doping scandal. The French midfielder recently signed a two-year deal with AS Monaco, restarting his footballing journey after receiving a ban for failing a drug test.",
      "Now, Pogba is eager to put his recent troubles behind him as he launches 'Unbreakable', a luxury collection in collaboration with his wife and jewellery house Elke Berr. Speaking to Var-Matin, Zulay described the struggles her husband has been through as something that created an extremely strong bond between them.",
      "She said: \"Paul’s problems were public. It affected us as a couple. It affected our children. We have been through very tough times, but we have stayed united. This is what we wanted to communicate through the collection: you are not alone in facing difficulties, what matters is getting back up.\"",
      "Pogba was once revered as one of the brightest talents in Europe. He found success at Juventus before returning to Manchester United, winning multiple trophies at the highest level. However, in 2023, the midfielder was initially suspended from playing after failing a drug test, with DHEA found in his system while in his second stint in Turin.",
      "More failed results followed, and the Italian side mutually agreed to terminate his contract after Pogba was banned from playing for four years by the Italian Anti-Doping National Tribunal. This ban was later reduced to 18 months, and he was allowed back into the competitive foray by March of this year.",
      "It wasn't just the stress of Pogba's drug ban that brought the couple closer together, though. The French international saw his brother, Mathias, sentenced to three years in prison in 2024 - with two years suspended - for attempted extortion of the ex-United star.",
      "The former footballer had been accused, alongside five other men, of attempting to extort €13million (£10.7m) from Pogba, and was found guilty last year - despite protesting his innocence throughout.",
      "Now, the current Monaco midfielder is trying to put his past behind him and focus on the future with his wife and children, with the jewellery business a joint venture between the two. Discussing their struggles, Zulay said: \"Unbreakable isn’t just about Paul and me.",
      "\"It’s a shared story – that of a child with their mother or father, sisters, brothers, two best friends. These bonds help us not to be defeated by life’s roller coaster. For us, Unbreakable is more than just a jewellery collection. It’s a symbol.\"",
      "The collection offers many different styles of jewellery, from necklaces to rings and bracelets, and is available on the Elke Berr Joaillerie website. Pogba and his partner plan to open a showroom in Monaco next September in collaboration with Monte-Carlo Diamonds.",
      "The Bolivian model added: \"What we went through was seen by many because it was public. But getting back up isn’t just about returning to sport, it’s about returning to life.\"",
      "As Ligue 1 returns in a week, Pogba will hope his life will remain positive. For now, fans will assume a spot in France's 2026 World Cup squad is a potential pipe dream - but the 32-year-old will be back on the pitch soon enough.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "With the signing of Benjamin Sesko now imminent, Ruben Amorim is targeting the signing of a midfielder and Baleba has been linked with move to Old Trafford from Brighton.",
      "Reports have speculated Collyer could be used as a sweetener to sign Baleba this summer because the 21-year-old progressed through Brighton's academy before leaving in 2022.",
      "The MEN previously reported the chance to sign Collyer arose unexpectedly. He was regarded as one of the finest midfielders in the country in his age group and a source at United admitted they were surprised to get the chance to sign him - but they were delighted that they did.",
      "Collyer was born in Worthing, which is around 10 miles from Brighton, and he was destined to break into the first-team at the Amex Stadium until he was let go from the club.",
      "Collyer's future is still up in the air this summer, though. The midfielder has received loan interest and there is thought to be interest from other clubs in signing him on a permanent transfer.",
      "The current indications suggest Collyer will go on loan. \"I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,\" he recently said in the USA.",
      "\"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan.",
      "\"The end goal for me is to play as many minutes as possible here, hopefully starting every week. So yeah, I'll sit down with them.",
      "\"Obviously, my feeling at this moment is I want to stay. I want to play as many games as possible. I've not really thought that far ahead to be honest. I'll just see how the next few weeks go and then we'll go over those conversations.",
      "\"I'll be able to sit down with them and see what's the best solution for that. But yeah, like you said there as well, obviously there's not a lot of time in football. You need to get the results and get the team progressing. So that's what we're working towards at the minute.\"",
      "Collyer made his Premier League debut against Liverpool at Old Trafford last season. He made 13 appearances for the first-team in total but was hampered by a small muscle injury.",
      "Last summer, a source discussed Erik ten Hag's fondness for Collyer and another source said he records 'freakish' running stats in training that are only bettered by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Ruben Amorim has also praised Collyer. \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity,\" said Amorim in January.",

He travelled on a private jet to Manchester alongside his agent, Elvis Basanovic, on Thursday evening and the 22-year-old is now set to undergo a medical to complete his transfer to Old Trafford.",

      "United sources confirmed Onana was training again during the tour but that he was involved in non-contact sessions to avoid the risk of aggravating his injury.",
      "Altay Bayindir has started in three of United's friendlies but struggled to convince. Tom Heaton performed admirably in the 4-1 thrashing of Bournemouth and came on for the second half against Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "As the MEN revealed in January, United have explored the possibility of bolstering their goalkeeping department. A loan proposal for Aston Villa 'keeper Emiliano Martinez did not materialise.",
      "Onana enjoys a good working relationship with United head coach Ruben Amorim, who privately indicated he wanted to keep the £47.2million goalie early in the summer.",
      "Benjamin Sesko arrived in Manchester on Thursday evening to complete his £73.7m transfer from RB Leipzig. Sesko was greeted at Manchester airport by United's director of football negotiations, Matt Hargreaves.",
      "Sesko, 22, could be paraded by United before the Fiorentina game at 12.45pm.",

      "Manchester United's priority in the transfer market all summer has been resolving last season's goalscoring woes.",
      "Only four teams scored fewer goals in the Premier League last term than United, and three of them ended up being relegated to the Championship.",
      "But with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo and their pursuit of Benjamin Sesko looking like it is going to reach a successful conclusion, attention over the last 24 hours has turned towards what is next for United in the transfer market.",
      "It is hardly a secret that Ruben Amorim wants more dynamism in his midfield and after the departure of Christian Eriksen this summer, United need another body in midfield to compete with Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo for a starting place.",
      "And their search has seemingly taken them towards Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba who is said to be a leading target for United this summer.",
      "The 21-year-old is an international teammate of United stars Mbeumo and Andre Onana and has impressed at Premier League level for the Seagulls across the last couple of seasons.",
      "His mentality and attitude are credited among his biggest strengths and, on the evidence of what we have seen during his time at the Amex Stadium, he is exactly the kind of player Amorim covets in his midfield.",
      "The problem is Brighton owner Tony Bloom is renowned as a master negotiator and a tough seller. Brighton have negotiated large fees for the likes of Moises Caicedo, Joao Pedro, Yves Bissouma, Marc Cucurella, Alexis Mac Allister and Ben White in recent seasons.",
      "Baleba will be a difficult and expensive transfer to make and while he may be one of United's top targets, they may well be forced to seek possible alternatives.",
      "With that in mind, using DataMB's player similarity generator tool to bring up players with similar characteristics to Baleba, one of the top results is a little-known German midfielder who has been a revelation for Freiburg in the Bundesliga.",
      "Patrick Osterhage joined the German side from Bochum last summer and made 30 league appearances last term to help his side almost qualify for the Champions League.",
      "The 25-year-old was seen as an astute buy and his ability to screen the back four at the base of their midfield was one of the big reasons behind their success last term.",
      "Speaking after his arrival at the Europa-Park Stadion, Freiburg sporting director Klemens Hartenbach not only praised his ability on the pitch but also cited his character away from the field as a big reason as to why they chose to sign him.",
      "\"We’ve had our eye on Patrick for a number of years,\" Hartenbach said.",
      "\"When he was younger, he battled through tough times thanks to his remarkable attitude. He can play anywhere in the midfield and we’re convinced that he still has a lot of potential.",
      "\"Patrick can pass well, but also likes to shoot himself. He’ll be a great addition to the side given his dynamism, pace and excellent stamina. We’re really excited.\"",
      "And while Osterhage's physical qualities would appeal to Amorim, that attitude is something the United boss is demanding from his United side.",
      "\"It is a key point in our way to do things now,\" Amorim said when discussing why United signed Mbeumo and Cunha this summer.",
      "\"It's not just how they play, it's really important of course, but the character is really important.",
      "\"We took a lot of time to know the players, to talk with everybody before we bring a player to our group. That is going to be massive in our decision to bring players.\"",
      "Transfermarkt value him at £8.68million and given he has the qualities Amorim seeks from new arrivals, he could prove to be an absolute steal as a possible Baleba alternative.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog on Friday, August 8,",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been busy this summer in an attempt to strengthen significantly following a disastrous 2024/25 campaign. Roughly £120million has been spent on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and that figure looks set to rise further with Benjamin Sesko's arrival imminent.",
      "The RB Leipzig star opted for a move to Old Trafford over Newcastle United with a £73.8million (€85m) package deal agreed.",
      "Plans are now being drawn up for his unveiling and medical tests with the Slovenia international landing in Manchester on Thursday evening.",
      "Elsewhere, contact has been made for Brighton's Carlos Baleba with Amorim in need of a new central midfielder. A goalkeeper coming in is also a real possibility with the future of Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has been linked, taking a fresh twist.",
      "With all of that being said, stay right here as MEN Sport bring you the latest United news and transfer rumours!",
      "Matthijs de Ligt praised Manchester United's signings in the summer transfer window when speaking to club media in the USA. Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon have arrived thus far with the Dutchmen speaking fondly of all three.",
      "I think they have made a really good impression. Bryan [Mbeumo] has only been here a few days, so we can't say too much about him, but he's already scored some goals during training.",
      "I think we can be really happy with him. Matheus [Cunha] has been here for two weeks now and he's training really well. It's a new club and environment, but he's already been chatting and making jokes with teammates.",
      "I think that's a really good adaptation from him. Diego [Leon] is a little bit younger, but he is also a player with a lot of talent. He is really strong and physical.",
      "He comes from a different system, so tactically he has to learn a little bit, but all the physical and tactical abilities are with him to become a really good player.",
      "It's been a really good window and hopefully they can help us as much as possible.",
      "Manchester United may have to part ways with a club-record transfer fee in order to sign Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "The conditions of a potential deal have been explored already with contact made and the 21-year-old not believed to have closed the doors on a potential switch. Unfortunately for United, it certainly seems as though the Seagulls have.",
      "Every club has their price and according to ESPN, Brighton's is £104million with Manchester City also being credited with an interest.",
      "If that is the case, considering the funds already used on other signings, it seems highly unlikely Baleba joins.",
      "Though Chelsea remain keen on signing Alejandro Garnacho, an injury blow elsewhere may change their transfer priority.",
      "As announced by the Blues on Thursday, Levi Colwill has undergone surgery after rupturing his ACL in training. It is likely Enzo Maresca and Co. are yet to decide on how to proceed but it is possible the Garnacho deal is impacted, especially if they pursue another new centre-back signing.",
      "With Jamie Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap already signed while a deal for Xavi Simons seems more advanced, Chelsea may end up using remaining funds to strengthen at the back having lost a key player.",
      "Chelsea remain in talks to sign Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho with transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealing a key update.",
      "There is a long-term interest in the Argentine from Stamford Bridge with a deal being pursued alongside Xavi Simons of RB Leipzig.",
      "Romano has now revealed that Garnacho has agreed every detail of personal terms and that now talks with Man United over a fee will follow.",
      "Manchester United have been given fresh hope of arranging a transfer exit for Antony this summer after it was reported that Portuguese giants Benfica have entered talks for the forward.",
      "The Brazil international impressed on loan at Real Betis in the latter half of last season but he remains out of Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "Despite increasing his stock, United look to be struggling to sell with it though Antony's sizeable wage is proving a problem for them. Now, Mais Futebol is reporting that Benfica have thrown their hats into the ring.",
      "It has been stated however, they are only willing to sign him on loan while United would prefer a permanent exit being sanctioned in the region of £43million.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund faces an uncertain Manchester United future following the expected arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Dane has struggled significantly since arriving at Old Trafford with a return to Italy now looking entirely possible.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, AC Milan are now prioritising a move for Hojlund ahead of Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic this summer. It is believed that the Italian giants would like the deal to be a loan with an option to purchase next summer.",
      "Hojlund's stock remains high in Italy thanks to his spell at Atalanta before joining United. It is claimed that AC could look to include an option to buy worth as much as £30m in 2026.",
      "Manchester United look to have been handed a major Gianluigi Donnarumma transfer twist amid links to the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper.",
      "The Italy international has just one year remaining on his contract and with minimal progress made over an extension, the Champions League holders have made a big move.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, PSG have agreed to sign Lille shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier for over £34.7million (€40m).",
      "With such a big fee spent on the 23-year-old, it seems unlikely he will not be the long-term No.1 which could result in Donnarumma considering a summer exit.",
      "Manchester United fans have made their feelings clear on the club's transfer interest in Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old is the latest midfield gem uncovered by Brighton with it no surprise those at Old Trafford have taken a keen interest.",
      "It is understood, he is open to the move but the Seagulls are likely to demand a high fee to sanction an exit. Despite that, it has been made perfectly clear to the United hierarchy that he should be signed.",

      "Benjamin Sesko will have his Manchester United medical today, according to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Slovenia international landed in Manchester on Thursday evening after United and RB Leipzig reached an agreement in principle for his transfer.",
      "Romano states the plan is now for him to undergo medical tests over the coming hours and assuming all goes well, be officially unveiled on Saturday at Old Trafford either before or at half time of United's pre-season clash against Fiorentina.",
      "United will then have plenty of time to register him for their Premier League-opener against Arsenal. Sesko was in talks to join the Gunners before they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Hello and welcome back to MEN Sport's Manchester United transfer live blog!",
      "The major updates are starting to emerge as Ruben Amorim and Co. hope for a big August with more new signings brought in and a positive start to the new Premier League season.",

      "United travel to Tottenham on 8 November, with the return fixture at Old Trafford on 7 February. Meanwhile, United host Chelsea on September 20, before visiting Stamford Bridge on April 18.",
      "Douglas Luiz has reportedly emerged on Man United’s shortlist this week, with the Juventus midfielder expected to leave his current club before the transfer window closes.",
      "The Brazilian is also attracting interest from Everton and Nottingham Forest, though Juventus are said to be demanding a permanent deal rather than a loan.",

      "MORE HERE",
      "United fans will have to wait that little bit longer to see a proper image of Sesko in Manchester.",
      "When that happens, it will likely be in his new red kit...",
      "It appears that Sesko is now in Manchester.",
      "Let's face it, it would not be a transfer window without some grainy airport pictures, would it?",
      "According to YouTubers flght, Sesko's private jet has arrived in Manchester from Leipzig during the last hour.",
      "The forward will likely be heading to his accomodation for the evening now before travelling to Carrington to complete his switch to Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko is set to join having scored 21 goals for the German club in all competitions last season.",
      "At the beginning of the summer, it was thought that United wanted Garnacho to go for no less than £60m.",
      "Of course, that position has been weakened as we edge nearer to the transfer window slamming shut.",
      "Chelsea are thought to be only wanting to spend as little as £30m on the winger.",
      "In truth, the figure will likely be somewhere between those two figures even if United's need to sell is greater now.",
      "Our colleagues at football.london understand that Garnacho has begun talks with Chelsea over a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "The Blues are advancing with their move for the winger who is keen to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Garnacho remains one of United's only sellable assets and the Reds will hope they can get good money for the forward.",
      "Hello and welcome to the United transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and it looks like we are in for a busy evening as the summer transfer window sparks into life once again.",
      "First up, let's take a look at the latest on this man's future in the Premier League.",
      "Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee have featured in team training ahead of Saturday's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina and the Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "Neither Onana nor Zirkzee have featured so far this pre-season due to injury issues, despite travelling to the United States for the club's pre-season tour. Onana suffered a hamstring injury in the first week of pre-season training last month, meaning he has been in a race against the clock to try and get himself fit for the Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford a week on Sunday.",
      "Zirkzee was also pictured training in the latest images published by the club, suggesting his recovery is also heading in the right direction. He was rushed back from a hamstring injury for last season's Europa League final but suffered a different injury three weeks ago. After being left out of the squad that travelled to Stockholm for the pre-season opener against Leeds United last month, he was included in the squad that jetted off to the US, but he did not feature in any of United's three Premier League Summer Series outings.",
      "\"I've got a small injury but it shouldn’t take too long to recover now,\" Zirkzee said during the tour. \"I've got great physios working with me every day. It's not a serious problem. It's pre-season so unlike last season where I wanted to push myself to be back for the final, obviously now I just want to be there for the start of the season.\"",
      "Benjamin Sesko has been pictured on a private jet alongside his agent, Elvis Basanovic.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, the striker will arrive in Manchester tonight ahead of his medical and contract signing on Friday.",
      "Romano adds that he will be officially unveiled on Saturday.",
      "Man United have been heavily backed to land Carlos Baleba this summer amid reports of interest. United are priced at 4/6 with Betfair with Chelsea out to 5/1 and Man City at 13/2.",
      "Betfair Spokesperson, James Mackie said: “Carlos Baleba has attracted the attention of Manchester United in what would look a huge boost to the Red Devils midfield if they can get the deal over the line before deadline day.\"",
      "Man United are reportedly open to allowing Rasmus Hojlund to leave on loan as they close in on a move for Benjamin Sesko, according to sources in Italy.",
      "Sky Italy now reports that the Reds are even willing to consider letting Hojlund leave on loan. It's said that AC Milan are among the frontrunners to sign Hojlund, with some reports suggesting they could put forward a loan offer that includes an option to buy.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot whatever happens,\" Hojlund said last month. \"I am still very young. I think people sometimes forget that. I am only 22 years old.",
      "\"I have learned a lot, and I think that shows in my game. I have done very well so far during the pre-season.\"",
      "Scott McTominay has been nominated for the Ballon d'Or.",
      "The 28-year-old, who left United to sign for Napoli in a deal worth £25million last summer, enjoyed a memorable first season at the Italian outfit.",
      "Indeed, McTominay helped Antonio Conte's side win the Serie A title, scoring 12 goals in 34 league matches and winning the division's Most Valuable Player award in the process.",
      "Alongside McTominay, Paris Saint-Germain stars Ousmane Dembele, Desire Doue, Vitinha, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Achraf Hakimi, Joao Neves, Nuno Mendes, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Fabian Ruiz, Barcelona quartet Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Pedri, Robert Lewandowski, Real Madrid trio Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, Inter Milan duo Lautaro Martinez and Denzel Dumfries, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alexis Mac Allister, Florian Wirtz, Arsenal duo Declan Rice and Viktor Gyokeres, Bayern Munich pair Harry Kane and Michael Olise, Chelsea's Cole Palmer, Manchester City's Erling Haaland and Borussia Dortmund's Serhou Guirassy are included.",
      "McTominay spent 22 years at Old Trafford.",
      "According to The Athletic’s David Ornstein, Chelsea have stepped up talks to sign Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The two clubs have been in contact over the winger for some time, but negotiations have now progressed, and Garnacho is reportedly expecting to complete a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Keen to remain in the Premier League, Garnacho is believed to be set on 'Chelsea or nothing'.",
      "Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg claims that Benjamin Sesko agreed to waive part of his salary in order to join Man United.",
      "It’s reported that he would have earned more had he chosen Newcastle United. Additionally, his agency, led by Elvis Basanovic has reportedly given up a significant portion of their commission.",
      "Plettenberg describes these sacrifices as necessary to push the move to Manchester United over the line.",

      "According to a report by The Athletic, United have 'made contact' with Brighton, via intermediaries, to explore the possibility of bringing him to Old Trafford.",
      "Capable of doing a little bit of everything in the engine room, the 21-year-old would provide the energy, aggression and ball-carrying expertise United sorely lack in midfield.",
      "\"Declan Rice, Matheus Cunha, Joelinton, they've all told me I've got it in me,\" Baleba told The Sun earlier this summer. \"I want to win the Ballon d'Or like Rodri.",
      "\"I watched him during the Euros and before his injury I played against him and time I got the ball, he was right in front of me. It was my first game against Manchester City, and it was very difficult.",
      "\"He made it so hard to dribble or pass. That showed his class. His success has opened the door for midfielders like us to believe we can win the Ballon d'Or someday.\""

      "Ahead of last summer's transfer window, Alejandro Garnacho was one of only four players Manchester United deemed untouchable.",
      "United planned for mass changes ahead of the 2024 summer window - the first under Ineos' stewardship - and they were prepared to listen to offers for everyone within the squad except for Andre Onana, Kobbie Mainoo, Rasmus Hojlund and Garnacho.",
      "Onana and Hojlund had arrived at Old Trafford the previous summer and Mainoo and Garnacho had established themselves as first-team regulars after coming through United's academy system.",
      "Now, just 12 months on, Garnacho has no future at Old Trafford and is running out of time to seal an exit. He has not featured in pre-season and has been relegated to the 'bomb squad' alongside Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Garnacho last played for United when they beat Hong Kong 3-1 in their post-season tour on May 30. His last competitive appearance came via the bench in the Europa League final just over a week earlier.",
      "Furious he had been left out of the starting line-up for the defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, Garnacho used his post-match interaction with the media to let everyone know of his feelings.",
      "\"Obviously it’s hard for everyone,\" he said, reflecting on United's 2024/25 struggles. \"Our season was s**t. We didn't beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more.",
      "\"Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today – I don't know. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "Previously guilty of criticising former United manager Erik ten Hag for substituting him during a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium in April last year, Garnacho also had to pay for a team meal by way of an apology for walking down the tunnel in response to being substituted against Ipswich Town at Old Trafford in February.",
      "Garnacho has developed an inflated sense of entitlement and has let himself down once too often. His activity on social media has also made headlines once too often.",
      "As talented as he is, United are, as has been well documented, better off rid of him. Reports of Chelsea stepping up their efforts to take him off United's hands are a blessing.",
      "Just like fellow wingers Marcus Rashford, who has already left Old Trafford this summer, joining Barcelona on a season-long loan deal, Sancho and Antony, Garnacho has no place in Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "The United head coach wasted no time in transforming United's style of play last November by switching to a wingerless 3-4-2-1 formation. Of the five wingers United had on their books at the start of last season, only Amad remains part of Amorim's plans.",
      "Criticised for not making the most of the seller's market in recent years, United have to cash-in on Garnacho before the window closes on September 1. There is literally no point in retaining a player that doesn't fit the coach's system and doesn't want to be at the club.",
      "Despite his attitude issues, Garnacho is a fantastic player with enormous potential. You don't make almost 150 appearances for United before celebrating your 21st birthday without having plenty of talent in the locker.",
      "On a personal note, Garnacho enjoyed a productive season last term, scoring 11 goals and registering ten assists in all competitions. It was an impressive haul given he had to adapt to a new formation less than three months into the season, meaning his stock is currently high.",
      "After being left out of the squad for the Manchester derby win over City at the Etihad Stadium in December, he fought his way back into the team and remained a regular starter. However, his comments after the defeat to Spurs in Bilbao marked the end of the road.",
      "He has put his nose out of joint once too often, and it is a shame considering how talented he is with a ball at his feet.",
      "However, United are at a juncture where they need to get a deal thrashed out before the deadline, get some much-needed cash in the bank and move on.

      "Chelsea have reportedly agreed personal terms with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Manchester United need the Argentina international sold before this transfer window ends, and their Premier League rivals appear his most viable destination. Garnacho is said only to want Chelsea, who previously showed interest in the player when the winter window was open.",
      "The Blues have already added Estevao Willian, Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro to their squad this summer, with Geovany Quenda also arriving next year, but more additions seem likely. They reportedly are negotiating with RB Leipzig to sign Xavi Simons, pursuing both Garnacho and the Netherlands international.",
      "The journalist Fabrizio Romano claims it is a done deal for Garnacho on the player's side, with every detail purportedly agreed on personal terms. Talks between Chelsea and United on a fee are now said to be the next step that will follow soon.",
      "Romano also reiterates that the wantaway winger only wants Chelsea. He added that they are pursuing Garnacho and Simons rather than one or the other.",
      "Ruben Amorim has already addressed why the wantaway winger is due to leave 12 months after being considered untouchable by United. \"Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out,\" Amorim acknowledged to journalists in Chicago earlier this month.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is, but I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that, so it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy; you have the connection, other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything OK for all the parties; to the club, to the coach and to the players; it's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "Matthijs de Ligt has praised Manchester United's signings in the summer transfer window.",
      "United began the transfer window by announcing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves. Cunha's release clause of £62.5million was triggered and he signed a five-year contract.",
      "Due to protracted negotiations, it took over a month to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, but a breakthrough was agreed before the USA tour and the forward arrived for £65million plus £6million in add-ons.",
      "Diego Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer window.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno to sign Leon.",
      "Speaking to club media in the USA, De Ligt shared his thoughts on the new additions and said: \"I think they have made a really good impression. Bryan [Mbeumo] has only been here a few days, so we can't say too much about him, but he's already scored some goals during training.",
      "\"I think we can be really happy with him. Matheus [Cunha] has been here for two weeks now and he's training really well. It's a new club and environment, but he's already been chatting and making jokes with teammates.",
      "\"I think that's a really good adaptation from him. Diego [Leon] is a little bit younger, but he is also a player with a lot of talent. He is really strong and physical. He comes from a different system, so tactically he has to learn a little bit, but all the physical and tactical abilities are with him to become a really good player.",
      "\"It's been a really good window and hopefully they can help us as much as possible.\"",
      "De Ligt competed against Cunha and Mbeumo last season and provided further insight.",
      "\"I think Matheus is a really technical player, with Brazilian flair, really good with the ball and really fast,\" he said. \"I didn't expect that. He scores goals and gives assists, so a really good addition.",
      "\"Bryan is more efficient; he just needs one action to go to his left foot, and he'll score. I think this is one of the biggest qualities in football, the ability to score and I think he can really help us with that.\"",
      "Reflecting on his first season in Manchester after signing from Bayern Munich, De Ligt added: \"I feel there’s still a lot more to come. Sometimes me and other football fans forget I’m still 25, and as a centre-back you’re normally in your prime at 28 or 29, so in that way, I’m still quite young.",
      "“Personally, I’d love to carry on from how I was in March, April – I feel that is the level I could show and should show on a consistent basis. That’s my personal goal, and also to stay fit, that is really important.",
      "\"And then the goal with the team is to really show everybody what it is to play for United, and to get a positive vibe again around the team and the club.",
      "“We want to show the fans what United is and that we want to win every game. It’s a nice feeling to start over again, because it gives you a clean slate, and hopefully from the start we can really get these positive vibes back.”",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "However, despite the Magpies' best efforts, Sesko has been leaning towards a move to Old Trafford throughout, and a deal is now on course to get over the line.",
      "He is poised to become United's fourth signing of the summer, following the earlier captures of Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United have been in discussions with Leipzig over the past week or so and their offer has matched the German club's demands. United have been determined to sign a striker all summer after finishing last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10.",
      "The Reds have already bolstered their attacking ranks this summer, bringing in Cunha from Wolves and Mbeumo from Brentford. The duo, before accounting for add-ons, have cost United an initial £127.5m.",
      "As a result, their pursuit of Sesko, who was of interest to the Reds back in 2022, United's spending is set to smash its way through the £190m barrier.",
      "United are also in the market for a midfielder and a goalkeeper ahead of the September 1 transfer deadline, and they have been heavily linked with Brighton & Hove Albion midfield ace Carlos Baleba over the last 24 hours or so.",

      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has been pictured in Manchester as he prepares to complete his transfer to Manchester United this week.",
      "The Slovenian became United's top priority once Bryan Mbeumo had joined from Brentford. Unlike the Mbeumo negotiations, it appears that the Reds have managed to complete a deal with the Bundesliga side much quicker.",
      "Despite competition from Newcastle for his signature, United have managed to persuade Sesko that their project is greater and it has been widely reported that United have agreed an initial £66m fee for the striker. Upon reaching an agreement with Leipzig, the club have worked quickly to get Sesko to the UK.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, Sesko was pictured by the German media boarding a private jet in Leipzig ahead of his imminent arrival at United. Now, the forward has been spotted heading into the airport terminal building having arrived at Manchester Airport.",
      "With this not being deadline day, there is less pressure on United and Sesko to complete the necessary paperwork and medical on Thursday evening. Instead, it will be expected that the centre-forward will complete these formalities at Carrington on Friday ahead of a potential announcement Saturday, prior to the pre-season fixture against Fiorentina.",
      "United have often used home matches to unveil new signings to their supporters. Rasmus Hojlund was presented to supporters at Old Trafford while Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu received the same treatment in the January transfer window.",
      "Should Sesko complete his move this week, he will be in line to make his debut for the club against Arsenal on August 17. The Gunners were credited with interest in the Slovenian during the summer transfer window but eventually abandoned their pursuit after welcoming Viktor Gyokeres to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Ironically, Gyokeres is a player that United's head coach Ruben Amorim knows well having signed him from Coventry City and developed him into Sporting's talisman.",

      "After finishing 15th in the Premier League last season, Manchester United have had no choice but to attack in this summer's transfer window.",
      "A bottom half finish, a trophyless campaign and another season that featured more upheaval off the pitch meant United signed off for the summer with very little optimism for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao ended United's hopes of qualifying for this season's Champions League, meaning they will be without European football for the first time since 2014/15 this term.",
      "The biggest concern immediately raised on the back of United's failure to qualify for Europe's premier club competition was about this summer's window. With no European football on offer, it was feared United could find life difficult in the market.",
      "Instead, with just under four weeks to go until the September 1 deadline, United are still in with a chance of having their strongest summer window in years - and much of it stems from rolling back the years and readopting a former blueprint.",
      "Having finished last season with a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League, United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings in this summer's transfer window, so far bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "The duo were among the Premier League's best players last season, scoring 35 league goals between them. United wasted no time in signing Cunha, triggering his £62.5million release clause on the opening day of the window, before setting their sights on Mbeumo and eventually getting him through the door last month.",
      "Cunha, who is well-versed in a three-at-the-back system, is a tailor-made fit for the left-sided No.10 spot in Ruben Amorim's team, whereas Mbeumo offers a multifunctional option in the attacking department. Both players are goalscorers and were linked with moves to Premier League clubs that could have offered them Champions League football this coming season before putting pen to paper on long-term deals at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha, who finalised his move to United on June 12, became the first attacker United had signed from a Premier League counterpart on a permanent basis since Alexis Sanchez arrived from Arsenal in January 2018.",
      "United were big spenders in the 2017/18 campaign, making four statement signings, of which three already played in the Premier League. Prior to signing Sanchez in the mid-season window, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic arrived from Everton and Chelsea respectively ahead of the start of the season.",
      "Since signing the aforementioned trio, United have not signed three Premier League players in the same window. However, that could change before the end of this window amid their interest in Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "Despite making attacking signings a priority this summer, United are desperate to strengthen their midfield before the bell sounds at the start of next month. They lack energy and aggression in the middle of the pitch, making the addition of a new midfielder vitally important.",
      "Baleba, 21, joined Brighton from Lille in 2023 and has gone from strength-to-strength ever since, becoming one of the most exciting youngsters in the Premier League. According to The Athletic, United have 'made contact' with Brighton via intermediaries.",
      "Although the Cameroonian is only 21 and has just 61 Premier League appearances to his name, he has quickly proven he is a quality operator at this level. He was one of the best all-round midfielders in the division last season, demonstrating he can provide the traits United are desperately lacking in the engine room.",
      "Baleba, who has previously addressed his hunger for winning silverware, is another example of Brighton's fabulous scouting system. The Seagulls are the masters of unearthing hidden gems, polishing them and selling them on for a handsome profit.",
      "Although no transfer offers the guarantee of success, there is less risk involved when signing players who are already proven in the league you need them to perform in. Cunha and Mbeumo are statement signings for United, and Baleba would be the same if he were to end up at Old Trafford.",
      "After taking one too many gambles on overseas imports in recent years, it has been refreshing to see United roll back the years this summer. Mbeumo and Cunha are excellent additions and have the necessary qualities to thrive in M16, meaning Baleba could potentially follow suit.",
      "This particular approach rarely let Ferguson down.",

However, it remains to be seen if United will be able to fund a deal for him amid their ongoing pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",

      "On the cusp of spending £75m to land Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, and having already signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo for a combined £132.5m, Manchester United have not been shy about spending this summer.",
      "While the ability of a side that finished last season in the Premier League fifth from bottom, and has no lucrative European football to look forward to this coming season may have been questioned by rival fans, the explanation is a pretty simple one.",
      "Manchester United remains one of the world’s biggest sporting teams, not just football teams, sporting teams. They rank alongside the New York Yankees, the Dallas Cowboys, Real Madrid and the Los Angeles Lakers when it comes to size and scale, dwarfing some of those in terms of actual revenue.",
      "United remains a big business. They are a global football brand that has fans that run deep into the hundreds of millions. That means that there is always cash coming into the business and, even with some fallow years in terms of competitive success, as long as they remain PSR compliant, which they have been, with accounts submitted being for Red Football Limited as opposed to Manchester United Plc, then they can spend.",
      "It gets more challenging and more fraught with risk the longer they spend outside of the Champions League, but it is a brand built over decades, and that means that they remain a big fish. The fact that they continue to have pull for top players even without Champions League football should be instructive.",
      "But some of the risks attached to being such a big side still and being able to pay the big money, something which co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously bemoaned before this summer splurge, are that the large number of players that still sit on their books and are no longer part of the Ruben Amorim vision are hard to shift to anywhere else but the Premier League, and selling talent to rivals isn’t normally the preferred course of action.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been heading for the Old Trafford exit for some time, with Amorim clear that he is not part of his plans. But on wages that while nowhere near the £250,000/£300,000 mark of some of his teammates, are still far above what many top sides outside of England can pay, it becomes a small market.",
      "Previous suitors have been told, according to The Athletic, that £70m is the valuation on Garnacho. That may be what United want, but it is hard to see that is what they are going to get because there will be few options available to try and get a bidding war going. Outside of the Premier League’s bigger sides, Spanish giants Real Madrid, Bayern Munich of the Bundesliga and the Saudi Pro League, the likes of Italy and France, save for Paris Saint-Germain who have moved away from that model in recent times, cannot play in that space.",
      "The broadcasting revenues in Spain, Germany, Italy and France are dwarfed by the Premier League, and only clubs such as Madrid and Bayern, as well as Barcelona when they finally get their house in order after the pandemic hit them badly, can lay claim to generating revenues in line with Premier League sides, even those in the bottom half.",
      "That makes shifting players difficult. Twenty years ago it would have been a normal sight to see the likes of AC Milan, Juventus or Internazionale in the running for top talent, but those clubs have fallen so far behind the Premier League in revenue terms that they cannot be active participants in that market. Sure, the odd loan happens here and there, but it is often heavily subsidised on the wage side and requires some give from the players to leave world football’s elite domestic league.",
      "Marcus Rashford would have been sold before now if there was a fully functioning market. But his huge wages mean that few could afford both the salary and the fee required. Barcelona have opted to take a punt on the deal in the knowledge that if it works out then his value will be far lower next summer due to him being a year out from the end of his contract.",
      "But then there is Garnacho. His behaviour creates some red flags for recruitment teams in the Premier League and that will have hurt his value proposition. United may posture about wanting £70m, but there will be a lot of room for negotiation as they know his value won’t be increasing over the next 12 months if he doesn’t play, and his wages will be a burden. They need a suitor, and with the player wanting to stay in the Premier League, Chelsea offers them the chance to sell, and they know that as an academy graduate he represents pure profit from an accounting standpoint.",
      "Jadon Sancho is another example. United want to offload but there are few clubs able to come to the table to offer the kind of money that United want and the player wants. Players don’t like taking pay cuts, especially hefty ones, regardless of how much they are on. It impacts the leverage they have when it comes to contract negotiations in the future if they accept less than what it was deemed at one stage their value was.",
      "Players like Rasmus Hojlund are also difficult to sell. United vastly overpaid for the Danish striker when they signed him from Atalanta in the summer of 2023 for a fee that could rise up to £72m if all conditions were met. Report suggest that the club would now accept £30m, and that would barely recoup the remaining book value he has.",
      "Paying good money for players is something that is afforded to the biggest clubs. The best players cost the biggest fees, but it isn’t always the case that the bigger the fee the more guaranteed success is.",
      "United have spent a lot. There is obvious wisdom in signing Cunha and Mbeumo, Premier League proven, albeit for two players who at 26 and 27 likely won’t carry enormous resale value in three or four years' time. Sesko has no Premier League experience but has a far greater chance of a big resale value or recouping funds if it goes awry.",
      "But the whole ecosystem continues to be buoyed by the Premier League, with the occasional Saudi side stepping in to offer big wages for fading lights. United’s pursuit of Carlos Baleba from Brighton & Hove Albion is an obvious long-term play, but without moving on some of the high earners from previous regimes, where structure and strategy was absent, then it is hard to press the reset button truly.",
      "Whoever took the reins at United needed time. It is a big job to turn around. But the past in the market should provide some lessons, and the club will have to be mindful that when it comes to moving on mistakes in the market, the options are limited, and that is a result of the willingness of United and others to meet huge demands that have made the system deeply flawed.",

      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has appeared to like a transfer update regarding the pursuit of Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian has been at the forefront of speculation this summer but it appears that Old Trafford will be his destination after turning down a move to Newcastle United.",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim is closing in on his third major summer signing after striking an agreement in principle to sign the RB Leipzig star. The Athletic have claimed that a deal worth €75.6million (£65.5m) with €8.5m (£7.4m) in add-ons has been agreed to bolster United's attacking force.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo became the second summer arrival after his long-anticipated switch from Brentford was completed, but the deal to bring Matheus Cunha to the Theatre of Dreams was much more seamless as his release clause was triggered.",
      "The move for Sesko was widely reported with Fabrizio Romano posting regular updates across his social media channels.",
      "His post on Instagram regarding a supposed agreement to sign Sesko attracted over 1.2million likes.",
      "It appeared that a social media account linked with Hojlund liked the post, despite the attacker's arrival posing fresh competition for a starting berth.",
      "The MEN reported on Wednesday that the former Atalanta striker is resigned to being forced out by Manchester United if the 22-year-old completes a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It's understood that sources close to the Denmark international have conceded that if Hojlund is unwanted it could lift his game, but ultimately, he may have to seek a move before the transfer deadline at the beginning of September.",
      "A lack of minutes would also throw up uncertainty over a place in Denmark's squad. The Dane's are set to qualify for the expanded World Cup next year and the attacker lost his place in the team in June after a run of one goal in 15 games for the national team.",
      "Speaking during the recent pre-season tour in America, Hojlund expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place in Amorim's side.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22.",
      "\"Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland).",
      "\"But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "\"Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "United replaced De Gea with Andre Onana between the posts two summers ago, and now the duo will go head-to-head this weekend. Ahead of the fixture, United have confirmed they have plans in place for when De Gea returns to Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The Reds have confirmed that there will be a presentation pre-match to honour De Gea's time with the club. Bruno Fernandes will lead the presentation, which will take place ahead of kick-off.",
      "During his time at United, De Gea made 545 appearances and won five major trophies, including a Premier League title. He has since gone on to have an impressive spell with Fiorentina and helped the Italian club reach the semi-final of the Conference League last season.",

      "Our colleagues at football.london understand the forward has entered talks with his ambition being to remain in the Premier League. Garnacho's time at Old Trafford was on borrowed time after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Garnacho expressed his disappointment at not playing a greater role in the fixture during a post-match interview. Earlier in the day, he had posted a picture of himself celebrating his goal during his last cup final against Manchester City under Erik ten Hag.",
      "MEN Sport reported at the time that Ruben Amorim had informed Garnacho that he should seek a move away from the club this summer. Following the summer break, Garnacho told United that he wished to leave, along with four of his other teammates.",
      "The Argentine was granted an extended summer break to aid his search for a new club but he would soon return to Carrington to undertake an individual training programme. Garnacho did not feature in the summer tour of the US and it now seems like progress is being made to end his time at the club.",
      "It has previously been reported that Chelsea are unwilling to spend more than £30m on Garnacho in the summer transfer window which is less than what Napoli bid for him in January. That offer was thought to be closer to the £40m region.",
      "All this comes as United appear to be closing in on a new addition to their squad. RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko has been pictured on a private jet believed to be headed for Manchester.",

      "Further details have emerged about Manchester United's move to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United have been heavily linked with signing the Slovenia international over the last few weeks, with the Reds having confidence that a deal could be agreed with the Bundesliga outfit. News emerged on Thursday that United have agreed a deal with Leipzig to sign Sesko this summer.",
      "Sesko has also been a player of interest to Newcastle, but United have seemingly won the race for the striker's signature. A £74million bid including add-ons was made by United earlier this week, with Sesko closing in on a move to Old Trafford ahead of the start of the new Premier League season.",
      "Since news broke of United agreeing a deal for Sesko, updates have regularly emerged in the media giving further details on the deal. One such update has come from Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg.",
      "His report has claimed that Sesko has agreed to 'waive' a portion of his wage at United in order to help make the move possible, with the Slovenia international having been offered a more lucrative salary package by Newcstle. It has not been stated how much of Sesko's salary will be waived, if the report turns out to be accurate.",
      "It has also been claimed in the same report that Sesko's agency, led by Elvis Basanovic, have waived some of their commission from the deal in order to get the transfer over the line.",
      "Should United get a deal over the line for Sesko, he would become the third new attacking signing of the summer to be added to Ruben Amorim's squad. United have already signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while they completed a deal earlier this year to bring defender Diego Leon to Old Trafford.",

      "The move will be seen as a coup for United considering that Newcastle were keen on his signature and could offer him Champions League football this campaign. As for United, this would complete their attacking signings this summer having already brought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sesko is now expected to fly to England shortly to complete his medical and eventually become a United player ahead of the new Premier League season beginning on Sunday, August 17 when Arsenal visit. With Sesko now primed to move to Old Trafford, the conversation switches to which squad number he will wear for Ruben Amorim's men.",
      "His favoured No.30 is off the table after it was given to fellow new recruit Diego Leon earlier in the transfer window. At his first club, FC Liefering, Sesko wore the No.21 which currently belongs to Antony, however the Brazilian has informed United that he wishes to depart this summer.",
      "Marcus Rashford lost his shirt number when he asked to leave so it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the same could happen to Antony. For Slovenia, Sesko mainly wears the No.11 which is currently owned by Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "It is unlikely that he will inherit that number considering Zirkzee is committed to staying at United. The coveted No.9 is worn by Rasmus Hojlund but could become available as MEN Sport understands the Dane could consider his options elsewhere if he loses his place to Sesko.",
      "The lowest available number to Sesko is the No.14 which was worn by Christian Eriksen until his departure at the end of last season. The last striker to wear that was Mexican favourite Chicharito.",
      "Other potential options include the No.20, previously worn by Diogo Dalot until he received his upgrade, the numbers 27-29, 31, 34-36 and 38-40.",

      "Man Utd have ‘agreed a loan deal’ for Rasmus Hojlund with AC Milan in ‘pole position’ to get a deal over the line for the striker, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have made three new signings this summer with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon all joining Ruben Amorim’s squad.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are set to transform Man Utd‘s attack this season with INEOS lining up another improvement in that department in the form of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Slovenia international is set to complete a £74m move from RB Leipzig over the next day or two with the hope he will contribute more than the seven Premier League goals that Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee managed between themselves last term.",
      "The signing of Sesko is likely to spell the end of Hojlund’s time at Old Trafford with Man Utd boss Amorim looking to offload the Denmark international.",

      "READ: Carlos Baleba, not Benjamin Sesko, will make Man Utd a passable football team",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano brought an update on Hojlund’s future, he said on his YouTube channel: “Højlund is saying, obviously, that he wants to stay at Manchester United, he wants to fight for his place, but if Man United sign a top striker like Sesko, Højlund can still leave the club.",
      "“No one from Man United told Højlund, ‘you have to go, you have to leave,’ but obviously if a top striker like Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, for Højlund it could be time to go and leave the club.",
      "“Don’t forget the interest from Italy, especially from AC Milan, who are looking for a striker. At the moment, financially, it’s still considered too expensive; it’s not the only option, because Milan are also considering a move for Dusan Vlahovic.”",
      "And now Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio has claimed that Man Utd have ‘opened the door’ to Hojlund leaving ‘on loan with an option to buy’.",
      "Di Marzio adds: ‘As we told you in recent days, AC Milan are looking for a striker to bring to the Rossoneri, and have identified the former Atalanta player from Denmark as one of the potential additions to the squad.",
      "‘Important news has arrived from England today: United have agreed to a loan deal with an option for Højlund, and Milan—given the deal’s terms—are currently in pole position to bring him into the team. However, the player’s approval for his departure is still pending. ‘",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has highlighted the “only difference” between Hojlund and Sesko after highlighting concerns about the latter.",
      "Ferdinand said earlier this month: “The only difference is that Rasmus came in and had inexperience around him in terms of [Alejandro] Garnacho [on] one side and Amad [Diallo] [on] the other, for instance, most of the time.",
      "“If Sesko comes in, he’s got two players that have played Premier League, scored goals in the Premier League and backed up by Bruno [Fernandes], so I think it’s a different dynamic that he comes into.",
      "“But the uncertainty worries me a little bit. Can he adapt to this league?”",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent arrival means one Man Utd star is ‘resigned’ to the exit in a stunning ‘waste of investment’.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United have made a ‘significant offer’ for a leading transfer target, while a striker is ‘pushing to join’ the club.",
      "Man Utd are buying another Rasmus Hojlund this summer as Benjamin Sesko will “need to adapt” to the Premier League, according to Rene Meulensteen.",

      "",
      "19) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nThe Brazil winger is being linked with Liverpool too but no-one’s heart is really in it – yet. We get the sense that Arsenal and Liverpool would be happy to take him, and Real Madrid would be willing to sell, but finding common ground over a price might be tricky. And the player seems to want to stay. If anything happens around Rodrygo, it feels like a late one. Arsenal certainly need a winger and Liverpool want another attacker if Nunez leaves.",

      "",
      "18) 🔼 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nHaving missed out on Sesko, Newcastle have been linked to Jackson more than any other striker. The Blues’ asking price is £80-100m or £60m, depending on who you believe. According to Craig Hope, the Magpies striker shortlist is: Jackson, Rodrigo Muniz, Ollie Watkins, Jorgen Strand Larsen, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Lois Openda and Goncalo Ramos.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Bradley Barcola – PSG to Liverpool\nReports in France suggest Barcola is being considered as an alternative to Alexander Isak now that Darwin Nunez is on his way. But there are also suggestions that the Reds are not on the 23-year-old’s tail so we very much doubt this is a go-er. Nunez will be replaced, though.",
      "",
      "16) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Anyone\nIt was reported ages ago that an agreement had been reached with Juventus but nothing happened. Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens. This will almost certainly go the way we expected it to: a loan move, late in the window when United get desperate to shift Sancho’s salary. At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",

      "",
      "14) 🆕 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nOoh. Baleba would make United a very passable football team. It emerged on Wednesday evening that the Red Devils had reached out to Brighton via intermediaries to suss the midfielder’s situation. Word hadn’t reached Brighton chief-exec Paul Barber by that point but it seems that the Seagulls would want something like £100million including add-ons, while United would open at £70million. That’s a big gap to bridge, especially when United don’t do this well and they are dealing with Brighton as reluctant sellers. Baleba, though, is keen to hear what United have to offer and his signing would be a bigger statement of intent than Sesko.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nEverton want to give Grealish the get-out he needs from City but the Toffees will have to haggle hard over who pays the bulk of the winger’s wages since he currently earns well over double that of their highest earner. We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. And the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Andrea Berta will doubtless spend weeks haggling over the number of instalments and Arsenal could really do with selling to make room in the squad and on the books for Eze.",
      "",
      "11) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. Brentford want that to lose another of their top players and they can see the desperation dripping off Newcastle.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. But we doubt this is dead yet.",

      "8) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the one-time Arsenal target. Banking £20million for Broja will help.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",

      "6) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThe Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Talks are now ‘advancing’ between Chelsea and United…",

      "5) 🆕 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nAndoni Iraola is going to be very short at the back for his side’s Premier League opener against Liverpool. Zabarnyi is set to follow Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen out of Bournemouth this summer.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Mads Hermansen – Leicester to West Ham\nIt was going to be Big John Victor, but the “disgraceful” Hammers transfer team shifted to original number-one target Hermansen at the eleventh hour. Poor John. West Ham are reportedly closing in on the Leicester ‘keeper for £18m.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nA deal has been agreed with Al-Hilal to take Nunez to Saudi for £56million. PIF paying Liverpool big money – over the odds? –  so they can buy Alexander Isak is quite the situation. Given Nunez was so keen to remain in Europe, this one could have a twist yet.",

      "2) Evann Guessand – Nice to Aston Villa\nThe Villans have been linked quite a bit but an agreement with Nice came out of nowhere in the end. The Nice striker was in the Midlands on Wednesday for a medical will join for £30.5m, which could open the door for Watkins to depart.",

      "The Red Devils have faced competition from Newcastle United in the race to sign Sesko as they have been scouring the market for a striker to replace Liverpool target Alexander Isak.",
      "However, it emerged on Wednesday that Man Utd have an agreement with Sesko over personal terms, with the striker set to pen a deal until 20230.",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed: ‘Benjamin Šeško has reached total agreement with Manchester United on personal terms. Contract until June 2030.",

      "Since this was announced, Man Utd and RB Leipzig have been working on thrashing out an agreement over a fee and a deal was finalised on Thursday afternoon.",
      "Respected journalist David Ornstein has revealed to The Athletic that an ‘agreement in principle’ has been finalised between the two clubs, with the deal an initial €76.5m (£66.4m) plus €8.5m in add-ons, which equates to around £77.3m overall.",

The Old Trafford club then finalised the operation in a relatively smooth and fast manner. They managed to secure a lower guaranteed fee than Newcastle and will be happy if the contingency payments are achieved.’",
      "Romano subsequently confirmed that an agreement has been reached between all parties and revealed when Sesko will travel to complete his medical.",
      "He said on X: “BREAKING: Benjamin Šeško to Manchester United, here we go!",

      "United are favouring Sesko over Aston Villa star Ollie Watkins, though Ferdinand recently gave one reason for preferring his former club to sign the England international.",
      "Despite this, Ferdinand is expecting Sesko to thrive at Man Utd, even though he has two concerns relating to his inexperience and lack of time he will be given to settle in.",

      "READ: Sesko over Watkins? Man Utd take Hojlund, Zirkzee risk again over what’s really important",
      "“Listen, he’s a young guy, been at Leipzig, playing, scoring goals. Last season, he played 45 games and scored 21 goals, six assists, so the guy knows where the back of the net is. That’s almost one goal every two games.",
      "“Yes, it’s a different league, it’s the Bundesliga, but he does play international football as well, he scores in international football and he knows where the net is.",
      "“A lot of people are going to go and suggest, ‘Oh, has he got the experience?’, and I was one of those guys in that camp going, ‘Do you know what? Where is the player that can actually show the young, inexperienced strikers that we have at the club how to do things? In times of need, who do they look to?’",
      "“He’s going to have to step up and be that guy. Can he do it? Yes, he can do it, he’s got huge potential.",
      "“But one of the things, as we’ve seen in recent years, our strikers, when they come in the door here, you’re not afforded a lot of time, there ain’t a great amount of patience and you’ve got to hit the ground running.”",
      "Ferdinand has also broken down what will be different about Man Utd’s attack should Sesko join Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in moving to the Premier League giants.",
      "“What I would say is Manchester United scored 44 goals last season. They’ve now invested in three strikers at the top of the pitch that have between them 48 goals last season, so that’s four more than the whole Manchester United squad got last year so that’s a huge improvement in that sense,” Ferdinand added.",
      "“Two of those guys have played in the Premier League and scored goals here. Sesko, now, has to go and transform his form, his goals, his menacing play, at times, into the Premier League and that’s the big question.",
      "“What I would say is not only are the goals a step up, but I would say the mobility in the front areas now is something, as a defender, I’m looking at now and I’m thinking differently about Manchester United’s frontline.",
      "“I’m going to have a physical presence up there and I’m going to have a physical test from all three positions and I’ve got people that can run and move up there, they’re mobile. They’re the things I was asking for over the last couple of years up there so more of that.",

His subsequent falling out with Ruben Amorim, as well as being one of five players to tell the club he wants to leave, has made him available for a much lower fee.",

      "Manchester United have been looking to sell Garnacho all summer, and that desire will only increase with the expected arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Having beaten Newcastle to the punch, the Old Trafford club are reported to have tabled a bid worth up to £73.8m for the Slovenian striker.",

      "As Manchester United close in on their new striker, who may prove to be the answer to their goalscoring woes but has more than a whiff of the Rasmus Hojlunds about him, David Ornstein revealed on Wednesday night that ‘contact’ has been made over a signing which will raise genuine concern among rivals that Amorim may actually have a passable football team to work with next season.",
      "While there can be no one missing piece to a puzzle which remains strewn across the living room floor, with a corner or two thought to have been eaten by the dog and others sucked up by the hoover, Carlos Baleba can be the centre-piece to bring the still disparate Manchester United together and grant supporters at least an idea of what a final image might look like.",
      "We’ve already questioned United’s linear transfer strategy this summer – the logic in completing one signing before moving onto the next rather than multi-tasking, to the point where Sesko has missed pre-season and any other additions look unlikely to join before the start of the campaign – but also, why this order when the midfield problem was so glaringly apparent under Amorim last term, having predated him for well over a decade.",
      "Ander Herrera, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Fred, Donny van de Beek, Christian Eriksen and Casemiro have been signed for a not-so-small fortune, with not one single person convinced Manuel Ugarte is any sort of answer for United as the latest in that string of frankly terrible signings to occupy one of the positions in their laughably unstable midfield pivot. If only they had used the Harry Maguire money on Declan Rice.",
      "Amorim could have been describing almost any game last season as he reflected on their 0-0 draw with Leeds a couple of weeks ago.",
      "“The gaps between our sectors was sometimes too big. We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and bring the ball.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes operated in one of the deeper midfield roles in that game and again in the 4-1 win over Bournemouth last week, and Sesko’s imminent arrival will see the captain take up that position in the best United XI, or at least the XI featuring all of United’s best players, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo playing ahead of him and off Sesko.",
      "That’s currently unworkable role for him. We will have to endure/be treated to the same soft-centred Red Devils, laughably at risk of being counter-attacked upon so long as any of Casemiro, Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo are forced to do the donkey work they’e either incapable of or unsuited to in order to provide Fernandes with the license to remain United’s creator-in-chief in that position.",
      "Baleba has correctly been identified as one of very few players capable of granting him that freedom. The 20-year-old made 4.22 combined tackles and interceptions per 90 minutes in the Premier League last season, falling just short of Moises Caicedo (4.38), who made more in total than any midfielder other than Idrissa Gueye.",
      "United will no doubt be encouraged by Caicedo’s excellent second season for Chelsea, with the attraction of signing midfielders who have stood out for Brighton further enhanced by their continued excellence following moves to European giants, with Alexis Mac Allister a second outstanding exponent of the value in raiding the Amex following his key role in securing Liverpool their second Premier League title.",
      "United’s need for a dominant midfielder in no way makes their bid for a new striker unnecessary. No-one watching Hojlund toil last season will have any confidence in him being the No.9 who can score them 20+ goals per season.",
      "But we also think they could have muddled through without Sesko, using Cunha or Mbeumo as the central striker if need be, or just trusting they can provide enough of an uptick in creativity and quality in those inverted winger roles to bring either Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee along for the ride with them.",
      "Baleba arguably should have been their priority from the start of the transfer window, but absolutely should have been part of what will be a £200m spend from the destitute Manchester United by the time they get the Sesko deal is over the line.",
      "We’ve heard the sell-to-buy nonsense with regard to United throughout the transfer window and that’s the party line once again. ‘Unless the Old Trafford side are able to secure a raft of lucrative sales, it is improbable they can afford big-money recruits up front and in the number six role,’ says Ornstein.",
      "They will come close to their greatest-ever summer spend even without securing what we’ve been told all along were the necessary sales of members of the bomb squad, so we can’t be sure they don’t have an extra £90m lying around for Baleba.",
      "But if he is indeed beyond them as things stand, it’s not too late to pull out of a move for another young, unproven striker to join the two United have already – whom the manager isn’t convinced by anyway, very reasonably preferring the experience and surety of Ollie Watkins – in favour of a midfielder who Fabrizio Romano reports Amorim quite rightly sees as the “perfect” foil for Fernandes, with the “intensity” required to make United a serious football team this season.",
      "Man Utd will have to look elsewhere this summer after Brighton made it clear that Carlos Baleba is not for sale, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on the progress of Benjamin Sesko’s medical ahead of his move to Manchester United.",
      "Man City have joined rivals Man Utd in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Premier League side Brighton this summer, according to reports.",
      "Brighton want £104m for Manchester United target Carlos Baleba, who ‘is happy to stay at the Amex’ for another season, according to a report.",
      "According to reports, Benjamin Sesko and his team have made two sacrifices to force through a move to Premier League giants Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached an ‘agreement’ with RB Leipzig over a transfer fee for Benjamin Sesko, who is set for a medical."

      "Manchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million.",
      "As This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About, we have our doubts.",
      "The overriding argument for Watkins is pretty compelling in our eyes: guaranteed goals. That is something United have notoriously lacked in recent seasons. They re-signed Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021 and he provided that for a year under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. He scored 24 goals in 38 games after Edinson Cavani bagged 17 in 39 the season before.",
      "Since their successful — albeit short-term — goalscoring exploits, United changed their striker recruitment philosophy to guys for the future. And how has that gone so far? Well…",
      "Rasmus Hojlund for £68million has been nothing short of a disaster. He needed 15 games to score his first Premier League goal, which did lead to a purple patch before an injury halted his goalscoring streak. Three in his last nine top-flight games of the season at least hinted he could pick up where he left off in 2024/25.",
      "He absolutely did not. The 22-year-old Dane registered four goals and zero assists in the Premier League last season. Joshua Zirkzee was even signed to unload some of the centre-forward burden, which didn’t help.",
      "Zirkzee was another inexperienced forward with no Premier League experience brought in by the club last summer. And just like with Hojlund, it’s proving to be a poor investment. Both players are young and can easily improve — even potentially become world-class — but these two case studies should be enough proof for United that no matter how appealing the prospect of signing Sesko is, they should have resisted the urge and gone all in on Watkins.",
      "There is an argument for why that’s not the direction United should have taken — and we’ll get to that — but how Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his transfer team haven’t used the Hojlund and Zirkzee evidence to ensure they don’t make the same mistake is startling. Ronaldo and Cavani are important here as well. The former was signed when he was 36 and Cavani was 33. Yet they were reliable options in front of goal, something Hojlund and Zirkzee have failed to become.",
      "Ronaldo and Cavani are not the only strikers older than Watkins (29) signed by the Red Devils who thrived at Old Trafford. There’s also Zlatan Ibrahimovic — the club’s second-best post-Sir Alex Ferguson signing — Robin van Persie, and, a long time ago, Teddy Sheringham.",
      "The fact Watkins turns 30 in December means absolutely nothing in a footballing sense. Players keep themselves in the sort of shape these days that means he could still be flying for United six years from now. But, no. In classic United fashion, they’ve gone for the flashy new toy — whose upside is huge, we know — but who also has an incredible, potentially Hojlund-esque downside.",
      "MORE ON WATKINS AND SESKO ON F365\n👉 Man Utd, Aston Villa, bad maths and Ollie Watkins ‘better than nothing’\n👉 Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again\n👉 Man Utd, Liverpool embarrass Newcastle: Top 10 PIF transfer targets missed by miserable Magpies",
      "The main issue with Watkins appears to be his resale value. In that respect, the best-case scenario is that Watkins performs at a high level for a few years and Saudi Arabia come calling with a huge offer that the player wants to pursue. The worst-case scenario is that he’s pants from day one and United are stuck with another high-earning, underperforming, big-money flop. Having watched Watkins in the Premier League for the last five years, that is very unlikely. And yes, so unlikely that we are completely writing it off, which we haven’t done with the prospect of Sesko being another Hojlund (or only a little bit better).",
      "‘Resale value’ can be disregarded when the player pays you back on the pitch, and that’s what Watkins would do at Old Trafford. His worst Premier League goal return came in 2021/22, when he scored 11. That was also the only season Watkins missed more than one game across a top-flight campaign. He played 38 out of 38 last term!",
      "It’s a Manchester United decision that’s just…very Manchester United, but there is some logic to it.",
      "United’s transfer philosophy changes every summer, and the mood this year is to only sign players who really want to play for the club. Sesko fits the bill, while Watkins wasn’t aggressively pushing for the move. That’s the biggest factor for United, we think.",
      "And then there were the selling clubs. Everything we said about Watkins could be worth nothing if Aston Villa have zero intention to sell the player. RB Leipzig, on the other hand, have every intention to sell Sesko — but it was always going to happen on their terms.",
      "MORE: Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko: Which striker should Man Utd sign?",
      "Arsenal reportedly preferred Sesko to new signing Viktor Gyokeres but were put off by the German club’s whopping valuation of the 22-year-old Slovenian: 90 million euros.",
      "That’s around £78.5m, and it’s what Newcastle United offered Leipzig for the player. United, knowing he only wanted them, went a little under that — offering £74m. Reports suggest that offer has already been increased to match the Magpies’, such is the Red Devils’ desire to get Sesko through the door and ready for their Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "The fact Leipzig are open to negotiations, and most importantly, Sesko is desperate to join, holds more weight in the United boardroom than a guaranteed success in Watkins — even if that’s what Ruben Amorim’s side are desperately crying out for.",
      "And we might be blinded by Hojlund and Zirkzee’s performances. They don’t necessarily mean that every young attacker signed by United will turn out rubbish — even if nearly all of their major signings over the last 12 years have been just that. The trend has to break at some point. Sesko certainly has the potential and current ability to be the trend-breaker.",
      "Still, the overriding point from us remains: Who is more likely to get United back in the top five? Watkins, for me, Clive. And that’s the bottom line.",
      "READ NEXT: Top 10 wingers available this summer: Man Utd trio, Grealish, Arsenal targets Rodrygo, Williams…",

      "Man Utd have agreed a deal to sign RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko ahead of rivals Newcastle; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Thursday 7 August 2025 16:00, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest ended after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Manchester United are now close to signing the Slovenian forward, having beaten Newcastle to his signature.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who look set to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",

      "Monday 4 August 2025 14:44, UK",
      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",

      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
