      "Of the 17 players to have played for both Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League era, Zeki Fryers is among the more likely who would go down as a Pointless answer.",
      "But the left back was once part of a controversial transfer that left Sir Alex Ferguson fuming and calling for a Football Association investigation into what he claimed was “blatant manipulation.”",
      "Fryers had left United for Belgian club Standard Liege in August 2012 for a small compensation fee after Spurs refused to pay £6m. Except by the following January Spurs had paid Standard £3m for Fryers, who claimed he was feeling homesick.",
      "\"I'm disappointed in Tottenham. I think it's a blatant manipulation of the situation,\" Ferguson said not long after the transfer to north London went through. \"I think the league should look into it and I think they should stop his registration until they examine it.\"",
      "Tottenham claimed afterwards that they only made a second approach for Fryers after being made aware that he was not enjoying life in Belgium.",
      "A Spurs spokesman said at the time: \"Zeki enjoyed his time at Standard, however, when Standard sacked their manager in November Zeki wasn't part of the new manager's plans which he accepts and understands happens in football. Unfortunately, a combination of this and the fact he had become homesick meant he wanted to return to England.",
      "\"His representatives made contact with clubs in England. This afforded us a second opportunity to sign the player and as per Fifa's solidarity contribution mechanism, Manchester United will receive 5 per cent of the transfer fee we have paid.\"",
      "Standard Liege later issued a statement which read: \"The young defender felt homesick and had difficulty acclimating to life away from home and family. So when the London club became interested we understood the situation and were not opposed to the return of the player in England.\"",
      "But fuming Ferguson added: \"They tried to buy him from us at the end of last season. They then took him on trial and said they couldn't afford him and all of a sudden he signed for Standard Liege. I expected him to go to Tottenham in the January transfer window. The league should look into it.\"",
      "Fryers, who was most recently playing in the Swedish third tier, went on to make 16 appearances in 18 months at Spurs before moving to Palace, for whom he made 14 appearances."

      "Rasmus Hojlund believes he is finally starting to emerge from his Manchester United nightmare to prove he can be worth £72million. The 22-year-old Danish striker has never hidden behind excuses after scoring just 11 goals for Ruben Amorim’s struggling team this season.",
      "But the smile was back on Old Trafford faces after he got on the scoresheet as United booked a Europa League date with Tottenham with a 7-1 aggregate hammering of Athletic Bilbao. However, Hojlund still admits it's been a disappointing campaign for the Reds.",
      "He said: “We’re very happy about being in the final, but it can’t take away the focus from the entire season. Domestically it has not been good enough - but then again we play to win trophies and we are in a good position to win a European one.",
      "“I think we’ve been improving in the last few weeks, even though the results in the Premier League have not been overly good, just in Europe. But in the Premier League we are gradually getting there - although we know we need to get better.",
      "“Obviously there have been hard times for me. When you go without a goal for a lot of games - I wouldn’t say I lost self-belief, but you’re going to be a bit more down and a bit more frustrated.",
      "“It’s been about going back to basics and focusing on what I can do to try and improve myself. I will check myself, chat with my team-mates, get in better positions…these sorts of things.",
      "“It is the hard times that make you better and you learn a lot from them. I have always said I know what this football club is all about and it’s a lot of pressure, but that is why I’m here. I want to show myself on the biggest stage.",
      "“We are focusing on the opportunity we have here. That can give us something from this year to take into the next season - because winning a trophy is always important for a club this size.”",
      "United now face West Ham at Old Trafford as they attempt to improve their poor Premier League position in the last three games of the season. Amorim has been boosted by the return to action of Amad Diallo, the young winger who has been sidelined for three months with an ankle injury.",
      "Amad produced a stunning cameo performance against Bilbao on Thursday night - and Hojlund said: “Amad is wonderful. I obviously knew him a bit before I came here because we played at Atalanta. Not at the same time, but they talked of him. He’s a great talent, what a player.",
      "“He came through the Atalanta academy. He’s a very good lad, very humble and down to earth. That’s why he is where he is now.",
      "“Last season he didn’t really have a lot of game-time but now he has shown himself and he is so calm and focused on improving. We know his qualities and this season they have been shining through. Full credit to him.”"

      "Leverkusen are set for a summer of mass change. Tah's exit is imminent and Xabi Alonso has announced that he will depart following some stunning achievements with Real Madrid seen as his most likely destination. Attacking star Florian Wirtz is of interest to Manchester City."

That has alerted Bundesliga pair Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund.",

The Manchester club are holding a ballot where a small number of tickets will be available for their staff. They have chosen to host a screening for the majority of staff closer to home with the invite open to plus-ones.",

      "Amorim has maintained that United want to retain Fernandes and will not be allowing him to leave this summer. “I think it is easy to understand [his importance], not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,” he said.",
      "“He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he’s the captain, so he’s really important. It’s normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like [Alejandro] Garnacho, like others, but we want to keep the best players, and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn’t change. We want Bruno here.”"

      "Former Manchester United star Paul Scholes isn't a fan of Ruben Amorim's approach of playing a weakened side for Premier League matches while chasing European glory. Amorim made major changes to the starting XI for last week's defeat at Brentford, including leaving captain Bruno Fernandes on the bench, in order to keep players fresh to face Athletic Club on Thursday.",
      "United lost 4-3 at the Gtech and then fell behind early on in their Europa League semi-final second leg. They rebounded in style, though, scoring four times in the final 20 minutes to wrap up a 7-1 aggregate victory, but Scholes believes his old employers are taking a big risk.",
      "\"It’s almost as if they go into Premier League games and there’s an acceptance that they’re not going to win the game, which is madness. I think the acceptance has come from everyone.",
      "\"I think it’s come from the manager even though he won’t admit it. He’s not playing teams to win games of football in the league. I think even fans are thinking let’s get these league games out of the way because the league has been a disaster.\"",
      "United aren't the only ones who have attempted to shuffle the pack in the league while competing in Europe. It didn't quite work for Arsenal, who lost their Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, but Spurs' rotation at West Ham last week left them fresh to beat Bodo/Glimt and join Amorim's team in the Europa League final.",
      "Ahead of Sunday's match, Amorim was asked whether he would continue resting senior stars now that a spot in the final has been secured. \"No, they will play because sometimes it's better to play,\" he replied.",
      "\"What I will protect is the players that can get an injury. For example, Bruno, or the last game before Tottenham but we moved the game to the Friday against Chelsea. So we'll have time to recover.",
      "\"We want to win and to be competitive, also in the Premier League. Bruno doesn't have the problem of any injury [touches wood] but Harry [Maguire] has. So we have to manage that but they have to play and it is better to play than to stay out.\""

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane once admitted that he financially benefited from the Glazer family's takeover of the club. The American ownership has been a contentious issue among fans since they acquired the club 20 years ago.",
      "Writing in his 2014 autobiography, The Second Half, Keane revealed his smart idea to pocket shares in United as part of his contract, meaning he saw a small fortune head his way thanks to the family's acquisition of the Red Devils.",
      "\"From the players’ point of view, it didn’t bother us too much,\" Keane, 53, wrote. \"I had a few shares in the club as part of my contract. So the Glazers coming in was worth a few bob to me\".",
      "The Glazers are now approaching two decades at the helm of United, having acquired the club from Irish shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus for £790million on May 12, 2005. Initially holding a 57 per cent stake, they increased it to 75 per cent just days later.",
      "Despite the team's early successes under their ownership, including five Premier League titles, the 2008 Champions League, two FA Cups, six League Cups, the Europa League, and the FIFA World Club Cup, fans have expressed concerns about the Glazers draining the club's resources.",
      "Their tenure has been marred by fan protests and widespread dissatisfaction with their management of the club. And the situation reached a head in 2022.",
      "Their reign at the helm of United seemed on the brink in November of that year when they announced the club was up for sale. Keane hailed the move as \"good news\" at the time, criticising the family for prioritising business over their rapport with the supporters.",
      "However, the plot took a twist when Sir Jim Ratcliffe instead acquired a minority 25 per cent share, leaving the Americans in post but with Ratcliffe and his INEOS team taking control of football operations. However, United's financial woes have persisted, with debts mounting and job cuts becoming a regularity under Ratcliffe's time in charge.",
      "While Keane may have profited from the initial sale, he has since been vocal about his disapproval of United's current management. In October 2024, he lamented the transformation of the club on the Stick to Football podcast.",

      "\"They're chopping and changing and getting rid of everyone in the background which is fine, there's a business side to it, we know that. But when we're discussing Man United, it's more like a business than a football club\"."

      "The 26-year-old is in his second season in Portugal after arriving from Coventry City. He fired Sporting to the Primeira Liga title last term, with the team currently sitting top again this year with two games to play.",
      "While he has another three years to run on his contract at the Estádio José Alvalade, it is increasingly unlikely he will remain in Lisbon for next season. The Gunners and United are both among the favourites to sign the Swedish international.",
      "Both of the Premier League sides are desperate for reinforcements in attack after disappointing seasons. But they face intense competition from many of Europe's other top teams.",
      "One of them is Atletico Madrid, who are keen to restore themselves back to the top of Spanish football. Atletico last won La Liga in 2021 and have selected Gyokeres as a potential target for the summer, with a major advantage now emerging for Diego Simeone.",
      "According to Mundo Deportivo, Atletico have made a formal enquiry about a move. The Spanish side are said to view their chances of signing him as being slim, though kit suppliers Nike could step in to secure a deal.",
      "The American company recently inked a long-term contract renewal with Atletico. They are said to see Gyokeres as 'one of the sensations of the moment' and are keen for him to join one of the clubs they sponsor.",
      "It is claimed that to avoid him wearing another clothing brand, they would even be willing to contribute towards Gyokeres' signing. Nike fear a similar situation to when Cristiano Ronaldo was sponsored by them but played for Real Madrid, whose kits are supplied by Adidas.",
      "Arsenal's deal with Adidas runs until 2030, while United's agreement with the German giant has another 10 years to run. It appears increasingly likely that an almighty battle will be fought for Gyokeres this summer, with Sporting boss Rui Borges recently dropping a clear hint he will be on the move.",

      "\"Fortunately, we have him at Sporting. We must make the most of the time we have with him because he is truly exceptional. I have said this before, and I will continue to say it: he brings a lot to the team, and his teammates are aware of what he contributes, which is why they look for him during games.",
      "\"The collective effort also plays a role, as no one can succeed alone. Viktor is a game-changer, and he will continue to be, whether with us or elsewhere. His quality is undeniable; it is phenomenal.",
      "\"He is the best in the league, clearly. There are no adjectives to describe Viktor. He is an extraordinary striker, very important to our team, he has helped the team to grow with confidence, quality of play, he passes it on to his team-mates.\""

      "A move for Antony will prove 'very, very complicated' according to Real Betis chief Angel Haro. The club's president is already planning a meeting with Manchester United to extend the Brazilian's stay with the La Liga club but Haro is refusing to get ahead of himself.",
      "Antony has hit the ground running since arriving in the south of Spain on loan from United and proven a key player in Betis' side. Already the 25-year-old has scored eight goals and added five assists in 21 games for Betis, having scored just 12 times in his entire United spell since his blockbuster move.",
      "The ex-Ajax star looks set to depart Old Trafford once his loan ends having failed to break into Ruben Amorim's plans this season. While Betis appear a strong, early contender, United are likely to prefer a permanent deal where they can bring in a fee for the star.",
      "And Betis president Haro is well aware the task of securing the player's signature will not come easily, despite his apparent willingess to contnue at the club. The first task remains to prove persuading to the Red Devils.",
      "\"Keeping Antony as our own is very, very complicated,\" he said. \"We'll have a meeting with Manchester United to extend the loan for another year, to be able to share a percentage of the player.",
      "\"It's about seeing the willingness of the player and Manchester United. The first filter is set by Manchester, and then the negotiation of the player would come, but that’s a long way off.",
      "\"Besides, the player is now fully engaged, wanting to win a title with Betis. When the time comes and the season ends, he'll be able to do his part if this option opens up.\"",
      "Antony scored to help Real Betis reach the Europa Conference League final and is already on his way to making a mark in the team's history. The United flop has already attempted to explain why he has settled so well.",
      "“Yes, I'm very happy,\" he said. \"I found myself. I needed to find myself and be happy.",

      "“It's important to score goals and provide assists but for me what's most important is sleeping peacefully knowing how I'm doing with myself and being well and happy. Seeing my family smiling is also essential for me; I always talk to my family in Brazil and they are also very happy for me.”"

      "It has been easy to pick apart Manchester United's recruitment mistakes in recent years, but occasionally, they get things right. As Ruben Amorim plots his Old Trafford rebuild, he has at least a couple of players who can signpost a brighter future.",
      "Despite their success in the Europa League this season, United's route back to the top is not easy. Their base camp is 15th after a desperate domestic season. Yet there are signs of promise and hope for years to come.",
      "Academy graduates Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho offer that. The pair of 20-year-olds have had mixed success under Amorim so far and might see their futures in the spotlight again this summer, but they have the talent to be part of the team, even if both are adapting to new roles in a system they are not accustomed to.",
      "It would be a shame and quite probably a mistake if United opted to cash in on either player. They are two sellable assets at a time when they need to raise funds, and they would be booked as pure profit under PSR rules. Both might not be in Amorim's strongest XI at the start of next season, but they should have roles to play in the future.",
      "Two young players whose immediate futures are absolutely guaranteed are Amad, 22, and Leny Yoro, 19. United paid fees for both as teenagers, but the combined outlay of £96million is beginning to look like a steal as they continue their trajectories.",
      "The path was bumpy for Amad after his £37million move from Atalanta, and there have been times when the initial £19million fee, with a further £18million in add-ons, looked like a waste. But the attacker never gave up. A successful loan spell at Sunderland unlocked his potential, and his rise in the last 12 months has been stratospheric.",
      "He might have been battling Bruno Fernandes for player of the year awards without his recent three-month layoff, but coming on as a second-half substitute against Athletic Bilbao, he showed that the injury hasn't slowed him down. He turned the game with his directness and dribbling ability and must start the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The image of Amad, on his own and surrounded by four defenders in blue shirts, was reminiscent of the famous picture of Diego Maradona in an Argentina shirt facing up to six Belgian defenders.",
      "That's not to compare them as talents, but Amad's work on the ball has the capacity to attract defenders towards him, which can be priceless in opening up space for others.",
      "The question at the moment is whether the Ivorian ends up as a wing-back or as a No. 10 in Amorim's system. In the short term he might be pressed into action on the right, but it has looked recently like Amorim wants him as one of his attacking midfielders, and you can see why that would be the case. He should be a fixture in this team for years to come.",
      "That can be said for Yoro as well, an initial £52million signing from Lille last summer. United beat Real Madrid to his signature, but he suffered a foot injury in his second pre-season game and wasn't fit to start until December, by which time the manager who signed him had gone, and he was being asked to play in a back three system that was unfamiliar to him.",
      "He is now starting to show why many observers consider him the best young centre-back in Europe, and those comparisons with Rio Ferdinand don't look so fanciful. His defending is assured but with obvious room for improvement given his tender age in that position, but his grace in position is particularly eye-catching.",
      "Yoro is starting to show more confidence in carrying the ball forward, which is a vital skill in a wide centre-back role in a back three. He is becoming more of a fixture in the final third.",
      "He set Mason Mount's first goal up against Athletic, and that unpredictability can be a major weapon in United's system.",
      "There are certainly areas where this squad can be improved, and there are plenty of examples of where money has been wasted. But in Amad and Yoro, United have two players who look like generational talents and two players who can form a major part of a successful team under Amorim."

      "Speaking to the media ahead of the quarter-final tie against Lyon, Ruben Amorim confirmed: \"He is out for the season. He will not play again this season, let's prepare him for the next one.",
      "\"It is tough, he was improving in every aspect of the game. It is tough for any player but he has to be ready to recover.\"",
      "Despite this admission from his manager, Zirkzee appeared to tell his friend and Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies on his Twitch stream that there is a chance he could return to take on Spurs. When asked about his recovery and told to rest up, the Dutchman appeared to tell Davies that it would be 'difficult but not impossible' to return in Bilbao.",
      "Davies and Zirkzee became friends during their time together at Bayern Munich. The pair played together on 16 occasions before a couple of loan spells at Parma and Anderlecht convinced the forward to join Bologna permanently in 2022.",
      "It has been a difficult first season for Zirkzee in the Premier League. However, after reaching his lowest spot at Old Trafford when he was jeered off the pitch having been substituted against Newcastle in the first-half, the forward managed to regroup in a different role.",
      "Amorim began using Zirkzee in the No.10 position where he had more of an impact on the game. While his optimism to return for the Europa League final is admired, it is unlikely that he would start even if he was fit enough to make the squad considering the slow approach United have used towards Amad's return."

      "But regardless of their success in the final against Tottenham in Bilbao later this month, United must bring in players that suit Amorim's way of playing as they continue their rebuild under the former Sporting CP manager.",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport have decided to play the role of United's recruitment department and take a look at potential transfer decisions facing the hierarchy.",
      "Cunha has a release clause of £62.5million and has scored 17 goals for Wolves in all competitions this season. The Brazil international, 25, is open to a move to United but there is set to be competition over his signature.",
      "Meanwhile, Delap has a £30million release clause after Ipswich's relegation was confirmed and the 22-year-old is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs after scoring 12 goals in a struggling side.",
      "If United can land both players early in the window, it will be a major foundation to build the rest of their transfer business on.",
      "Failing that, it is no secret that Amorim is a huge fan of Sporting CP forward Viktor Gyokeres having helped the Swedish international develop into one of the most prolific goalscorers in Europe.",
      "Amorim signed Gyokeres from Championship side Coventry City in 2023 and the 26-year-old scored 43 goals under his management last season. Gyokeres has kicked on again this term and already has 52 goals across all competitions.",
      "He won't come cheap - at least £85million may be needed to prise him from Lisbon - but he almost guarantees goals and is already familiar with how Amorim operates.",
      "The challenge will be convincing Gyokeres his future is best served at United rather than the likes of Arsenal who have also been linked with the former Brighton youngster.",
      "United's goalkeeping situation is one to watch this summer.",
      "Andre Onana hasn't fully convinced since his £47million move from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023 while Turkish international Altay Bayindir may not be satisfied with a third season as second choice in a World Cup year.",
      "One affordable option that has been mooted is Serbian international goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic. The Torino shot-stopper has been one of the most consistent goalkeepers in Serie A and has unfinished business at Old Trafford having signed for United as a teenager.",

      "Similarly, Casemiro may have enjoyed a renaissance in recent months but at 33 and reported interest from the Saudi Pro League, it may be the right time to cash in on the Brazil international.",

      "The summer transfer window may not open until next month but Manchester United's early intentions have been clear for a few weeks now.",
      "The probable £92.5m cost of Cunha and Delap would be offset by the planned sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, all of whom are currently away from Old Trafford on loan.",
      "Cunha, who has 17 goals and six assists to his name this season, is set to be a man in demand this summer having impressed for Wolves for a number of seasons now. His representatives have welcomed United's interest and the Brazilian international is said to be keen to join the club.",

      "If United fail to win they won't be in Europe next season and they will lose the added riches being in the Champions League will bring.",
      "And while United's status of being one of the biggest clubs and having one of the richest histories in world football remains a huge pull for players, not being in the Champions League could be a big problem when it comes to recruiting players of Cunha's ability - particularly if there is interest elsewhere.",
      "Certainly, that is the view held by Wolves legend Don Goodman.",

      "If United have a clear run at signing Cunha then it shouldn't become an issue. However, if the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle reignite their previous interest in the 25-year-old, and can offer him Champions League football, it will make life difficult for United if they fail to beat Spurs in Bilbao.",
      "Not only in the case of Cunha, but Delap has many suitors because of his relatively cheap £30m price tag. And it will apply to whoever else United target in the summer, too.",

      "By the time Rasmus Hojlund joined Atalanta, Amad had been gone for 18 months. The teenager played just 64 minutes of professional football before being snapped up by Manchester United in a deal worth up to £37million, but in Bergamo, they hadn't forgotten what they had seen.",
      "When Hojlund made the same journey in August 2023, joining United from Atalanta in a move worth up to £72million, he was excited to see the player he had heard so much about in action, but whose trajectory had stalled a little at Old Trafford. While Hojlund was making a big enough impression at Atalanta to catch the eye of United, Amad was getting back into form with an impressive loan spell at Sunderland.",
      "His first start for United last season came only a year ago on Monday, but the last 12 months have seen him make a breathtaking breakthrough, from fringe first-teamer whose days looked to be numbered, to probably the most dynamic and exciting attacking talent in the squad.",
      "There have been 20 goal contributions in 43 games during the last 12 months, despite spending three months on the sidelines with a recent ankle injury, and he has made an instant impact on his return to the side, turning Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg on its head when he came off the bench.",
      "He set up the third goal for Hojlund in the 4-1 win that secured a 7-1 aggregate success against Athletic Club. The Dane pointed to Amad in front of the Stretord End, and when he was asked about him after the match, his face lit up as he explained how people had Atalanta had still talked about his talent.",
      "\"He’s wonderful. I obviously knew him a bit before I came here because we played in the same club. Not at the same time, but they talked of him. They spoke of him very highly. He’s a great talent, what a player,\" he said.",
      "\"And he’s not only focusing on himself but also trying to find the right solution for the team. It’s great to have him back.\"",
      "Amad's megawatt smile and his infectious enthusiasm have helped to lift the mood of this squad, and Hojlund's affection for a player the same age as him was clear.",
      "The Ivorian has become an entertaining presence on social media and snapped a selfie as the players celebrated Hojlund's goal on Thursday night.",
      "\"He’s a very good lad, very humble and down to earth. That’s why he is where he is now,\" said Hojlund.",

      "Both Amad and Hojlund have had their difficult moments at United. Amad has suffered injuries that held him back and went through a disappointing loan spell at Rangers, while Hojlund has endured a lengthy goal drought in recent months.",
      "But the goals are starting to flow again for the Dane, and he believes those dark days will only serve him well going forward.",
      "\"Absolutely right, it is the hard times that make you better and you learn a lot from them,\" he said. “I have always said I know what this football club is all about and it’s a lot of pressure, but that is why I’m here. I want to show myself on the biggest stage.",
      "\"Obviously, there have been hard times. When you go without a goal for a lot of games, I wouldn’t say I lost self-belief, but you’re going to be a bit more down and a bit more frustrated.",

      "Manchester United will be going in search of a first Premier League home win since February when they welcome West Ham United to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Despite progressing to the Europa League final in midweek with a 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of their semi-final showdown, United's Premier League form has been nothing short of dire in the last few months, winning just two of their last 12 league outings.",
      "Heading into the clash with Hammers winless in their last six league games, the Reds will be determined get three points on the board and increase their confidence levels ahead of the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in just over a week's time.",
      "Regarding the team news, head coach Ruben Amorim is expected to rotate his pack for the second league game running, meaning multiple changes are likely.",
      "Below, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see United line up this afternoon:",
      "Amorim isn't going to make wholesale changes to his United side over the next few games but this feels like the ideal opportunity to give some players a rest and get minutes into others, starting in goal, where Tom Heaton deserves a game as he gets closer to signing a one-year contract extension.",
      "In defence, Shaw and Fredricson can come back in. Shaw needs the minutes as he builds up fitness and although Fredricson struggled in the second half last week, this should be easier. Maguire can play the experienced role in the middle.",
      "Amass can get another game at left wing-back and Amad needs a start on the right as he builds up to starting the Europa League final. Ugarte and Mainoo are the midfield pairing.",
      "Mount has to start again after his efforts this week, with Eriksen alongside him, and Obi can come back into the side as Hojlund gets a rest.",
      "Despite having no midweek game to consider this coming week, Amorim should still use the visit of the Hammers to shuffle his pack and increase the fitness levels of players still working their way towards full-match sharpness.",
      "Shaw has rotated between starter and sub in recent games, meaning he should be recalled and start on the left of the back-three. Mazraoui has been pushed to his limit in recent weeks, meaning Kamason deserves the nod at right wing-back to make his debut.",
      "Casemiro and Ugarte are a sure bet to start alongside each other in midfield in the Europa League final, meaning they should not be risked less than 72 hours after their last outing.",
      "Obi, despite struggling to make his mark at Brentford last week, will only improve by playing, meaning he deserves a second start. Amad and Mount deserve starts after their impacts off the bench on Thursday night."

      "United will go into the clash with the Hammers riding the crest of a wave after booking their place in the Europa League final on Thursday night with a 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Goals from Mason Mount (2), Rasmus Hojlund and Casemiro sealed a 7-1 aggregate triumph.",
      "But before head coach Ruben Amorim can give the final and Tottenham Hotspur his full attention, he must first navigate his and his side's way through Premier League clashes with West Ham and Chelsea.",
      "Ahead of this afternoon's tussle with the Hammers, here are five things to look out for:",
      "If last weekend's 4-3 defeat to Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium is anything to go by, United's supporters should anticipate a flurry of changes at Old Trafford this afternoon.",
      "Amorim made eight changes for the clash with the Bees from the 3-0 win over Athletic in the Basque Country less than 72 hours before, with only Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Alejandro Garnacho retaining their places.",
      "The chances are Amorim will make a crop of alterations to the side that started the second leg of the semi-final triumph, meaning the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Amass, Kobbie Mainoo, Christian Eriksen, Mount and Amad will all be targeting starting berths.",
      "Youngsters Jaydan Kamason, who is still waiting to make his senior debut, and Chido Obi will also be vying for starting berths in what will be another Premier League game with very, very little riding on it. Obi made his full league debut last weekend.",
      "Although United's Europa League form has given their supporters plenty to celebrate in the last few weeks, their Premier League form has done anything but. The Reds head into today's game winless in six in the league, losing four.",
      "Of course, strong arguments will be put forward for United's league campaign long since petering out and full focus being applied to their Europa League campaign instead, but the players will still have the ambition of winning and sending their supporters home happy.",
      "Without a win in the league since the March international break, United are in danger of going seven league games without a win for the first time since the inaugural Premier League season in 1992/93.",
      "That seven-game winless run saw United draw five and lose two between September and November. They drew the first five games of that sequence before being beaten by Wimbledon and Aston Villa, both by a 1-0 scoreline.",
      "They eventually got back on track with a 3-0 home win over Charlton Athletic.",
      "With changes guaranteed, all eyes will go in search of Amad's name when the teamsheet drops 75 minutes before kick-off. The Ivorian changed the game after coming off the bench against Athletic in midweek and his performance was a reminder of how big a role he can play in United's future under Amorim.",
      "The former Sunderland loanee's cameo appearance against the Spanish side was his third outing in a row via the bench since recovering from a recent ankle injury, meaning the next challenge for him is to bag a start.",
      "One of United's stars of the season, he must start the Europa League final, meaning it is important he builds up his match sharpness ahead of the trip to Spain in just over a week's time.",
      "With no midweek fixture to think about this coming week, Amorim will be tempted to unleash Amad from the off. However, it will be interesting to see if he starts at wing-back or as the right-sided No.10.",
      "Despite highlighting the gulf between academy football and the first-team stage at Brentford last weekend, Chido Obi is worthy of his second start and his first at Old Trafford.",
      "He was tasked with leading the line last Sunday, replacing Hojlund, but he struggled to impose himself on proceedings in the way he would have liked.",
      "However, at the tender age of 17, the only way the Dane is going to adapt to life at the highest level is by playing. Facing a West Ham side that have massively underperformed this season, Obi will fancy his chances of trying to flex his muscles a little more than he did last weekend.",
      "With next to nothing riding on this game, what is the worst that can happen?",
      "For the first time since leaving United last August, Aaron Wan-Bissaka will return to Old Trafford this afternoon. He joined West Ham almost a year ago in a deal worth £15million, signing a seven-year contract.",
      "United always planned to sell Wan-Bissaka last summer in order to recoup a fee for the right-back. His exit also paved the way for Noussair Mazraoui to arrive from Bayern Munich.",
      "Wan-Bissaka, who made 190 appearances during his time at United, has played 35 times for the Hammers this season, chipping in with two goals and three assists.",
      "Producing an unexpected resurrection in the second half of the 2022/23 season under former United boss Erik ten Hag, the London-born defender should receive a warm reception from the home fans."

      "If United are triumphant in Bilbao, their transfer plans could change for the better with the Champions League seen as more enticing for potential targets. So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a closer look at two reports which could drastically affect United's summer plans.",
      "According to the Daily Express, soon-to-be free agent Jonathan Tah is a top target for both United and Bayern Munich this summer. The 29-year-old centre-back has made a whopping 400 appearances for Bayer Leverkusen during his career but announced recently that he would be leaving them at the expiration of his contract.",
      "The Express understands that United have already undertaken initial talks with the defender's agent Pini Zahavi over a move to Old Trafford. It is believed that Tah has a desire to play in the Premier League despite admiring Bayern.",
      "What MEN Sport says: United can't sign players who are all teenagers or in their early 20s - there needs to be a balance. That does not mean spending big sums of money on players who are clearly experienced and have little resale value. The free agent market is perfect to pick up some gems to bolster this team and Tah would be one of them. His record at Leverkusen speaks for itself and his arrival would add quality to a defence which is not miles away from being complete - they have only conceded two more goals than sixth-placed Aston Villa. Tah would be an excellent addition and allow Ruben Amorim another option to rotate into this team if European football is on the agenda.",
      "According to The Sun, Ruben Amorim has U-turned on the decision to sell Casemiro at the end of the season. They claim that Amorim has been working closely with the midfielder and now sees him as being key to the United rebuild.",
      "Casemiro has reportedly attracted interest from the Saudi Pro League's Al Nassr and the MLS ahead of the summer transfer window. He is also United's biggest earner on a reported £350,000 per week.",
      "What MEN Sport says: There is no doubting that Casemiro has pulled his weight for United in the Europa League this season. However, in an ideal world, would he be your starter in all competitions next season? Probably not. Would he be a good player to have in the squad for his experience? Absolutely. But paying £350,000 per week for that is well over market value. It remains to be seen if a Middle Eastern or American club could pay a sum United would be happy to sell for but at this stage, freeing up his wage could be just as beneficial."

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has decided not to provide free Europa League final tickets to Manchester United staff members, continuing his stringent cost-cutting measures.",
      "The Reds will compete in the grand event in Bilbao, but unlike Tottenham, they won't be offering their employees complimentary tickets. United will face the north London team in an all-Premier League match-up and have been allocated approximately 15,000 tickets for the May 21 showdown.",
      "The Manchester club is conducting a draw where a limited number of tickets will be available for their staff. Instead, most employees are invited, along with a guest, to a local screening of the match.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Ratcliffe's thrifty approach means that staff members will receive two free drinks, while their guests will need to purchase their own. In contrast, Tottenham has opted to provide every full-time employee with a free ticket to the Bilbao match, potentially benefiting up to 700 individuals.",
      "There is a feeling within Old Trafford that the club is prioritising fans over staff, as tickets are highly sought after. This is the Reds' first European final since 2021 when they were defeated in the Europa League final.",
      "At that time, they had only 2,000 tickets as the world was beginning to recover from Covid lockdowns.",
      "In the past, when United had larger allocations, they covered the costs of flights, accommodation, and meals for staff attending the last three Champions League finals in which the club participated.",
      "For the 2017 Europa League final, the club received a mere 10,000 tickets. Consequently, they organised an event in Manchester where drinks would be complimentary, with entertainment provided by former Take That member Gary Barlow.",
      "However, this event was cancelled following the Manchester Arena terror attack. Since Ratcliffe and Ineos took over in Manchester, two rounds of redundancies have been implemented as the billionaire aims to reduce expenses and channel more revenue towards the team.",
      "Staff have seen several perks removed, including the cancellation of the Christmas party. Ratcliffe's approach starkly contrasts with that of PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, who is funding the travel of 600 staff members from the Parisian club to the Champions League final.",
      "All club employees will have the opportunity to attend the Champions League final against Inter Milan on May 31, as the French side attempts to secure their first European victory.",
      "Both teams have been allocated approximately 19,000 tickets for the match, and it has also been reported that Inter Milan are offering free tickets to their staff for the showdown at the Allianz Arena in Munich.",

President Steve Bellis has more County years under his belt than most and believes this is the most exciting era of the club’s, and town's, history.",

      "The 19-year-old spent two years in Italy with Bologna earlier in his career and is now preparing for the biggest games of his life and dreaming of a potential Wembley final and promotion.",
      "It would also be big for a town that has undergone a transformation in recent years and is in the midst of a £1billion regeneration. Stockport has featured among the best places to live in the country, it's seen a cultural revival with a popular market and clutch of independent business in the old town. There's a new transport interchange that has spawned Viaduct Park and new homes. The band Blossoms, who hail from the town and are named after a town pub, have also helped with their cool image raising Stockport's profile.",
      "The town and football club - lodged in the doldrums of National League North as recently as 2015 following financial issues - have risen together almost hand in hand. That's not lost on County president Bellis who has been involved at the club for more than three decades.",
      "\"I've never been as excited about the future for the club as I am now, I can only see more success,\" he told the MEN. \"Much of the credit has to go the owner for the investment and belief but it is not just about money, it is about doing things the right way and we have retained our DNA. We don't want to lose touch with who we are which is a community focussed football.",
      "\"It is not just great for the club but is great for the town. Both the town and the club are doing great together. The regeneration of Stockport, the old town, the little Berlin comparisons, the market place, even walking out of the station now it looks like a place you want to come to. Stockport is definitely on the up and the club is on the up at the same time.\"",
      "The next rung to climb for the club is promotion into the Championship, a division those behind the scenes at Edgeley Park feel is the rightful home and one that offers the dream of the Premier League and the riches that come with it.",
      "\"With the owner and the manager we have got we can really aim high,\" adds Bellis. \"We are in a situation when if we get into the Championship we can sustain and maintain ourselves.",
      "\"We have the infrastructure, we have the size of the town and the dream is we have a golden season and get into the Premier League. That has to be dream but the aim is the Championship.\"",
      "It's the aim for the squad as well. For Andresson it would cap a remarkable story from growing up just outside RRRR in a footballing family and getting within one promotion of the Premier League just four months after arriving at Stockport.",
      "\"Promotion would be amazing,\" he added. \"It would mean so much. Football is so big in Iceland and if you make it abroad then everyone knows you.\"",

One year on from majority shareholder Peter Lim departing, the quartet have been bought out by Neville, Beckham and several global investors.",

That image has since become a viral moment and our Chief Business of Football Writer Dave Powell believes it could be worth up to £308m for the Merseyside club.",

      "However, if it was a stunt planned by United, it has already missed its moment to have a huge financial impact like Liverpool's.",
      "Without going too GCSE Media into the topic, the joy of social media for brands is the ability to share a moment in real time that can ultimately be used to push, in this instance United's, appeal.",
      "If it was planned, there is very little reason to do it so soon after Salah's version. While there is no law against copying a celebration's format, it did come across as a cheap alternative rather than a brilliant moment.",
      "But even if you feel it was right to recreate it on Thursday night, the end product has been a let down. If you go on X at the time of writing, fans are asking the club to publish the footage from the celebration.",
      "As mentioned, this could be impossible if it was a United fan's phone but if they are choosing to withhold the footage for another time, it shows how out of touch this club still is. Ultimately, these matters are not the be all and end all.",
      "But, in an era where United feels like a club that is struggling to fit into the 21st century - this feels like yet more evidence to show that actually, their finger is not on the pulse of what works. And when United need all the money they can get, it is even more disappointing."

      "The Brazilian scored United's second on the night as Ruben Amorim's men cruised to the final of the Europa League with a 4-1 victory, 7-1 on aggregate, success over Athletic Bilbao. Casemiro has undergone a redemption arc this season and while struggles in the Premier League are still prevalent, but admittedly less frequent than last season, it is European football where the midfielder has truly shined.",
      "Casemiro bagged two important goals in both legs of the semi-final and has looked more comfortable under Amorim's coaching. This has led to questions as to whether or not he is playing his way into a contract extension.",
      "His current deal at Old Trafford is due to expire in 2026 and he is believed to be the highest earner at the club on £350,000 per week, according to Capology. There have also been reports that the midfielder's wage could rise to a whopping £500,000 per week next season if United are in the Champions League.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously spoken about failing to understand the logic of signing Casemiro considering his age and lack of re-sale value. But, according to Brazilian publication Trivela, a new contract for the midfielder is not being ruled out.",
      "United have the option to extend the Brazilian's stay at Old Trafford until 2027 if they wish and it is claimed that Casemiro is 'waiting for a signal' from the Reds, either way, that this will be activated. Should United wish to let Casemiro leave, they will be hoping to sell him in the summer to recoup some money.",
      "A move to Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr has been heavily touted recently with Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly determined to reunite with his former Real Madrid teammate in the Pro League. However, it is unclear if Al Nassr are willing to pay a transfer fee that United would find acceptable.",
      "United have sought potential bidders for Casemiro over the past 12 months and they would require £15million to sell him and avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United coach Ruben Amorim recently admitted that the Brazilian had changed his mind following his recent good form.",
      "\"I think he has improved a lot also,\" Amorim said. \"You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "\"He is a very good example. Even Toby (Collyer) sometimes was playing in front of him and now it is hard to take Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United. No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment.",
      "\"Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.\""

In December 2023, reports emerged that Potter and Ratcliffe had met secretly to discuss the possibility of becoming his first head coach appointment.",

      "Whether the former Chelsea manager was realistically considered for the United job this season is unclear, but in his pre-match press conference Potter did offer up some insight as to why he may have rejected the role if he was considered. \"We have no idea how Manchester United will approach the game,\" he explained to reporters.",

      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",
      "Sheffield United received £109.7m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",

Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",
      "Rashford has been heavily linked with a potential move to Barcelona over the past couple of years.",
      "Ahead of this season’s winter transfer window, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd and it was widely reported that Barcelona were his preferred destination.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants did not go through as his poor form for Man Utd and huge salary proved huge stumbling blocks.",
      "Instead, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m and his form has picked up in recent months. He has four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Unai Emery’s side.",
      "READ: Where next for Marcus Rashford? Villa or ‘dream’ scenario threatened by lack of cash?",
      "Rashford’s improved form is likely to attract interest from further afield and a recent report claimed he remains keen on a move to Barcelona, with the forward willing to take a significant pay cut and a ‘strategic step’ to force through a move to the Spanish giants.",
      "Romano has provided an update on Rashford situation and in a boost for the England international, Barcelona are in favour of a move.",
      "The transfer expert claims two factors boost Rashford’s chances of joining Barcelona as he is “under consideration” ahead of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "“Internally at Barcelona, they still believe that Marcus Rashford could be an option for the summer transfer window,” Romano said on his  YouTube channel.",
      "“They believe at Barcelona that Rashford might be available on the market. They believe at Barcelona that Rashford could be a good solution because he can play as a No 9 and play on the wing, so he can help in several positions.",
      "“He’s a player appreciated by those at Barcelona. They already wanted Rashford in January, it didn’t happen because Ansu Fati didn’t leave and so in terms of FFP it was not possible to balance the deal.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford remains in the list of Barcelona and so if Rashford is not staying at Aston Villa we will see what happens. He’s one of the options under consideration at Barcelona.",
      "“Then it will depend on FFP, on deal conditions, on more clubs being keen on the player and on what he decides to do.",
      "“We will see on Rashford’s side, but on club side one of the names being mentioned internally at Barcelona is for sure Marcus Rashford.”",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side."

      "“Nobody can deny that Gyokeres hasn’t been one of the hottest strikers in Europe for two seasons now, but he’s been doing it in Portugal. The argument would be that he has scored goals in the Champions League, but there are still doubts about his pedigree in the Premier League.",
      "“Isak, at Newcastle, he was not good at the beginning. He was a good player, but he didn’t have that performance level that he has right now. You need to know if you can give your players time to adapt.",
      "“But sometimes you can’t wait, you need a striker who can score right away. That would be my concern about Gyokeres. I would go for Isak, because he is already proven in the Premier League. He’s already posing problems and already knows how to deal with the opponents.”",

It’s one thing getting your chance and blowing it (Antony of 2024 I’m looking at you), but Mount hasn’t really had a shot at all. By all accounts that is through no shortage of hard work on his part.",

The jury is still out for me in terms of what exactly he does, but it’s great to see him thrive now with the platform to show it.

This is where a fair number of teams reside, if you draw them in Europe its an ‘ah that’s’ nice sort of fixture rather than the excitement of drawing one of the above. I reckon this is where Arsenal sit, they have more money than their counterparts in other leagues but a decent Scandinavian outfit will fancy beating them every so often.",

Tottenham may have a shiny stadium and Brentford may be well run but they just don’t cut it. Celtic probably reside here, not enough European success to be in the third tier.",

Then, and only then, he angrily hoofs the ball away, I suppose, because the ref had the temerity to blow up after Trossard so skillfully smashed another player over right in front of him.

If PSG fails to renew its star goalkeeper, the next summer market could be decisive for its future. Donnarumma, with an already consolidated career and room for growth, is facing a possible new challenge away from Ligue 1.’",
      "A former Premier League referee claims Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma deserves a “ban” for his “disgraceful” actions vs Arsenal.",

      "United and Spurs sit 15th and 16th in the Premier League respectively having endured miserable domestic campaigns, but having both cruised through their respective Europa League semi-finals, one of them will be competing in the Champions League next season.",
      "Speaking to beIN Sports, Wenger claimed the Europa League winners should be rewarded with a place back in the same competition and said the rule was particularly unfair for English clubs.",
      "“No – they should qualify automatically for the Europa League again but not necessarily for the Champions League,” Wenger said.",
      "“Especially when you’re in the Premier League, where already five teams qualify.",
      "“I think it’s something [for UEFA] to think about and to review. On the other hand, people will tell you that to keep the Europa League focused, interesting and motivated you need to give them that prize [of qualifying for the Champions League].”",
      "Neville insists the glory of winning the Europa League has been diminished, with United in particular far more focused on Champions League qualification than the trophy itself, with the financial implications massive for securing a place in Europe’s showcase competition next term.",
      "“I do actually agree a little bit with Arsene Wenger,” Neville said. “Every game we watch at the minute we just talk about the money at stakes. No one is talking about winning the Europa League to win a trophy.",
      "“UEFA Cup and Cup Winners’ Cup used to be big trophies that club could win. Now, the first thing you hear is ‘yeah you get the Champions League, it’s a £60m game’. The FA Cup has become devalued, really great competitions have become devalued.”",
      "And Keane is adamant that teams who have lost as many games as United and Spurs this season shouldn’t be competing against Europe’s best.",
      "He said: “I agree with that. I think it’s spot on. To have five or six teams.. It’s called a Champions League.",
      "“I think that’s kind of the incentive for smaller teams, they could get in through the back door. But Man Utd lose loads of games last year, losing loads of games this year. Spurs are the same.”",

      "Ruben Amorim gushed over “perfect” Mason Mount after Manchester United secured a spot in the Europa League final, but also reserved praise for an unsung hero at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils had a 3-0 lead going into the second leg but it was a tense atmosphere for much of the second leg after Mikel Jauregizar’s first-half strike gave Athletic Club hope of a comeback.",
      "But Amorim rang the changes in the second half and in the end United stormed to a 7-1 aggregate win over the Spanish side, with Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund both getting on the scoresheet, while Mason Mount scored a brilliant brace.",
      "Mount has endured a nightmare since his £55m move to United from Chelsea in the summer of 2023, making just 42 appearances for the club, and doubled his goals tally on Thursday with two outstanding strikes.",
      "The first saw him curl the ball into the far corner after making space for himself in the box with an excellent first touch before he drilled the ball from 40 yards out over the goalkeeper in no-man’s land.",
      "Amorim was delighted for Mount, who he believes is the “perfect” player for the inverted winger role in his 3-4-3 system, but was also impressed by the cameo of Kobbie Mainoo, who’s also not had the best of seasons.",

      "“When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him. He is perfect for this position as he can be a midfielder, but also runs like a winger so I’m really happy for him.",
      "“When you have a full squad you can think about the game. Sometimes we’re surviving with people in different positions, but with more options you can change the game and push forwards and these things can help you win games.”",
      "Amad Diallo was also hugely influential having only recently returned from injury, and came off the bench to set up Hojlund’s goal with some wonderful play on the wing.",
      "And Hojlund hailed his teammate for the assist, as well as Mount as another “extremely talented” player.",
      "“Lovely. It was very nice to score a scrappy goal. I am very glad Amad played the ball. What a player. Great player to have back in the team. Them two players are extremely talented, so we are very glad to have them both back [Amad and Mount].”",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim has performed an ‘incredible U-turn’ on one Manchester United star who could ‘see out his career’ at Old Trafford.",

      "Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, Scholes outlined his “fear” if United do sanction his departure from the club.",
      "“He’s perfect in a regular 4-3-3. He will be a real threat,” Scholes said. “He needs to tidy up his decision-making and finishing, sometimes his final ball is a bit rash but he’s a young player so that’s to be expected.",
      "“I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "“Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system.",
      "“I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.”",

      "“I hope he stays. He’s too good to let go. I would never want the club to sell him. But the system is an issue because it doesn’t suit some of the players.”",
      "And Scholes’ frustration with Garnacho was evident at half-time as the club legend analysed a moment during the first 45 minutes when he was put through on goal but his attempted chipped finish drifted wide of the post.",
      "Scholes said: “I have never seen Garnacho score a goal like this, he is not the player with that kind of guile. With the pace he has got, he should just go around the keeper. We said before the game he gets in brilliant positions, he is great at running through but a lot of the time he makes the wrong decision.”",

      "It’s an inexact science but a glance down the highest-rated Premier League players according to the WhoScored algorithms sees exactly zero new signings feature until No. 33, when we arrive at Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "In truth, his teammate Nikola Milenkovic is probably the correct answer to any question about the best signings of the Premier League season – he topped our own top 10 in March – with a nod to Bournemouth, who will likely quadruple their money on Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "But you could not make a case for any signing by a club with Premier League title ambitions – or even those without reasonable ambitions but with the heritage to still belong to the Big Six – to even make a revised, season-ending top 10.",
      "Manchester United made three of the most expensive signings of last summer, with Chelsea adding Pedro Neto to the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, while Dominic Solanke would only truly justify his monstrous Spurs transfer fee if he scored the winner in the Europa League final.",
      "Was there a single signing made last summer – outside of Nottingham – who has made a season-defining difference to their club this season? Liverpool spent almost nothing to win the title, Arsenal spent more to fail once again (though Mikel Arteta has his own theories about that), Brighton spent a metric f***-tonne of money to stand still, and Ipswich made an inspired striker signing but went down anyway.",
      "There could still be trophy-claiming moments for summer arrivals at Crystal Palace, United, Tottenham and Chelsea, but in terms of the Premier League, there has been an embarrassing lack of impact by new signings.",
      "When Jorgen Strand Larsen is the new arrival who has scored the most Premier League goals, excuse us for feeling a little underwhelmed.",
      "The good news is that this summer can only reap greater rewards, with almost every major Premier League club competing for strikers and Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko among those likely to arrive. After the phoney war of this frankly dull season, surely battle is about to commence.",
      "Mo Salah should not have another absolutely free run at every individual award. As wonderful as he is, every other ambitious Premier League club – barring perhaps Manchester City – should be signing somebody who wants to knock him off his f***ing perch. And that includes Liverpool.",
      "A summer without a major tournament can feel like a long one, but it does at least offer the potential for transfers not squeezed by football or born of desperation. Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",
      "While it’s true that transfers are not the answer to every question and Arne Slot has proved that continuity and coaching can still be the twin towers of a title victory, there are such obvious gaps in such obvious places, that there will surely be money spent.",
      "Brighton will definitely not retain their biggest spenders crown and Nottingham Forest really should not be pulling off the very best deals."

      "Another common occurrence is Alejandro Garnacho missing simple one-on-ones. His dink wide only added to the unease, and the sense grew that Bilbao might just nick a second and make this properly nervy.",
      "But it didn’t happen.",
      "Mason Mount’s sublime equaliser killed the tie and Bilbao completely gave up. Casemiro added another – a header, as in the first leg – just to rub it in and make sure United’s unbeaten record in Europe lives on.",

      "Amorim’s subs did the damage. Mount bagged a brace. Amad Diallo set up Hojlund. Kobbie Mainoo squeezed in two take-ons in just 11 minutes. Lovely job.",
      "And so, we get the final we didn’t know we needed: two broken Premier League giants, 15th vs 16th, 35 combined defeats, not a single one of them on 40 points. And yet, they’ll meet in Bilbao with a place in next season’s Champions League and millions on the line.",
      "It’s ridiculous. But it’s not undeserved. In this competition, they’ve looked the part. That’s all that counts.",
      "The loser, though, is going to feel it like a tonne of bricks. For United, it’s about funding a rebuild that would be near-impossible without Champions League football and that windfall.",
      "For Spurs, it could decide Postecoglou’s job – even if they win it, he’s not safe; if they don’t, he’s done. They might be better equipped to absorb the blow, but don’t mistake that for a lack of hunger. This is a club still chasing its first trophy since 2008, in case you weren’t aware.",
      "United have fared far better on the silverware front in that time, even when you take out the five years under Sir Alex Ferguson. Win in Bilbao, and they’ll have won a trophy in each of the last three seasons. Somehow. Despite being a complete and utter shambles on and off the pitch.",
      "Honestly, we didn’t expect it to pan out this way, but we are absolutely here for it and genuinely excited for a football match where two teams try their absolute hardest to lose.",

      "Including four Manchester United players, transfer expert David Ornstein has named 22 players ‘available’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "It promises to be a busy summer, with Arsenal, United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all targeting a striker.",
      "Several strikers are being linked with moves to the Premier League, including RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Lille’s Jonathan David, while Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap are expected to join another English club.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side has a lot of work to do this summer and wants to sign both Delap and Cunha.",
      "However, they will need to sell players in order to buy, and Ornstein has stated that they have three players they could sell. Christian Eriksen will also be available on a free transfer following the expiry of his contract.",
      "In addition to Eriksen, Ornstein mentions that on-loan stars Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are ‘available’.",
      "There is also a possibility that winger Alejandro Garnacho could leave. Ornstein noted, ‘Maybe Garnacho’ as one of the 22 players ‘available’ this summer, ‘off the top of his head’ when answering a question on The Athletic.",
      "Garnacho was linked with Chelsea and Napoli in January but stayed at Old Trafford, despite the latter selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG.",
      "The names of Rashford – on loan at Aston Villa – and Sancho – at Chelsea – appearing should surprise no one.",
      "The United players named by Ornstein are not the biggest names on his list of 22 players expected to be available at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Let’s run through them, shall we?",
      "Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting), Benjamin Sesko (Leipzig) and Jonathan David (Lille)\nThree big-name strikers expected to be on the move this summer. David is entering free agency, Sesko has a gentleman’s agreement to leave Leipzig and Gyokeres will spread his wings elsewhere after two incredibly productive years in Lisbon.",
      "David’s future is massively unclear, but I do know he won’t be playing for Lille next season.",
      "One of Sesko or Gyokeres will likely end up at Arsenal, we suspect. Whoever doesn’t might end up at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap (Ipswich) and Matheus Cunha (Wolves)\nCunha’s future appears to lie at Old Trafford, but there are too many clubs interested in Delap to predict where he’ll end up.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nEighteen Premier League goals this season is an outrageous return for a Brentford player and they have bloody two of them! Yoane Wissa is not being linked with an exit, but Mbeumo is headed for the door. Club captain Christian Norgaard said this week: “I think Bryan is likely to go. I don’t know about Wissa yet. Everyone hopes that he might stay. Either way, I’m happy for the season and am happy for both of them. They deserve it so much.”",
      "Arsenal and Newcastle and Man United are being strongly linked with the Cameroonian.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nWho will take a chance on Darwin, then? A Liverpool exit seems inevitable.",
      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)\nAsked about De Bruyne to Liverpool, Ornstein replied to another reader: ‘As far as we understand, Hugo, Liverpool are not signing De Bruyne. He is good friends with members of their squad, notably Virgil van Dijk, and I’m sure those guys would love to play alongside him, but any notion of the Premier League champions moving for him are thought to be wide of the mark.’",
      "City legend KDB is out of contract this summer.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth)\nBournemouth should rake in the big bucks this summer, with three of their star players wanted by Premier League rivals. Huijsen’s exit is all but confirmed, but to who, Chris Kamara? Kerkez is destined for Liverpool, it seems. Ornstein adds that Semenyo will ‘potentially’ leave. Ooh, the uncertainty.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs)\n‘Probably’ available, Ornstein says. He also only gave surnames. I’m pretty confident he was referring to the Spurs Romero. Atletico Madrid are keen.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nOut of favour at Arsenal, who are addicted to signing left-backs under Mikel Arteta, Zinchenko will leave this summer and knowing the Gunners, they’ll get £5m for him and he will go on to be world-class elsewhere.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nNewcastle tried and failed last summer. They should come back for him in June.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund), Jorrel Hato (Ajax), Mike Maignan (Milan) and Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)\nThe rest, I guess. The only surprise out of these four is AC Milan and France goalkeeper Maignan. He is club captain and his country’s long-term No. 1, but he is out of contract next year so the Italian giants could seek a fee this summer.",
      "Tah, meanwhile, is out of contract in 2025 and wanted by a host of clubs. The latest we have on Gittens is that Arsenal want him, and Hato is one of the most promising defenders in the world and wanted by every top club."

      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire, who “CROSSED THE BALL!”",
      "Manchester United are enduring a dismal domestic season and sit 15th in the Premier League having won just ten of their 35 games this term, with legendary captain Keane one of their harshest critics.",
      "The European League could be their saving grace though as victory over Athletic Club in the semi-final followed by a win over either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt would mean a trophy for Ruben Amorim in his his first season in charge and crucial entry into the Champions League next term.",
      "Playing in Europe’s showcase competition will make United more alluring to potential new recruits ahead of what looks to be a significant summer rebuild, and grant the club with more money to make those changes.",
      "But Keane isn’t impressed with United simply being happy about being in the competition next term, having played for the club when they were competing to win it.",
      "Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast: “Everyone’s saying if United are in it, how big United are, that United are going to be in the Champions League. You’re talking like they’re a small club, they’ve got no chance of winning it.",
      "“The way it’s panned out now, it’ll be huge for the club, and the format might be that they’ll win one or two games because of the seeding, but in terms of winning it, United are going ‘we have to be in it’, they’re not talking about winning it! ‘",
      "“‘We just have to be in it for financial reasons, what a place to be.”",
      "United have a very good chance of reaching the Europa League final after claiming a 3-0 away win in the first leg, but Keane claims they’re an “absolute disgrace” for giving up on the Premier League to focus on Europe.",
      "“(I’m just fed up at) how bad they are,” Keane added. “They’re getting on my nerves, they keep talking about a big game next week, they’re not even trying.",
      "“A couple of weeks ago at Newcastle they said ‘we couldn’t focus because we’ve got Lyon coming up’ so they keep writing these matches off.",
      "“I understand it’s a big game, so you just dismiss these league matches? They’re a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.”",
      "The panel went on to discuss Inter Milan defender’s Denzel Dumfries’ outstanding displays against Barcelona in their two-legged semi-final tie, with Gary Neville insisting he would like to see United sign the Dutchman.",
      "Jill Scott then couldn’t resist riling Keane further by joking that Amorim should play Maguire at right wing-back after the defender assisted Casemiro’s opener in Spain last week.",
      "“Oh relax Jill, will you,” Keane fired back. “I know you’re joking. Harry Maguire last week. Harry Maguire crossed the ball and everyone’s going ‘what amazing feet’.",
      "“HE CROSSED THE BALL! Skill? He did a little shimmy, crossed it! It’s not bad for £80m is it, someone who can cross the ball! Oh my god! You’re all living in cuckoo land.”",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville agree with Arsene Wenger’s call for a UEFA rules change which would cost both Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s ...",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Roy Keane piled in on Jamie Vardy earlier this week, criticising the Leicester forward’s relegation apology days before announcing his departure."

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "5) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "7) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",
      "",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side."

      "Rashford was dropped by Ruben Amorim for the Manchester derby in December and didn’t feature again for the Red Devils before a loan switch to Aston Villa in January.",
      "The forward managed four goals and six assists for Unai Emery’s side before a hamstring injury put paid to his season, and although Villa have a £40m option to make Rashford’s move permanent, reports suggest the 27-year-old only has eyes for Barcelona.",
      "He was linked with a move to the Catalan giants in January, but they were put off by his £325,000 per week wages, which Villa are currently paying 75 per cent of.",
      "Rashford though has told Barcelona that he’s willing to take a significant pay-cut in order to make the move happen.",
      "A report last week stated:",
      "‘His great goal is to try to play for Barça and his environment has already sent to the Blaugrana leaders that he is willing to lower his salary ostensibly so that the operation can be viable from an economic point of view. Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.",
      "And now according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, in another ‘strategic step’ to ensure a move to the Catalan Club, ‘Rashford has decided to entrust his affairs to a high-profile, highly experienced agent with strong ties to FC Barcelona: Pini Zahavi,’",
      "Rashford is said to have been keen on enlisting Zahavi to work on the move over his agent and brother, Dwaine Maynard,  because of Zahavi has a ‘good relationship with club president Joan Laporta’.",
      "Zahavi also represents both Hansi Flick and Robert Lewandowksi and has other ‘strong connections to the club’ that Rashford wants to take advantage of.",
      "It’s claimed ‘sources close to the player indicate early-stage talks have already begun ahead of the summer window’, but in what will be a significant blow to Manchester United, ‘a loan deal is seen as the most realistic path’.",
      "United want to secure Rashford’s permanent exit to get £40m of pure profit for their summer rebuild and to ensure all of his mammoth wage is off their bill.",
      "Amorim insisted last month that he was pleased to see Rashford and fellow loanee Antony performing well in their time away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim said: “All the players on loan will return, and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season.",
      "“The talent of Rashford, the talent of Antony, they all have talent. We are really happy because if you put players on loan, you want them to perform. That is good for us.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",

      "His return became inevitable ahead of the 2023/24 season as he faced charges relating to attempted rape and assault after images and videos of a young woman leaked online.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service eventually discontinued the case against Greenwood, with it ruled that there was not a realistic chance of conviction after key witnesses withdrew.",

      "READ: Man Utd vs Athletic Bilbao prediction, expected line-ups, how to watch and stats",
      "The 23-year-old has been in good form for Marseille this season, grabbing 19 goals and five assists in 34 appearances across all competitions.",
      "The Red Devils are well-placed to make more money on Greenwood as they have a 50% sell-on clause.",
      "It has been widely reported that the forward is attracting interest from other clubs ahead of this summer’s window, with it claimed Liverpool have made him their ‘top target’ to replace Darwin Nunez.",
      "Signing Greenwood would be a major risk for Premier League clubs as he comes with a lot of baggage and a report from TEAMTalk correspondent Fraser Fletcher claims Man Utd’s ‘hopes of a windfall are diminishing’ as a ‘return’ to England ‘has hit trouble’.",
      "TEAMTalk have ‘revealed Greenwood’s chances of moving to the Premier League in the summer transfer window’, with ‘it extremely unlikely that another club in the English top flight would sign him’.",
      "It is noted that ‘several Premier League clubs have privately expressed interest in signing Greenwood’, though ‘they are deterred by the significant public relations risks stemming from his past’.",
      "The report has also revealed the ‘most likely’ outcome for Greenwood this summer with Premier League rivals keen to avoid a ‘PR disaster’.",
      "‘Signing Greenwood could be seen as tone-deaf, with the risks of fan boycotts and reputational damage also a concern for clubs, according to sources.",

      "‘Greenwood’s camp will be aware of the challenges, but they will hope consistent performances abroad can rebuild his image.",

      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Arsenal's target at the start of the season was to win the Premier League. They would have also been hoping to improve on last season's run to quarter finals of the Champions League and potentially go on and taste success for the first time in that competition.",
      "The Gunners wanted silverware. Mikel Arteta wanted to win.",
      "However, with Liverpool running away with the Premier League, a Champions league last-four exit to PSG, an early exit in the FA Cup and a semi-final defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the reality is a fifth trophyless season under Arteta.",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City also faced a battle to finish in the top five and guarantee a Champions League place. However, on a run of seven unbeaten games and with Arsenal's dip in form, there is the possibility they could finish second.",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",

      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",

      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",

      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
      "Between these two, they have lost 35 Premier League games.",

      "In an ideal world, without PSR restraints and the lure of playing European football being a necessity for most players, both clubs could just do with a season of Premier League focus.",
      "Just look what it did for Chelsea in 2016/17.",
      "After a season in the doldrums, finishing 10th in the Premier League, Antonio Conte revitalised the club and, without the added stresses of European football, roared them to a Premier League title.",
      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",
      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",
      "Although Spurs and Manchester United don't officially fall into that category, it gives a relevant overview of how a European campaign can make it very hard to remain consistent in the Premier League.",
      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",

      "Mikel Jaureguizar's first-half goal had given Athletic hope but Mason Mount came off the bench to settle United nerves before goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and a second from over 40 yards out by Mount earned a handsome win at Old Trafford.",
      "The result sets up an all-English final in Bilbao on May 21 following Tottenham's win over Bodo/Glimt in the other semi-final. A difficult season for both Premier League clubs will end with one of them securing a Champions League spot next season.",

      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",
      "Athletic were dreaming well into the second half but Ruben Amorim's substitutions changed the game. Amad Diallo provided attacking impetus but it was Mount's quality finish that ended Ernesto Valverde's side's hopes, turning and firing expertly into the far corner.",
      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",

      "Enzo Fernandez's price stands out on picking up a booking based on his likely match-up with Bruno Guimaraes in central areas. It's Brazil vs Argentina in there and Bruno is a foul-drawing master, having been responsible for getting 34 players booked since the start of last season - a huge figure.",
      "Fernandez's cards data away from home recently is very appealing too - he's been carded in six of his last nine away games.",
      "Nottingham Forest are ridiculously short in the betting here at 1/3 with Sky Bet, even against a team like Leicester, when you factor in what is on the line and the expectation on the home side to win the game. It's something they've not coped with at home, losing to both Everton and Brentford in front of a very nervy crowd.",
      "So at the prices, Forest have to be taken on here, but I want to chase a bigger price in Jamie Vardy to score and be carded at 18/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Vardy will be relishing this occasion. He needs just one goal to reach 200 for Leicester and you can see him doing it at the City Ground, with perhaps a prepared shirt underneath celebrating the milestone.",

Judging by his words, it will be another rest and rotate job for this one in what could be a very low-key game up against another team with a huge fixture on the horizon.",
      "Oliver Glasner seems a little more convinced about keeping the rhythm of his team together in the build-up to that Wembley final and it's easy to see why the market favours them here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",
      "The one constant this season in a bang average West Ham side has been Jarrod Bowen's attacking output.",
      "He will have been disappointed not to have kicked on in terms of improving last year's numbers but a per-90 average of 0.59 goal involvements is still something to be proud of playing for a team who could finish 17th in the Premier League. Bowen has four goal involvements in his last three games and is 11/8 with Sky Bet to grab another.",
      "Arsenal have scored 17 goals fewer and recorded 20.7 expected goals fewer than Liverpool in the Premier League this season. That has held them back and has proven costly across all their major trophy hunts this season. Just look at that first 10 minutes at Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "They were sensational in every department, apart from the most important one - putting the ball in the net.",
      "One player that may start doing that more next season is Declan Rice, who remains very attractive in the goalscorer markets based on his new position playing in the No 8 role. In his 54 starts in that position, he's managed to score 12 goals. Those numbers make the 20/1 first goalscorer price with Sky Bet look a little wild.",

      "Man Utd beat Athletic Club 7-1 on aggregate in their Europa League semi-final to book their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21; Mason Mount scored twice, becoming the first United substitute to do so in a European knockout game since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 11:43, UK",
      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",
      "\"It was too long,\" he added, referring to his wait for a feeling like this on a big night.",
      "Mount, who had never scored at Old Trafford for United, became the first substitute at the club to score twice in a European knockout match since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",
      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He's a really good player and you can see both goals are really good goals. So I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, but also the team-mates, they were so happy for him.\"",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",
      "Tottenham await Man Utd in the Europa League final, which takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim claims his team could be the worst Premier League side to lift a European trophy; United face Athletic Club in the second leg of the Europa League semi-final on Thursday and hold a 3-0 lead",
      "Thursday 8 May 2025 21:02, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has claimed his side could be the \"worst Premier League side to win a European trophy\" if they go on to lift the Europa League.",
      "United head into the second leg of their semi-final tie against Athletic Club with a 3-0 lead as they look to book their place in the final in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Speaking in his press conference ahead of Thursday's second leg, Amorim was asked to reflect on his comments from January, where he claimed his team could be the worst in the history of United, given they could reach a European final to potentially salvage a disappointing campaign.",
      "He said: \"For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title.",
      "\"So we will not change anything. We know that this season was disappointing.",
      "\"Nothing is going to change, in that moment, I have to think a bit more but I felt that. I still feel that this season was the worst in the last 50 years.\"",
      "United forward Alejandro Garnacho, who was seated next to him in the press conference, was then asked for his opinion on the comments made by his manager and how it impacts the dressing room.",
      "He said: \"We know we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. We follow the rules and tomorrow we will face the game like it is 0-0.",
      "\"If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we can face the next season with a better mentality.\"",
      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",
      "\"That is it.\"",
      "They join long-term absentees Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee on the sidelines.",
      "Garancho says he is \"happy\" at the club amid interest from Napoli and Chelsea.",
      "\"As a footballer, you will hear rumours about the future,\" he said. \"I am contracted until 2028, and I am happy here.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Daily Mail report this week claimed Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could be the target for a big-money offer from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal this summer.",
      "The Portugal international's representatives reportedly held talks with Al Hilal on Monday after initial contact between the two camps last year before Fernandes signed his new Old Trafford deal until the summer of 2027, which has an option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim revealed in March he had told the 30-year-old he was \"not going anywhere\" following links to Real Madrid, with Amorim striking a similar tone amid talk of a summer move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it is easy to understand (his importance) - not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he's the captain, so he's really important.",
      "\"It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others.",
      "\"But we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn't change. We want Bruno here.\""
