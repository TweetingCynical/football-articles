      "Sir Alex Ferguson is no stranger to holding private talks with either Pep Guardiola or Ruben Amorim. Guardiola's Manchester City host rivals Manchester United, managed by Amorim, in the Manchester derby on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Despite both clubs enjoying vast Premier League success in the past, neither side has started the season well. City, despite their hopes that last term was merely a blip, are down in 16th, having won one and lost two games so far.",
      "Less surprisingly, given United's decline since Ferguson's departure in 2013 and a woeful 15th-place finish last season, Amorim's Red Devils are in 11th place. And it is entirely possible that the Portuguese head coach may have leaned on Sir Alex for some advice ahead of the short trip to the Etihad Stadium.",
      "That's because Amorim revealed last season in January, midway through United's turbulent campaign, that he was in regular contact with the 83-year-old. Allowing Amorim to tap into his vast knowledge suggests that Ferguson has a reasonably close relationship with Amorim and wants to help the young head coach.",
      "\"I speak with Sir Alex several times. I try to call him to keep being positive,\" Amorim told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's really good because I feel the history of the club but it's really hard, as they did such a good job, to be the guy leading the team at this moment. It's really hard but we have to believe.\"",
      "In the opposition dugout on Sunday will be a man whom Ferguson will also know well. The Scot had formerly handpicked David Moyes as his successor, only for his compatriot to be sacked less than a year into the United job in 2014.",
      "Ryan Giggs took charge on an interim basis before Louis van Gaal was eventually appointed. But before the Dutchman's arrival, Ferguson had sought to make amends by apparently trying to snap up Guardiola - then at Bayern Munich, and regarded as the best manager in the world.",
      "Guardiola, who ironically joined City in 2016 and has won six Premier League titles since, recalled once being invited to a private meeting by Ferguson, where he was left unsure of whether the Scotsman was offering him the United job or not.",
      "\"He invited me to [a] super restaurant and we had a very, very good time. My English [was] not so good when Sir Alex [Ferguson] spoke a little bit quickly, I had sometimes had a problem understanding him,\" explained Guardiola.",
      "\"That's why I didn't understand if I received an offer or not. It was a friendly dinner, like always with me when I started as a coach, he was so, so gentle and we spent a very, very good time together.\"",
      "Ferguson's record in Manchester derbies is 26 wins, 10 draws, and 11 losses. Guardiola, meanwhile, has won eight of his 15 league clashes with the Red Devils but lost both times he faced Amorim last year. One loss came against Amorim's Sporting CP side in the Champions League and then to United in December.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "British boxing legend Ricky Hatton was due to attend Sunday's Manchester derby before his tragic death aged 46. Hatton, a passionate Man City supporter, was found dead at his home in Hyde, Greater Manchester at 6:45am on Sunday.",
      "Greater Manchester Police say that they are not treating his death as suspicious. Hatton had a table in hospitality booked for the Premier League match between City and Manchester United, and there will now be a minute's applause before kick-off at 4:30pm.",
      "The club shared a heartfelt tribute which read: \"Manchester City are devastated to learn Ricky Hatton has passed away, aged 46. Ricky was one of City's most loved and revered supporters, who will always be remembered for a glittering boxing career that saw him win world titles at welterweight and light-welterweight.",
      "\"Everyone at the Club would like to send our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends at this difficult time. We can confirm there will be a minute’s appreciation ahead of today's game against Manchester United.\"",
      "Tributes are flooding in for Hatton, one of Britain's most popular fighters. He is survived by his three children; son Campbell, and daughters Fearne Grace and Millie.",
      "A GMP spokesperson said: \"We can confirm that we have found a body at an address on Bowlacre Road in Gee Cross at 6.45am today, Sunday, September 14. The death is not being treated as suspicious.\"",
      "Hatton was scheduled to return to the boxing ring in early December, 13 years after his last professional fight. The Hitman was set to face Dubai's first-ever professional boxer, Eisa Al Dah, in the Middle East.",
      "His last professional bout was against Vyacheslav Senchenko of Ukraine in Manchester. That came three-and-a-half years after he hung up his gloves following a loss to Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas.",
      "Aside from boxing, Hatton loved his football and attended the PFA awards less than a month ago. He wore sky blue shorts in the ring and walked out to City's anthem, Blue Moon.",
      "He fulfilled a childhood dream by fighting at the City of Manchester Stadium in 2008, beating Mexico's Juan Lazcano. Speaking on the club's official podcast in 2024, Hatton explained: \"I go to the same pubs and I go to the match on Saturdays. I think that's why the fan base I had was so massive.",
      "\"I had an exciting boxing style, I was a body puncher and aggressive but I was just one of the boys. People in town could relate to me. They see me in town, at the darts, at the match, you don't see me on a red carpet. The fans could see me as one of them.",
      "\"It's the way I was brought up. My mum and dad brought me up right and I've always had good friends around me. No outsiders, it's always been the same group.",
      "\"If I ever got too big for my boots, my mates would tell me and they wouldn't want to know me. City fans I've no doubt will get behind Campbell because he's he same, he's one of us.\"",
      "He added: \"It's always been a family club. They've invested in the ground and facilities and the team but the club has kept its feet on the ground. When a few quid comes in you can lose that but we've not lost it, it's still the massive family club it is.\"",

      "Manchester United fans have been left feeling that the club is 'cursed' after Rasmus Hojlund took less than a quarter of an hour to score on his debut for Napoli. Hojlund, 22, joined the Italian champions on a season-long loan in the final knockings of the summer transfer window, having been pushed down the pecking order at Old Trafford.",
      "The Danish striker wasn't included in any of Ruben Amorim's squads for the four matches before his departure on deadline day, with new signing Benjamin Sesko preferred. United agreed a fee of up to £73.7million for Slovenia international Sesko and Amorim was happy to have him and Joshua Zirkzee as his options up front.",
      "Napoli needed a replacement for ex-Red Devils striker Romelu Lukaku, who suffered a thigh injury in pre-season and is set to spend the next two to three months on the sidelines. The Serie A title winners have paid a £5m loan fee and will be obligated to sign Hojlund permanently if they qualify for the Champions League, with a £38m deal already in place.",
      "The United loanee previously played in Italy for Atalanta, where he convinced the Red Devils to fork out an initial £64m for his signature two years ago. Hojlund bagged his first goal of the season as a substitute in Denmark's 3-0 victory over Greece during the international break.",
      "He took his shooting boots back to Napoli and netted with just 14 minutes on the clock in Saturday's trip to Fiorentina, making it 2-0. Antonio Conte's side ran out 3-1 winners, with former Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne also getting on the scoresheet.",
      "Although he'd scored in Champions League games, United fans had to wait a painstaking 1,027 minutes for Hojlund to finally notch his first Premier League goal on Boxing Day 2023. So it was no surprise that the Old Trafford faithful reacted strongly to the Denmark international's early goal for Napoli.",
      "\"Debut goal, Utd are cursed,\" one fan said. A second lamented: \"Hojlund scores on his debut? Wow we're cursed.\" A third bemoaned: \"We're really cursed.\" Another asked: \"So the problem is Manchester United?\"",
      "Post-match, Conte hailed his new striker, joking that Napoli signed Hojlund because Scott McTominay was a success after coming from Old Trafford last season. \"Hojlund is only 22 years old, we got him from Manchester United, seeing as it brought us luck doing that with McTominay,\" the Napoli boss told Sky Sport Italia.",
      "\"We knew his qualities; he has great potential and can improve. You can see he's a lad with great prospects.\"",

      "Gary Neville famously refused to shake hands with Peter Schmeichel during the 2002 Manchester derby. The pair had formed a close bond during Schmeichel's eight-year tenure at Old Trafford in the 1990s.",
      "However, Schmeichel's decision to join City in 2002 after successful stints with Sporting CP and Aston Villa was seen as a betrayal by many United fans. The move also particularly irked Neville due to the intense rivalry between the two Manchester clubs.",
      "An awkward moment ensued during the Manchester derby in November, 23 years ago, when both teams were lining up in the tunnel at Maine Road. Schmeichel, leading out City, offered his hand to Neville, who was standing in as United's captain, but the full-back remained silent, briefly locking eyes with Schmeichel before brushing his hand aside.",
      "Neville then stood firm, a stern expression on his face, before leading his team onto the pitch to face their fierce rivals. Reflecting on the incident in 2018, Neville defended his decision to snub Schmeichel. During an appearance on the Quickly Kevin, Will He Score? podcast, he explained: \"When you look back now and you're 43, like I am, there are two things about that.",
      "\"One, he left Man United at the age of whatever he was, 35, and he said he was retiring, basically to go abroad. At the time when he came back, he played for Manchester City. You can't play for Manchester City. I'm a United fan and I can't play for Manchester City, I can't play for Leeds and I can't play for Liverpool. That's just written in stone.",
      "\"You just don't play for those clubs, irrespective of what happens. He'd won the treble with United in '99, said that he was retiring... he should have carried on playing for United for the next two or three years if that was the case. We struggled for a keeper between Peter and Edwin [van der Sar].",
      "\"The other thing was at that time I hated everybody, we all did. Everybody hated us, we all hated everybody. That's the way it was. With Sir Alex [Ferguson], you're on an island and we were [in a] siege mentality. If you're not on the island, do one.\"",
      "Neville also revealed he maintained a strict policy of refusing to shake hands with opposing players before kick-off, regardless of their identity or allegiance. He added: \"Shake hands at the end of the game when you've had the battle. I just think, I'm focusing before a game.",
      "\"I'm focusing on my first pass, which wasn't always a good one, my first touch, my first tackle, my opponent and how I'm going to affect him in the first five minutes of that game. I can't let him go past me on my first one-on-one - that's impossible - because if he goes past me the first time he's going to get confidence.",
      "\"I'm also going to run off him going forward to make him think he's got to run back. The first time the ball is in the air, I'm going to win that header. All I'm thinking about before that game is that. The idea of talking to a player from the opposition - that would distract me.",
      "\"So you say about not shaking hands with Peter Schmeichel, but I didn't shake hands with my brother [Phil Neville] when he was captain of Everton. And that's not because I don't like my brother - I do like him, he's all right.\"",
      "During that memorable Manchester derby, City thrashed United 3-1 at home, with Shaun Goater netting twice and Nicolas Anelka also on target to overshadow Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's consolation goal. The revelation comes ahead of Sunday's clash between the Manchester rivals at the Etihad Stadium, more than two decades after Neville's confrontation with Schmeichel.",
      "Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are desperate to find their footing at home after a mixed start to the season, with a victory over Wolves but defeats to Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton. The Citizens are keen to get back on track in one of the most high-stakes games of the season.",
      "Meanwhile, United have had a varied start to the season, with a loss, a draw and a win against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley respectively. Manager Ruben Amorim is under pressure to deliver this season, having received full support from the board this summer, following a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League last term.",

      "It's the prime slot for the biggest Premier League game of the weekend, but there's more than just three points at stake. As with every derby, local bragging rights are up for grabs. The victorious fans will claim Manchester as either blue or red until the return fixture at Old Trafford on January 26, 2026.",
      "However, this time around, the stakes seem higher. Both teams currently languish in the bottom half of the table.",
      "It is surprising to see City in 16th place, even after only three games. Pep Guardiola's men have suffered back-to-back defeats against Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton & Hove Albion, following an opening-day victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "United, on the other hand, sit in 11th position. Ruben Amorim's side have had a mixed start to the season, winning one, drawing one, and losing one of their first three matches, requiring a late Bruno Fernandes penalty to secure all three points against newly promoted Burnley last time out.",
      "United's Carabao Cup journey was cut short last month, following a penalty shootout defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town. In the wake of that match, United boss Amorim seemed to doubt his future at the club.",
      "However, their victory over Burnley silenced the speculation for a while. Losing to rivals Man City, though, could reignite those rumours.",
      "United hope to carry forward the momentum they built up before the international break into the upcoming game. A win would give City the boost they need to kick off their season.",
      "United's next challenge is Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday. While they have nearly a week to prepare, City face Napoli in their opening Champions League match on Thursday.",
      "City will undoubtedly aim for a positive result against their rivals to set them up nicely for the challenging fixture. Meanwhile, United will appreciate the extra preparation time before their next match, and no one wants to arrive at Carrington this week with the pressure to make amends.",
      "Given it's still early days in the season, securing three points could significantly alter the table standings. A win for United would bring them level with Everton and Sunderland, who currently sit in sixth and seventh place, respectively.",
      "A victory for City would catapult them into the top half of the table, two points clear of their city rivals - a much-needed morale boost following the disappointment of their last two matches. However, defeat could spell disaster, solidifying a sluggish start to the Premier League season.",
      "City learned the hard way last season; escaping a rut can be daunting. Their poor form almost ended their chances of securing a spot in the Champions League.",
      "A loss against United this weekend could effectively knock them out of the title race with Liverpool and Arsenal, despite the season being in its infancy. United find themselves in a similar predicament; defeat could resurrect the doubts that haunted last season, dampening morale both on and off the pitch and potentially jeopardising their European ambitions.",
      "The significance of the Manchester derby is never to be underestimated, but Sunday's match may carry more weight than previous encounters and those yet to come. It already feels like a do-or-die situation for both teams, a sentiment rarely felt this early in the campaign.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has admitted midfielder Carlos Baleba has been \"affected by the noise\" around his failed move to Manchester United.",
      "Baleba was strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window and became one of United's top targets as Ruben Amorim sought a new No 6 to play alongside Bruno Fernandes in midfield.",
      "But United were put off by Brighton's reported valuation of £115million and moved onto other targets - though they were ultimately unable to bring in the defensive midfield player they wanted.",
      "Hurzeler insisted he was confident Baleba would not be sold and his prediction came true, but not without consequences. The 21-year-old was benched for his side's 2-1 loss to Bournemouth on Saturday and instead came off the bench.",
      "The German coach said Baleba had been affected mentally by the speculation surrounding a move to United, saying \"sometimes young players don't have the face we want to see\".",
      "\"I think it’s normal for a young player when the media creates the noise around him,\" the Brighton boss said.",
      "\"It’s not easy for this player to handle it. Therefore we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance.",
      "\"But he’s a young player and I think that’s something we have to accept, that young players don’t always have the face we want to see. ‘It’s our responsibility to help them in the right moments.",
      "\"I think everyone gets affected, especially when you are that young and you hear these kinds of things, no matter if they are wrong or right. But it’s just noise we don’t need.\"",
      "Hurzeler was speaking after his Brighton side's defeat to the Cherries, in which Baleba played the final 24 minutes.",
      "It was the first time Baleba has not started a game in the Premier League this season. He's played a total of 200 minutes in the top flight in 2025-26 so far and has been a key player for the Seagulls since his arrival in 2023.",
      "He's played 82 times for the club, scoring four goals, becoming the latest successful midfield signing to star for Brighton after Yves Bissouma, Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister.",

      "Andy Dunn is the Mirror's chief sports writer.",
      "Despite the hullabaloo that has accompanied Manchester United’s modern-day struggles, it should be no surprise if the derby goes their way at the Etihad today. After all, Pep Guardiola has managed to win only four of his nine Premier League home fixtures against United. Pep has lost four of those games, with one drawn.",
      "As City manager, his overall record against United - who have had five different, official managers during Guardiola’s Etihad tenure (if you count Ralf Rangnick’s six-month spell as official) - is good.",
      "But, in the context of City’s all-conquering era, it is not startling. In all competitions, City have faced United 25 times since Guardiola took over in the summer of 2016 and have lost nine of those matches, winning 13 and playing out three goalless draws.",
      "Only against Liverpool and Spurs have Guardiola’s City suffered more defeats (10). And Guardiola’s record against Ruben Amorim is underwhelming, having won only one of their five meetings, drawing two and losing two.",
      "Both United and City have made unconvincing starts to the season, Amorim’s team a point ahead of their local rivals. United have created plenty of chances but still look limited in the goalscoring department while City’s defensive vulnerability - which emerged quite emphatically last season - remains there for all to see and exploit.",
      "So, while bookmakers have City as favourites for the latest edition of the Manchester derby, it is a very tough one to call. And also, it would probably be unwise to read too much into the outcome.",
      "After all, despite United’s good record at the Etihad in the Guardiola years, City have won six Premier League titles in that timespan. Getting a home beating at the hands of United has rarely knocked City out of their successful stride.",
      "But a win for United in this latest encounter WOULD carry extra significance. By any means, it has not been a spectacular start to the current campaign but given he joined when a grim season was already well underway, this feels like the real beginning of the Amorim regime.",
      "The departure of Andre Onana, who has gone on loan to Trabzonspor, is starkly symbolic as the goalkeeper was one of the previous regime’s flagship signings. In contrast, for all the transfer business done by City in this year’s two transfer windows, perhaps the most significant move in or out of the Etihad in 2025 was the departure of Kevin de Bruyne.",
      "He was a flagship player of the entire Guardiola-City era. And of all the incomings, it is still hard to pinpoint one as a certainty to follow in the influential footsteps of serial winners such as De Bruyne.",
      "It still takes a huge leap of imagination to see this season marking the decline of Pep’s Premier League powers and the emergence of Amorim’s excellence. But another United victory at the Etihad would certainly bring that scenario an unlikely step closer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Owen Hargreaves was as classy as ever in his response to Sir Alex Ferguson branding him as one of the worst signings of his career. It was in 2007 when Manchester United signed the ex-England star from Bayern Munich for a reported fee of £17million.",
      "Arriving in England with four Bundesliga titles and a Champions League triumph to his name, Hargreaves possessed quite the pedigree while being voted England's best player at the 2006 World Cup a year prior.",
      "It was instant success for the midfielder at Old Trafford as he won the Premier League and Champions League double in his first season, making 34 appearances across all competitions.",
      "Unfortunately, that would turn out to be the last full season of Hargreaves' career as a recurring patellar tendinitis problem would effectively end his time in football. Despite numerous operations on both of his knees, it would do little for a hopeful return to the pitch.",
      "Hargreaves made just five more appearances in his next three seasons at United before he was released in 2011 as he went on to sign for Manchester City for one season. In his only campaign for City, he played four times and retired from football after his release from the Citizens.",
      "It was in Ferguson's autobiography that he revealed his regret in signing Hargreaves, claiming his former player had no self-belief. \"We started to put together a bid for him. But I studied his playing record and felt a tinge of doubt. I didn't feel a strong vibe about him. David Gill worked hard on the deal with Bayern,\" the Scotsman wrote.",
      "\"I met Owen's agent at the World Cup final in Berlin. Nice man, a lawyer. I told him we could develop Hargreaves at United. It turned out to be a disaster. Owen had no confidence in himself whatsoever.",
      "\"He didn't show nearly enough determination to overcome his physical difficulties, for my liking. I saw him opt for the easy choice too often in terms of training. He was one of the most disappointing signings of my career.\"",
      "Despite the harsh words from his former manager, Hargreaves was class personified when given the opportunity to respond, instead insisting a private conversation would be required rather than taking to airwaves.",
      "\"It's a complicated one. Anyone who knows me knows that professionalism is one of my strongest traits. A lot of people were surprised by what he said, me included. He said a lot of things in there that were with emotion,\" Hargreaves told BT Sport.",
      "\"The reason he brought me over was to win the Champions League and we were able to do that and I played a big part. After the treatment that I had that summer I virtually never played again. For a young player, I was only 27, be at that point in my career and never play again, to have to deal with all of that was very, very difficult.",
      "\"I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. A lot of relationships break down due to communication. My only regret is that I didn't go to him sooner. But I didn't realise the severity of the situation until it was a little bit too late. The reason I left Bayern was to play for United, it was a privilege to play there.",
      "\"It was an honour to play under him. For it to deteriorate like it did was very disappointing. I think it's a conversation me and him need to have personally. I wouldn't wish that situation on anyone.\"",
      "Hargreaves' two former sides are set to clash on Sunday in the first Manchester derby of the season at the Etihad Stadium. Both clubs have had a dire start to the season, with City suffering consecutive defeats. United's only victory has come at home to Burnley, courtesy of a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty.",

      "It's the first Manchester derby of the season, and there are headaches in both camps. Both Pep Guardiola and Ruben Amorim's sides have had poor starts to the new Premier League campaign, only winning one game each.",
      "After a chance to reset during the international break, City and United are ready to clash at the Etihad. Last season's version of this fixture saw United snatch a 2-1 win in the dying embers, compounding a miserable run of form for City.",
      "The hero of that night, Amad, has been short of minutes in the Premier League this term, but due to Diogo Dalot, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount all being ruled out through injury, he's set to be involved from the start. Their spate of injuries could also see Benjamin Sesko make his first league start since joining from RB Leipzig for a cool £73.7million.",
      "One new signing who won't be starting is Senne Lammens, as Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Altay Bayindir would keep his place. \"Altay is going to continue because it's a different league (for Lammens), it's a different country, trainings, ball, so we try to maintain that and they will fight for the position,\" the Red Devils boss explained.",
      "\"So, for me, it's clear, Altay will start. We believe in our goalkeepers, I believe in Altay, he's ready to play and he's going to play.\"",
      "While Amorim has already made a decision on his goalkeeper, Guardiola must decide whether he hands a debut to Gianluigi Donnarumma, who like Lammens arrived on transfer deadline day. James Trafford, a fellow summer signing, received mixed reviews after his three games between the posts and faces a battle to keep the gloves.",
      "When asked about about Donnarumma, Guardiola replied: \"He is so tall, he is so huge. [From] all the keepers we want is safe balls, give confidence to the team, have personality and a big presence.",
      "Who'll win the Manchester derby? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"In the biggest stages in the Champions League last season, at Villa Park, Anfield and in many games, he proved how good he is. He is going to concede goals, that is for sure, but all of us, we are going to try to handle it.\"",
      "On Trafford, the City manager said: \"He is a keeper for Man City. I can only play one keeper, I can play two full-backs, two centre-backs. The season is so long everyone will be involved. They may not believe it but they will.\"",
      "Following the closure of the summer transfer window, United are down to just four academy graduates in their Premier League squad. The Red Devils have had someone from their academy in every first-team matchday squad since 1937, a record that Amorim doesn't want to be responsible for ending.",
      "\"We want to maintain it - I don't want to be the guy that broke that record or that idea,\" Amorim admitted. \"If you see the past of Manchester United, it's built on kids that grew up here and stayed here for a long time. I think that should be our goal in the future so I will try to maintain that, that is for sure.\"",

      "Nicky Butt believes Marcus Rashford's \"ship has sailed\" at Manchester United, claiming that bigger players have left the club before him. Rashford, 27, secured a season-long loan move to Barcelona this summer after being considered surplus to requirements by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The forward fell from grace under the Portuguese tactician shortly after his arrival last November, moving to Aston Villa on loan in February. Upon his return this summer, Rashford appeared to have no prospects at Old Trafford and consequently moved to Barcelona on loan with an option for a £20million permanent transfer.",
      "Numerous supporters will question whether the Red Devils' academy product will return to his childhood club, but Butt believes he has no role with United moving forward. Speaking to the MEN via BetMGM, the 50-year-old said: \"Yeah, I think that ship's sailed.",
      "\"I think over the last two or three seasons he's shown that he needs to move football clubs, and I think that comes. A lot of things have been said about certain behaviours and whatever he's been doing, but not everyone's built to stay at a football club all their lives.",
      "\"It's very few and far between, one-club players within the whole of the Premier League, and it gets on my nerves a little bit. Everyone goes, 'Oh, he wants to leave Man United,' well Man United haven't been performing great. Man United are not winning anything at the minute, they're slipping down the tables of the biggest clubs in the world.",
      "\"My history loves the football club, but nobody has to stay at a football club forever. And yeah, he didn't behave right at certain times, Marcus, we all get that, but he's a phenomenal footballer, and I think he went to Villa, did well, and I think he's now joined a massive football club in Barcelona, and I think it'll work out for him.",
      "\"Man United's part of his history, he'll always love the football club, he's been there since he was seven years of age, I know his family love the football club as well, but life moves on. Big players leave football clubs.",
      "\"Bigger players than Marcus have left Man United, and bigger players will leave the football club in the future as well, and hopefully he'll put Barcelona into Marcus Rashford's history as well, with the shining light on it, and he'll look back on what a great move it's been.\"",
      "Discussing how he expects Rashford to perform at Camp Nou, despite fierce competition from the likes of Raphinha and Lamine Yamal for his spot, Butt added: \"I've just got a sneaky feeling he's just going to blow it away, I really do. Because I've known him since he was seven, eight, nine, he's got such natural ability.",
      "\"And I think when Marcus came onto the scene, a young player, he didn't have any fears, he didn't have anything going on in his head. I remember him making his England debut, he just got the ball and faced up the full-back and runs at them, and his best position is off the left, and he can play up front off the left, and he had no fear, he was doing it all the time.",
      "\"And then he got into the first team and became the star. He was coming and he had loads of hype around him with all the good stuff he was doing off the pitch as well. And I think Marcus was then thinking too much about his game, and I think that's what's killed him. But now going to Barcelona, I've just got a funny feeling that he'll do really well.\"",
      "Rashford aired his views on United's struggles following his exit. He insisted that the Red Devils haven't properly evolved since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013, despite bringing in a string of high-profile managers.",
      "Chatting to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest Is Football, Rashford said: \"At times I feel like United has been...we're hungry to win, so we will always try to adapt and sign players that fit this system, but it's reactionary. If your directions are always changing, you can't expect to win the league.",
      "\"You might win some cup tournaments, but it's because you have a good coach, good players, and you have match winners in your team, you're not there by accident. This is what some people forget. Yeah we have been way lower than what people deem United to be, but if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over the last six months, what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we have been in a transition for years. To be in a transition you need to start a transition. It's like the actual transition has not started yet.\"",
      "Since his move to Barcelona, Rashford has featured in all three of the Catalan giants' La Liga fixtures this campaign. He appeared as a substitute in a 3-0 triumph against Mallorca and a 1-1 draw with Rayo Vallecano, as well as earning a starting berth in a thrilling 3-2 victory over Levante.",
      "The England international will now be hoping to get the nod for Barca's next fixture against Valencia at the Camp Nou on Sunday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "With just one win each from their three league games, an embarrassing cup exit and questions over the make-up of their sides to contend with already this season, Manchester City and Manchester United meet today in a derby with a lot on the line, even if it is only September.",
      "Pep Guardiola's City come into the Etihad Stadium meeting off the back to two successive defeats to Tottenham and Brighton, while Ruben Amorim's Red Devils needed a last-gasp penalty to beat Burnley in their last outing.",
      "Confidence might not be too high heading into the clash then, but how confident are our team about their predictions? Here's what they've had to say:",
      "No matter how bad they are, you can never write United off at the Etihad. I can certainly see them getting a goal but I think City's attack will be too strong for a defence who struggled to defend at home to Burnley.",
      "Erling Haaland is fresh off scoring five for Norway - and it could've been more had he taken the penalty that he won. Injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are also blows for Ruben Amorim, as he might actually have to start his £73.7million striker, Benjamin Sesko.",
      "City have three difficult games over the course of the next eight days but I reckon they'll start off strong with a comfortable win. For Amorim, the pressure will be piled back on. Prediction: Man City 3 Man Utd 1",
      "Remember that goalless derby draw at Old Trafford in April? It won't be as bad as that because nothing really can be ever again, but after two defeats from three games Pep Guardiola will crave control in this one, and that might make it a tough watch.",
      "If Liverpool win at Burnley earlier on Sunday then City would be going into the game nine points off the top already, and they really can't afford to let that gap get any bigger regardless of how early in the season it is.",
      "Ruben Amorim got a smash and grab win at the Etihad last season in one of his first big results at the helm, and he might try and adopt a similar approach and hope that City run out of legs as they did alarmingly at Brighton last time out.",
      "The thing is though, have United got the firepower to take advantage of any City slackness? Without Matheus Cunha I can't really see it, so I'll go for Guardiola's boys to cling on to the three points. Prediction: Man City 1 Man Utd 0",
      "Manchester City have lost their last two Premier League games, but I think they might run riot against United on Sunday. Erling Haaland has looked as sharp as ever and plundered five for Norway on Tuesday. He'll be up against Altay Bayindir and a United defence that was troubled by Grimsby not long ago.",
      "United's balance (or lack of it) in midfield, with Casemiro still possessing plenty the nous that made him one of the best defensive midfielders in the business, but crucially none of the mobility, and Bruno Fernandes, who is at his best as a No.10, is a staggeringly obvious issue that Ruben Amorim continues to ignore.",
      "If Tijjani Reijnders rampages into the box, like he did on debut against Wolves last month, then City can blow United away. Prediction: Man City 3 Man Utd 1",
      "If United were fully fit, I’d still probably back City to win relatively comfortably. So with no Lisandro Martinez, Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot the equation becomes even simpler.",
      "I’ve been burned by United in these predictions time after time, but I’m still going against them. There’s an argument to be made that Altay Bayindir wouldn’t start for any other Premier League team, so the fact he is for United is pretty damning - and could prove the decisive factor.",
      "United under Amorim have produced their best performances when they are allowed to sit in, soak up pressure and break at pace.",
      "Cunha is a brutal miss in that respect, with his ability to travel with the ball from deep and create for those around him.",
      "City have hardly set the world alight either. But I fancy them to settle into one of their long winning runs fairly soon. I'm not anticipating it to be particularly pleasing on the eye for the neutral, but City should have enough quality. Prediction: Man City 2 Man Utd 0",
      "They say that form is temporary and class is permanent. Although Man City's form has been underwhelming for a long time compared to what we're all now used to, the quality they possess is certainly still there. Plus, Man Utd's start to the season is hardly something to get too excited about. Sesko is struggling, Cunha is injured and Amorim has endless goalkeeper issues that are never fixed.",
      "Late win or not, Man Utd celebrating a last-minute win against Burnley like they won the Champions League speaks volumes about where they are at as a club. Prediction: Man City 3 Man Utd 1",

      "Ashley Young snubbed Manchester City and Liverpool in favour of a move to Manchester United. As he was gearing up to depart Aston Villa back in 2011, Young was a sought-after player but joining Sir Alex Ferguson's side was an easy choice for him.",
      "The versatile star transitioned from a dazzling forward at Villa Park to a dependable full-back during his time with United. Young racked up 261 appearances for the Red Devils, clinching the Premier League title and other significant honours before leaving for Inter Milan in January 2020.",
      "Now 40, Young, who recently joined Championship side Ipswich Town, continues to impress despite his advancing years. He is likely to be watching as United and City lock horns in the first Manchester derby of the season on Sunday.",
      "Recalling his move to United amid interest from City and Liverpool, Young told UTD Podcast in 2019: \"My agent called me and said, 'Listen, you're going into the last year of your contract [at Villa], there are a few teams that are in for you.",
      "\"He said Liverpool. We'd already spoken to City. Then he said United had come in. And I said, 'When am I [to] meet Sir Alex [Ferguson]? Where's the pen?' There was no other place I wanted to go.",
      "\"The history of the club, the players that were here, what they'd achieved. For me, that was the place I wanted to be. I wanted to go there and put my marker down on this club and play for the biggest club, for me, in the world. As soon as my agent said that... we didn't even meet Liverpool.\"",
      "The England winger admitted he was starstruck during his first meeting with Sir Alex. He added: \"I always remember the meeting with Sir Alex in London.",
      "\"I think it was probably a two-hour meeting. Ten minutes of that, we spoke about football, the rest was about horses and wine! It was one of them where the boss has just got that aura.",
      "\"He challenged me and said you either sink or swim. That's basically what it is, you're going to be challenged every day. And that's what I wanted. Ultimately, it was down to me to make the decision and as soon as I could sign here, I wanted to sign.\"",
      "Young indeed rose to the challenge, becoming a member of United's last league-winning squad in 2013 and later being appointed as captain by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2019.",
      "Young's first derby was one to forget, as it came during the 6-1 thrashing in 2011. He also enjoyed some success in the fixture, winning four out of 12 matches, including a memorable performance in which he scored once and set up two goals in a 4-2 triumph in 2015.",
      "Two years ago, Young opened up about maintaining a relationship with Ferguson. He told the Telegraph: \"I talk to them all [previous managers]. I won't say the best but the one who has given me the most is 'The Boss', Sir Alex. The one I still talk to most is 'The Boss'.\"",
      "Despite leaving United in 2020, Young's ties to the club are still strong. At Ipswich, he is playing under Kieran McKenna, who was a part of United's first-team coaching staff for five years before taking the reins at the Tractor Boys in December 2021.",

      "Pep Guardiola and Erik ten Hag pursued Ederson and Andre Onana respectively and the motivation was simple - both goalkeepers would evolve the way their manager's wanted to play.",
      "The two tacticians decided after a year at the helm that they needed to upgrade their shotstoppers if they were to achieve what they set out to do. Manchester City's former goalkeeper departed English shores this summer having put himself in the conversation of the Premier League's best ever goalkeepers.",
      "Onana meanwhile leaves in a similarly live debate, discussing who may be the worst goalkeeping investment in England's top flight. Ederson set City back £35million when they signed him from Benfica in 2017.",
      "If players are judged on a value for money basis then few have paid their fee back more than the Brazilian, who immediately did exactly what he said on the tin. He's ball-playing ability immediately evident as he sprayed passes in the same ilk as former team-mate Kevin De Bruyne, all from his own 18 yard box. His exploits being compared to a quarterback such were his vision and accuracy.",
      "Within months Ederson had clips going viral as he controlled balls out of the air in his own half before passing backwards such was his advanced position. His feet were so impressive that when City found themselves in the midst of a penalty-scoring crisis the goalkeeper was touted as a possible solution.",
      "In stark contrast to that Onana was raising his own red flags on debut. The goalkeeper flying out in stoppage time on his first outing with United 1-0 up before clattering into Wolves ' Sasa Kalajdzic. A VAR check somehow saving him - something the PGMOL would later admit was an error.",
      "The mistakes kept on coming as teams found ways to breach United's goal with relative ease. Even if Onana was more capable than David de Gea with his feet, it certainly wasn't worth the fear he had put into his back four. Ten Hag was left to stick by him more through stubbornness than belief.",
      "The then United boss launched a staunch - and questionable - defence of Onana months after his arrival. Ten Hag claiming: \"If you analyse it well then you see he is the second-best goalkeeper in the Premier League.\" This was a Premier League that included Ederson, Alisson and Emi Martinez among his goalkeepers.",
      "City's former shotstopper can boast three successive Golden Gloves on his CV, partly owing to his stellar backline, but equally reflective of the commanding presence he continued to be in between the sticks for an all-conquering City side.",
      "His exit this summer came after eight years with an acceptance that the two parties had done all they could together and City needed to bring in new blood. The Ederson-era in Manchester will go down in the club's history books with Gianluigi Donnarumma his replacement.",
      "Turkey is his new home after making the move to Fenerbahce. And in the Super Lig he will now be joined by Onana himself with the United goalkeeper making a somewhat surprising loan switch to Trabzonspor. Ruben Amorim had shown no desire to move on the Cameroonian, even if he was eyeing a new goalkeeper during the summer.",
      "The Red Devils signed Senne Lammens on deadline day but still very much planned to have Onana as an option. But a route out of Manchester has emerged and, perhaps tellingly, United haven't stood in his way.",
      "A heavyweight club allowing their, apparent, first choice goalkeeper to leave is a move that speaks volumes in itself. Onana's only outing this season saw him make another howler as United were embarrassed by Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "And so he'll call Trabzonspor home for the upcoming season. His debut coming against Fenerbahce as they boast their new goalkeeper, Ederson, who will also be making his first outing.",
      "Two goalkeepers who have called Manchester home now get to enjoy the sunny surroundings provided by the Turkish climate. But there's no doubt that Onana arrives under a cloud. Amorim has not yet faced the media to explain why he let the 29-year-old leave the club.",
      "Faith appeared to be dwindling with Altay Bayindir starting all three Premier League games thus far. The signing of a up and coming goalkeeper is also the furthest thing you can get from a glowing endorsement. But the nature of the loan agreement means Onana will be back in Manchester next year.",
      "So whilst Ederson can embrace his new life in the Super Lig safe in the knowledge he'll go down as a modern day pioneer for how goalkeepers can be used, Onana needs to somehow show that his last two years at United were rogue outliers in his career.",
      "What he's lacked in performance he's made up for in defiance. The ex-Ajax and Inter goalkeeper said in 2023 during his struggles: \"You want to tell me in six months the best goalkeeper in the Champions League last season can become the worst in the world? Nah. Everything is temporary. I know it'll be alright. If not today, it will be tomorrow, if not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.\"",
      "Safe to say, those in Manchester are still waiting for that day to come, and it certainly didn't happen when he said it would.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester City welcomes Manchester United to the Etihad this weekend for the highly anticipated Manchester derby. Recent meetings between these two sides have been entertaining affairs, with both teams scoring in four of the last five encounters and over 2.5 goals being recorded in five of the last six. City have been formidable at home, winning five of their last six league matches at the Etihad, while United have struggled on their travels, failing to win any of their last six away league games and losing four of those.",
      "Erling Haaland enters the derby in red-hot form, having scored five goals in a single game for Norway during the international break, and adding three goals in as many appearances for City so far this season. The Sky Blues, however, have made an uncharacteristically shaky start to their campaign, with one win and two defeats from their opening three matches. After a resounding 4-0 victory at Wolves, City suffered back-to-back losses against Tottenham (0-2) and Brighton (1-2), results that have increased the pressure on Pep Guardiola and his squad.",
      "This is the first time under Guardiola that City have lost two of their opening three league games, and coming off a season without silverware in 2024-25, there is mounting pressure on the Catalan manager, who could be entering his final season at the club. Nevertheless, City will take confidence from United’s own struggles and will be optimistic about securing all three points in front of their home fans.",
      "Guardiola will be hopeful that Phil Foden can recover from a foot injury in time for the derby, but Omar Marmoush, Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Josko Gvardiol, and Mateo Kovacic are all expected to miss out, while John Stones faces a late fitness test.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, come into this fixture with a record of one win, one draw, and one loss from their first three games. New manager Ruben Amorim is already under significant pressure, as his side have exhibited many of the same weaknesses that contributed to last season’s disappointing league finish. United’s campaign began with a 0-1 defeat to Arsenal, followed by a 1-1 draw with Fulham and a narrow 3-2 win over Burnley before the international break. While there have been occasional signs of improvement, United remain vulnerable, and Amorim is still searching for the right formula with his team selections and tactics.",
      "For this match, United will be without new signing Matheus Cunha, a significant blow to their attacking options, while Mason Mount remains a doubt and could also miss out. United will need several players who have yet to make a real impact to step up if they are to come away with a result.",
      "All signs point to another difficult afternoon for United, and we expect City to take advantage of their rivals’ struggles and add further pressure on Amorim with a home victory.",

      "It's derby day in Manchester, with Ruben Amorim taking his side to the Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City on Sunday. It's a huge game for Manchester United, who are yet to click into gear this season.",
      "Altay Bayindir will start in goal for United, with Andre Onana having left on loan for Trabzonspor and £18.2million arrival Senne Lammens deemed not ready by Amorim. There could be a new goalkeeper for Manchester City, though, with Gianluigi Donnarumma having arrived from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "United picked up their first win of the season before the two-week international break, beating Burnley 3-2. But those three points came at a cost, with Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount picking up injuries. They will sit out of the City match, with Diogo Dalot also out injured.",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes has once again been forced to defend himself over criticism about his style of leadership. The 31-year-old has been targeted for his emotional approach on the pitch, but he says he won't change.",
      "“People have an opinion about me and I can't change that,” said Fernandes. “It's the way people want to judge you about what they see on most of the people, what they see on the pitch, some of them, what they see on the television, some of them what they see on interviews.",
      "“You know, I can't change that. They have the freedom to think the way they want about me, as I have the same freedom to think about them. But what I don't do is I don't judge people until I know them. They can. They can have an opinion about me and that's fine.\"",
      "Manchester City could attempt to exploit Bayindir's weakness from crosses and set pieces in the derby on Sunday afternoon according to Craig Burley.",
      "“With Bayindir, every set-piece I’m putting Haaland and every centre half on him and just swinging it under the crossbar for fun,” Burley told ESPN. “Hell, if Man City have got someone who takes long throws, I’m throwing it in Rory Delap style. I’m just piling it into the box because he’s absolutely hopeless at coming out and dealing with aerial balls – he’s shown that.”",
      "Amorim is confident that Bayindir is up to the task. He said: “We are in the moment that the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience but we also have to look at the present with a focus on the future so it is a bit of both. He will be ready.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko has struggled to make an impact in a Manchester United shirt so far. But Rene Aufhaser, a coach who worked with Sesko and Erling Haaland at Red Bull Salzburg, has backed him to come good.",
      "\"He will develop in the next one and two years, I'm sure. Erling reached his mark after his transfer from Dortmund to Man City and we will see. I am quite sure Benji will reach this mark after one or two years. But, of course, Erling is the top. He has 10 out of 10 from me.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has warned Kobbie Mainoo he must improve and show more fight if he wants to be a regular starter for Manchester United.",
      "Mainoo has not started a Premier League game for United this season and asked to go out on loan before deadline day due to a lack of playing time, a request that was rejected.",
      "Midfielder Mainoo was left out of Thomas Tuchel's latest England squad due to his lack of game time, with the 20-year-old worried he could miss out on next year's World Cup in the USA.",
      "But Amorim warned Mainoo – who is in contention to start today's Manchester derby because of injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha – he needs to get better to win back his place.",
      "“I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that he is already done [the finished article],” said Amorim. “I think he can do so much better, he can improve a lot.",
      "“For some guys it [talent] is enough, but for him it's not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "“If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he's going to play and I've proved that already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot. He's a top, top player, but he can be so much better.”",
      "Mainoo scored United's winner in last year's 2-1 FA Cup final win over City at Wembley and started for England in their Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain by the same scoreline seven weeks later.",
      "Despite such a meteoric rise for club and country, Mainoo's progress has stalled under Amorim, who told the Stockport-born player it is up to him to prove the United boss wrong.",
      "“Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach,” said Amorim. “I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolves. Nowadays, you can see that Vitinha is maybe the best midfielder in the world.",
      "“The way I play is completely different from the last manager. I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal and you could feel the United team was really transitional.",
      "“Kobbie was the only guy who calmed the game down. Now we have other players who can calm the game down. We play a different game and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie - and I know he can give that.",
      "“I know that he started the final of the European Championships in a team that has a lot of talented players. Phil Foden played in that game, Cole Palmer was on the bench and Kobbie was playing. I know all that, but sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.",
      "“Kobbie is really good at controlling the game, but if he plays as an eight, he has to reach the box, then return and sometimes he has to cover a lot of space with just two [midfielders]. Bruno is doing that job and then sometimes it's just bad luck.",
      "“Bruno is the more influential player in the last few years and he’s been playing in that position. Kobbie could play as a six [a defensive midfielder], but sometimes he passes the ball and goes away, so we have to balance everything.",
      "“He has the technical ability, but he needs more pace. He needs to understand the position better. He needs to play at different speeds. Sometimes it's slower. Sometimes it's faster and I think he can improve on that.",
      "“Then he has to beat Bruno. He has to beat Casemiro. He has to beat Manuel Ugarte. They are also good players and so I need to choose.”",

      "Even in difficult moments in recent years, United have shown themselves capable of springing a derby day surprise and that’s left Guardiola wary - especially with their cross town rivals currently above them in the League table.",
      "Said Guardiola: “It always is (dangerous) against United. United is United - they have good players just look at what they spend in the last decade.",
      "“They can beat us, of course. Do we want to be beaten tomorrow? No, because we need the points, we need to break the rhythm of two defeats.",
      "“But I don’t worry about what happened in the past. It hurts because we wanted those points to help us win trophies or be there at the end. Of course it is a special game for the fans and we will try to do it, yeah.”",
      "Despite Manchester City’s Premier League dominance during Guardiola’s nine year reign, United have won four times at The Etihad while the Spaniard has been in charge.",
      "The last time was in December when United winger Amad scored a 90th minute winner to stun Guardiola and his men on their own turf just 22 days after Ruben Amorim took over.",
      "Amorim then helped guide his stars to a goalless Old Trafford draw to take four points from City and leave Guardiola still waiting for his first Premier League win over United’s new boss.",

      "The Italian is a very different keeper to Ederson, who has been between the sticks for all of Guardiola's successes in Manchester. But Guardiola has insisted he won't ask Donnarumma to replicate the Brazilian's incredible ability with the ball at his feet.",
      "\"Always I try to adapt the quality of the players. I would not demand to Gigi to do something he’s uncomfortable with,\" said Guardiola.",
      "\"We are talking about one the best players I have seen in distribution, in short and long, I have seen with Ederson. We didn't take Gigi to do what Ederson has done. Gigi has another quality.",
      "\"You're talking about the wingers that we had in the past, for example, Riyad, Raheem or Leroy, it's completely different than the wingers that we have now.\"",

      "Lammens hasn’t gone in goal yet for the warm ups. He fired a saveable shot at Bayindir that the Turk got a hand to and it still went in the bottom corner. Lammens is actually wearing the same top as the goalkeeping coaches. Heaton and Bayindir are in players’ training tops.",
      "Tom Heaton was quite vocal in the goalkeeping department’s huddle just before the warm up. All three goalies are out there, along with coaches Jorge Vital and Craig Mawson. There are certain to be pieces filed on the goalkeeper situation at both clubs from today’s game unless it is another drab draw.",
      "Ugarte starting",
      "“I think it is a team that changes a lot, the position. We need to have a guy who is more light in the movements, the way he can press is really strong. I don't know but we want to play Bruno [Fernandes] on one side, but I don't know which side we need to press higher with a midfielder. Maybe, with Case [Casemiro] or Kobbie [Mainoo]. I think we would struggle a little bit with that and Manu can give us that but, tactical, it was to choose Manu.”",
      "My thinking on our set-up",
      "“We need more like a winger inside, playing inside, than an extra midfielder. That is my feeling. I think we are going to have more space behind. Amad playing in the national team, I saw during the week, and a lot of games he played as a no.10 in Sunderland. He played for the national team on the left so he could start on the left. We can change also, so we will see during the game.”",
      "We have a responsibility to win games",
      "“I think a little bit, it's the responsibility. We need to recover that. We need to win every game and when we have this responsibility of winning games, sometimes we struggle a little bit. When you see the last games during this season, if you take Grimsby [out], you can feel like we maintain the consistency, improving in every aspect of the game. Of course, we have to score more goals as we have a lot of opportunities, and we need to do better in set-pieces. But you can see, even this week, it is a league of set-pieces to open the game. We need to be careful. We are going to play against a very good team.”",
      "More two keepers on the bench nonsense from Amorim. Ten Hag did it a few times, too. The Premier League should insert a law preventing it as it is totally uncalled for when a younger lad, remote chance though it may be, could come in and make a name for himself.",
      "There was a glimmer in Amorim’s eye when he hinted Sesko would make his full Premier League debut today. The suspicion was Sesko would start and this fixture is a huge opportunity to kickstart his time at United. There is no better fixture than the derby to score your first goal for the club.",
      "Seven of United’s starters are defensive players. An allowance can be made at a team like City, even if their fear factor has gone, though the choice of wingers - two full backs - is not in keeping with United’s ethos. They are pragmatic picks.",
      "Mazraoui impressed last season and he is a fine squad player over the course of nine months. United fans should not expect too much of him in an attacking capacity. Dorgu, like Ugarte, was also hooked at half-time against Grimsby and has failed to maintain his fine pre-season form.",
      "City have two Mancunians in their starting XI. United have two on the bench. That will smart for some United fans. In the final derby at Maine Road in 2002, City did not have a single Englishman in their line-up. The Nevilles, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs (practically an adopted Mancunian) were in the United XI.",
      "I did mention Ugarte in a cursory manner earlier. There is method to Amorim’s call there but it also feels rather contrary. He suggested two days ago some of us journalists believe Mainoo is the finished article (we don’t) and it feels like he is refusing to bend to our will. We are not willing him to start Mainoo, who has been out of form for a year, but his inclusion today felt logical. To not start Mainoo and start Sesko and Ugarte is telling. Sometimes a manager has to look after himself but the Mainoo issue is going to rumble on and on.",
      "Ugarte has done decently in some big games for United but his recall is not exactly deserved after his first-half horror show at Grimsby less than three weeks ago.",
      "It’s a big bonus to City to have Foden back. He’s started just 20 of City’s 41 Premier League games since scoring twice against West Ham to win the title. There is a real lack of goals in this squad beyond Haaland and Guardiola spoke on Friday of how City miss Foden in the final third. He could have a big role to play today.",
      "City’s big call goes the away of the big goalkeeper (who is actually an inch shorter than James Trafford). Donnarumma had to start really after his £26million deadline day move. An interesting decision to go with neither Lewis or Nunes at right-back. Khusanov looks like he will play there, and presumably it is O’Reilly at left-back, with Gvardiol next to Dias.",
      "XI | Donnarumma, Khusanov, Dias, Gvardiol, O’Reilly, Rodri, Reijnders, Silva, Foden, Doku, Haaland.",
      "Subs | Trafford, Ake, Nunes, Lewis, Mfuni, Gonzalez, Bobb, Musaka, Savinho.",
      "XI | Bayindir, Mazraoui, De Ligt, Yoro, Dorgu, Shaw, Ugarte, Fernandes, Amad, Mbeumo, Sesko.",
      "There are a few interesting selection decisions facing Guardiola today, but when the teamsheet lands eyes will be drawn to the top, and not just because that’s an obvious place to start. Will Donnarumma make his debut in goal, or will he stick with Trafford for now? Although Guardiola refused to confirm on Friday, the smart money was on Donnarumma after the way Guardiola spoke in his press conference. It’s going to make for a fascinating transition from Ederson to the Italian No. 1, but what he can’t do with his feet, the 26-year-old more than makes up for with some huge saves.",
      "City’s squad trained at the Etihad yesterday, which is a rare and unusual move, although there is never going to be any concern about the pitch at this stage of the season. It might have helped some of the new signings familiarise themselves with the place. It was a disappointing start to the season at home when Spurs won 2-0 and City were really flat in that game, especially in the second half, so Guardiola will hope Saturday’s training session can help them today.",
      "We'll have the confirmed starting teams in 10 minutes.",
      "In the March 2016 derby, Wayne Rooney travelled across town even though he was injured and gave a pre-match speech. United won 1-0 - the Marcus Rashford derby when he skinned Martin Demichelis.",
      "Unavailable players have been present for Etihad derbies in the recent past. Paul Pogba in 2018 springs to mind. Patrick Dorgu did the pre-match chat, so he’s starting.",
      "The following players have arrived at the Etihad:",
      "Fernandes, Maguire, De Ligt, Zirkzee, Bayindir, Lammens, Mainoo, Heaven, Heaton, Mazraoui, Sesko, Fredricson, Yoro, Dorgu, Leon, Amad, Ugarte, Martinez, Shaw, Mount, Casemiro, Cunha, Mee, Mbeumo.",
      "That doesn't mean Cunha, Mount and Martinez will be in the squad, though.",
      "The full squad news will be confirmed at 3.15pm.",
      "Donnarumma was one of the first off the City bus and Trafford one of the last.",
      "So read into that what you will. We could tell from Onana’s body language at Fulham that he would be staying on the bench that day.",
      "City players spotted arriving:",
      "Rodri, Donnarumma, Dias, Nunes, Lewis, Khusanoz, Bobb, Ake, O’Reilly, Foden, Savinho, Gvardiol, Reijnders, Doku, Trafford, Haaland, Ait Nouri, Gonzalez.",
      "United’s kit men and their outgoing analyst, Paul Brand, have been out for their pre-match prep. Amorim referenced the “different ball” goalkeepers have to deal with in the Premier League. Any ball that heads in Bayindir’s direction could go past him and the conditions today are particularly tricky for goalies.",
      "City have two No.1s and could have the best goalkeeper in the world between the sticks. United have two No.2s. The most important positions in a team are in goal and up front and there are still question marks about both at United.",
      "United have sent their heartfelt condolences.",
      "Ricky Hatton has sadly passed away.",
      "Amorim will be without Cunha, Mount and Dalot this afternoon. At least two of those players would have been starters. It felt like only a matter of time before Cunha scored his first goal for the club, so it was a huge shame to see him go off with an injury against Burnley before the international break. Mount has started each Premier League game down the middle this season. Amorim has said United need Cunha and Mount to be \"competitive.\"",
      "Mainoo and Sesko would be logical starters today but you can’t be certain both will. It would create more of a fuss around Mainoo, who was mentioned repeatedly at Amorim’s Friday press conference, if he is on the bench again despite the absence of Mount and Cunha.",
      "Amorim also admitted he didn’t know if United had the right midfield partner for Mainoo. He has excelled next to Casemiro but his axis with Ugarte has been anything but a success. It would cause ructions if Ugarte somehow started ahead of Mainoo today.",
      "City will pay tribute to boxer Ricky Hatton ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby after he was found dead on Sunday morning at the age of 46.",
      "There will be a minute's applause before kick-off as the Etihad pays its respects to the former world champion and lifelong Blue, who never hid his affection and support for City.",
      "Both sets of players will also wear black armbands as the stadium remembers one of Manchester's greatest sportsmen.",
      "The Hitman was a two-weight world champion and had a devoted following of fans as one of the best and most charismatic fighters this country has ever produced.",
      "A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: \"Officers were called by a member of the public to attend Bowlacre Road, Hyde, Tameside, at 6:45am today where they found the body of a 46-year-old man.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "We are still waiting for City to confirm any planned tributes to Ricky Hatton today, but it is sure to be an emotional occasion before kick-off. The 46-year-old never hid his affection for City but he was a legend across Manchester as well, as one of the most successful and charismatic boxers this country has ever produced. There will be plenty of fans in the home end and the away end who have been to Hatton fights. He was an everyman who inspired a devoted following and nowhere was that more the case than in Manchester.",
      "Non-stop rain on the walk from the CFA to the Etihad, so we are graced with the appropriate derby weather.",
      "The outcome of today shouldn’t surprise anyone. You could see United beating City or City battering United. The build-up for these games has subsided in recent years, with the odd exception of the back-to-back FA Cup finals, and there is a danger that both clubs could be considered Premier League also rans before the clocks have gone back.",
      "For United, it will be curious to see if they continue without Benjamin Sesko or start him. The injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount give Amorim the chance but United have actually looked quite promising in their strikerless formation, albeit they have scored one goal from open play in 270 minutes."

      "Amorim signed Senne Lammens on transfer deadline day and Andre Onana has been shipped out to Trabzonspor on loan. Altay Bayindir has started the campaign as United's first choice goalkeeper and Amorim has confirmed he will start the Manchester derby.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount, Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez are unavailable due to injury.",
      "This is how our writers think United should line up:",
      "Bayindir is starting but Tom Heaton would be the most dependable option. Sticking with the same back three would be advisable, given how decently Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have done. Patrick Dorgu comes back in to provide balance, with Amad on the right.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has thrived next to Casemiro in the past and they would be the logical partnership, given the alternative is Manuel Ugarte. United have played well without starting Benjamin Sesko but he has to come into the team at some stage and there are two significant absences in the attack. That said, a triumvirate of Mainoo, Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes could function more fluently.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Amorim has confirmed Bayindir will start, but he is an accident waiting to happen and I'd throw Lammens in at the deep end. Although there is logic in protecting Lammens by naming him on the bench, there is no better place to start than the Manchester derby to deliver a strong debut performance.",
      "Cunha and Mount have been ruled out, which means there needs to be a reshuffle. I'd start Casemiro and Mainoo in the midfield pivot and push Fernandes to the left side of the attack.",
      "Amorim had a twinkle in his eye when he discussed Sesko potentially making his first league start at his press conference on Friday. Sesko is the only choice to lead the attack this weekend because Joshua Zirkzee is not a goalscorer.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has hinted Benjamin Sesko could start against Manchester City.",
      "Sesko completed a €76.5million (£66.4m), plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons, move to Old Trafford before the start of the Premier League season.",
      "Amorim decided to name Sesko on the bench for the opening league game against Arsenal, and the 22-year-old has made further substitute appearances against Fulham and Burnley.",
      "Sesko was given his first start against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, but he has not started in the Premier League. Amorim was asked for his verdict on Sesko at his press conference on Friday afternoon and hinted the young striker could be given his first league start in the Manchester derby.",
      "\"I think what’s more important than looking at exactly what he did during the games, is what he can bring to our team,\" said Amorim of Sesko's first few weeks at the club.",
      "\"If you see against Burnley, he had some movements – especially inside the box – that we don't have with Josh (Zirkzee), or with (Matheus) Cunha, and even with Rasmus (Hojlund) in the past. We have a guy (in Sesko) who really likes to go inside the box to have a header.",
      "\"He can run – we need to use him more as a runner – and he’s going to improve. So we need to get used to that. It feels like the pace is different and he is going to get used to that. But maybe against City, it is a good moment for him to start the game.\"",
      "Amorim has started Mason Mount down the middle in the Premier League this season, but Mount picked up an injury against Burnley and has been ruled out of the Manchester derby.",
      "United won 2-1 at the Etihad last season thanks to Amad's heroics in the game's final minutes. \"I don't know,\" said Amorim when asked whether the win backfired by raising expectations.",
      "\"It's hard to point to a game last year that was a backfire. We had so many moments like that. We just focus on the future. We have four points. I think we should have more in this moment, but we need to be really competitive.",
      "\"It’s a very important game for everybody here, but especially for our fans, so we will try to do our best.\"",
      "When asked about potentially having more pressure on him than Pep Guardiola, Amorim responded: \"No, you cannot compare. The guy (Guardiola) is winning all the time. He can relax in not winning anymore.",
      "\"I have to prove myself every day here and I feel that. So I'm really comfortable with that and I think that every day that I come here, that I have to do better. To compare me with the situation of Guardiola? Is just a joke (laughs).",
      "\"I think we have bigger problems. We continue to have bigger problems, but we are addressing everything. And sometimes we are frustrated, angry… but we are facing all the problems.",
      "\"And we are trying to improve. And I see the team playing so much better now. We just need to be more clinical, to win more games and things are going to get easier.\"",

      "Amorim was appointed from Sporting Lisbon in November, but he has yet to win successive games in the Premier League. That is no surprise given how dismal last season was, but it's an unwanted record.",
      "United were excellent in the first half against Burnley before the international break and could have been 3-0 up by half-time. The Reds were wasteful in front of goal and allowed Burnley back into the game.",

      "United to hammer title hopes?",
      "It would be foolish to suggest City won't win the Premier League if they lose on Sunday, but the last time City lost three of their first four top-flight games was in 1995/96 under Alan Ball.",
      "That campaign ended in relegation. That won't happen this season, but defeat in the derby could see them fall nine points behind Liverpool.",
      "That is added motivation for United this weekend. Dishing out an early blow to City's hopes of winning the league would make a win even sweeter, and City's supporters have been notably edgy in the build-up to the game.",
      "Local representation",
      "There could be no Mancunians starting in the Manchester derby. There were no local United players in the team when the two sides met at Old Trafford in April, which was the first time in a decade that was the case.",
      "Altay Bayindir will start in goal with Tom Heaton potentially not even in the squad. Kobbie Mainoo has failed to cement his place in the starting XI under Amorim but there's hope he could start tomorrow.",

      "Manchester United's stunning win in the 2024 FA Cup final was made sweeter by the goalscorers at Wembley.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo were developed in the club's academy, and the pair contributed heavily to a truly great United performance.",
      "It meant more to see academy graduates topple rivals Manchester City.",
      "Mainoo's matchwinner was particularly special given his Stockport roots. Erik ten Hag had entrusted Mainoo with first-team opportunities and the midfielder grabbed his chance with both hands.",
      "Ten Hag described Mainoo as the \"perfect midfielder\". Gareth Southgate said England \"haven't really had a player like him until now\". Mainoo started for England in the Euro 2024 final against Spain.",
      "Just 14 months later, Mainoo is out of favour at United and was left out of England's squad for the September international break. There are concerns about where Mainoo fits into Ruben Amorim's system and Thomas Tuchel has explained he needs minutes to feature in his England plans.",
      "Mainoo requested to leave United on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window and fans questioned why such a talented young player felt he needed a change of scenery.",
      "Amorim has challenged Mainoo to fight for his place in his starting team, but eyebrows were raised when United's head coach said Mainoo is competing with Bruno Fernandes to start.",
      "The next few months will be pivotal for Mainoo. The 20-year-old is suddenly at a crossroads in his career and wants to feature at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Mainoo was a talking point at Amorim's press conference ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday.",
      "\"No, like a lot of guys, he wants to play more,\" said Amorim when asked whether he'd seen a difference in Mainoo. \"I didn’t have a conversation with him before the window closed - I did this week.",
      "\"Because I don't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having any conversation with him just to hold on to him. I don't want that feeling. I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "\"I think for some guys it is enough (their talent), but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie Mainoo, and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "\"If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he is going to play. And that I proved already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot... I have the same thing that you have: that he is a top, top player, but he can be so much better. So I'm focused on that.\"",
      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League so far this season. Amorim said: \"You have to imagine… Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach. I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton.",
      "\"Then nowadays, you can see that Vitinha – maybe – is the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes. The way I play is completely different from the last manager.",
      "\"Sometimes, I look at Kobbie Mainoo and I feel that sometimes he was like – and I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal – and you can feel that the Manchester United team was really transitional.",
      "\"He was the only guy who calmed down the game. Now we have other players who can calm down the game. We play a different game, and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"And I know that he can give that. So sometimes, like you said, maybe if I start more Kobbie Mainoo, then he is going to play and he's going to get hard to take out. Sometimes it's not fair, but I need to go with what I'm feeling in the moment, and that is the only feeling.",
      "\"I know that he started the final of the European Championship in one team that has a lot of talented players. (Phil) Foden played in that game. (Cole) Palmer was on the bench. He (Mainoo) was playing… I know all that. But sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he could clarify the \"most important things\" that he looks for in a midfielder. \"Everything. Sometimes, it's the balance in the midfield,\" he responded.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo is really good at controlling the game, but if he plays as an eight, he has to reach the box, returning (tracking back), and sometimes he has to cover a lot of space with just two.",
      "\"Bruno is doing that job. And then sometimes it's bad luck. Bruno is maybe the more influential player in the last few years, and he’s been playing in that position. Kobbie Mainoo could play as a six (a defensive midfielder), but sometimes he passes the ball and goes away and it's not a reference as a six, so we have to balance everything.",
      "\"I think he needs to have the technical ability that he has, but he needs more pace. He needs to understand the position better. He needs to play in different speeds. Sometimes it's lower.",
      "\"Sometimes it's faster, and I think he can improve on that. And then he has to beat Bruno. He has to beat Casemiro. He has to beat Manu (Ugarte). They are good players, also. So I need to choose.\"",

      "\"It depends on the opposition. It depends on set pieces sometimes. All these things matter when you choose the team. Kobbie Mainoo is a very, very good player, but so is Bruno. So okay, I could put Bruno on the side, or I can push him up, but then I have to take Cunha (out).",

      "The Blues trailed 1-0 at the interval following a superb strike from Kevin Schade but appeared destined to return to Stamford Bridge with maximum points and local pride intact after strikes from Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo, with the latter firing home a thunderbolt from the edge of the area in the 85th minute.",
      "However, the unmarked Carvalho emerged in the dying moments to poke home a leveller and deflate the Blues' hopes following a lengthy throw-in.",
      "\"What happens as it develops is this is the key battle. Garnacho has a job to do, he's got to mark Carvalho,\" Redknapp explained, identifying the winger and Carvalho on screen.",
      "\"That's your job. Simple as that. Don't lose him, you're now one of the defensive players in here. If he gets in behind you, it's on you.",
      "\"Everybody else is trying to win that first contact; it's not easy, Brentford have got some big guys. But Garnacho just falls asleep at the vital moment. Ball comes in, Garnacho's not concentrating, they get that contact and there [Carvalho] is at the back post.\"",
      "Garnacho switched to Chelsea from Manchester United in a £40million transfer and had previously celebrated his debut appearance in a Blues jersey by setting up Caicedo for his stunning late strike.",
      "When Enzo Maresca was questioned about whether he believed his team had done sufficient to secure victory, he responded to journalists: \"I think so, yeah. I think in the second half, we scored twice.",
      "\"We could have scored two or three more goals. Cole had a chance, Pedro [Neto] had a chance. So I think we did enough. Unfortunately, we lost two points just in the last two or three minutes.\"",

      "After signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, United have chosen to move captain Bruno Fernandes deeper meaning Mainoo is now in direct competition with the Portuguese playmaker for that position. The Englishman's only start this season came in the Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby Town and soon afterwards he requested a loan spell away from the club.",

      "Unsurprisingly, Mainoo is a popular figure among the fanbase and many fans would have had their hearts in their mouths when they saw that the midfielder was not included in Amorim's squad list for the remainder of the campaign.

      "Former Manchester United full-back Paul Parker has raised fears over a relegation battle at Old Trafford this season ahead of Sunday's derby.",
      "Ruben Amorim's team have looked better in patches throughout the early stages of the 2025/26 campaign - but have just one win from four matches. The Reds' problems were highlighted in their catastrophic League Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town in August.",
      "United somewhat recovered with a hard-fought win over Burnley before the international break, but they needed a Bruno Fernandes penalty in stoppage time to secure all three points. Attention now turns to the derby at Manchester City on Sunday afternoon (4:30pm kick-off UK time).",
      "And Parker, who won two Premier League titles at M16 in the 1990's, has raised concerns over several issues at United under Amorim. He begins with their handling of Andre Onana - who left to join Trabzonspor on loan earlier this week.",
      "\"It was something that could have been done a lot earlier. The start of the season, with everyone knowing that he just wasn't good enough to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"Then he's given his first game in that disastrous evening at Grimsby, that's where it just carried on from where it left off the previous season, and now it's got to the point of them letting him go now, already into a season.",
      "\"I think we have to say that maybe one of the reasons they wanted him to go was that things were pretty sour while he was around, and when you're trying to move forward, and you've got a young goalkeeper, which you brought in place of him, you've got an experienced goalkeeper who isn't gonna help.",
      "\"You have to get them out of the way because they're just gonna cause problems. It's good that United have managed to get him out, but it's far, far too late.\"",
      "Amorim has confirmed that Altay Bayindir will start on Sunday. Parker, however, believes new Reds keeper Senne Lammens should be given the gloves at the Etihad Stadium this weekend.",
      "\"Well, given everything, I think you've got to start him,\" Parker insists. \"If you put Bayindir in goal, where's his head at?",
      "\"I was having kittens in that Fulham game watching him play. I mean, that was terrible, and all of a sudden you made Fulham look like prime Arsenal with their coolness. I think you've got to start the new keeper.\"",
      "On Amorim and what United can achieve - Parker insists that Europe has to be the objective, but raises fears over a potential relegation battle.",
      "\"They need to get their credibility back,\" he said. \"They've got to finish in the top half of the table.",

      "\"I'm sure that there were a lot of people laughing at the Cup Winners' Cup at one point. No one was laughing after Man United won it in 1991. Everything was then about the European Cup.",
      "\"But these competitions need big clubs, they need big players, they need big managers to play in it, and if United were to qualify for it, that means they've shifted up in their position last season.

They've got something about them, more than what the other three did, so you can't can't let your standards drop.

      "Ruben Amorim has promised to prolong Manchester United's record of including an academy player in every first team matchday squad dating back to October 1937.",
      "United only have four academy members in their current first team squad following the sale of Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea. Tom Heaton, 39, has not played since February 2023, Tyler Fredricson is likely to struggle for playing time after his first-half performance in the League Cup defeat at Grimsby Town, Kobbie Mainoo has started in 16 of Amorim's 46 matches in charge and 17-year-old striker Chido Obi is yet to be included in a matchday squad this term.",
      "Mainoo, 20, wanted to leave on loan last month but was blocked by the club amid a shortage of specialist midfielders. The Mancunian scored the winner in the 2024 FA Cup final against Manchester City and could start in Sunday's derby at the Etihad in the absence of injured duo Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The derby will mark the 4,326th consecutive United match with an academy player in their squad. \"I don't want to be the guy that broke that record,\" Amorim stressed. \"If you see the past of Manchester United, it's built on kids that grew up here and stayed here for a long time. I think that should be our goal in the future. So I will try to maintain that.\"",
      "United were unbeaten against City across three derbies last season and won at the Etihad in Amorim's seventh match in charge through two late goals.",
      "City suffered their first trophyless season since Pep Guardiola's first at the club in 2016-17 and dropped to third in the table, having won four successive Premier League titles. They have spent more than £300m on signings this calendar year but have lost two of their first three league games and head into the derby below United.",
      "\"It's a top team with the best coach in the league,\" Amorim added. \"A team that is really hard to imagine how they are going to play.",
      "\"They change all the time. But we are prepared for that.",
      "\"And we believe in our team. And I have that feeling. So it will be a very good game. We know what to do, we have one more training. The table, in the moment, it doesn't matter. I'm just worried about maintaining the same principles. The way we fight for every ball. The small details that sometimes we drop a little bit. Not in these games.",
      "\"So I'm more comfortable in these kinds of games. But we will be ready against a very, very good team.\"",
      "Amorim is convinced United have improved since they defeated City nine months ago. \"I think we are a better team. Any aspect, if you see the data, we are a different team. We are ready to play the game. But we have to show onside. So I think we are a better team.\"",
      "Amorim's close friend, Hugo Viana, is now the City sporting director. Viana and Amorim worked together at Sporting and the prospect of a reunion at the Etihad was floated before United hired Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag in October.",
      "Viana and Amorim still socialise but their friendship will have no bearing on the weekend's game. \"No, it has no influence. We have different jobs, we have different clubs. We have dinner all the time and don't talk about football.",
      "\"I'm red, he's blue. But we are really, really close friends. That will not change. So I hope to win Sunday and that's it.\"",

      "Whilst strolling through the quaint streets of Lyon hours before Manchester United’s Europa League quarter-final, a WhatsApp voice note arrived from a contact. It contained an instruction.",
      "In the event that United won, this correspondent was advised to get Andre Onana’s attention in the mixed zone by addressing him with a specific phrase in Italian. Onana would then stop to chat and do something “funny” to defuse the fallout from his pre-match comments that United were “way better” than Lyon. Onana’s own brand of comedy was reserved for his performance that evening.",
      "There were two more errors, the second an added-time fumble that invited Rayan Cherki to equalise. Before kick-off at the Groupama Stadium, Onana, iPhone headphones on, casually strolled over to one of the goal frames to check that they were stable. They were. He wasn’t.",
      "Officials at United were unhappy about the “way better” quip that Onana uttered to four of us in the makeshift mixed zone at Old Trafford, the only memorable event from a dour derby. Onana’s delivery was not disparaging yet it elicited a withering response from Nemanja Matic at the pre-match press conference.",
      "“If you are one of the worst 'keepers in Manchester United history, you need to take care,\" Matic warned. \"If David de Gea, Peter Schmeichel or Edwin van der Sar said that, I would question myself.",
      "\"But if, statistically, you are one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's modern history, he needs to show that before he says.\"",
      "Onana never truly recovered from that week. The public ridicule preceded his withdrawal from the weekend shellacking by Newcastle United. Ruben Amorim took him out of the firing line and has now effectively fired him. His exit route to Turkey signals career decline at 29, a premature age for a goalkeeper.",
      "A montage of Onana’s ‘mistakes’ has gained 2.2 million views online. Some additions are unfair and some glaring errors are also conspicuous by their absence. In 102 appearances, Onana comfortably conceded at least two dozen saveable or avoidable goals, depending on the slack you cut a ‘keeper.",
      "A quirk of his second sorry season is that it was going well until Amorim arrived. No memorable cock-ups, important saves in key games at Southampton and Porto and a save of the season contender at Crystal Palace. The regression was instigated by Arsenal and their set pieces three days before Morgan Gibbs-White’s pot-shot unfathomably flummoxed Onana.",
      "Senior figures at United were downplaying a goalkeeping addition in the final weeks of last season. The priority was the attack and people at the club liked Onana’s character. Us journalists can attest to this.",
      "On a chilly evening at the City Ground, Onana was warm company as he admitted how trying his first six months in Manchester had been off the pitch. He is a bullish and candid conversationalist befitting a United goalie. He could talk the talk but not walk the walk.",
      "Onana was under the impression he was safe on account of his warm rapport with Amorim. Perhaps Amorim lulled him into a false sense of security. Onana had a tight bond with Erik ten Hag and was never going to be as close with Amorim, who has leant heavily on fellow Portuguese speakers Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Casemiro and now Matheus Cunha. Ultimately, their working relationship was moot as Onana continued to err.",
      "Historically, United have had to bide their time when it comes to replacing an incumbent number one. De Gea was released after weeks of indecision. Tim Howard, Fabien Barthez and Mark Bosnich had ceased to be the first choice by the time they were jettisoned. Alex Stepney had a second lease of life after Wilf McGuinness was sacked with the reappointment of Sir Matt Busby. Onana is not halfway through a five-year contract and his escape routes were reduced to Turkey or Saudi Arabia.",
      "He has not even moved to one of Turkey's eminent clubs. Jose Mourinho, an admirer of Onana’s, had no intention of moving for Onana before he was dismissed by Fenerbahce, who opted for the other phased-out goalie from Manchester in Ederson. Galatasaray were also keen on the Brazilian.",
      "Not for the first time, United have botched a succession plan in goal. Onana represented a more modern goalie than De Gea yet his once-famed distribution deserted him last season.",
      "United have settled for, or rather saddled with, Altay Bayindir. The consensus at United is the club is \"too demanding\" for a goalie who warmed the bench for Turkey during their World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "Come Onana's last final appearance at Blundell Park, he was booed. United matchgoers became regularly irked by his delayed restarts at goal kicks last season, their mood not helped by Onana occasionally urging them to relax.",
      "This jarred with his pre-season promise: \"I will take a lot of risks. I can tell you in advance already!\" he chuckled to a few of us pitchside at UCLA. \"Be prepared because it’s gonna be this season, trust me! I will enjoy it even more when this season starts.\"",
      "A few weeks after the aborted ‘funny’ in Lyon, United were revelling in one of their most accomplished European away victories of the last decade in Bilbao. Onana strolled past me in the San Mames mixed zone and offered a knowing wink.",
      "He sometimes kept goal as if one eye was permanently closed.",

      "Although Mather's contract at Old Trafford expires in the summer of 2027, there is hunger on the player's behalf for regular starts after outgrowing academy football with the Under-21s.",
      "Mather has predominantly played on the left wing during his time in the academy, but his preferred position is the No.10 role and the player is understood to be keen to play regular competitive football.",

      "The transfer windows in Saudi Arabia and Turkey remain open, so there may see some departures from Old Trafford. Although the summer transfer window has closed in England, several United players could be on their way out as the trading periods in Saudi Arabia and Turkey are still active.",
      "Goalkeeper Andre Onana is one player who has left after securing a season-long loan move to Trabzonspor on Thursday. Tyrell Malacia's loan move to Elche fell through, but a temporary switch to Eyupspor is reportedly on the cards.",
      "However, there were reports on Wednesday evening suggesting that the defender was not keen on the move. Meanwhile, potential future signings are also being considered, with a long-term plan in place for Brighton's Carlos Baleba after United were unable to finalise a deal this summer.",
      "Follow all the United transfer news updates throughout the day below...",
      "Manchester United have submitted their Premier League squad for the first half of the 2025/26 season.",
      "Premier League clubs submit up to 25 players to form their squads. The list can be tweaked in the January transfer window, but each side have now submitted their squad before this weekend's round of fixtures.",
      "United have just 21 players in their squad, but the number is bolstered by players named in the Under-21 section, which include Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo, Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven.",
      "Premier League rules state U21 players do not need to be named in the main squad, which can include no more than 17 players who do not fulfil the homegrown player criteria.",
      "A homegrown player is deemed somebody who, irrespective of nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to the FA or the FAW for a period of three entire seasons, or 36 months, before his 21st birthday, or the end of the season during which he turns 21.",
      "United's homegrown players are Tom Heaton, Dermot Mee, Rhys Bennett, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Amad.",

Ahead of this weekend's Manchester Derby, he boldly said the latter, who joined the Red Devils from RB Leipzig this summer, will be as good as Haaland.",
      "So far, the 22-year-old has only started one game under Ruben Amorim, which was the disastrous League Cup second round exit to Grimsby Town. However, after seeing both Haaland and Sesko when they were both raw football talents, Aufhaser is confident the United forward will fulfil his potential.",

Having held that position for four years, the ex-Scotland international became technical assistant for nearly half a year before eventually taking on the role of technical director.",

      "The lack of external hype in his game is reflected in his CIES Observatory ranking, which states a \"fair market\" value for his services is between £39m and £46m.",
      "It's far away from Palace's reported £100m price tag - a figure slated as \"mad\" and \"daft\" by Jamie Carragher - but's it's a significant rise from his January value of £28m, according to Transfermarkt.",

      "The Premier League returns with a bang after the international break for Manchester City and Manchester United.",
      "United make the short journey to the Etihad Stadium for the first Manchester derby of the season on Sunday afternoon (4.30pm kick-off). Both teams will be looking to get one over on their rivals and take all three points.",
      "City go into the match looking to bounce back from two defeats from their opening three games. A 4-0 opening day win over Wolves has been followed by a 2-0 defeat vs Tottenham and a 2-1 loss to Brighton.",
      "The start of the campaign has been a mixed bag for United with one win, one draw and one defeat. There was also a sobering penalty shootout loss against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "They did however go into the international break on a high with Bruno Fernandes’ late penalty giving them a 3-2 win over Burnley in their last outing.",
      "Sunday's game at the Etihad will have the eyes of the world on it. Ahead of the match pundits have already been giving their thoughts as to what the outcome could be.",
      "Here’s a look at what just some have had to say.",
      "The former Man City striker told Stake.com: “Derbies are always emotional moments for teams and their supporters, living outside the realm of their regular ups and downs.",
      "“This one arrives with both sides raring for a change in fortunes. There's a spanner in the works too – the FIFA matchday that will have some players arriving worn out from international games. But I trust City will take the win.",
      "“These are usually tight matches, won by whoever better capitalises on their opportunities. A few exceptions here and there to this rule, no doubt – but I don't see any one of the two teams being overwhelmingly better than the other. I'd expect a high-intensity match.",
      "“I think it'll come down to midfield possession, so whoever gets more chances to stand out in that area, perhaps. It's a shame that [Rayan] Cherki is out, for this reason. That being said, I think City has the players to ensure controlling the ball as I mentioned.”",
      "Augero’s prediction: Man City win",
      "“Home win,” he told Betfair. “It's a huge game for both clubs already this season and it always is.",
      "“But because of what's happened to Man City and the pressure Man United could be under, it's a huge game. I'll go for a home win.”",
      "Shearer’s prediction: Man City win",
      "He told BetVictor: “What a game this should be and I’ll be honest, I’m not quite sure what to expect!",
      "“City have been all over the place in the last couple of games, I just didn’t see that coming. I do expect a big response from Pep’s side here though but defensively; Pep must have big concerns about his side.",
      "“As for United, they got that dramatic win over Burnley but was that just papering over the cracks? Only time will tell I suppose. I do like the way United attack and I think Cunha and Mbeumo have really settled in well and look such a threat.",
      "“I’m going for City to win 3-1 but it’s so hard to predict those two sides right now!”",
      "Redknapp’s prediction: Man City 3-1 Man United",
      "“I can see Bryan Mbeumo hurting City, with United counter-attacking and him being a thorn in their backline chasing balls in behind,” he told BBC Sport. “I am also not as convinced by City if James Trafford keeps his place in goal.",
      "“So, I think United will definitely score, but I still cannot go against City at Etihad Stadium because we know they will create chances there.",
      "“It is a massive week for them, with Napoli visiting in the Champions League on Thursday before they head to Arsenal next weekend, and of course people are going to judge them on these results. After losing two of their first three league games, this week could decide if they are in the title race, or if they are ruled out of it.",
      "“I don't want to keep bringing up the goalkeeper but City's chances of getting the results they need will definitely be improved if new signing Gianluigi Donnarumma is in goal because right now they need a big presence there, and Trafford doesn't give them that.",
      "“The same position is a huge call for United boss Ruben Amorim on Sunday too, but in a totally different way.",
      "“United signed Senne Lammens ahead of Villa's Emi Martinez, who has definitely got the kind of presence that brings confidence to his defence the same way Donnarumma does.”",
      "Sutton’s prediction: Man City 2-1 Man United",
      "“I thought Manchester United were really good the other day against Burnley,” he told SportsKeeda. “It was a bit like the Manchester United of the old times. But they still needed a penalty at the end to win that game and that is a concern if you ask me.",
      "“Manchester City looked comfortable until the substitutions changed the game for Brighton. I'm looking for reasons to back City here and I can't find any if I'm being honest! They don't have a player like David Silva or Kevin De Bruyne anymore, so who is going to step up?",
      "“Julian Alvarez was the kind of player who could have picked the ball up and pulled off something special in games like these, but they don't have him either! Erling Haaland isn't that type of a player, he relies on people like Silva and De Bruyne for service. And I've always said that Jeremy Doku is a hit-and-miss, so this isn't the dominant Manchester City we once knew.",
      "“City were terrible against Tottenham at the Etihad. I actually think Manchester United's front-three can hurt them in this game. I say that despite having the opinion that United will not finish in the top six this season, so you can imagine what I think of City at the moment!",
      "“I'm going to go for a draw but if someone told me I had to pick a winner, I would only choose Manchester United. I just don't think Ruben Amorim's men will lose this game.”",

      "Ruben Amorim has explained why he didn’t hold talks with Kobbie Mainoo while the transfer window was still open after the Manchester United star asked to leave the club.",
      "Mainoo asked to leave United on loan towards the end of the window after not starting any of the opening three Premier League games of the season, but was denied his request by the club.",
      "“Like a lot of guys, he wants to play more,” Amorim said ahead of United’s clash with Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "“I didn’t have a conversation with him before the window closed, but I did this week. Because I don’t want Kobbie Mainoo thinking I was having any conversation with him just to hold onto him.",
      "“I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done. I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "“I think for some guys it is enough, but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I’m helping Kobbie Mainoo and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.”",
      "A report earlier this week claimed the United board are ‘unhappy’ with their manager and are ‘wanting Amorim to tone down his emotional public outbursts’.",
      "Amorim’s decision to publicly claim that Mainoo will be competing with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot this season ’caused collateral damage that the Red Devils’ top brass could have done without as they negotiated a tricky end to the summer window’.",
      "Jason Wilcox ended up having to persuade Mainoo to stay late in the window and not pursue a loan move away from Old Trafford and it was ‘seen as a stupid and unnecessary move by Amorim, one lacking emotional intelligence and empathy with Manchester United’s history of homegrown young stars’.",

      "When asked by reporters how Mainoo is reacting to the situation, Amorim added: “He’s not used to fighting for his place, maybe. He’s uncomfortable, but he’s a very good kid. He wants to learn. Sometimes it’s hard to push different things from the players.",
      "“I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton. Nowadays, you can see that Vitinha is maybe the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes.",
      "“The way I play is completely different from the last manager. I watched a lot of games from the Premier League in Portugal. You can feel then that Manchester United really [played in] transitions. He was the only guy that calmed down the game. Now we have other players that calm down the game.",
      "“Sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo. Sometimes, maybe if I start [him] more, Kobbie Mainoo is going to play and he’s going to get hard to take out. I need to go with what I’m feeling at the moment and that is the only feeling. He’s starting the final of the European Championship in a team that has a lot of talented players – [Phil] Foden played that game, [Cole] Palmer was on the bench. He was playing. I know all that, but sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.”",

      "It is not often in recent years that City approach a Manchester derby with as much trepidation as United. But the hosts at the Etihad on Sunday have just as many reasons – if not more – to fret over a game both managers could really do without.",

Coming on the back of a post-transfer window international break, the preparation for derby no.197 will be sub-optimal for both sides even before you begin to consider the wider contexts. And those wider contexts give Guardiola more grounds for concern than Amorim.",

      "It is not an unrealistic prospect that City could be nine points behind Liverpool and seven off Chelsea by Sunday evening. The Reds and Blues face opponents fancied by many to struggle this season. That those teams, Burnley and Brentford, are on the same number of points as Guardiola’s men is a damning indictment on City, even at this early stage.",
      "That is what Guardiola will have spent most of the last fortnight stewing over. The City boss flew to New York for the US Open but he must have been preoccupied at Flushing Meadows by the thought of City pulling the chain on their title prospects with a derby repeat of the performances that reaped no points from Tottenham or Brighton.",
      "City were not especially wretched in either defeat. But more worrying for Guardiola than those performances in isolation is the absence of the aura that made them so dominant for so long.",

      "Spurs are City’s weird kryptonite, but there was still an added zip and swagger about Thomas Frank’s side at the Etihad, especially on the break, that portrayed an absolute confidence that the hosts were vulnerable.",
      "At the AmEx, City assumed the control that Guardiola so craves before they relinquished it whole. And all it took was a quadruple substitution. After that, Brighton unleashed a storm on their visitors that the City of old would usually weather with little inconvenience. But this version of City, one evidently still traumatised and in transition, wilted.",
      "“We forgot to play,” as Pep put it and his four changes – two doubles – to counter Brighton’s, initially to steady the ship and then to stop it sinking, failed to have the desired effect.",
      "More lasting changes came in the following days, with Ilkay Gundogan, Manuel Akanji and Ederson waved off, the trio following Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Jack Grealish through the exit. It is a turnover that City planned for – most of it, at least – but one that sees a lot of stoic experience leave a dressing room already on the back foot.",

      "There is hope amongst the fanbase that Lammens has been brought in to start but Amorim revealed in his Friday press conference that Bayindir will be in net for the Manchester Derby on Sunday.",
      "Amorim said ahead of the fixture: “Altay is going to continue. Different league, different country, different ball. They will fight for the position. It is clear. Altay will start. He is ready to play, he will play.”",
      "And now Romano has explained what Lammens’ role will be at Man Utd this season, the transfer journalist revealed on GiveMeSport‘s Market Madness podcast: “I think they will be competing for the spot for the first-team goalkeeper, so it’s not going to be 100 percent guaranteed for anyone, but I’m sure that Senne Lammens is also a clear favourite.",
      "“I think Manchester United really trust him for the present, but also the future. They believe that this is one of the best young goalkeepers in the world, and so they really trust this boy.",
      "“They wanted Lammens strongly. Obviously, there was also the opportunity to go for Emi Martinez, which is a completely different profile – obviously to add some leadership, but also with different costs in terms of salary and transfer fee.",
      "“So they decided for Lammens, because they believe this is the ideal solution for the present and the future. I’m sure that Lammens has a very good chances to be the starting goalkeeper at Manchester United.”",
      "In his press conference, Amorim added on Lammens: “We are really pleased, he is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential.",
      "“We are in a moment where we need a goalkeeper to be really strong, have a lot of experience, but also in a moment we have to look at the present, but with focus on the future, a little bit both. He is one more option to play. He will be ready.”"

No content is distributed like this anymore; TV, music, film and even books are accessed using models far closer to what Ligue Un are doing.

      "Romano has also confirmed that they are keen to settle Martinez’s future soon, as they “don’t want to go into late 2026”.",
      "“Contracts at Man Utd will now be an important part of the focus for the club after this summer transfer window,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“One of the situations to follow, from what I’m told, is the one of Lisandro ‘Licha’ Martinez. Licha is out with an injury. Licha is not available now, but he will return as soon as possible.",
      "“My understanding is that Man Utd want to discuss a new contract with Licha. He’s out of contract in 2027. Man Utd don’t want to go into late 2026 with the player not having his contract extended yet to avoid the problems.",
      "“And so what Man Utd will try to do is to negotiate with Martinez before arriving in the final year of his contract.",
      "“Now, waiting for the player to return, of course, there is no rush, no pressure, but for sure, Man Utd want to try as soon as possible. My feeling is as soon as Licha will be close to returning, they will try to accelerate.”",

      "A huge change was promised, but the same problems remain as United are still ineffective in attack and easy to play through, while it remains to be seen whether unproven Senne Lammens can address their issue between the sticks.",

      "Crystal Palace proved with the Marc Guehi saga that they are willing to hold firm to eke out as much cash as possible when selling a key asset, and that was with a player only under contract until next summer.",
      "Wharton, meanwhile, is contracted to Palace until 2029, so Oliver Glasner’s side are under no real pressure to sell and certainly won’t be ‘cutting’ Wharton’s price anytime soon.",
      "Also, Wharton being in a World Cup year would surely make Palace wait until the summer, at least, to see how he fares in the hope that a buying club offers an extra few million.",
      "So it’ll be £100m, not £60m; sorry to burst your bubble, Manchester United fans…",

      "After bringing in Lammens from Royal Antwerp on deadline day, Onana was allowed to join Trabzonspor on loan until the end of the season.",
      "Reports have claimed that Amorim saw Onana’s exit from Old Trafford as key to his rebuild of the club and it was felt that the Cameroon international ‘was showing a lack of involvement and interest in working for the team in the final days before the international break.’",
      "It’s not yet clear whether Lammens has been brought in as number one or to challenge Bayindir but Amorim confirmed on Friday that the latter is starting against Man City on Sunday.",
      "READ: Missing Men: When Gary Neville fed the Goat in the final Maine Road Manchester derby",
      "Amorim told a press conference: “Altay is going to continue. It is a different league, a different country, different training, different ball. So we will try to maintain that and they will fight for the position but for me in this game is clear, Altay will start.”",
      "On Lammens, the Man Utd boss added: “He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential. I know that we are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience. We are also in the moment where we have to look at the present but also with a focus on the future – so it is a little bit of both. He’s a guy with a great potential that is one more option [for us] to play, and he will be ready.”",
      "When asked why Man Utd signed Lammens over Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez, Amorim continued: “We have an option that can give us different things in the moment but also has a great potential to be our goalkeeper for a lot of years so that was out choice in the end.”",
      "On why Onana had to leave Old Trafford, Amorim said: “I think we understood that this needed a change and sometimes it is hard to point out why. Sometimes it is the moment, the bad luck in some moments.",
      "“It is hard on him, on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers but I wish the best for Andre Onana.",
      "“He was really good at working and trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need a change.”",
      "Injured trio Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot, who cost Man Utd £136.5m in total, will be missing against Man City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim said of the trio: “They are out for this game. I don’t know how long it is going to take. We need our guys to be a very competitive team but we have very good players who are eager to play, so we will be competitive on Sunday but they are out. They cannot help us in this game.”",
      "When asked how long they will be out for, Amorim replied: “I don’t want to say. If you talk to Cunha he will say he is able to play this game. So I don’t know. We will manage day-by-day. They are pushing really hard and that is a good thing.”",
      "Amorim has explained why he didn’t hold talks with Mainoo while the transfer window was still open after the Man Utd star asked to leave the club.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo will once again attempt to persuade Bruno Fernandes to leave Man Utd in January and move to Saudi Arabia, according to reports.",
      "Al-Hilal made Fernandes their priority early on in the summer with the Saudi Pro League side willing to give the Red Devils midfielder a tax-free contract worth £700,000-a-week plus bonuses, which is around three times what he earns at Old Trafford.",
      "After talks between Fernandes’ agent, Miguel Pinho, and the Saudi club, the Man Utd captain decided to stay at the Premier League club for the time being.",
      "Revealing why he opted to stay at Man Utd over a move to Saudi, Fernandes – who has also attracted interest from Al-Nassr and Al-Ittihad – said: “The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask me about it.",
      "“There was a waiting period for me to think about the future. As I have always said, I would be willing to do it if Manchester United thought so.",
      "“I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, was very annoying to me not to go! The club said they would not be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave, that it was not a financial issue.”",
      "READ: Missing Men: When Gary Neville fed the Goat in the final Maine Road Manchester derby",
      "Fernandes added: “It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course.",
      "“Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "“It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship.",
      "“But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions. and I feel capable of it.”",
      "In a fresh update on Saudi interest in Fernandes, Fabrizio Romano revealed earlier this week that clubs in the Middle East are ready to return for the Man Utd captain in 2026.",
      "Romano explained on his YouTube channel: “From Saudi, they want to return in the future. For 2026, keep an eye on Saudi because they will return. And then, it’s going to be up to Bruno to say ‘yes, I want to come’ or ‘no, I want to stay in Europe, no, I want to stay in Manchester United’.",
      "“But from Saudi, they want to return for Bruno Fernandes, and they keep the name of Bruno Fernandes in their list for the future targets. Keep a close eye on the situation of Bruno Fernandes because Saudi want to return.”",
      "And Spanish website Fichajes claim that current Portugal international team-mate Ronaldo ‘pressures’ Fernandes to join a Saudi club in January.",
      "Ronaldo has ‘stepped up his efforts to convince his compatriot to join the Saudi Pro League’ as the former Man Utd striker’s ‘role in Saudi Arabia’s football project goes beyond his performance on the pitch’.",
      "Although he failed to persuade Fernandes to join him in the summer transfer window, the report adds that ‘interest remains alive and could be revived by January 2026’.",
      "The report continues: ‘The English club is experiencing financial difficulties and could seriously consider selling one of its most valuable assets if an attractive offer comes in. Fernandes is entering the final stretch of his contract, increasing the pressure to define his future.’",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has hit back at pundits and former players who have questioned his demeanour in the past.",
      "Are you really a world-record holder if you have to lower yourself to counting goals scored against Scotland? Cristiano Ronaldo is an embarrassing fraud.",
      "According to reports, Bruno Fernandes ‘could be in his last season’ at Manchester United amid interest from several Saudi Pro League sides.",
      "A ‘significant U-turn’ suggests Manchester United already regret a £100m transfer decision, which has exposed ‘furious’ Ruben Amorim…",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been branded a “child” after his penalty miss cost Man Utd in a 1-1 draw against Fulham in the Premier League over the weekend.",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.9bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…"

      "The Premier League roars back after the international break with an absolute cracker of a weekend in store.",
      "There’s a Manchester derby where the Heavyweight Crisis Club belt is on the line, there’s the return of Ange Postecoglou, there’s the prospect of Alexander Isak and all manner of other shiny late-summer signings making their debuts, and in the Championship the long-awaited return of a south-coast derby to the league schedule after a 13-year absence.",
      "It is, in short, a very Big Weekend. Enjoy.",
      "A Sunday afternoon treat in store for us all in one of those games absolutely guaranteed to provide narrative out the wazoo no matter what happens.",
      "The fixture computer has been cruel indeed to Manchester City, compelling them to play their first two home games against the teams who inflicted the most embarrassing league defeats upon them at the Etihad last season.",
      "History has already repeated itself thanks to Spurs’ alarmingly controlled and tension-free 2-0 victory a few weeks ago, and City really cannot afford any kind of repeat of the late nonsense United pulled on them in a 2-1 win during the depths of City’s late 2024 despair.",
      "Whoever loses this really is in big trouble.",
      "If it’s United, then the difficulty of the fixture list will provide only scant mitigation for a poor league start (not to mention the Grimsby unpleasantness) in which Ruben Amorim has been lucky to nick a point against Fulham and even luckier to beat Burnley at home.",
      "He already sits atop the reformed Sack Race now Nuno Espirito Santo has been Marinakised and has both Chelsea and Liverpool to worry about in the weeks ahead.",
      "If it’s City, then the early crisis club mantle passes to the blue half of Manchester after three straight defeats and a title challenge petering out in mid-September and renewed questions about whether Pep Guardiola has the energy or desire to follow through on building himself another great City side on the back of all 24/25’s relative struggle.",
      "The most damning thing for City would be the fact that those three straight defeats would have come without a meaningful title rival in sight; that looms with next week’s trip to the Emirates which really would start to look like a fixture that could end City’s Premier League season before we’ve even reached the second international break.",
      "Or it could be a draw, in which case no firm answers can be reached but they’re probably both f*cked.",
      "So yeah. A Sunday afternoon treat for absolutely everyone, except for anyone who supports at least one and very possibly both of these clubs.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings: 14 places between Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "",
      "Here he comes. He’s back. Angeball is inevitable.",
      "Nottingham Forest insisted they really didn’t want to get rid of Nuno Espirito Santo and had no intention to do so right up until the moment they, alas and alack, felt they simply had no choice given the breakdown in trust for which they were in no way responsible. Which all means the negotiations to appoint a replacement they hadn’t given a moment’s thought to previously were conducted in record time, with Ange Postecoglou appointed mere hours after Nuno’s midnight axe.",
      "Really, it’s just another reminder of what an efficient, well-run club Nottingham Forest are these days. That’s just the speed at which they can get things done.",
      "And another example of how efficient and clear-headed Forest are is in the way they’ve gone straight out and snaffled themselves a manager to provide seamless, frictionless continuity given the obvious similarities in the way he and Nuno operate.",
      "Yes, if unfortunate circumstances outside your control just after the end of the transfer window force you to replace the manager who last season delivered success wildly beyond any reasonable expectation, then really all you can do is go out and appoint the closest thing you can find to what you’ve lost.",
      "Or, of course, there’s the other option, which is to look at what’s worked so well for you and that departing manager and the squad you’d built for him over the last 18 months, and then appoint literally the most polar opposite manager it is possible to imagine, one whose tactics led a bigger and wealthier and far more established club to 17th place last season.",
      "It’s a genuinely brilliant slice of nonsense, this, and one that has absolutely no downside. It’s a plan so stupid that it might in fact be genius and actually work, in which case: great. There really are few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works.",
      "But do you know what is one of the few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works? Angeball when it doesn’t.",
      "If you’re not enormously excited by the prospect of Nikola Milenkovic playing a high line then we really are very different people.",
      "At the other end, though, Forest absolutely do have the attacking tools to cause teams serious pain when given freedom and licence to roam and with chests swelled with pride by one of Ange’s patented inspirational team talks.",
      "There’s a reason everyone who has played for Postecoglou seems to adore the bloke. It’s just who he is, mate.",
      "And of course the fixture computer has sent him to Arsenal for his first game back in the Premier League.",
      "It’s unlikely Ange has had time to get all his ideas across to his new charges, which for this game might well be for the best. It is a bit of a free hit for him anyway. Just pump the players’ tyres and send them out there. Get any kind of result and it sets him up for potentially the sort of instant ‘WTF?’ impact he had in those very early games at Tottenham.",
      "Lose, and he can just come out in the post-match interview and say ‘Warra trophy, mate’ and he still wins. Perfect.",
      "",
      "Always a highlight of this first post-interlull matchday, of course. We’ve all been starved of delicious Barclays for an agonising, drawn-out fortnight but when it comes back it comes back strong with all those late summer signings set for debuts, from Isak against Burnley to his assorted replacements for Newcastle, to Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani at Spurs, or Harvey Elliott for Villa, and the quite brilliant fact we really don’t actually know with any compelling certainty who will be in either goal for the Manchester derby.",
      "But Isak is clearly the star attraction here. Given that he’s short of match sharpness and had precious little time with his new team-mates due to confirmation of his move coming so late in the window and having to head pretty much straight off to international duty with Sweden, it’s very possible – likely even – that he is only on the bench for Liverpool at Turf Moor.",
      "That’s only a minor consolation for Burnley, though, who will have to deal with a still-elite attack posing nightmarish threats from every direction while also knowing that just as the fatigue of chasing Wirtz and Ekitike and Salah around for an hour or so really starts to kick in, they’re likely to have to deal with perhaps the Premier League’s best centre-forward stepping off the bench with sky-high motivation and myriad points to prove. Very best of luck to you.",
      "",
      "West Ham’s 3-0 win at Nottingham Forest just before the international break was perhaps the single most discombobulating result of that entire 30-match intro to the new Premier League season.",
      "Kneejerk assessments had been made of West Ham in the previous fortnight, and the consensus was clear: they were rubbish, and many people feared for them, they really did. We did. We do.",
      "But the chaotic final 10 minutes at the City Ground changed everything. It provided cover for Forest to do what they obviously wanted to do to Nuno, for one thing, but also sent the Hammers into the international break looking a very different beast and with potentially a very different season to the one everyone had prescribed for them.",
      "There is still the sense that it was just a freak nonsense. The goals coming in a rush at the end as they did certainly adds to that sense.",
      "So the challenge for Graham Potter and his players is to immediately disprove that theory. To immediately use it as a springboard to launch a season that had started so miserably.",
      "And for that reason there really are few better fixtures to follow it for West Ham than Tottenham at home. Spurs fans have long mocked West Ham for this game being the Hammers’ cup final, noise which quietened when West Ham inconveniently reached and won an actual cup final while Spurs were languishing in trophyless banterland.",
      "Last season’s Europa League win means that noise will return for a fixture that has a compelling history of high-level nonsense, one that has featured dramatic late winners for Spurs from names as varied as Paul Stalteri, Eric Dier and Gareth Bale, to Manuel Lanzini halting Tottenham’s bid to put the pressure on Chelsea in 2017 and more recent match-winning exploits from Michail Antonio and Jesse Lingard.",
      "West Ham haven’t lost at home to Tottenham since 2019, when Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge of Spurs produced a chaotic 3-2 win that was in no way whatsoever a sign of things to come.",
      "The last three have ended in 1-1 draws, and even that would be enough to give West Ham something to work with moving forward. Which really didn’t look likely after those two miserable opening defeats and pitiful Carabao exit.",
      "",
      "The real El Clasicoast returns as a league fixture for the first time since a 2-2 Championship draw in April 2012, and 13 years in which assorted miseries have befallen both clubs. Especially Southampton, but especially Portsmouth.",
      "A Premier League team in 2010 became a League Two one by 2013 and it’s been a long slow climb back to the second tier and renewed acquaintances with their local rivals.",
      "Southampton themselves were in League One during Portsmouth’s final Premier League season, and just seven years later were completing a fourth successive season in the top flight’s top eight under managers like Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman.",
      "They then fell off, bobbed around a bit and last year, as Portsmouth finally dragged themselves back up into the Championship, Southampton tumbled back into it after the second worst Premier League season in history.",
      "And it’s Portsmouth who’ve now made the better start to this season ahead of the short trip to St Mary’s.",
      "",
      "Juventus bid to make it three wins from three at the start of the Serie A season against an Inter side whose opening-day high of a 5-0 win over Torino was followed by a real back-to-earth-with-a-bump of a home defeat to Udinese after taking an early lead.",
      "Juventus haven’t, in truth, been wholly convincing against either Parma or Genoa, but two wins from two games without conceding a goal is never to be sniffed at.",
      "We’ll have a better idea about where both these teams might be heading this season by Saturday evening.",
      "",
      "The newly-promoted Lionesses host their first ever WSL match this weekend, with life not getting much easier after a chastening defeat at the hands of Arsenal last week.",
      "There are plenty of reasons to think this weekend might go differently, though. World-record signing Grace Geyoro could come straight into the side, while a thin-looking United squad could well be a touch weary after a 1-0 midweek defeat in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier against Brann.",
      "That result also leaves Marc Skinner’s side likely to have one eye on the crucial return leg next week and vulnerable to a London City side who will have laser focus and history-making on their mind.",
      "Arne Slot explained why Alexander Isak was left out of Liverpool’s squad for their trip to Burnley on Sunday and his plan for the Reds’ new striker going forward.",
      "Enzo Maresca gets pelters for what he’s doing to unbeaten Chelsea and do Arsenal have the best worst player in the world?",

      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "People will say Amorim has created much of his own mess at Old Trafford with his tactical stubbornness and outspoken, speak-before-you-think nature in press conferences and interviews.",
      "But he is cleaning up an unholy mess left by his predecessor. A mess that was, admittedly, enabled by the Man Utd hierarchy.",
      "The new-ish Red Devils hierarchy has already made several mistakes. One was keeping Ten Hag after a worst-ever Premier League campaign in 2023/24. Another might well be picking Amorim as his replacement less than four months after his contract extension.",
      "There may be a vastly different boardroom, personnel-wise, but the same mistakes the old hierarchy made with Ten Hag have potentially been repeated with Amorim. And if his fate is the same, a club in transition could end up in an even bigger mess than the one the Portuguese inherited.",
      "READ: Amorim sent resignation warning as Rangnick the only Man Utd manager of six still standing",
      "In Ten Hag’s first summer at Man Utd, he was backed with a monstrous, club-record transfer window, spending £227million on Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro, while Christian Eriksen joined on a free transfer and Martin Dubravka on loan.",
      "Man Utd had their foreshadowing moments, such as the 7-0 defeat at Liverpool and the Europa League meltdown against Sevilla, but overall, it was a positive first season for Ten Hag, who guided the Red Devils to third in the Premier League, the FA Cup final, and Carabao Cup glory.",
      "The club clearly got giddy and backed Ten Hag with more of ‘his own players’. Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount, Andre Onana, Sofyan Amrabat, Altay Bayindir, Jonny Evans and Sergio Reguilon all joined for a combined £166million.",
      "Ten Hag was clearly obsessed with signing players he had previously managed, or at least those with Eredivisie experience.",
      "That approach was again evident in a 2024 summer full of uncertainty surrounding his future, as Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui were among those to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Fast forward to January 2025: Amorim is two months into the job, not being backed with heavy spending because Man Utd’s hands are tied, but supported with the signing of wing-back Patrick Dorgu — a clear sign that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his board are buying into their head coach’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Six months, two domestic cup exits, a Europa League final defeat, and a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League later, they did it again.",
      "Amorim was backed with an enormous transfer kitty as the club remained confident in his managerial ability and in a formation that’s still not working.",
      "But while he has been supported with new signings and patience, he has also been tasked with finding solutions for a host of underperforming players signed by his predecessor.",

      "The 27-year-old was easily barged out of the way of the ball as Ricardo Calafiori scored the only goal in Arsenal's 1-0 victory at Old Trafford, despite a dominant United display on the opening day. Bayindir was also flung into the spotlight when he parried the ball into the path of Jaidon Anthony during United's 3-2 win over Burnley last time out.",
      "His performances led to some calls from fans to see Lammens given the nod for the derby; however, Amorim maintains that the club will be feeding players in differently to ensure players thrive at the club.",
      "\"It's not just the pressure of Manchester United, but it's a different club,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We are building stability at the club to make new players better. If you go back into the past, this club had a really good base with Roy Keane, Gary Neville, all of these types of guys, but I remember world-class players like [Juan-Sebastián] Veron had problems.",
      "\"We had a situation in the past with goalkeepers where we spent a lot of time trying to get a goalkeeper and then Edwin van der Sar came and was like a different player in that position.",
      "\"It's not something that is happening now. It's happening now because we cannot win a lot of titles and that adds more pressure to every player, but we've had these kind of moments at this kind of club.",
      "\"We will try to build stability and a base to help all of these players and we are building that. So in this moment, it's really hard for different players to adapt to this club.\"",
      "Asked who the club's next Van der Sar is, Amorim said:",
      "\"This week I hope to see Altay Bayindir doing well like Van der Sar. Then in the future, they have to fight for the places. We as a team can help the goalkeepers be better. We are doing that.\"",
      "Amorim says it was the right time for both the club and Onana to part ways.",

      "Amorim also believes that after the transfer window, he can see more things in the team that he likes. United signed the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, who helped take Man Utd's spending to £232.4m.",
      "Outgoings included Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho, who secured loan moves elsewhere and permanent departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho. Amorim believes his side are better and that owes to losing the Europa League final, which means fewer games and more time on the training pitch.",
      "\"It's going to take time, but we are better,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"I can see more things in my team that I like. More of the things I don't like in my [current] team are more mental because I know the quality is there. We proved in different weekends.\"",
      "\"I think it's hard for the fans, people and some pundits to understand because the Europa League win would have brought us more money to spend and change a lot of things in the team and more games to rotate the team for more players to be happy, but I think we need time.",
      "\"So for me it was the best thing about losing the final, if there can be a best thing. It was time to improve not just the team but also the club.",
      "\"We've shown that a little bit in the games, we play better, we are more dominant, we create more chances, we avoid more chances from the opponent. We are going to use every minute to improve our base. To have our way of playing to be ready for the adaptation, for them to understand every detail of their positions.",
      "Now we have a full week to have a schedule and show the mistakes and now you are showing what you did well in the last game. Now we have more days to focus on the strategy for the next game.\"",

      "United are all too familiar with the promise of a rebuild. Ruben Amorim represents the sixth permanent time of asking for a manager at the Old Trafford club to restore the glories of the past.",
      "While for Guardiola, after nine years - his longest spell at a club - he navigates another reboot to restore more recent success, for the first time in his managerial career.",
      "Still yet to provide proof that his footballing concepts can bear fruit, Amorim, on the other hand, must convince fans that a record low finish of 15th in the Premier League was a blip in his first full season at the helm.",
      "United have made an indifferent start to the new season. There was a sense of positivity despite defeat in the season opener to Arsenal. Old habits crept in as United gave away a lead at Fulham and Carabao Cup embarrassment at League Two Grimsby wearied both fans and Amorim himself of whether he could continue as the boss.",
      "After the penalty shoot-out defeat at Grimsby, the Portuguese boss suggested \"something had to change\", implying that it could not be the players, leaving the door open to speculation over his future. Days later, Amorim backtracked on his comments, putting them down to emotion, explaining, \"sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years\".",
      "That frustration perhaps could be borne out of the fact that United are doing the right things but are lacking the results and points to reflect their improvements. United have only scored one goal from open play this season, but the underlying numbers appear much more favourable for United.",
      "It is very early on in the season, but Amorim's side have generated the most expected goals, have had the most shots and created the most chances in the Premier League so far this term, reflecting a freer, flowing attack.",
      "United have also hit the post four times across their three opening fixtures as their new-look forward line attempts to improve on their return.",
      "Incomings in the form of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have made for a more expressive United in forward areas, but there has also been a greater emphasis on a more direct style with United also leading the Premier League in long passes completed.",
      "Signs of improvement extend to United's newly-found willingness to battle, a side of their game that has often been criticised. Only one side has bettered United this season when it comes to duels won and aerial duels won.",
      "Amorim will be desperate for his side's promising numbers to translate into victories. United's win over Burnley before the break was a much-needed one but the Manchester derby offers further opportunity to reflect proof of concept.",
      "Guardiola is the only current manager that Amorim has faced more than once in the Premier League while remaining undefeated.",
      "Amorim beat Guardiola twice during the 2024/25 season, the first as he led Sporting to a 4-1 victory in the Champions League days before taking up his post at Old Trafford. Amad then sealed a late comeback win for Amorim at the Etihad last December. The Manchester derby ended goalless when the two last met in April.",
      "City's unprecedented dip in form last season pushed the club into uncharted territory. Their lowest points total under Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term prompted a summer rebuild. But their woes have dripped into the new season with Guardiola making his worst start to a league campaign since 2008.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne's departure signalled a new era at the Etihad. Summer signings James Trafford, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders added to January acquisitions of Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Omar Marmoush, among others to create a new-look City under a new director of football, Hugo Viana.",
      "However, with just one win on the table in the Premier League so far, the 'new Man City' have made a stuttering start.",
      "Changes to the technical staff appear to have had some impact. Former Liverpool assistant Pep Ljinders has joined Guardiola in the dugout alongside Kolo Toure. Lijnders, Jurgen Klopp's former right-hand man, was famed for his part in Liverpool's dynamic, high-octane approach.",
      "Jamie Carragher, after City's resounding opening victory at Wolves, noted City's \"rock-and-roll\" approach, akin to Klopp's Liverpool.",
      "\"It felt like in the game, it's almost like a little bit of an obsession, certainly in the first half, about catching them offside,\" Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"We always know Pep's team like to push up. We get all that, but that was something a little bit different. It just makes me think of the influence of Pep Lijnders in terms of the offside.",
      "\"When you think of Liverpool as well, keeping back to Pep Lijnders, the amount of counter-attacking goals that Liverpool team would score with [Sadio] Mane and [Mohammed] Salah, breaking forward. When I looked at the goal from Reinders in the game. It was fantastic.",
      "\"But one of the goals was what you'd think of as a counter-attack, not maybe a Pep Guardiola goal. They win it, and then they're off.\"",
      "A change in approach has been evident. With Cherki now involved and the reintroduction of Oscar Bobb, there has been a slightly greater emphasis on individual flair, with City having completed the most take-ons of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Despite Rodri returning to fitness, City appear to have struggled to control games, giving up their lead over Brighton and being blown away by Thomas Frank's rampant Tottenham. It is that perceived lack of control that will be bothering Guardiola the most ahead of the derby.",
      "United head into the derby above City for the first time in five years, but that does not remove the feeling of trepidation that surrounds Old Trafford at the moment.",
      "The added context of key City absentees in the form of Marmoush and Cherki will offer confidence. As will Amorim's record against Guardiola and City's only win in their last four meetings, being the Community Shield shoot-out victory last season.",
      "Derby games are the proverbial great leveller, but when both sides have been equally uninspiring in terms of results, it becomes a must-win for both managers that could be indicative of the validity of their rebuilds.",

      "In the blue corner, Champions League winner and Euro 2020 hero Gianluigi Donnarumma has joined Pep Guardiola's squad, throwing James Trafford's spot in the starting line-up into question despite only signing from Burnley in July.",
      "In the red corner, Senne Lammens' £18.2m arrival from Royal Antwerp on Deadline Day sealed the immediate future of Andre Onana after a catalogue of high-profile mistakes, with a move to Trabzonspor now confirmed for the Cameroon international.",

      "Two bitter rivals sharing the same predicament with the goalkeeping position in full focus.",
      "\"Altay [Bayindir] is going to continue because we need to,\" Amorim said ahead of the game against City.",
      "\"This game is clear. Altay will start. It's a show of faith in Altay.\"",
      "The United boss has been forced to publicly back Bayindir yet again, after already seeing his starting credentials questioned following errors against both Burnley and Arsenal.",
      "The 1-0 defeat to Mikel Arteta's side arrived from a Riccardo Calafiori header after Bayindir failed to command his area, while victory was almost snatched away against Burnley when Bayindir spilled the ball back into his own penalty area for Jaidon Anthony to tap home.",
      "Bayindir now has the backing from his boss but needs to repay that faith with a solid display at the Etihad.",
      "Bayindir will need to take the opportunity ahead of him with Lammens now waiting in the wings, eager to impress.",
      "The numbers have backed up the signing of the 23-year-old. Whether the eye test matches his impressive statistics remains to be seen.",
      "No goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season during his 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League. He also had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe and made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "A debut in the derby has been clearly been deemed too much of a risk by Amorim - but it will not be long before Lammens is given a chance to impress.",
      "Breaking into the AC Milan squad as a teenager, playing at the San Siro against rivals Inter at 16, two penalty saves in the shoot-out against England to guide Italy to the Euros title in 2021, Champions League hero and a two-time Yashin Trophy winner.",
      "A debut in the Manchester derby would not faze Donnarumma. He is made for the big occasion.",
      "There have been questions raised about whether the 26-year-old fits Guardiola's style of play, but the City boss has insisted he is not expecting the 26-year-old to replicate Ederson's ability with the ball at his feet.",
      "\"I always try to adapt to the quality of the players,\" said Guardiola at his press conference ahead of the derby.",
      "\"I wouldn't demand 'Gigi' do something he is uncomfortable with. We are talking about the best (goalkeeper) I have ever seen with distribution, short and long passes, in Ederson.",
      "\"We didn't take Gigi to do what Ederson has done. Gigi has another quality.\"",
      "That quality is shot-stopping. City have faced 15 shots on target across the opening three games, the most of any side in the top flight, meaning Donnarumma's strength in this area will be welcomed with open arms by Guardiola and his staff.",
      "United lead the league in shots taken so far this season (56) and come in at second behind Liverpool for shots on target (15). Right now, City need a goalkeeper to address that threat. Donnarumma is the perfect option.",
      "His ability on the ball and other topics of debate are a discussion for another day.",
      "On the other hand, you could argue Trafford deserves the opportunity to impress in the derby.",
      "He enjoyed a steady start to his return to City, two years after leaving the club to join Burnley, having kept a clean sheet in the season opener against Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "However, a major error against Tottenham leading to the second goal of the afternoon during a 2-0 defeat, as well as another loss to Brighton and Hove Albion, has cast an unwanted spotlight on the 22-year-old.",
      "\"He is a keeper for Man City. I can only play one keeper,\" Guardiola added on Trafford now facing competition from Donnarumma.",
      "Despite the error and the new arrival, Trafford can still stake his claim to remain between the sticks for City.",
      "Only Guglielmo Vicario has made more saves than the City 'keeper across the opening three games, while he also comes in at second for goals prevented in the top flight.",
      "Trafford is a solid shot-stopper, capable of the extraordinary, as his tipped save against Brighton showed.",
      "Donnarumma could provide healthy and high-quality competition for the academy graduate, rather than displacing him immediately.",
