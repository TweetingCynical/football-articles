      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot has become a Premier League champion at the first time of asking, and points to one of the Reds' first games of the season as a key moment. Slot had big shoes to fill after replacing long-serving boss Jurgen Klopp, but a subtle tweak he made in just the third game of the season had a big impact.",
      "After beginning the season with 2-0 victories over Ipswich and Brentford, Liverpool faced a big early test with a trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United. A 3-0 win kept up their perfect start, though, while accelerating the United decline which saw Erik ten Hag sacked in Octoner.",
      "Liverpool's victory owed a lot to Slot putting Dominik Szoboszlai directly up against Casemiro. United's Brazilian midfielder had a torrid time, leaving the field at half-time, and the visitors were never in any real danger during their victory.",
      "\"Just recently some Dutch media asked me: ‘What was the game where you probably won the players over?’ I think it was this game because we changed some small details in the way we did our build up,\" Slot told The Athletic",
      "\"I said to them that United would be expecting Dominik Szoboszlai to play on the right. That they will have prepared all week for it, but he’s going to play on the left and we’re going to do this, this and this a bit different. Indeed exactly what I said happened.\"",
      "Liverpool were 2-0 up at the break after a Luis Diaz break and extended their advantage 10 minutes into the second half through Mohamed Salah. Slot's team lost their next league game, at home to Nottingham Forest, but then went on an unbeaten league run which lasted until April.",
      "\"Did we win the game because of that reason? No. We scored two counter-attacks, maybe even three!\" Slot added. \"But I think it was a day when the players thought: ‘Oh, what he’s trying to tell us works’. And to win 3-0 at Old Trafford gave us the confidence that there was maybe something special ahead of us.\"",
      "Since clinching the title with a 5-1 victory over Tottenham at the end of April, Liverpool have gone three games without a win. They have a chance to go out on a high, though, with Crystal Palace visiting Anfield for the final game of the season.",
      "\"It's going to be a completely different game than the one tonight,\" Slot told Match of the Day when asked about the finale after Monday's 3-2 loss at Brighton. \"You saw Brighton want to press us high and bring the ball out from the back but if Palace play like their cup final then we'll have more possession than tonight but it's very difficult to play through them.\""

      "The crushing 1-0 loss to Tottenham in Bilbao saw United blow a place in next season's Champions League - and with it £100million in revenue. Defeat to Spurs means United will not play in Europe at all next season, for only the second time in 35 years and means further cutbacks at the club that has already seen mass redundancies",

      "United are also desperate to off-load Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho, all of whom are currently out on loan elsewhere. Rashford is desperate to leave United after the breakdown of his relationship with Amorim and the club, and is holding out for a move to Barcelona.",
      "Garnacho, furious at being left out of United's starting line-up to face Tottenham, having played a key role in getting them to the final, is attracting interest from Napoli and Chelsea.",

      "Ruben Amorim has claimed he will walk away from Manchester United if the \"board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy\". But one ex-Premier League star has made clear he doesn't believe the Red Devils head coach.",
      "Even more pressure has been piled on Amorim and the rest of the squad following their 1-0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday. The Red Devils were favourites in Bilbao, but a scrappy Brennan Johnson goal on the stroke of half time sealed the deal for Spurs.",
      "It handed Tottenham their first piece of silverware in 17 years, while for United, the loss means they will finish this season trophyless and without any European glory since 2017.",
      "Post-match, Amorim told the media that he would walk away from the job at Old Trafford if the club's hierarchy and supporters show they believe he isn't in a place to take the team any further – but he still feels he is the man for the job.",
      "The 40-year-old said: \"But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not here to defend myself. It's not my style. I have nothing to show to the fans. In this moment [I need] a little bit of faith.\"",
      "Despite this bold claim, former Liverpool star Didi Hamann isn't convinced by Amorim's words of belief and confidence. The ex-Germany international, who had stints at Anfield as well as with Manchester City and Newcastle United, is adamant that the Red Devils will have to sack Amorim and pay up his wages if they really want a change in leadership next season.",

      "\"If they want to get rid of them, they're probably going to sack him.\"",
      "Hamann also observed that the position the United players find themselves in is a tough one, and that the boss may be running out of messages of belief for a side that is winless in its last eight games.",

      "Since Amorim joined in November 2024, United have been dumped out of three separate cup competitions, dropped from 13th to 16th place in the Premier League, and been defeated in the Europa League final by fellow domestic strugglers Spurs.",
      "While their results in recent times in Europe have shown hope, including 3-0 and 4-1 wins over Athletic Club, fans are growing restless with the lack of success and real signs of progress around a club that was once so dominant in English football.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho’s Manchester United future looks bleak after he courted controversy yet again following the Europa League defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. The 20-year-old has been linked with a move away from the Red Devils this season, with Napoli and Chelsea expressing interest in signing the Argentina international during the January transfer window.",
      "That speculation will only intensify after Garnacho, like his brother Roberto on social media, expressed his frustration at starting the 1-0 defeat as a substitute. The academy graduate had started every knockout match in the run to the final and eventually replaced Mason Mount in the 71st minute at San Mames.",
      "After the game, Garnacho didn’t hold back as he summed up United’s season. He told reporters: “Obviously it’s hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league.",
      "“We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.”",
      "Meanwhile, Roberto took to Instagram to accuse Ruben Amorim of throwing his brother under the bus. He posted: “Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe hahahahahaha.”",
      "While the talented Garnacho has shown flashes of brilliance since breaking into the first team, there have been too many moments of controversy. Here’s a round-up…",
      "It appears Garnacho just can’t help himself when it comes to social media. After being taken off at half-time in a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth last year, he ‘liked’ a series of negative posts about then-manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "With Ten Hag under mounting pressure before a surprise FA Cup final win over Manchester City, Garnacho’s apparent willingness to undermine his manager reminded many of Sir Alex Ferguson’s sage words from his autobiography. The club’s greatest manager wrote: \"There is a phrase in football about players 'not playing for the manager,' which I have seen happen a thousand times.",
      "\"Once that happens, the manager is as good as dead, because he has failed in his major undertaking, which is to motivate the players to follow him.\"",
      "While Ten Hag survived the summer, he was sacked in October, although the arrival of Amorim has clearly not quelled Garnacho's outspokenness.",
      "More tension between Garnacho and United surfaced when the club refused his request to represent his country at the Paris Olympics, as it would have led to him missing the start of the Premier League season.",
      "United stood firm despite Garnacho pleading his case in person to Ten Hag, whose stance can perhaps be understood as he desperately needed a strong start to the season after finishing eighth in 2023/24.",
      "Garnacho’s representatives aren’t afraid to speak their minds either, and it doesn’t just to apply to United matters. In 2023, agent Enrique de Lucas let rip at the Spanish Football Federation after his player opted to switch his allegiance to Argentina, having represented Spain at youth level.",
      "De Lucas hit out at “bad politics” as he told Ole : “I think that Spain is a closed issue and there is no hiding it. Very bad management by the Spanish Federation, I don’t know who, or I can guess who, but very bad management or very bad politics. And I think Garna is not going to be the only case in which a player with dual nationality could lose, I honestly tell you.",
      "“And he decides to go with Argentina because he really feels it. For him it has not been a trauma at all, quite the contrary. When that possibility opens up for him, imagine, being able to play with a team like Argentina, all his maternal family, his grandparents, he has felt them since he was littleand for him it’s not a problem, it’s a blessing.”",
      "Roberto also has a history of fiery statements. He once let rip at fans after his sibling’s goal against Wolves in May 2023, which came after Garnacho had been criticised on social media. Roberto blasted to one social media user: “Apologise as much as you disrespected, b******.”"

Despite losing 1-0 to Ange Postecoglou’s side in the San Mames Stadium, United are understood to have decided to go ahead with the barbecue at the club’s Carrington training ground, for players, their families and staff.",

      "Club chiefs are also standing behind head coach Ruben Amorim. United’s meek 1-0 defeat compounded their worst top-flight campaign since relegation 51 years ago – a point above victors Spurs – heading into Sunday’s season finale at home to Aston Villa.",
      "Amorim has overseen just six Premier League wins since succeeding Erik ten Hag in November and admitted after Wednesday’s costly defeat he would walk away without compensation if the club or fans wanted him to.",
      "Heading into the final, it was believed the Portuguese had the club’s full support irrespective of the outcome and he indeed retains the backing of the hierarchy despite the painful loss in Spain.",
      "Several United players emphatically threw their support behind Amorim after the drab defeat, with Bruno Fernandes saying he was “the right man” for what the club still see as a longer-term project. United's skipper was left distraught by the defeat and admitted he could be sold by club bosses this summer",
      "Luke Shaw said the candid coach is “100 per cent the right person” to oversee a change in “mindset” and “standards”, with fellow full-back Diogo Dalot offering similar support.",

      "“A lot of changes are happening at the same time, but ultimately it’s going to be what we do on the pitch. We have to take responsibility from that. Nobody apart from us is going on to the pitch and trying to get results.”"

United were toothless and uninspired as they let Spurs clinch their first major trophy since 2008.",
      "The scrappy 1-0 victory also gifted Ange Postecolou the added dusting of Champions League football for next season. Ruben Amorim's side will now walk away from the 2024/2025 season having failed to capture any silverware, and there is a real threat that they now could finish as low as 17th in the table if results don't go their way this weekend.",
      "As United desperately attempt to stave off humiliation on the Premier League's final day on Sunday, just a few miles up the East Lancs Road, Liverpool will be lifting their 20th top-flight trophy. What this all could mean for United's pull in the transfer market is largely unprecedented.",
      "With no European football to offer, as well as the financial implications that Wednesday's loss brings, even the most ardent of United loyalists will find themselves concerned.",
      "Liverpool, however, now look like they're prepared to sit at Europe's top-table when it comes to transfers, and it seems the Red Devils have been left to feast on their scraps.",
      "Reports suggest that United have entered the race for Lyon winger Rayan Cherki. The 21-year-old French star was thought to be a target for Arne Slot, however Liverpool are now thought to have pivoted their attention to one of the most in-demand players on the continent in the shape of Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.",
      "The reality of United now chasing their fiercest rivals' back-up transfer options will be an uncomfortable truth and a bitter pill for the Old Trafford faithful to swallow. But it's just another blow to suck up as they are forced to sit back and watch as the Anfield outfit reascend the very perch that Sir Alex Ferguson gleefully knocked them off years ago.",
      "Slot's achievement this season also means Liverpool have accumulated 47 major trophies in England, ranking them as the country's most successful club, while United remain on 44 - the stuff of nightmares for those on the red side of Manchester.",
      "However, they are still United in name and, regardless of the woes they are traversing, good players will come. United are believed to be confident of signing Wolves playmaker Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and they are also heavily interested in Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap.",
      "Before their Europa League final crash-out, Amorim confirmed that the club did have a contingency in place should they lose, but he didn't shy away from what defeat would ultimately mean.",
      "\"We have two plans even for the market,\" he said. \"And we need to understand that is tough for a club like us not to be in the Champions League.\"",
      "With Bayern Munich offering heavyweight competition for Wirtz's signature, Liverpool are likely to have to fork out a club-record fee to bring him to Anfield.",
      "Yet even if Wirtz remains elusive, Liverpool's closing in on the signing of Leverkusen full-back Jeremie Frimpong, while being linked with players such as Atletico Madrid's Julien Alvarez and Bournemouth's exciting left-back Milos Kerkez should send shockwaves through United.",

      "No, it wasn't nightmare, it really happened. Manchester United lost the chance to salvage their season by winning the Europa League final, as a dreadful 1-0 loss against Tottenham condemned Ruben Amorim's side to a trophyless campaign.",
      "But it's not just this term which has been marred by the defeat in Bilbao. Lifting the trophy at the San Memes would've given United a ticket for the 2025-26 Champions League and earned the club around £100million.",
      "If you believe co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, that kind of cash would've been transformative for the Red Devils' finances. But it's gone Spurs' way, leaving beleaguered boss Amorim to sift through the wreckage and plan for what's set to be a difficult summer and domestic-only season.",
      "Who'll be signed? Who'll be sold? Will Amorim even be in charge? The Portuguese dropped a bombshell post-match and said that he'll walk away if the United board don't think that he's the right man for the job.",
      "Altay Bayindir, thanks for the Arsenal saves but we're going to need stiffer competition for Andre Onana. For the £52m which Onana cost, I'd say United would've been better off spending the money elsewhere and keeping David de Gea.",
      "But this is where we are. In light of Onana wanting to stay, the Red Devils could do with a young goalkeeper who can push him to improve - or take his place. United have an established relationship with Belgian side Royal Antwerp stretching back two decades, so signing their young shot-stopper, Senne Lammens, makes sense, as the 22-year-old shouldn't be too expensive.",
      "There's an argument to be made that United's strongest position when it comes to depth is central defence - at least when they're all fit. Leny Yoro is looking more the part every game, Harry Maguire has enjoyed a resurgence, Matthijs de Ligt is proven at the top level and Lisandro Martinez will come back from injury next season.",
      "But given Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof's looming departures, and even with Ayden Heaven breaking through, it leaves United short. We're working on a budget here, though, so I'd bring in Bayer Leverkusen's Jonathan Tah on a free transfer.",
      "At 29, he's three years younger than Maguire and unlike the rest of United's centre-backs has an impeccable injury record over the last five years. Tah is a leader and before confirming his departure helped Leverkusen follow-up last season's league and cup double with a solid campaign this term.",
      "That's why Bayern Munich and Barcelona are still interested in the Germany international, who's also been linked with Real Madrid. It's a hard sell on paper but United need leaders who can play consistently and Tah fits the bill.",
      "At left-back, Luke Shaw, Patrick Dorgu and Harry Amass provide hot competition and the highly-rated Diego Leon is also on his way, so no stress there. On the right, Noussair Mazraoui is a good utility man and I'd think we'd see the best Diogo Dalot if United reverted to a back four.",
      "This is where I'm going bold. Sell Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Yes, I know - I get where they'd statistically be without his goals and assists. But the cold reality is that Fernandes is unlikely to ever be part of a title-winning United side.",
      "The United captain turns 31 in September, so I'd do exactly what the man himself hinted at just minutes after the Europa League final: cash in. Let Fernandes go and rebuild with the kind of fee you could get for him from a Saudi Arabian club.",
      "He'll be missed, of course, and he remains the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. But United need to take the long road back and Fernandes' sale would, in my opinion, have the potential to do more good than his short-term impact.",
      "Following Fernandes out of the door would be Casemiro. Credit to him for bouncing back this season but he showed again in Bilbao that his powers are waning.",
      "Christian Eriksen is almost certain to leave, so we'd be left with a stark lack of experience in midfield. So let's go back to Germany, where Joao Palhinha has spent a mixed first season at Bayern under Vincent Kompany, where he's made only 24 appearances.",
      "The ex-Fulham midfielder felt like a belated Thomas Tuchel signing and he's evidently more suited to the Premier League. Palhinha may've lost confidence and momentum in Bavaria but he'll be a better player for the experience.",
      "And with Bayern pursuing the £126m-rated Florian Wirtz, they'll need all the cash they can get. Back at United, where Mason Mount and youngster Toby Collyer would pick up more minutes in 25-26, you're not going to recoup what you spent on Manuel Ugarte. I wouldn't give up on him yet, though.",
      "The Uruguayan has had a year to get used to the rigours of the Premier League and could strike up a balanced partnership with Kobbie Mainoo, who United must not sell. Not only would the Red Devils be losing a player who I believe is one of the most talented midfielders in Europe, they'd be turning their back on tradition and the United way - selling their soul if one single transfer ever could.",
      "Where do we even start here? Marcus Rashford - sell. Antony - sell. Those decisions seem to have already been made by the hierarchy but in fairness to the pair, they've not been why United have struggled for goals in the second half of the season.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund needs a loan move, somewhere where he can get used to hearing the sound of the net bulge and the crowd roar again. The raw materials are there but right now Joshua Zirkzee, who's also still a rough diamond, should be starting.",
      "This is where I'll go against United's plans. It's not the right time for Liam Delap - even for £30m.",
      "The Red Devils should go for someone more established like Victor Osimhen. Napoli are open to a sale and I'd explore some kind of swap deal with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Osimhen's prolific loan spell with Galatasaray this terms has only boosted his stock, but it doesn't seem like there's concrete interest from Premier League clubs. Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko and Hugo Ekitike are taking up more column inches, so there's an opportunity to nab the Nigerian striker, who could serve as a mentor to United's Chido Obi.",
      "On paper, Matheus Cunha is exactly the type of signing that United should be making. Proven in the Premier League, entering his peak, but questions remain over his attitude and £62.5m isn't cheap.",
      "If United can get the dressing room culture right by signing the likes of Tah, though, the Brazilian's brashness can be harnessed in the best way. His versatility would make United more unpredictable in atack and he can play behind Osimhen or out wide.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is another Premier League-proven target but he's now likely out of United's price range, but Lyon's Rayan Cherki could be a risk worth taking for his rumoured £25m release clause. The 21-year-old playmaker has had a tumultuous rise in France but United witnessed his brilliance in the Europa League.",
      "Given that Cherki is another forward who can play out wide or centrally, he and Cunha could fill the creative void left by Fernandes. It's a big swing but United need to start accepting short-term pain for long-term gain."

      "But skipper Bruno Fernandes immediately threw his weight behind the manager and his countryman did the same.",
      "Dalot said: “I'm 100 percent sure that he's the right man for us because I see it every day, the standards that he has, what he demands from us, the view that he has for the club, for the players, for the coaching staff.”",
      "Luke Shaw also made a passionate defence of Amorim but went on to suggest the players should now be questioning whether or not they are good enough to be representing United. And Dalot, 26, went down the same path, urging his team-mates to use the summer break to evaluate their contributions to the club’s cause.",
      "He said: “We still have one game to play but in the time that we're gonna be away, we need to think about what we should do better and as soon as the season starts, we need to change things.",
      "“I think the demands from each other have to be a lot higher. Ultimately, what you do every day will determine if you win things in the long term. So that is the standard of this club. And if we don't do that every single day, it's gonna be really hard for you to put this club back on top.”",
      "But Dalot is also not the first United player to question whether or not the squad has got the psychological strength to establish themselves as a winning force.",
      "Dalot said: “Results will determine a lot of things in football, as you know. When you don't win games, you always tend to go towards more negativity than positivity.",
      "“The reality is that this season we didn't get the results that we wanted. Sometimes we deserved better, sometimes pretty much a lot of times we didn't. We need to find a way to win games and we need to find that winning mentality.",
      "“That will make us feel more confident and as soon as we start having that consistency, I think things will start going up.",
      "“If we keep this rollercoaster of results, of emotions, of standards, it will be really hard.",

      "Manchester United capped off their worst season in 51 years by going out with a whimper in their Europa League final clash with Tottenham.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side needed a win to salvage their season and qualify for next term's Champions League after a woeful campaign, which could see them finish the Premier League season just one place above the relegation zone in 17th.",
      "But the Red Devils couldn’t find the net against a Spurs side who had also endured a tumultuous season to forget. It was the north Londoners who emerged the 1-0 victors and lifted their first trophy since 2008, thanks to a goal that deflected in off Brennan Johnson late in the first half.",
      "A defeated Amorim offered to quit United in his post-match press conference, promising that he would leave without receiving any compensation if the club believed he was no longer good enough to be head coach.",
      "Having been appointed in November, the former Sporting CP boss has only managed to win six out of 26 league games, and has now failed to secure European football for next season by missing out on silverware.",
      "Amorim stated he remains confident in his methods but reiterated that it was down to the club's decision-makers and supporters to decide if he is the right man to continue at the helm.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not going to be here defending myself, it is not my style,\" Amorim said. \"I cannot do it, it is really hard for me. So I have nothing to show the fans to say I am going to improve because of this, I had these problems, I will not do nothing [sic].",
      "\"In this moment, it's a little bit of faith. So let's see. Like I said before, coming here before in the flash, I am always open. If the board and fans feel that I'm not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation. But I will not quit again. I am really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things.\"",
      "Amorim went on to say that United were the better team against Tottenham but addressed the side's lack of firepower, adding: \"What I can say is it was clear we were the better team, but we managed not to score again, and that is really hard to win football matches. But the guys tried everything to win the game. In the future, we will have time to assess everything.\"",
      "Red Devils captain Bruno Fernandes echoed his manager's comments by saying he would be willing to leave this summer if club bosses decide to cash in on him. The 30-year-old, who joined in January 2020 and has made close to 300 appearances, has consistently been United's best player in their worst era in recent memory.",
      "But his efforts proved fruitless again on Wednesday. He missed out on the chance to land his biggest trophy as a United player with a second Europa League final defeat, which ensured he will not be playing any European football next season.",
      "The midfielder, who turns 31 in September, has two years remaining on his contract with the option of a further year. He has recently been linked with a stunning move to Al-Hilal in the Saudi Pro League, with such a transfer transforming the financial picture at United.",
      "While Fernandes insists he's happy to stay at Old Trafford and help Amorim in his rebuild, the Portugal international astonishingly revealed he would be willing to leave if club bosses look to sell him.",
      "\"I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go,\" he admitted post-game. \"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. On the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this. It's very sad. We wanted to win more than anything in this final. It's a very sad day because we've done some very good things in this competition until today.",
      "\"But today was the day that mattered, the most important day of the competition. It was the day we could have been in the history of the Europa League, but it's not like that. And football is cruel, and it's been our turn to lose.\"",
      "Defender Luke Shaw, who played the full 90 minutes of the crushing defeat in Bilbao, said his team-mates must take a look at themselves and decide whether they are good enough to be at the club.",
      "\"It's hard to put into words the season, but I think for a club like Manchester United, it's not really good enough,\" said the England left-back.",
      "\"I think definitely me and I think all of us have to question ourselves tonight. Are we good enough to be here? Because this club, this season, it's not acceptable. We know that and it's down to us. I think we have to look at ourselves. Something has to change.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "United's deal with the German manufacturer dictates that they cannot spend successive years out of Europe's top tournament, but a dire Premier League season and a Europa League final loss means the Champions League continues to elude them.",
      "Not only do they miss out on all the revenue on offer, but they'll also have to fork out an eight-figure sum. It is another financial blow for the Red Devils who continue to fall from the heights they once enjoyed.",
      "Even during their struggles post-Sir Alex Ferguson only once had they been without European football of any type - that coming in 2014/15. Next year will now be the same as Ruben Amorim's side languish down in 16th spot with one game of the season left.",
      "United, even though results have nosedived and trophies have been less frequent, have remained a huge brand and been able to attract commercial partners. Now though that pull is beginning to fade.",
      "The Tezos sponsorship of the club's training kit ends this summer and as of yet there is no announcement about any replacement, which would be another source of revenue they'd be without. One senior figure at the club believes their sponsorship income could now collapse.",
      "They told the BBC : \"Not being a European team creates more existential issues around the whole model. It's not healthy, and people start to question whether you are still a 'big club'. But win, and it keeps the wheels spinning. The cash will be 'lifeblood' that allows them to keep trading. If not, they'll have to look at selling homegrown talent like Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo to give them the funds they want.\"",
      "Ironically Amorim had confessed he didn't want to be in the Champions League, but was speaking from a playing point of view, not financial. He has got his wish after his side failed to turn up in the Europa League final with Tottenham ending their own trophy drought.",
      "Earlier this month Amorim by no means dismissed the notion of winning the Europa League, but was open about the struggles they would face in Europe given the state of the squad. \"We are not ready to play in the Premier League, be competitive, and to be in the Champions League,\" he said.",
      "\"We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition [Europa League], to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League. Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions. So, it is a dilemma, but we want to win, of course.\"",
      "United are due to embark on a squad overhaul with Amorim needing to bring in players to suit his specific system, whilst others are set to depart. In recent weeks Matheus Cunha at Wolves and Ipswich frontman Liam Delap have been on the club's radar.",
      "Its been reported that, even without Champions League revenue, the club would be able to press on with both signings, who will likely cost just over £90m combined. Reinforcements on the flanks will also be needed and possible faces in midfield."

      "Given the shambolic season they have endured since his arrival, Amorim has long felt United would be better off without the added burden of Europe next season. Amorim believed the best scenario would be no European commitments next season, giving him more time to work with his squad, without the burden of additional games the players are clearly not equipped for.",
      "Such a view is a damning indictment of where United now find themselves – a club that once ruled at home and abroad, but one whose manager feels is better off not embarrassing itself on Europe's biggest stage.",
      "Given how lamentably United performed in Bilbao, Amorim's belief that a season out of Europe could ultimately work in their favour – short-term pain for long-term gain – looks to be well-founded. But United's failure to win in Bilbao – and with it a place in the Champions League next season worth up to £100million in revenue – means more tough decisions will need to be taken at a club that has already embarked on mass redundancies to cut costs.",
      "With fewer games, Amorim will have to operate with a smaller squad, and without the financial income from a European campaign, players will have to be sold to generate revenue. United are also now likely to struggle to attract their first-choice transfer targets, given they cannot offer prospective signings European football, just a thin set of domestic fixtures.",
      "The club are paying the price for more than a decade of mismanagement and poor recruitment in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. That has now caught up with the fallen giants and defeat in Bilbao will only serve to prolong their stay among football's supporting cast.",
      "Amorim, not for the first time this season, issued a 'back me or sack me' ultimatum moments after the final whistle in Bilbao, offering to go without compensation if the United hierarchy felt that was best. United insisted Amorim's position would not be under threat, whatever the result in Bilbao, but Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cronies have previous for going back on their word – just ask Erik ten Hag and former sporting director Dan Ashworth, both sacked after initially being backed.",
      "It remains to be seen if 40-year-old Amorim suffers the same fate. After Sunday's final game of the season against Aston Villa, United fly straight to the Far East for a two-match post-season tour worth £10m.",
      "It is the last thing Amorim and his deflated players want to do, but says everything about United's dire financial state that they are now forced to hawk their players across the other side of the world for exhibition matches to boost their flagging finances.",
      "But the biggest call United face this summer is Amorim, whether to stick or twist. More than three decades ago, with United regressing under Ferguson, the board were under pressure to sack him, but held their nerve and went on to enjoy an unprecedented era of success.",
      "Will the current board show Amorim the same faith? Only time will tell. But if they decide to cut their losses, United will find themselves back to square one, with no guarantee the next man in charge will fare any better."

There was a real lack of quality and they’ve [United] almost brought their league form to the table, but there’s been tension, obviously, and Spurs managed to get their noses in front. We mentioned before the game about getting bodies in there, United having bodies back, but not obviously not doing defensive job.",

Remember there’s only one ball. Just focus on the ball sometimes.",

      "Bruno Fernandes believes Manchester United's decision-makers could be tempted to take Sir Jim Ratcliffe up on Ruben Amorim's offer to quit the club without compensation after defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "But the club captain urged Sir Jim Ratcliffe to stick with the head coach and said he won't find a better option than the 40-year-old to take charge of the club.",
      "Amorim made his offer to walk away for free if United decide he isn't the man for the job in his post-match press conference after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham in Bilbao, but a queue of United players lined up to reaffirm their faith in the former Sporting boss.",
      "Amorim has lost 16 and won just 15 of his 41 games in charge in all competition, with just six of those victories coming in the Premier League, and Fernandes admitted it would be \"easier\" to get a different coach in now.",
      "He insists that would be the wrong approach, however, and urged club bosses to stay calm as they assess Amorim's future over the next few days following defeat at San Mames.",
      "\"It’s not my decision but I do think the manager is the right one and I don’t think that it will be a better person to come into the job and do the job,\" Fernandes said of his countryman.",
      "\"I know it's difficult to understand that, it's difficult to see that. But I still do think that he's the right man to lead the club. I do think that the club is in a situation where it's easier to get a different one in because the results haven't been there.",
      "\"But as my other teammates said, and I repeat myself, I do think he's the right man.\"",

      "He called this the worst United team ever in January and also said they were in a relegation battle, and he has regularly said he expects to be replaced if he doesn't turn the club's fortunes around.",
      "\"We just agree that he's the right man. He has done a lot of good things,\" said Fernandes.",
      "\"We know that the manager is looked at by the results. Obviously we see more than that as players. We know for everyone it will be about him bringing back the positivity in the club.

      "It's a disappointing morning for United following Wednesday night's Europa League final against Tottenham. Ruben Amorim's men failed to take their chances and fell to Brennan Johnson's scrappy first-half winner.",
      "It means there will be no European football at the club next season and no lucrative financial injection. United need open-heart surgery, and at least two players will be signed, but many more are being targeted.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap are two known targets who look likely to arrive. However, the loss against Tottenham does strike a blow to their chances of signing Viktor Gyokeres, who is understood to be keen on Champions League football.",
      "Catch up with the latest news, views and Manchester United transfer rumours below.",
      "A football finance expert has said Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday night means they will miss out on around £85million in additional revenue.",
      "Professor Rob Wilson, Director of Executive Education at University Campus of Football Business, has outlined just how costly United's failure to get back into the Champions League will be. \"Having lost the Europa League, Manchester United have probably missed out on something between £10m to £15m in direct prize money,\" Wilson told Genting Casino.",
      "\"That was made up of around £4m for winning the final, somewhere between £3m and £5m from an increased UEFA coefficient share. Then there's elements around commercial bonuses, appearance fees, match day revenues that they would have benefited from. What we then need to remember of course is that there will also be an offset there.",
      "\"So they won't have bonus payments to pay, for instance, for their player wages. So that's quite an important factor to include. The qualification that they've missed out on in the Champions League has cost them around £85m of additional revenue. That revenue is due to broadcast, gate receipts and some of those UEFA payments.",
      "\"The fact that the club has missed out on that revenue is quite a blow to their budget line and will affect what they're able to do in the transfer market this summer, not just from an amount of cash perspective and what they can spend on transfers but also the type of players they can attract as a result of having no European football given their league position.\"",
      "The club is reportedly aware of the conditions required to trigger the clause. However, there has been no 'direct contact' between the clubs so far, though those formalities are expected to happen once the season ends.",

      "Roberto Garnacho caused a stir again after the final on Wednesday night when he posted on social media: \"Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe, hahahaha.\"",

      "He did go close to cancelling out Brennan Johnson's first half opener when he saw a header expertly cleared off the line by Spurs centre-back Micky van de Ven, but that was his only notable contribution.",
      "He was replaced by Joshua Zirkzee, who had recovered from a hamstring injury ahead of schedule, with 20 minutes to go and the Dutchman gave United more mobility in attack, with the former Bologna man dropping into pockets of space to try and link the play and get United up the pitch.",
      "As effective as Zirkzee had been as a No.10 prior to his spell on the sidelines, it had long since been discovered that he was not a natural alternative to Hojlund to spearhead United's attack.",
      "The pair have scored 17 goals between them this season, of which only seven have come in the Premier League. It has been obvious for some time that a striker must headline United's shopping list this summer.",
      "But having lost to Spurs and missed out on Champions League qualification for next season, United are now expected to be shopping in a different market to the one they had planned to had they secured a place back at European football's top table.",
      "United will not feature in any European competition for the first time since the 2014/15 campaign. They need to gut their squad this summer and rebuild from almost a blank canvas but are not going to be as attractive an option as they would have been had they have clinched Champions League qualification.",
      "Of course, the pull of playing for United will always be there. However, many players United have been linked with in recent months will believe they can find better options.",
      "Among them will be strikers Viktor Gyokeres and Jonathan David. Gyokeres is increasingly likely to leave Sporting Lisbon this summer and a possible reunion with United head coach Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford has been mooted for months.",
      "Having scored 53 times this season to establish himself as one of Europe's best goal-getters, Gyokeres will have the pick of the crop this summer. The former Coventry City man, who scored six goals in eight Champions League appearances this season, has been linked with the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Barcelona. Those three are streets ahead of United and will be able to offer him Champions League football.",
      "David, who announced last week he will be leaving Lille this summer when his contract expires, is another who will have ambitions of playing in the Champions League next term. He scored 25 goals this season, including seven in the Champions League, and is available on a free transfer.",
      "Arguments have been put forward more than once for United to try and sign David this summer, but it was always going rely on winning the Europa League.",
      "The Canada international cemented himself as one of Europe's most consistent strikers over five seasons in France and his numbers made for excellent reading. He is continuing to be linked with a cluster of clubs who have qualified for next season's Champions League, including Barcelona, meaning he will not be short on offers.",
      "United, in their current situation, do not stand a chance of attracting players like Gyokeres and David. United's history and size will always be appealing, but their recruitment this summer will have a ceiling as a result of this season's failures. Unfortunately, players in the category of Gyokeres and David are above it."

      "The appointment of Ruben Amorim was supposed to be the start of a new era at Manchester United, but as Amorim and his players trudged out of the San Mames stadium in the early hours of Thursday morning, it felt more like the end.",
      "For months, this team had survived an ordeal of Thursday night highwire acts, but they could never escape their reality. One false step in the Europa League would transform them from a team chasing glory to one stripped of its protective layer.",
      "So when they were finally exposed in Bilbao, they looked more vulnerable than at any point this season. Within seconds of full-time, the United end had virtually emptied, furious at the meekness of the performance they had just seen in a European final.",
      "By the time those supporters were back in the bars around Plaza Nueva or in buses and taxis back to Santander, San Sebastian, or Vitoria, they would have been reading about Amorim's offer to walk away without a penny in compensation if United decide he isn't the man for the job.",
      "The majority of these supporters still back the 40-year-old - although some are now harbouring doubts - and he will get support at Old Trafford on Sunday, but Ineos will surely give that offer at least some consideration. Sir Jim Ratcliffe likes the way Amorim shoots from the hip, but words will only get you so far.",
      "It is deeds that will keep Amorim in a job. He has now lost 16 of his 41 games in charge and is primarily the head coach associated with the club's worst season in 51 years. The players will carry that stain with them as well.",
      "By my reckoning, it's been three years since a United player last spoke to the written media in a mixed zone after a Premier League defeat, when David de Gea volunteered for a mea culpa after the 4-0 loss at Brentford. As part of their UEFA obligations, three players had to stand on a podium and talk into a microphone in the bowels of San Mames.",
      "Luke Shaw was up first, and the emotion was writ large on his face. One colleague remarked afterwards that he thought Shaw might actually burst into tears. He wore a haunted, pained expression and struggled to find the right words. Anyone who says these players don’t care enough should have taken one look at Shaw and realised that is the wrong diagnosis.",
      "His introspective assessment that every player in that dressing room should be assessing whether they are good enough to remain at Old Trafford drew headlines and respect. He has been here 11 years and has seen the club's decline first-hand. This, now, is surely rock bottom, so how did we get to this point?",
      "Shaw stared back, gave the question plenty of thought, and then began, \"Honestly, I don't know.\" It was honest and raw. Like Diogo Dalot, who would follow, he pinned the blame on the players rather than the manager.",
      "But after Amorim had offered to quit, captain Bruno Fernandes made it clear that he would be willing to leave if United decided the time was right to cash in on him. It's impossible not to feel for Fernandes in these situations.",
      "He has carried this team on his back for five-and-a-half years, and his general excellence has delivered him a League Cup and an FA Cup medal. He turns 31 in four months and will spend next season without any European football and must surely realise that trying to drive this club back to the top will now take the rest of his career. He can't be blamed for at least leaving the door ajar to a departure.",
      "Six months after Amorim's appointment, this night felt like the end of something. Shaw, Fernandes, and Dalot backed their manager, at least, but it's clear they feel standards aren't being met. Their demands on each other aren't high enough.",
      "On the opposite side of the room, Alejandro Garnacho opted to speak to the Spanish press, and it was clear the 20-year-old had a lot to get off his chest. Garnacho was livid not to start, having begun all six knockout ties to this point. He was even angrier to only get 19 minutes off the bench.",
      "As he walked past the bank of cameras, his brother had already accused Amorim of throwing him \"under the bus,\" and Garnacho pulled no punches either.",
      "When he was asked about not starting, his facial expression and a deep sigh during his answer betrayed his emotions even more than his words did.",
      "\"Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next,\" he said.",
      "It's no secret that United are also tempted to cash in on Garnacho. After Wednesday evening, he could be tempted to look for an exit.",
      "So there will be no silverware to save a dreadful season. No ticket to the Champions League and no £100m boost to the revenues at Old Trafford.",
      "It didn't take long for the regret and recriminations to kick in in Bilbao, and at the end of the night, so many questions remained: Will Sir Jim Ratcliffe take Amorim up on his offer? Is there any way back for Garnacho? Is this the end of the road for Fernandes?",
      "And if the players are blaming each other, how does Amorim, or whoever the manager is, rekindle a fractured team spirit?",
      "A night that could have helped kickstart the Amorim era ended up feeling like it might already be close to the end."

      "For Manchester United, Wednesday evening at the Estadio de San Mames could have brought about a silver lining to a dire season, one that would have allowed them to accelerate their plans for a rebuild.",
      "But a 1-0 defeat to Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur, another club that needed the boost that a Europa League final success had to offer, meant that the Red Devils’ UEFA Champions League hopes disappeared, with Spurs instead punching their ticket to the league phase of next season’s competition.",
      "That qualification has earned Spurs a lucrative sum to enable them to head into the summer transfer market with plenty more ammunition than they would have had otherwise. For United, a club that has an annual wage bill of £365m, one of the largest in the Premier League, and transfer debt of £331m, the third largest in the league, against transfer receivables of just £60m due, the loss in Spain will be impactful.",
      "Qualification for the Champions League yields enormous success. With participation alone worth £15.6m and every victory and draw in the revamped competition’s league phase delivering an additional £1.7m and £580,000, just making it to the league phase can bring in, conservatively, around £20m, and that is before factoring in any progression to the knockout stages, where the money continues on a steep incline. The Champions League value pillar is more lucrative than that of the Europa League and is worth another £20m to clubs.",
      "Matchday revenue then plays another significant role. Playing in the league phase guarantees four home games for each team, adding an extra £17.2m for United. That means, conservatively, the club could have booked some £70m in Champions League-related revenue before even taking into account the potential for knockout qualification and more matchday revenue.",
      "This isn’t the plan that club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe had envisaged playing out when he paid £1.2bn for a 27.7% stake in the football club, complete with football strategy oversight, back in December of 2023.",
      "Job cuts of 250 or more have painted a picture of a club that needs to address its cost base, and Ratcliffe has been candid about that. The way that the club approaches the transfer market this summer will also be instructive about how big a challenge Ratcliffe and club head coach Ruben Amorim face in turning around the tanker for next season. It will be a long process.",
      "The era, for now at least, of United being at the table for the biggest deals and the biggest fees for the top talent is over. That has to be accepted. It is a club in decline, and this season should have shown club chiefs that they cannot simply trade on just being Manchester United.",
      "Champions League qualification would have addressed some of what ails them, but not all of it, and questions still remain about just how much capital should be allocated to the transfer market to a manager who has so far endured a dismal record and faces starting next season already fighting for his Red Devils career so early on.",
      "The club already face diminished revenue from the Premier League via its central funding. The club currently sit 16th, which would earn them £14m in merit payments. That is a sum £22.7m less than the £36.7m that they managed to achieve last year, and with the Europa League money that has been earned from this season, which includes matchday revenue attributable to the competition, standing at £65.7m, that will be absent from the forecasts for the next financial year.",
      "The focus will be on driving down payroll and more aggressive player trading in terms of outgoings to try and claw back some of the deficit. It seems likely now, without the benefit of Champions League funds next season, and the diminished commercial revenues from Adidas by £10m as per the clause in their deal if United fail to make the Champions League two seasons in a row, that what happens in terms of incomings will be guided by who leaves Old Trafford, and that puts the club on the backfoot in the market. It’s unlikely the club will make early moves because they don’t have the financial flexibility to take on such risk without alighting themselves of some big earners for a profit.",
      "These are tough times and Manchester United, and the impact of defeat last night in the face of what has been a dramatic competitive decline cannot be overstated. Ratcliffe has talked a good game about where he sees the club in the future, but that vision is further and further away with each missed opportunity. There is now little room for manoeuvre and where United find themselves in five years will be determined by how they manage to navigate the financial struggles of the present."

      "Manchester United's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham further proves that the club is in dire need of reinforcements.",
      "The defeat to Spurs marks only the second time in 35 years that United have failed to qualify for European competition and officially confirms their worst season since relegation in 1974.",
      "However, those in charge won’t have to wait much longer to get their business underway, with the summer transfer window set to open on June 1. And Ruben Amorim has already confirmed the club's stance on the market.",
      "\"We have two plans even for the market,\" Amorim confirmed. \"We need to understand that is tough for a club like us not to be in the Champions League. But we have to use the other side. We have more time to work during the week on the Premier League and that will be our focus.\"",
      "The club is reportedly aware of the conditions required to trigger the clause. However, there has been no 'direct contact' between the clubs so far, though those formalities are expected to happen once the season ends.",
      "Other clubs are also interested in Cunha, but he is thought to prefer a move to United.",
      "MEN Sport says: This appears to be the only positive piece of transfer news at the moment. Missing out on Champions League football could have serious consequences for the club when it comes to attracting new players.",
      "The Brazilian’s reported willingness to join the Reds despite the lack of European football is encouraging, and securing a player like Cunha would strengthen their squad for next season. However, it’s clear they’ll need more than just Cunha to significantly improve Ruben Amorim’s side.",
      "TalkSPORT have provided an update on Liam Delap, with Newcastle United said to hold talks with Ipswich Town's in-demand striker 'this week.'",
      "In addition to United and Chelsea, Newcastle are thought to be one of the clubs who have shown interest in triggering the 22-year-old's £30million release clause. Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano says the striker is still 'exploring his options' after holding talks with Chelsea and United.",
      "In his Caught Offside column, Romano wrote: \"There is genuine interest from two very important clubs – Chelsea and Manchester United. Both clubs have several targets on their shortlists between them, but for sure the interest in Delap is concrete and genuine. My understanding is that Delap has spoken to Chelsea and to Manchester United, and now it’s time for him to explore all the options possible.",
      "\"From what I’m hearing there is also interest from clubs in the Bundesliga – important clubs from Germany would be ready to hold talks with the player and offer him an important contract. Still, the player’s priority is very clear – to stay in the Premier League, to stay in England.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: This could be a major blow for United, especially after missing out on Champions League football next season. Clubs like Chelsea and Newcastle are likely to be able to offer that to Delap, should he choose to join one of them. While United's chiefs appear to have beaten off competition for Cunha’s signature, this deal is could be more complicated.",
      "Arsenal appear to be in pole position to secure Viktor Gyokeres' signature - especially after their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League. The 1-0 loss meant that United missed out on a lucrative return to the Champions League next season.",
      "To fund further spending, they'll need to offload some high-profile players, with Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho potentially on their way out. Meanwhile, Gyökeres is eager to test himself at the highest level, aiming to compete in the Champions League and fight for major trophies next season.",
      "Speaking on Portuguese television channel Sic Noticias, Gyokeres was asked what the future holds and said: \"Hopefully you can expect I keep improving and score goals.\"",
      "When probed further about what this summer holds, the striker made no guarantees to Sporting: \"We'll see. It's the future. Football is like that, you never know what's going to happen. As we saw this season, you never know what's going to happen. And it's the same thing now. We'll see what the future holds.\"",
      "MEN Sport says: Unfortunately, missing out on a Champions League spot could see Gyokeres head to north London instead. This highlights the growing contrast between the two clubs - Arsenal are competing for titles every season, while United have fallen short, enduring their worst league campaign since the 1973/74 season.",
      "At present, United simply can't compete with Arsenal in terms of consistency, squad quality, and Champions League football - all of which give the Gunners a clear edge in attracting top talent."

      "Diogo Dalot has backed Ruben Amorim as \"100% the right man\" to lead Manchester United forward and blamed the players for the club's worst season in 51 years.",
      "United saw the chance to salvage something from a dismal campaign end with defeat in the Europa League final in Bilbao, and they go into the final weekend of the Premier League season in danger of finishing 17th, propped up only by the three relegated sides.",
      "The defeat to Tottenham at San Mames will invite fresh speculation on the future of Amorim, who has offered to walk away without compensation if the club feel he is no longer the right man for the job.",
      "But his players were queuing up to back him last night, and Dalot instead turned the focus onto the dressing room and suggested the players weren't demanding enough from each other and had let standards slip.",
      "\"I think the demands from each other, from ourselves, have to be a lot higher,\" he said. \"Ultimately, what you do every day will determine if you win things in the long term. So that is the standard of this club.",
      "\"And if we don't do that every single day, it's going to be really hard for you to put this club back on top. We are going into a very difficult time after this season.",
      "\"I know that everybody's difficult to find positives. You have nothing to grab after the season that we had. But like I said, this time that we're going to be away, we have to fight really hard to start the season well and put this club back where it belongs.\"",
      "Amorim will look to begin an overhaul of the United squad this summer, although his transfer kitty will be decimated by the lack of European football, with defeat to Tottenham closing an avenue to the Champions League and a £100m boost to the coffers.",
      "But the current squad is packed with internationals and multi-million-pound signings. The starting XI in the Europa League final cost £539million to assemble, and they went down with a whimper in what was the biggest game of their season. Dalot is at a loss to explain why they have underperformed.",
      "\"That's the answer that we need to find,\" he said. \"Results will determine a lot of things in football, as you know. When you don't win games, you always tend to go towards more negativity than positivity.",
      "\"The reality is that this season we didn't get the results that we wanted. Sometimes we deserved, sometimes pretty much a lot of times we didn't. I think that's the consistency we need to find. We need to find a way to win games, and that winning mentality.",
      "\"If we keep this rollercoaster of results, of emotions, of standards, it will be really hard. But like I said, this club will never die in my opinion, so if we want to be a part of the team that is going to put Man United back on top, we need to do much, much better.\"",
      "One decision Dalot doesn't want to see taken concerns Amorim. The wing-back is convinced his countryman is the right coach to take United forward despite losing 16 of his 41 games in charge and winning just 15, including only six in the Premier League.",
      "\"I'm 100% sure that he's the right man for us because I see it every day, the standards that he has, what he demands from us, the view that he has for the club, for the players, for the coaching staff,\" said Dalot.",
      "\"A lot of changes are happening at the same time, but ultimately it's going to be what we do on the pitch. We have to take responsibility from that. Nobody apart from us is going to the pitch and try to get results.",
      "\"So this season it's been obviously a way off how this club should be and what this club deserves. So we have to take responsibility on that and take this time that we're going to be away to think about what we should do better and as soon as the season starts, we need to change things.\""

The goal will have completely changed the feeling in the United dressing room at half-time and McCoist believes the trio of Reds players could be at fault for conceding.",

      "But then it's also the case that the two sets of fans do things differently. While Spurs fans were gathering in numbers, smaller groups of Mancunians were seated around tables in different bars across this wonderful city.",

There were groups of five or six, bucket hats on, still singing 'For United are going to Bilbao' while knocking back pints in temperatures that will feel familiar after the spring that Manchester has enjoyed.",
      "There was no mass gathering, though - at least not yet. There might have been more substantial sing-alongs on Tuesday night, and the atmosphere will be cranked up a notch on the day of the final.",
      "There is room for 20,000 fans at United's fanzone in Etxebarria Parkea, with a musical line-up that could sell out Heaton Park, but for many of United's regular European away-dayers, such substantial shows of force and numbers are to be avoided. It's also true that Etxebarria Parkea is at the top of a hill in Bilbao, and as beautiful as the views are, the walk to get there isn't all that much fun.",
      "A group of United fans were scouting it out on Tuesday, climbing the steps to see the ring of steel around it. The big screen is up, and the bars and toilets are ready to go. \"It's f**king miles away,\" didn't suggest they would be going back on game day.",
      "The journey to Bilbao - and the wider Basque Country - has also been challenging. John and John, father and son United fans, were reunited in the city on Tuesday. Dad flew in from Manchester via Amsterdam, but his son was here via Hong Kong.",
      "\"I moved to Hong Kong for work, I don't get back for games often, but I had to be at this one,\" said the younger John.",

      "He is also one of the many United fans who have made the journey without a ticket, but he did the same in Stockholm for the Europa League final against Ajax in 2017 and plans to try the same approach to getting inside San Mames.",
      "\"I don't have a ticket, but everyone says leave it as long as possible, that's what I did in Stockholm,\" he said. \"I left it until five minutes before kick-off and got two tickets for face value, so the longer you hold the nerve, the better you have of getting good value.\"",
      "Although United fans seemed outnumbered on Tuesday, that might not be the case on matchday. Thousands are staying around the Basque Country after refusing to pay the price of accommodation in Bilbao.",

      "The subject of their fun sat on the other side of the United head coach. Harry Maguire has, in many ways, been the hero of this Europa League campaign. An injury-time equaliser at Porto and then that unforgettable winner in extra-time against Lyon that sent Old Trafford into a frenzy.",
      "There was also the twisting, turning dribble down the wing in this very stadium three weeks ago. He went one way, then the other, and then he whipped in a cross that ended with Casemiro setting United on their way to a Europa League semi-final cruise against Athletic Club.",
      "Manuel Ugarte flicked that cross on to Casemiro, so Maguire didn't actually get the assist, which is perhaps Exhibit A as to why these starts can be so worthless. Everyone knows the 32-year-old was the real hero of that goal.",
      "So it was that a journalist asked him if these \"inspirational moments\" in attack were all part of a new tactical plan. Amorim's laughter would suggest not, but Maguire played along.",
      "“The manager has me dribbling down the wing every day in training,\" he said to laughter.",

Another question asked him how it felt to now be so important to this team when, for so long, the noise around him had been \"toxic.\" He swerved that one, but his recovery is one of the feel-good stories out of Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "It's easy to forget now, but the build-up to the Europa League final in Gdansk in 2021 focused on Maguire's fitness. He was nowhere near being fit, but United took him along and had him pictured in training to keep up the suspense.",
      "The next time United reached a cup final, he was a figure of fun, routinely jeered on pre-season tours and captain in name only. He was on the bench for the Carabao Cup final success in 2023 and came on for the final two minutes, sharing the trophy lift with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Maguire stopped to speak to reporters in the mixed zone at Wembley that day and insisted he was happy to be part of a trophy-winning United side after six years without silverware, but he must have been hurting at seeing his role reduced.",
      "\"I don’t have any mixed emotions, it’s been so long since the club won a trophy, it’s a really good day for the club and the fans,\" he said that day.",
      "\"I am club captain and my main job is to move this club forward and to bring success back to the club and today has been part of it. Obviously, listen, I am a footballer who wants to play games and I want to lead the boys out of the tunnel at the start of the game but also like I said I understand this is part and parcel of football when you play at the top level and you have got huge competition for places.",
      "\"It’s a real good day for the club and for me and a proud day for my family who were in the stands and saw me lift my first trophy for Manchester United.\"",
      "United were in an FA Cup final later this season, and Maguire didn't get off the bench in the defeat to Manchester City. A year later, he was injured for the Wembley win against Manchester City.",
      "So in four cup finals since his £80million move from Leicester City in 2019, Maguire has missed two through injury and played a combined two minutes in the other. It sums up his fortunes at United.",
      "But over the last couple of years, the narrative has turned again. For all of those cup final disappointments, the winner against Lyon felt like his moment at United.",
      "“I've had some amazing moments at this club, been here six years now and I've had some great times and some bad times as well,\" he said.",
      "\"I think that game pretty much summed up my time at this club, to be honest! It was an incredible feeling to score that winner in such an important game, in a game that was full of emotion and the strangest, maddest game I've ever played in or witnessed.\"",
      "Now, finally, Maguire will get to play in a cup final. He's no longer captain, but he's more of a leader now than when he wore the armband. He's had to wait for this moment, but few players deserve this final more than Maguire."

This led to some fears that he may choose to step down in the summer or early next season if results do not improve.",

      "\"He's an excellent manager and I think he will be there for a long time. You are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce.",
      "\"I think you saw a glimpse of it against Arsenal. How many players against Arsenal on the bench did you recognise?",
      "\"How many have ever worn a Manchester United shirt for [the first team]… as there's no squad left. We are down to the last 10 or 11 men in the squad really, of proper first-team players. Ruben is doing a super job.\""

      "An agreement regarding his future, which allows him to leave for a set fee, was reportedly reached with his club earlier this year.",
      "His release clause is set at £84.4 million (€100m), but reports suggest he could potentially depart for just £60m. Given both United and Arsenal's need for a striker, the prospect of signing one who has scored 53 goals in 51 appearances at such a price could be hard to resist.",

      "Francisco Trincao also weighed in on Gyokeres' situation during his appearance on Manhas da Comercial. Amidst discussing their tough season following Amorim's departure to United, he humorously suggested that to keep the forward at the club, he would, \"try to lock Gyokeres in the gym\".",
      "The light-hearted confession indicates a sense of resignation that Gyokeres may be playing his last match for Sporting in the upcoming cup final.",

Come 6pm on Sunday while likely looking up from 17th in the Premier League, all that is left beneath is the Championship.",
      "Until now, the thought of Manchester United being relegated has been restricted to the wet dreams of ABUs. Logic says the club is simply too big to fail so spectacularly. But this is not the United of old. F*** knows what this United is.",
      "Now, barely a night’s sleep after losing the Europa League final, it is too much to explore in depth all the issues that make the Red Devils the undisputed banter champions of the world. Too much. Too sad.",
      "In short: United are a failed state. Once the richest of world superpowers, now unashamedly penny-pinching and staff-shedding in an attempt to live within its means, while those most culpable for their decline – players, executives, owners – trouser their grotesque salaries and dividends.",
      "The Glazers don’t give a f***. They milk their ailing cash cow from behind the safety of an INEOS-shaped shield, fronted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe carrying the look of billionaire regretting his life choices. At his stage of life, he doesn’t need this sh*t.",
      "And that’s precisely what the team have served up on a bi-weekly basis. At least, unlike Ratcliffe, the players and coaching staff are only tied to the boulder dragging them to the ocean floor for as long their contracts dictate. Or until someone, anyone, offers to pay actual money for them.",
      "There is perhaps one player, Bruno Fernandes, whose departure would be mourned by a majority of supporters. For many of his team-mates, there would be long queues of fans willing to piggy-back them to their next destination.",
      "It is too simple to say they don’t care. Most do, though predominantly with self-preservation in mind. Being a United player in recent years has been a cushy gig. Unlike other clubs, the personal rewards – the highest salaries and biggest profiles – were guaranteed regardless of the team’s fortunes. It is why Old Trafford remained an attractive destination, even while it was crumbling, literally and metaphorically.",
      "Not now. Would you advise any player to join this circus? Instinctively, the motives and sanity of anyone signing for United this summer will be questioned. Any top talent with a modicum of sense and palatable alternatives would drop their shoulder on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Poor Ruben. He did not want to join United mid-season and, in hindsight, he should have stuck to his guns. It highlights that as recently as six months ago, United still had something like the pull of old to make him doubt his instincts. Now, his first summer coincides with the first in generations when the club has so little to advertise.",
      "If Amorim was a pragmatist, he would consider resigning. He has offered to leave without compensation if the board and fans feel he should. Though he has failed to deliver anything like the improvement that was expected when he replaced Erik ten Hag, or even just a continuation of that dross, he probably still has an acceptable approval rating among fans. Barely.",
      "But if he looks at the task now before him, are his targets achievable? Just a fortnight ago, it was said that Amorim had been set the goal of a top-six finish next season. Would he honestly back himself to get what he admits is the ‘worst-ever Manchester United team’ up at least 11 places amid the chaos likely to ensue in the coming months?",
      "If so, crack on. If not, he’s still new enough in the job to deny ownership of the sh*tshow around him and leave with his reputation bruised rather than battered, beaten and left for dead in a gutter.",
      "If you ask supporters, most would probably prefer to avoid another managerial change. Who else is there? Amorim is a likeable fella and many fans appreciate his honesty even if outsiders don’t. But suspicion grows that he doesn’t help himself.",
      "He was appointed as one of Europe’s brightest young coaches with an admirable, steadfast belief in his principles and system. For as long as he’s in charge, United will be playing 3-4-2-f***ing-1.",
      "Which, of course, makes them hilariously easy to play against, especially while he has a squad wholly unsuited to it. It is lost on precisely nobody that a must-win final between two coaches who refuse to adapt was won by the one who eventually did.",
      "Amorim admitted in the wake of the Europa League final defeat that without tangible evidence of improvement, he is asking for ‘a little bit of faith’. Blind faith, that, when the manager has neither the means to play his way or the will to even consider the possibility of another.",
      "In the absence of anything else to cling to, Amorim will probably get what he’s asked for. Maybe he’ll repay that faith. But amid the post-Bilbao gloom, after a 21st defeat of the season, it is entirely conceivable that United have depths yet to plumb.",
      "Man Utd lost to Spurs and you might have thought that was interesting enough without inventing BRUTAL digs and ‘sack decisions’.",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?",

      "Manchester United will not be the football team it was while the manager is there.",
      "He thinks he is still managing Sporting and trying to use the same system he used with them, if they keep him employed United will probably get relegated to the Championship next season because the Premier League is a different type of football altogether. They need a manager that knows how to use different systems not just the one and is able to get the team playing football again not like they are at the moment.",

      "",
      "…When the manager knows he’s not been good enough to even deserve a payoff, you know two things – #1 he really hasn’t been; #2 he’s a decent chap, who can evaluate his own performance. I’ll add a #3 that he’s sensible enough to know that being seen to take a big pay-off makes it look like he was only in it for the money, and teams won’t necessarily be so keen to take a punt on a guy who would need a job.",
      "Thing is, I don’t understand the double standards from the fans. When Ole was all about counter-attacking, he was lampooned (while doing better). When Ten Hag had to adapt to the players available in the meantime, he was derided for a lack of discernible style (while doing better). Amorim’s tactic is ALL about counter-attack at pace, yet we simply don’t see this in action at all. When we launched long balls to Fellaini, Weghorst and Scotty, the manager was mocked. But it’s ok for Amorim to do it less effectively with Maguire?",
      "As many others have said, while painful, this is arguably a preferable result. It’s not like we were going to be allowed to celebrate it anyway. The club needs a reset with a number of high-profile players being sold or just plain culled. It needs to go back to being built around youth. We need that youthful running and fearlessness, we need that hunger, we need players who are about the team not themselves, we need players from the academy and area. And as a result of this “performance”, we now can’t realistically afford to keep these big-wage players. It’s time to act like we were actually relegated, clear the deadwood, and rebuild properly, whether we keep Amorim or not.",
      "Critically, the club needs to be shot of players who regularly get exposed in the biggest games. Obviously, I’m thinking Maguire in particular there who once again exposed, Shaw (powers definitely now very waned) as he has done on repeat down the years. I’m also thinking one-trick Bruno who once again couldn’t pass in between the cracks and just pinged balls out wide. I’ll say it again: Bruno has personally *missed* as many big chances as he has created. Too often, he was more interested in moaning at his team-mates than being available for the pass.",
      "Back to the main villain here though, forget the refusal to make substitutions in a timely manner – poor Amad was run out by the 60th minute, having been kicked all game – the introduction of Mainoo with 2 minutes of regular time left was a f***ing insult. This guy has the perfect skill set for exactly this kind of game where space is tight, but no… seems Ineos want to get him to accept being sold, so puppy dog Amorim won’t play him.",
      "Players like Mainoo, Amad, Heaven, Yoro, Ugarte and even poor Dorgu – who seems to have lost confidence to run at his man – are more important to the future of this club than this manager. Or indeed the asset-stripping, cost-reducing part-owners.",

      "And that is a complete reset. This squad is utterly terrible, and also really small. ETH got rid of loads and only brought in a small number of bodies – at great expense – almost all of whom haven’t worked out. Manchester United went into a major European final with 1 single striker, who is an unproven kid completely out of form. No options on the bench. No Ole on to win it. Nothing. Maguire up front.",
      "This has been the season of great equalisation in the premier league. For far too long the league places were largely determined by Net Transfer Spend + Wages. This season it really isn’t like that, with so much quality across 15 odd places. And you know what? Most of the teams haven’t been built by ridiculous overspending.",
      "So there is a path for United to tread. Young, unproven but ambitious players. A switch to a system and players to fit that. A young, talented coach who so far has only really talked the talk, but at least has a clear ethos.",
      "Will it work? Who knows. But I’d much rather try Amorim’s rebuild than go back to randomly buying whomever agents want to pawn off to Ed Woodward this week.\nRyan, Bermuda",
      "",
      "…By all accounts, that was one of the worst cup finals of all time. It may even be the worst United game I’ve ever seen. Spurs fans won’t care, and rightly so. They have nobly passed their banter club crown to United, who seem to have to accepted the gift with open arms. Or floppy ones, if you happen to be Andre Onana.",
      "As a United fan I am deeply worried. Not because we lost in a final to the 17th best team in England but because if you haven’t notice United can’t actually beat any of the top 16 teams in England not called Manchester United. Not only that but we have a team that is seemingly full of players – with few exceptions – that are physically incapable of performing in their designated league.",
      "United play at half pace compared to the good English teams (including Spurs). I am worried this is down to both the manager AND the players. If it’s one or the other I can work with it and have some patience but I think it might be both. This would mean yet another full reset is needed. After every other reset that has followed a managerial appointment in the last 13 years and counting.",
      "If we err on the side of optimism and say Amorim is just hampered by his players (we are at least starting to dominate possession even if we aren’t doing anything with it) then let’s look at the squad (again, because everyone wants another United deep dive).",
      "Onana – not good enough. In his prime.\nBayindir – not good enough. In his prime.\nHeaton – old",
      "Dorgu – has the physicality and possibly some skill but is still inexperienced\nShaw – fragile, cannot be trusted to play every week, hasn’t performed consistently for United in two years. Also turns 30 in July.\nDalot – availability is his biggest asset. Not great going forward. In his prime\nMazraoui – has been surprisingly available, good defender, not great going forward. In his prime\nMaguire – old, plodding, not reliable in any sense, annoyingly stupid occasionally and prone to mistakes. Good for ten minutes in each game as a centre forward though\nYoro – inexperienced but definitely going to be a great player if he avoids injuries\nDe Ligt – a younger Maguire. In his prime.\nMartinez – injury prone, short. But a fan favourite and we love him. In his prime.\nLindelof – old and never good enough (wasted a minute for spurs by complaining about time added on\nHeaven – young but looks like he has potential and physicality\nAmass – looks a baller but he’s tiny! Young and inexperienced\nFredricson – has done ok when he’s played. Young and inexperienced\nMalacia – probably not good enough but also lacking physicality, especially after his injury. Hasn’t played the full 90 mins on loan for PSV since March. In his prime.\nJonny Evans – too old and injured",
      "Bruno – heart and would of the team. Brilliant but frustrating. Getting on a bit.\nUgarte – should be approaching his prime but can’t get in the side against Spurs in a European final. Does he lack the pace and passing ability for the Premier League?\nEriksen – slow, old, past it\nCasemiro – see Eriksen\nMainoo – huge potential but easy to get past. Lack of physicality.\nToby Collyer – looks ok when fit. Tenacious if limited passing ability (from what we’ve seen).\nDan Gore – tiny but tenacious. Young and massively inexperienced\nMount – theoretically a proper Premier League player in his prime. Practically an unknown entity due to injuries.",
      "Hojlund – still young, lacking confidence. Probably also lacking skill, strength and intelligence. Has the size and speed (and possibly the ability) to trouble defences acrosss the world but hasn’t figured out how to use it. Quite possibly never will under the spotlight at United.\nMarcus Rashford – skillful, fast, strong when he wants to be, in his prime. Performs only in fits and starts and doesn’t want to be at United (don’t necessarily blame him for the latter). Still only 27.\nZirkzee – seems quite decent. Has the physicality and the skill to play in the Oremier league, not necessarily the speed. Can. Not. Shoot. Still young(ish)\nAmad – young, skillful, great at pressing but lacks physicality when on the ball and entering the box. Has scored seven league goals this year but three were against Southampton.\nGarnacho – Still young. Much like Amad seems a little lightweight but doesnt necessarily work as hard. Slight better quality with his shooting though. Exciting player to watch.\nAntony – should be in his prime. Rubbish for United after an ok first season. Lighting up the Conference League for Betis. Not a Premier League quality forward though could be repurposed as a wing back?\nEthan Wheatley – Young, massively inexperienced. No idea if he has the talent required at the top level.\nChido Obi – lots of hype. Tall but needs to fill out. Only 17. Could be a good player, could disappear.\nSancho – should be in his prime. Not apparently quick enough or physical enough for the Premier League. Seems to have some other baggage.",
      "Right so from that list of 34 players we have 14 players that are still young and unproven in the Premier League. 7 players are passsed it (or never were it), including Luke Shaw who has been a walking injury for far too long. That leaves 13 who are in their prime (or should be) but that includes two goalkeepers who are definitely not performing at the required level, at least three players who have big question marks over their injury records and at least three who are currently plying their trade elsewhere because they want to leave the club. Malacia is a combination of all three (except the goalkeeper part). This leaves us with four competent outfield players in their prime who have no question marks over their quality* or availability: Dalot, Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte. And the jury is probably out on Ugarte.",
      "I wouldn’t be totally upset if United shed 13 players this summer. But if we shed the ones I’m thinking about, we’d be down to a squad of 21, 14 of which would fit in that young and inexperienced bracket. I think this is potentially disastrous. Not for the first time in its history United are over reliant on young players to perform. Whilst there is bags of potential there, the Premier League is less forgiving than at any time in the past and most of those players are lacking the physicality or composure to thrive in it.",
      "Equally, United are now incentivised to sell the best of those players before selling the 13 I mentioned. In doing so, the soul of the club will be damaged as a result, even if you don’t think Garnacho or Mainoo are good enough.",
      "All this is to say that United are now more than open heart surgery away from competing in the Premier League. Fans will be expecting a bounce back into Europe next year. Some will even fancy a Champions League spot or a title push. The reality is that the first goal – for the first time in the Premier League era – will be to get to 40 points. Based on the current squad, anything else will be a bonus.",
      "Perhaps we’ll be able to say a lot of those young players have come of age next year and everyone will stop being injured and we’re no longer looking at a squad containing 4 players in their prime. If we do so then we’ve had a better season than this one by a long stretch. But then we could also be relegated for the first time in 50+ years.\nAshmundo (quietly pleased for Ange, mate)",
      "*in terms of being good enough to play in the league, not win it. By the latter measure we are very fucked indeed.",
      "It’s who real fans are, mate\nLast night the football wasn’t great, but as the fans of either team could tell you, on such an occasion the only thing that matters is the result. Shortly after the final whistle two of my three sons drove down to Tottenham just to be part of the celebration. Since I started taking the boys to Spurs in the early nineties, the celebrations have been fairly thin.",
      "However, they’ve ignored the glory hunters they grew up with, (who probably couldn’t find certain northern cities on a map, but claim to be die hard fans nonetheless), so their joy at the final whistle was a real pleasure for me.",
      "I finished my beer whilst reading this site and a couple of others, and it crystallised the ‘online universe’ of football fans.",
      "The volume of messages demeaning the Spurs achievement with tired old cliches “tallest dwarf”, “bald men and combs” are so typical of the online football universe, especially irritating from fans of clubs not involved. Many of whom who are probably like my lads school friends, die hard fans of clubs in cities they haven’t even visited. Just let the fans of either team celebrate/vent as appropriate. Let people enjoy the moment, not everything has to be a d*ck measuring contest. There is a shortage of joy in the world, so just back off and let fans enjoy themselves.",
      "So far this year I have been genuinely happy for Newcastle and Palace, whilst I know a couple of Geordies I know no Palace fans at all, but could appreciate the joy of both sets of fans at winning, after some lean years.",
      "I will join my lads to see the parade on Friday, and be back in my usual seat on Sunday. As grumpily as ever I will fork out the cost of my season ticket renewal at the latest possible moment.",
      "As I finished my last beer last night, I browsed your late night mailbox, and found myself totally overwhelmed. In amongst all the garbage mentioned above, there was a brief note from Garey Vance MUFC. Despite my not having written to this site in quite a long time, he name checked me, telling me to enjoy the celebrations.",
      "Many thanks to Garey for his wishes, I suspect he’s a kindred spirit, because he demonstrated “It’s who real football fans are, mate”.\nJim French, Herts (Spurs since ’59)",

      "Almost prefer it in fact.\nDan Mallerman",
      "",
      "…Has a game ever summed up so well the quality, form and mood of two teams who were suffering awful seasons? Even the goal, everything was so on brand for the occasion.",
      "Anyway, that’s not why I’m writing in. As a Newcastle fan who was at Wembley this season and simply didn’t know what it was like to feel pure* unbridled joy at winning something, I’ve really enjoyed watching Palace, Spurs (and even Bologna!) fans celebrate their team’s success, without the usual pained jealousy. People in stands crying, hugging, feeling emotions that haven’t experienced ever or in such a long time. It’s what football’s about.",
      "This is also real life sports fandom, not keyboard warriors or Twitter virgins banging on about what trophies matter, who is the real ‘big club’ and who has history. Raw, happy emotion at watching the football club that is a source of important escapism in your life, win a trophy and celebrate as one.",
      "Say what you want about this season but it’s truly been a memorable season of disruption for me, so it’ll live long in the memory, and will hopefully continue.\nHarry, York\n*I expect sniggers at the back about the ‘Pure’ PIF",
      "",
      "…Nothing worse than bitter fans having a go at clubs for winning “tinpot” trophies or downplaying the result because of the quality of the game. Some real salty tears in the mailbox this morning.",
      "I loved seeing Spurs win last night. Not just because watching United lose is always hilarious, but because I’ve always had a soft spot for Spurs. As a child of 90’s football, there was just something brilliant about Spurs. Ginola, Klinsmann, Ferdinand etc. They were always fun to watch.",
      "It was also fantastic to see their fans and players celebrating and enjoying it so much. I watched the game with a lifelong Spurs fan, and there was a small group of other Spurs fans in the United dominated pub. It was great to see how delighted they were. Modern football has increasingly found a smaller and smaller pool of teams hoovering up all the pots. This season has been different and all the better for it. Palace winning the FA cup, Spurs winning last night. Even as a Liverpool fan I was able to enjoy the celebrations as Newcastle broke their trophy curse.",
      "Whether it was deserved or not is irrelevant, whether they are good or not is irrelevant. They won and should celebrate their win for a long time. So don’t be bitter and try to downplay it.\nMike, LFC, London",

      "In 2012, we qualified for the CL on merit, in the league. Then Chelsea, who had not, won the Champions League and took Britain’s fourth place off us. With so much prize money in the CL that we were robbed of, who knows how we might have kicked on if we’d been let in?",

      "The flashbacks just rubbed salt into the open wounds, particularly as they illustrated just how far Manchester United had fallen. As soon as anyone attempts to describe footballers as potential match-winners, there is so much cognitive dissonance having actually seen them that it invalidates everything. At which point my 11 meg of broadband couldn’t take it anymore and snapped for an hour. I don’t expect I missed anything.",

Whose decision was it to do the five-hour show? And who do they answer to? I wonder what creative reason they invented to justify it? I watch football every day of every week and it was even too much for me and too low in quality.",

It’s amusing hearing them trying to excuse the clumsy play.",

Again, I am genuinely being reflective but the likes of Casemiro, Hojlund, Dalot, Shaw, perhaps even Fernandes are in my eyes just not fit to tie any Utd players shoes that I have seen over the years. Before anybody says anything, Big Bruno is a good player!",

Like it or not, Utd are a top team and the league needs it. Who wants to watch City relentlessly win it? Do I want to watch Liverpool win it all the tins? The selfish me says yes, but it’s the competition that drives things! And without the competition (like this year, apologies to Arsenal fans) it all falls apart and makes it sh*t for everybody!",
      "So Glazers, from a Liverpool fan… go play on the M62! What about Jim? The club needs a reset, now some of his behaviour has been sickening frankly but if he is a Utd fan at heart, why not show it by putting more of your chemical money into Utd at a time it’s needed and getting rid of those at the top? Many will disagree, but 15 years of siphoning from Glazer Co. hasn’t helped has it?",

But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton, and made just one excellent stop v Bournemouth.",

      "4) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.6\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final.",
      "",
      "5) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have faced the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "6) Alisson (Liverpool): +2.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more. Remarkably, he made nine saves v Brighton as a sloppy Liverpool lost 3-2.",
      "",
      "7) Kepa (Bournemouth): +2.0\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",

      "8) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.7\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",
      "9) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",

But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted. But he under-conceded v Liverpool and made five saves in the 1-0 win over Newcastle to draw him level with Sels for the Golden Gloves.",
      "",
      "12) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.0\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Not at fault as Man Utd lost to Chelsea before the Europa League final.",

      "14) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): +0.1\nThree consecutive clean sheets when it matters have rescued a below-par season for the Argentine.",
      "",

Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",

      "Spurs should not be blamed for reconsidering the future of Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United really ought to give Ruben Amorim another think.",
      "",
      "1) If history truly is written by the victors, the history of the Tottenham has been a second-hand account for too long.",
      "In the words of the scorer of the goal which salvaged from a wreckage of a season the club’s first silverware in 17 years: “We get battered for not winning a trophy, so we had to get the first one in a while today.”",
      "It didn’t feel particularly Spursy to take the lead in such a ridiculously critical final and defend it so diligently. It seemed like the conclusive appointment for Dr. Tottenham to treat an unimaginably ill patient back to miraculous health through unthinkable incompetence. The world was waiting for a moment of ultimate schadenfreude which never came.",
      "The team which finished third in a two-horse race. The Put The Pressure On merchants. The Europa League winners. Warra trophy indeed. The end-of-season DVD might be entirely unwatchable for the first few chapters but the final scenes were more euphoric than anyone dared to dream.",
      "",
      "2) It is ludicrous that from the embers of what should have been one manager’s stunning mic drop, another has delivered perhaps the single most vindicating middle finger in recorded history.",
      "“If they don’t want me, then I go somewhere else to win trophies because that is what I do,” said Erik ten Hag after inspiring Manchester United to a victory at Wembley which paved this absurd path to the Europa League final almost exactly a year later.",
      "That directly influenced Manchester United to bottle the decision to sack the manager, the ramifications for which have been severe, obvious and not yet fully realised; it remains to be seen whether this grants Ange Postecoglou the time and patience he believes is needed “to build a team that can be successful for four, five years”.",
      "“I don’t feel I’ve completed the job here,” he added. And there is a substantial difference between Manchester United collecting trophies under different coaches even in these directionless post-Ferguson years, and Spurs ending a drought which has crippled them for almost two decades. The manager who achieved that was always going to be hailed as an icon and a legend. It is almost impossible to remove emotion from that equation and until the final whistle blew in Bilbao it was difficult to compute or appreciate how much this would change the mood, the complexion, everything.",
      "This muddies the decision over Postecoglou’s future considerably and there honestly doesn’t feel like a clear answer exists any more in the same way it absolutely did at Old Trafford 12 months ago. Spurs would be completely forgiven for basing the call on one game in a way Manchester United never should have. As far as counter-arguments to finishing 17th go, few can ever be as compelling.",
      "",
      "3) Postecoglou will, either way, always have his “I always win things in my second year” conversation-ender. It has a slightly more positive ring to it than Jose Mourinho’s third-season syndrome, and thankfully overshadowed most of the talk about what Spurs should do next.",
      "The 59-year-old deserved his moment away from the idle speculation which has followed and taunted him for months. There are legitimate criticisms to be levied over a great many aspects of this Spurs season, and questions worth asking as to whether this suddenly eradicates those problems heading into next season, but far too much commentary has crossed over into something more personal against Postecoglou, whose infrequent tirades have been understandable.",
      "This is a career-defining success more than 40 years in the making. He is the first coach from outside of Europe or Argentina to ever win a European trophy, and it is almost impossible to fathom the farcical amount of barriers he has faced from the beginning of his journey to this incredible peak.",
      "“The strategy was to bring in a trophy manager and we did it twice. You have to learn from the mistakes,” said Daniel Levy in September 2023. Spurs broke Mourinho and Antonio Conte, but not Postecoglou.",
      "",
      "4) A couple of months after that revealing statement from Levy came the quote which, until now, had encapsulated Postecoglou’s Spurs reign.",
      "“It’s just who we are, mate. It’s just who we are. It’s who we’re gonna be for as long as I’m here.”",
      "Premier League leaders Spurs, down to nine men after less than an hour, had continued to deploy a high line, kept attacking Chelsea whenever possible and fell on their swords in an eventual 4-1 defeat. It was a stirring performance and message but one which summed up a naive stubbornness they could not possibly use as solid foundations upon which to build.",
      "It has not been especially relevant for some time, particularly in this tournament. Spurs have kept as many clean sheets in the Europa League this season as they have in the Premier League despite playing 23 more games in the latter, having shown a willingness to compromise and evolve.",
      "This was a continuation of the quarter and semi-final second legs: a sacrifice of principles to focus on resolute, organised and compact defending to consolidate a position of strength. It might have felt a little early for some when Postecoglou substituted his goalscorer to form a five-man backline in the 79th minute but it paid off handsomely.",
      "Spurs had the fewest shots, possession share and completed passes of any major European finalist on record. And they won. It’s just who they are now, mate.",
      "",
      "5) That makes for an uncomfortable contrast with Ruben Amorim, who might well have overseen his worst Manchester United game at the least opportune time.",
      "An ineffective set-up was compounded by a lethargic approach and a bizarre reluctance to change anything which played into Tottenham’s hands. The first substitutions came about 20 minutes too late and it is remarkably damning that the one concession Amorim seems willing to consider at the expense of his system is to stick Harry Maguire up front for the final five minutes and get it into the mixer.",
      "That worked against Porto and Lyon in this competition and Leicester in the Carabao, but even at their worst Spurs were fully prepared for the best Manchester United had to throw at them.",
      "Even after the game Amorim said he “will not change” how he operates and if that remains his stance after abdicating their Premier League responsibilities for six months in the name of a final they didn’t bother to show up for, it is worth wondering whether Manchester United should simply cut their losses again.",
      "It seems unlikely but when the £21.4m it cost to install Amorim is added to the £4.1m paid to hire and fire Dan Ashworth, the millions lost in prize money and the spiralling expenses required to rebuild this mess in the transfer window, it is increasingly difficult to envisage the manager surviving any vaguely efficient end-of-season review without the hierarchy contorting itself to justify their apparent foolishness.",
      "Of course, this is Sunk-Cost Fallacy Football Club we are talking about here, and they will plough on for at least a few more months after things become clearly untenable.",
      "",
      "6) It might be simplistic but the differences in how these two teams approached the final in the build-up alone were stark.",
      "The Manchester United pre-match press conference featured Amorim, Maguire and Bruno Fernandes all cracking jokes, while the Spurs equivalent was headlined by Postecoglou admonishing a journalist for suggesting he could be labelled a “clown”.",
      "The Australian has defended his players to a fault, with Amorim desperate to publicly immolate both himself and his squad.",
      "He also said winning the Europa League “will not change anything in our problems” and openly wondered whether not qualifying for the Champions League would be more beneficial in the long run; Postecoglou showed no shame in underlining how it meant everything to him, the players and the club itself to win it and “change things”, from their trajectory to how they are perceived.",
      "Even the starting line-ups were diametrically opposed. Spurs made ten changes with Pape Matar Sarr the only survivor, and Manchester United made one with Victor Lindelof the sole casualty. The former favoured rest while the latter opted for rhythm, but long before a ball was kicked it was resoundingly apparent who this meant more to. The bus parade beat the BBQ.",
      "",
      "7) The last disparity came just before kick-off. The Manchester United starting line-up gathered in a huddle near the centre circle, oblivious to the Spurs players who walked past them to applaud and appreciate the fans rocking in the end they would be attacking.",
      "They formed their congregation in front of that riotous travelling support in a show of unity between the players and the fans. It was a small but meaningful gesture which had no bearing on the result but it summed up the fractious nature of Manchester United in 2025 that they didn’t think to do the same.",
      "",
      "8) The first 20 minutes or so were characterised by high pressing, manic defending and nervous goalkeeping from both sides.",
      "The plan for Manchester United seemed entirely contingent on getting the ball to Amad; with Spurs it was a little less obvious beyond testing Andre Onana with quick deliveries into the box.",
      "Postecoglou’s side had 13 crosses to Manchester United’s 12 in the first half. In the second half it was zero to 20 as Spurs turned their best form of attack into an obdurate defence. Cristian Romero reached such a flow state that he started a war with Maguire just to keep himself busy.",
      "",
      "9) On that note, here is a passable impression of Sean Dyche on co-commentary a minute before Crystal Palace scored in the FA Cup final:",
      "‘Against a Man United side who don’t generally require a great deal of breaking down and offer frequent gifts, the presence of Spurs’ first-choice backline may be of far greater significance than any absences further forward.",
      "‘Most obviously, Man United’s back three is vulnerable specifically to wide players ghosting in at the far post to score from crosses. They have conceded almost the exact same goal five times in their last three Premier League games – twice against West Ham, twice against Brentford and against Chelsea.",
      "‘It is a goal Spurs score frequently, with Brennan Johnson’s Temu Raheem Sterling act a genuine potential gamebreaker here.’",
      "What a shame it was a front-post Johnson ghosting which ultimately decided the game. Tickers, you fraud.",
      "",
      "10) But what a worthy goalscorer, even if UEFA’s insistence that Luke Shaw did not administer the final touch feels slightly hollow.",
      "It was Johnson’s goal in spirit either way, his run which caused communicative ripples in the opposition defence, his presence which proved such a nuisance as to render Manchester United’s eight-to-three numerical advantage in the box from Sarr’s cross wholly moot.",
      "For a player who was compelled to deactivate his social media accounts due to fan abuse in September, and who felt uneasy enough in his relationship with those supporters not to celebrate the goals he scored soon after, it was a stunning moment.",
      "Johnson’s movements off the ball might genuinely be among the best in the Premier League and this was further reward for his work. If Nottingham Forest qualify for the Champions League this weekend there might finally be competition for Dan Burn in the What A Week For stakes.",
      "",
      "11) The ball came off Shaw but there were arguably three teammates more culpable for the goal. The cross could even have been cut out at source really but a clever Rodrigo Bentancur run did stretch the play well.",
      "Maguire seemed to choose not to get a touch when he could have cleared it. Onana’s reaction time was pitiful and perhaps even specifically designed to try and make the save which never came look better. But Patrick Dorgu can shoulder most of the blame.",
      "Shaw, monitoring Dominic Solanke, pointed to Johnson on multiple occasions to prompt his teammate to mark the Welshman more tightly. Dorgu was already a step or two behind when the ball came in, and Shaw only realised when Johnson emerged over his shoulder. The way it was bundled into the net was unfortunate from Manchester United’s standpoint, but the amateurishness of what came before made it possible.",
      "A few minutes earlier in the first half, a cross reached Dorgu at the back post with no Spurs player in the vicinity, but he chested the ball out for a corner to Onana’s frustration. It is unknown whether he received the call from a teammate to take his time or simply ignored it, but for a similar situation to unfold soon after is inept at this level.",
      "",
      "12) From that point Spurs were largely content to defend, as was their right. The unheralded key to success on that front was how they consistently broke up the play.",
      "They committed 22 fouls, at least three more than in any other game under Postecoglou, with the honours split evenly across the team and Pedro Porro the only starting outfielder not to pitch in.",
      "It prevented Manchester United from establishing any momentum and reached a glorious crescendo around the hour mark, when Richarlison forced about five different stoppages in the space of a few seconds. He was a fitting leader of the sh*thousing charge.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester United never really did identify a coherent solution and much of that was down to the performance of Fernandes. So often their stimulus, the captain became a burden.",
      "It was his passes which were intercepted in the build-up to the Spurs goal, he who missed a huge chance with an unmarked header from Noussair Mazraoui’s ball in, he who caused so many attacks to break down with poor decisions executed imperfectly.",
      "His teammates should not escape censure for failing to step up and share the burden, but there was a tangible sense that this particular glare was too much for Fernandes to handle. Postecoglou did say he planned to “overwhelm” the Portuguese but the occasion and pressure seemed to do that too.",

      "",
      "14) Might he have switched places with Mason Mount to exert more influence? The England international was anonymous on the left, with all attacks filtered down the other side through Amad.",
      "The one chance which fell to Rasmus Hojlund did so through the fingers of Guglielmo Vicario when the Spurs keeper let a cross slip away, but Micky van de Ven did wonderfully to hook the Dane’s header away.",
      "Mount and Hojlund were substituted in the 71st minute as Amorim finally looked towards his bench for solutions, and while Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho did spark an improvement it was not enough.",
      "The change Manchester United needed to make throughout the second half finally arrived in the 90th minute with Kobbie Mainoo replacing Dorgu. They needed a ball-carrier, a disruptor, a change in approach from the surfeit of crosses Spurs were happily heading away.",
      "Amorim keeping five defenders on the pitch for so long when the opponent had shown no attacking intent since around the hour mark was baffling and it cost them. There was enough quality on that bench to make an impact but it was used sub-optimally.",
      "",
      "15) Postecoglou ultimately nailed his decisions in a way Amorim categorically did not. That started with one of the biggest calls of all: to leave out Heung-min Son.",
      "There were echoes of the 2019 Champions League final, when a blatantly unfit Harry Kane was given the nod by Mauricio Pochettino to start and he was predictably ineffective. Son had played the previous two Spurs games on his return from injury but could not have argued when Richarlison was named in his place.",
      "Son has been more patient and understanding than Spurs have had any right to expect over the years, but Postecoglou was right to overlook sentimentality and make a choice which benefitted the team. Richarlison justified it completely, as did Son’s shaky start when he came off the bench.",
      "When the captain did settle into the motion of the game he did his bit to help Spurs see it through. Perhaps no-one has done more over the years to earn that trophy.",
      "How apropos that Spurs and Kane ended their long waits in the same season; by staying to complete the journey Son might have overtaken the legacy of his former teammate as the best player in the club’s modern history.",
      "",
      "16) Lads, it’s Manchester United.",
      "Things could get even worse for a failed state of a football club with a manager without the means to play his way or the willingness to change…",
      "Ange Postecoglou might still be done for, so who will be the next manager of Tottenham? Oliver Glasner is the new favourite.",
      "Man Utd lost to Spurs and you might have thought that was interesting enough without inventing BRUTAL digs and ‘sack decisions’.",
      "Ange Postecoglou is still under huge pressure despite leading Tottenham to their first trophy in 17 years as David Ornstein reveals the “clear direction of travel”.",
      "We’ve been adamant Spurs should sack Ange Postecoglou regardless of the Europa League outcome, and we might have f*cked that to be honest.",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?"

      "“I always say the defender the furthest away is your talker and your eyes and ears. He has to signal the other players. He has to shout, scream, push, whatever, and let them know players are running across them, and he didn’t do that and they got punished.”",

He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “It was a wonderful ball in from the left and the United defence couldn’t deal with it.

      "Tottenham were slightly better than a terrible Manchester United to win an actual trophy, but still, they’ve got four players in this list of ten who took part in the Europa League final that should be axed this summer.",
      "",
      "Rasmus Hojlund\nAfter half an hour he had touched the ball three times. One of those touches saw him commit a foul while he lost possession after another. The ‘not getting the service’ excuse has gone past tired to the point where even his most effusive supporters have accepted that United have spent £64m on a willing runner. They’ll be very fortunate if any club offers even half that much for him now.",
      "Liam Delap has been heavily linked and discussions as to whether he’s the best option are one thing, but there can be little doubt he’ll improve United as we’ve seen him do things like control and pass the ball on a semi-regular basis.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions on Spurs winning the Europa League: Amorim sack, Postecoglou vindication, terrible Manchester United",
      "",
      "Luke Shaw\nThere will definitely be Serie A clubs looking to do their absolute favourite of saving the career of a downtrodden Premier League star and if United can palm a guy off on one of them whose fifth start this season showed just how far off his best he now is then they surely should.",
      "Rio Ferdinand blamed the goal entirely on Patrick Dorgu, but Shaw pointing at Brennan Johnson at least twice in the few second before he nipped in ahead of him to score was pretty damning evidence that he knew he was there despite the pundit’s claim to the contrary.",
      "As was the case all night, Shaw appeared to be working at a speed somehow slower than his slovenly teammates.",
      "",
      "Guglielmo Vicario\nHe’s given plenty of opportunity at Spurs to make your pretty saves – no Premier League team has a higher PSxG outside the relegated three this season – and made a couple here, including that one in the last minute to deny Luke Shaw, but his lily-livered attempts to come for crosses make him an absolute liability.",
      "It’s a weakness that’s been targeted by opposition teams to good effect for at least the last year, and his bid to catch what looked like a very simple high ball ahead of Micky van de Ven’s extraordinary goal-line clearance from Rasmus Hojlund’s header showed that presumed work on the training ground has not made the required difference to remedy a flaw that will continue to be earmarked as a means to hurt and score against Spurs.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho\nWe assume he took being benched after starting – and largely impressing in – all the Europa League knockout games to reach the final really well.",
      "“Mason Mount gives us a different balance and is an extra midfielder” was Ruben Amorim’s explanation for the change and is also why he would surely bite your hand off for even £40m for Garnacho this summer.",
      "Players in his position, or rather the position he’s played in in Amorim’s unsuitable system, are expected to do the dirty work Mount is famed for that’s alien to Garnacho, who may very well turn into a superstar, but commitment to Amorim and his philosophy means that journey will happen elsewhere.",
      "",
      "Andre Onana\nWe were staunch defenders of him for a long time but the blunders against Lyon in the first leg of their bonkers quarter-final which appeared to be the point that Ruben Amorim and United decided he wasn’t for them was also the point we backed down. That said, let’s not pretend he was at fault for the goal.",
      "It’s a real shame Emiliano Martinez wants to play Champions League football.",
      "",
      "Son Heung-min\nThe fourth-highest goalscorer in the club’s history (173) but a well below-par season that’s seen him score just 11 of them this term and Richarlison starting ahead of him in comfortably their biggest game of the season is a damning indictment of just how far his stock has fallen, absolutely correct call though that was from Ange Postecoglou.",
      "",
      "Casemiro\nThe five-time Champions League winner claimed this has been “one of the most successful seasons of my career”. An absurdly bold statement in isolation but less so when paired with his “for turning things around” explanation.",
      "He has indeed been key to United reaching the final, scoring in both legs of the semi against Athletic Club and claiming two assists in a Man of the Match display in the mad 5-4 second leg win over Lyon, and if United had won here we’re sure the Leader narrative would have seen Red Devils fans welcome the continued £350,000 per week outlay, but not now.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero\nRomero is a very good footballer but we’ve never been convinced he’s a very good defender and with his head and heart already in Spain over the last few months he’s largely  given up on that aspect of the game that he deems beneath him at the best of times.",
      "Tottenham fans will quite rightly be singing his praises after this game, in which his tenacity, sh*thousery and quality made a rare appearance. But the evidence that he can do it is if anything more damning.",
      "It’s now surely just a case of how much money Daniel Levy can squeeze out of Atletico Madrid, with a major trophy and Romero’s key role in winning it no more than a parting gift.",
      "",
      "Pedro Porro\nReports in March claimed Tottenham are looking to ‘cash in’ on Porro this summer, with Bayern Munich and Barcelona both monitoring his situation, while Manchester City are also considering a move for the 25-year-old they sold to Sporting for just £7.5m three years ago.",
      "Spurs’ £50m asking price represents a significant markup, even from the £33m they paid Sporting in 2023, and quite the coup if they can get it for a footballer who has retained his value after a standout first season at the club through an inauspicious second campaign in which his quality on the ball has been good in the main but his defending has been found wanting on multiple occasions.",
      "That wasn’t the case here, with Mason Mount getting little-to-no change out of him and Garnacho’s introduction not as significant as it first looked as though it might be. His departure wouldn’t be an axing but a means to bring in some cash to put to far greater use to the team if reinvested elsewhere, with Djed Spence proving himself perfectly capable of taking Porro’s spot in the team moving forward.",

      "Zirkzee joined United from Bologna for £36.5m last summer and has managed just seven goals and three assists in a debut season which featured him being jeered off by his own fans during a defeat to Newcastle in December.",
      "His performances before suffering injury in mid-April were more positive though, certainly better than those of fellow striker Rasmus Hojlund, and Lee Sharpe reckons with a consistent run in the side the “real baller” can become a “superstar” at Old Trafford.",
      "“I like Zirkzee – he was unfortunate to get injured when he did, but he’s a real baller and I think he can be a superstar for Manchester United if he can get games under his belt,” Sharpe told Metro via Coin Poker.",
      "“He needs a regular run. I don’t think he’s had a 10-game stint where he has actually played week in, week out.",
      "“There were reports that he wasn’t quite fit when he signed, so it took him a bit of time to get up to speed. I think he was just finding his feet when he got injured but I think he’s going to prove a real key player next season.”",
      "Zirkzee made a shock return to training this week but the Europa League final clash with Spurs may have come too early for the Dutchman.",
      "Football Insider claim United have put both Zirkzee and Hojlund are ‘up for sale’ ahead of the summer transfer window in order ‘to make way for top striker target Liam Delap’.",

      "It is understood that at least one of Zirkzee or Hojlund will need to be sold ‘to free up space in the squad and raise funds for further summer business’.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s arrival at Old Trafford in a £62.5m transfer from Wolves looks to have been sewn up and Sharpe believes both he and Delap will be good additions to Amorim’s squad.",
      "“I think both players look like good acquisitions,” Sharpe added.",
      "“I’ve seen Delap a few times this season and he’s a good, big strong typical number nine. He holds the balls up well, which is what you need in any team but he also knows where the goal is and puts defenders under pressure.",
      "“He’s still young enough to improve and for the position United are in – not quite challenging for the league but looking towards that top six – and I think he would be an ideal signing.",
      "“Cunha speaks for himself. In a team like Wolves, which have struggled at points this season, he’s been the standout player.",
      "“He’s a little bit like Kobbie Mainoo in that he can beat players, create a chance and score a goal.

      "The former Liverpool target’s second season at Stamford Bridge has been far stronger than his first and he’s one of the few huge Todd Boehly-era signings to pay off. He’s not quite justified the £100m player tag yet, but he’s getting there. He is Chelsea’s player of a poor season.",

      "Manchester United are at \"rock bottom\" according to Luke Shaw after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur; Ruben Amorim claims he is still the right man for the job - but would leave if the fans and board do not want him",
      "By Pete Gill",
      "Thursday 22 May 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Manchester United's season, already their worst ever in the Premier League, hit a new low in Bilbao as they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Victory would not have turned United's season into a positive, but it would have provided a glimmer of light and reason for optimism.",
      "Instead, after losing for the fourth time this season to the team 17th in the Premier League, United's road back to the elite looks longer than ever. Once again, more questions are being asked of Manchester United and their head coach than answers are being provided.",
      "What is the identity of Amorim's United?",
      "United's performance in Bilbao raised familiar concerns, not merely about their quality but also their style. Amorim stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-3 formation even into the final stages when every Tottenham player was behind the ball. \"I will not change,\" Amorim repeated afterwards and his resilience is admirable.",
      "But the evidence this formation does not suit his players is close to overwhelming, a consistent pattern of play still has not emerged, and Amorim's belief in his system felt a stubborn streak too far deep into the final stages in Bilbao when United, predictable and stifled, kept three centre-halves on the pitch despite Tottenham's obvious refusal to leave their own half.",
      "Is the head coach's position under threat?",
      "If it is, it should not be. Amorim needs more time and, given the size of the problems he inherited, deserves it too. Practically, United probably could not afford to change their head coach again, and certainly could not afford to accept that if Amorim goes, everyone involved in his appointment will have to go too.",
      "But it is also fair to say that Amorim had a very bad night in Bilbao. Never mind the formation, what about the team selection? Starting Mason Mount was a colossal misjudgement, immediately exposed when Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first five minutes on the pitch than Mount had done in the previous 70. Ange Postecoglou did not only beat Amorim tactically, he also won the selection battle - the decision to start Richarlison and leave Heung-Min Son on the bench was comprehensively vindicated.",
      "Amorim showed up well in his post-game press conference. But he almost always does. Likewise, Luke Shaw was outstanding in his summing up of the situation and post-final support of his head coach. The problem is that United only ever seem to impress these days in their off-field media duties.",
      "How many players do United need, to the nearest 10?",
      "Ouch. It is a question that was posed midway through the final and it is tough to answer it is only 10.",
      "Do United have the finances and clout to overhaul their squad?",
      "While Amorim predicted at the start of the week that a win would only help deliver one more summer signing, the bottom line is that victory in Bilbao would have been worth an estimated £100m for a club who have lost £300m over the last three years.",
      "United simply may not possess the financial clout this summer to overhaul their squad half as much as they want or need to.",
      "It was especially worrying to hear Fernandes acknowledge as much late on Wednesday night.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is,\" said the United captain.",
      "Hardly the assurance.",
      "What is Matheus Cunha thinking now?",
      "And what about Liam Delap?",
      "United will not have any sort of European football next season.",
      "Never mind the finances, and they are a huge obstacle to the overhaul, do United still have the pulling power?",
      "Andre Onana - twist or twist?",
      "From a footballing perspective, it is tough to argue that United's worst decision in the last few years has not been replacing David de Gea with Onana. There have been flashes but no more than that. What there has not been is enough saves or convincing performances. United need a new goalkeeper. But they also need at least two new forwards, a couple of wing-backs and some authority in midfield. Given the choice, where do you place a goalkeeper in that list of actions?",
      "Do 'pure profits' Mainoo and Garnacho have to be sold now?",
      "From an all-important PSR perspective, selling 'homegrown' Kobbie Mainoo and Garnacho would be hugely beneficial. But when an overhaul begins with selling your best players, just how far back are you?",
      "Does playing once a week, with up to 10 teams in Europe next season, actually help United?",
      "It does and it does not.",
      "Postecoglou was very clear after the final that he had given up on the Premier League in order to focus on the Europa League. But there was a whiff of convenience to that explanation. To what extent are Tottenham simply not that good? The problem with the Premier League is that there is not an equivalent of playing Bodo/Glimt in the semi-final and United may well find, even with the extra rest of inactivity, that it makes no decent difference without good enough players. True, they will not be tired. But just because they are not tired does not mean they will not be terrible.",
      "What United really need is new players, and a lot of them, to start hauling themselves out of this rut, and it is far, far harder to attract and finance those new players without European football.",
      "Champions League qualification was not a cure for all their ills but it would have been a significant route forward in their road to recovery.",
      "It would have been both an escape route and escapism.",
      "Now United have neither."

      "Tottenham beat Manchester United 1-0 in the Europa League final thanks to Brennan Johnson's winner; Cristian Romero was a rock at the back for Ange Postecoglou's side while Micky van de Ven saved Spurs in second half; Bruno Fernandes, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund had nights to forget",
      "Thursday 22 May 2025 01:18, UK",
      "Tottenham are Europa League champions, ending their 17-year wait for a trophy by beating Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao.",
      "Brennan Johnson's winner late in the first half was enough for the north Londoners to book a spot in the Champions League next season - and increased the pressure on Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, who will be subjected to their lowest-ever Premier League finish and nothing more.",
      "Got away with it, then became a hero. An early stumble but Rasmus Hojlund could not take advantage, and he then gifted a chance to the same United striker, only to be saved by Micky van de Ven's acrobatic heroics. Produced two good saves to deny Alejandro Garnacho and Luke Shaw late on to redeem himself. At least one goalkeeper turned up…",
      "Two excellent halves for different reasons. The first half saw him use his wand of a right boot to create some good openings, then he had to be defensively secure in the second period.",
      "He's never lost a final and you can see why. The Argentina defender showed excellent awareness throughout as he marshalled his side's low block brilliantly, making more clearances than any other Spurs player. He even got into Harry Maguire's head when the United centre-back started to threaten in the box. Spurs have to keep him to develop - but will he stay?",
      "That clearance. That athleticism. The Dutchman was just as solid as Romero but his acrobatic heroics to deny Hojlund that leveller will be remembered just as much as Johnson's goal. What a way to make yourself a hero.",
      "Looked nervous early on, swiping at a Man Utd corner and getting turned by Amad Diallo too many times. But he then grew into it and shut down the United winger in the second half. His game was summed up by a great tackle in the box to deny Amad a decent opening, before breaking to set up Dominic Solanke's big chance for 2-0. He did so much running, it is no wonder he had to come off late on.",
      "Solid. Won the second-most duels out of any Spurs player on the pitch - behind Romero - and the second-most tackles behind Udogie. Will be one of the more underrated players from this success.",
      "Like Bissouma, a good water carrier, doing a lot of the dirty work without being spectacular. All three of Spurs' midfielders kept Bruno Fernandes very quiet, giving the Manchester United danger man next to no space.",
      "Superb cross for Spurs' opener - exactly what was needed after his side lost James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski to injury for this big game. Did not hold the ball well enough but that did not really matter in the end. It was not punished.",
      "Caused all sorts of problems early doors for Luke Shaw and you could see his opener coming. That trademark run from back post to front under Ange Postecoglou's tactics is destined in Spurs' folklore for generations. Did his work in the other direction too.",
      "You felt for the Spurs forward - he did so much running off the ball without getting many touches. Should have done better with a chance on the break for 2-0 but set up a decent chance on the break for Heung-Min Son at the same time. An important moment.",
      "A shock inclusion over captain Son - but you can see why he got the call up. Less of an attacking presence and did not do much in the air against Noussair Mazraoui, but his defensive performance and selfless display was excellent. He was taken off with an injury, which showed how much he committed.",
      "Actually, you could see why the Spurs captain did not start. He came on and even then he struggled, being beaten in a race by Patrick Dorgu despite playing an hour less football than his counterpart. Has he lost his legs?",
      "Brought on to shore up the backline as another centre-back and helped with the low block, including one huge clearance from an Amad cross. Had half a chance from a free-kick but did not take it.",
      "Nervy, shaky, unconvincing in his decision-making. Onana's frequent reluctance to come out and claim crosses or back passes created nervousness in defence for United - and gave Spurs an invitation to cross. He was not totally at fault for Spurs' opener but the indecision took its toll. More cons than pros this season by quite a way - time for United to move on?",
      "Not great but not bad. Nearly caught out by the Spurs press in the first half but not helped out by more Onana indecision. He could have scored in the second half but it is harsh to criticise the second-youngest player to feature in a European final for Man Utd.",
      "The centre-back was player of the half for United in the first period - until the opener. Solid in defence, put his body on the line and caused issues in the other penalty box. But he then fell asleep towards the end of the half, letting too many balls bounce, including for Spurs' opener. He was rattled by Romero - no goalscoring heroics this time.",
      "Beaten easily by Johnson a couple of times early on so it was no real surprise to see him overcome by the same player for the goal. Not good enough with the ball either going forwards. A sharper Shaw may have fared better but United miss Lisandro Martinez in that position.",
      "Like Yoro, he cannot be blamed too much. Good in the air against Richarlison, including a good, well-timed header to deny the Brazilian early on at the back post. He won 12 duels overall and got forward well, setting up that glorious Bruno Fernandes chance. Harshly taken off but can understand the need to bring attack-minded Diogo Dalot on.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder had some flashpoints with some big tackles, which showed he could still deliver in a big game, but that is where his influence was limited to. You cannot help but think how he has gone from Champions League finals with Real Madrid to this.",
      "Anonymous throughout as the Man Utd captain struggled against Spurs' flat midfield three. His frustration was summed up by lashing out at Udogie to concede a free-kick and having a simple pass cut out by Johnson, which led to a Spurs counter attack. He then missed that big chance to level. It was just not a captain's performance.",
      "Not bad going forwards and got into good areas, but spent a lot of time tracking back to help Shaw out. The youngster did not communicate enough for Johnson's goal - he wil learn.",
      "United's bright spark. The young wide man caused Udogie a lot of problems and provided United's only two shots in the first half, plus the cross for Hojlund's decent chance just after the break. A light in a dismal Ruben Amorim era.",
      "From light to dark. Mount was given a chance and did not take it. Mount actually got in the way of his United team-mates a couple of times in the first half, while he lacked the final ball throughout. Rightly taken off as United's need for a goal became more urgent - and Alejandro Garnacho did more in four minutes than Mount did in 70. Matheus Cunha will take his slot next season, no doubt.",
      "The young forward's hold-up play was actually not bad. But United lacked a penalty box presence needed from a striker in a cup final. Needed to take that second-half chance from Amad's cross and unlucky to be denied by Van de Ven's stunning clearance. But Man Utd need better. Ten Premier League games without a shot, as well.",
      "Brought on for Hojlund and got as many yellow cards as he had shots. Just six touches of the ball in around 20 minutes. He's just not a striker, is he? But if Fernandes, Cunha and Amad are the No 10 options then where does it leave the Dutchman?",
      "Probably should have started given Mount's performance and kept out by Vicario well. But if he and Kobbie Mainoo are not trusted for a European final, where does it leave them in Ruben Amorim's plans, especially as they are both available to be sold for pure profit?"

      "A bullish Ange Postecoglou said he will \"never be a clown\" and insisted his work at Spurs is not done - even if they beat Manchester United in Wednesday's Europa League final.",
      "In an explosive press conference ahead of the game in Bilbao, the 59-year-old hit out at a newspaper headline which described him as \"teetering between hero and clown\" amid speculation over his future as the club's head coach.",
      "Spurs' poor Premier League campaign, which has seen them slump to 17th place on 38 points, having lost a club-record 21 games, has led to suggestions that he could leave even if he guides them to their first trophy in 17 years in the Europa League.",
      "But Postecoglou insisted his future is not a distraction and urged his team to seize their chance to make history by winning a trophy which would also earn Spurs a Champions League spot.",
      "\"I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and I never will be, mate,\" he told a reporter in reference to the article relating to his Spurs legacy.",
      "\"I'm really disappointed you'd use such terminology about a person who, for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he's leading out a club in a European major competition.",
      "\"For you to suggest that, somehow, us not being successful means that I'm a clown... I'm not really sure how to answer that question.\"",
      "Postecoglou has faced repeated questions relating to his future in recent months but insisted his sole focus is on ensuring his players are ready to take their opportunity to win silverware.",
      "\"Does it matter, really?\" he said when asked about his future. \"It doesn't matter because the reality of it is the opportunity is the same for me and, more importantly, for the club.",
      "Postecoglou said the injured Lucas Bergvall is not available to play against Manchester United despite having travelled with the squad to Bilbao. Pape Sarr is fit, however, despite having been taken off with back pain during Friday's 2-0 loss to Aston Villa.\n\n\nJames Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also missing due to injury but like Bergvall, have travelled with the squad to Bilbao to support their team-mates.",
      "\"I've said before, whatever happens beyond tomorrow is kind of irrelevant when you think about the opportunity that exists right now and that is to provide something special for this football club, for the supporters, for everyone who's worked so hard, not just this year, but for the last 15, 16 years since we last won a trophy and 41 years since a European trophy.",
      "\"If I were worried about my tenure at this football club, it's fair to say we wouldn't be in this position as I would've been distracted long ago. I'm pretty good at making sure all my focus is on giving this football club the best opportunity to do something special.",
      "\"Whatever happens after that, I'm very comfortable that I'll continue on trying to win trophies wherever I am.\"",
      "The Spurs boss insisted he has not spoken to his players about his future ahead of the final, adding: \"Again, that would not really be helpful in what is before us right now.",
      "\"I've said to the lads from day one, nothing is guaranteed in life, nothing is guaranteed in sport, so you've got to make sure you take every opportunity before you.",
      "\"That's what I've done my whole career. I've been in this position before where the big game was the last game I managed, so it's not unusual territory for me and I've always navigated that pretty well.",
      "\"For me, nothing is more important than my responsibility at this football club and to its fans tomorrow. Me and the players' minds are on one thing and that's trying to create something special.\"",
      "Pressed again on his future, Postecoglou insisted: \"I wouldn't be the first person who changes jobs. We all change jobs.",
      "\"My future's assured. I've got a beautiful family, I've got a great life, I'll keep on winning trophies until I finish, wherever that is, so don't worry about my future.",
      "\"My future is not entwined with anything. Provided, God willing, my health remains and my beautiful family and friends are beside me... there's nothing wrong with my future.",
      "\"Don't stress. Sleep easy at night. I'll be OK.",
      "\"I don't think my job is done here. I really feel like we're building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.",
      "\"I still think there's a lot of work to be done, that's quite obvious with the challenges we've had this year, which are well chronicled. There's some reasoning in the context of that, but also there's been some growth that I'd like to see through.",
      "\"Whether that happens or not is not that important right now. I don't think this job's finished and I certainly feel like there's some growth there that we can take this club to where it needs to be.\"",
      "Spurs captain Heung-Min Son insisted he is ready to make history by winning his first trophy at the club after admitting he was affected by nerves in the 2019 Champions League final loss to Liverpool.",
      "\"It would be very special,\" he said. \"It would be a historic moment, I stayed here 10 years. I just want to win the trophy, which nobody has done in 10 years.",
      "\"Tomorrow is going to be a massive day for the club and for the boys, and for me as well. It has been such a tough season but we have always been together and that's why we are here.\"",
      "Son, who also revealed he had chatted to Bundesliga winner Harry Kane ahead of Wednesday's game, continued: \"Six years ago I played my first final. It was a very nervous moment.",
      "\"It was exciting but I was very nervous. I couldn't believe I was in the Champions League final.",
      "\"Six years later I'm a grown man, I'm experienced and just want to prepare in my way, calm.",
      "\"So many players have changed, also my role has changed. I'm captain of this club and leader of the boys and I want to help lift the trophy together.",
      "\"That is my dream. Tomorrow, I hope we can make a historic day that I can never forget.\"",
      "Son only recently returned from injury but insisted he feels physically prepared for the challenge ahead as Spurs aim to change their history of falling short.",
      "\"If we win the trophy, we can change the mentality and the history of the club. Then hopefully we can compete for other trophies.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim reiterated his stance that winning the Europa League would not solve the club's issues but admitted it would help him build their future.",
      "Amorim's side sit only a point ahead of Postecoglou's in 16th place in the Premier League after a similarly difficult campaign but while the Spurs boss has preached optimism, Amorim has favoured brutal realism.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident, but we already know the problems,\" he said.",
      "Manchester United have been given a boost with Diogo Dalot, Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro all available to feature having recovered from injury.\n\n\n\"They recovered quite well,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we respect the feelings of the players, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to part of the team and that is a very good sign.\n\n\n\"They are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club; the way we do everything in the week at Carrington, the recruitment, the academy. I think we need to improve.",
      "\"It's hard to point at one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow will be important for us, for our fans. That feeling of winning can help us have strength to do every job we have to do.",
      "\"But nothing is going to change our season. We have a lot to do at our club, not just winning tomorrow. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build the future.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire insisted Manchester United have shown their quality in the Europa League, despite their domestic struggles.",
      "\"When you play for this club, you want to win every football match and this season we've been far too inconsistent, we haven't won enough in the Premier League. It's not been good enough, we know that.",
