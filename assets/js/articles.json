      "Cole Palmer celebrated his first Chelsea goal of the afternoon differently to normal. (Image: Darren Walsh, Chelsea FC via Getty Images)",
      "Chelsea star Cole Palmer has dismissed speculation linking him with a departure from the club, after the Blues' talisman netted a first-half hat-trick against Wolves, but has admitted that he's noticed the talk.",
      "The England international bagged all of Chelsea's goals in the 3-1 triumph at Molineux. His opening two strikes came from the penalty spot, as the Blues maintained their impressive run under Liam Rosenior.",
      "After converting his first spot-kick, Palmer opted against his trademark 'cold' celebration and instead sprinted towards the travelling supporters with his hands covering his ears, before blowing a kiss to the travelling Chelsea faithful.",
      "The gesture follows claims that he was experiencing homesickness and was prepared to return to Manchester with boyhood outfit Manchester United. However, Palmer now seems to have dispelled those rumours.",
      "Speaking to BBC Match of the Day following the victory, he explained: \"Everyone loves to chat rubbish, don't they? I don't pay too much attention to it.",
      "\"You see things. But I feel like I've come from a strong place anyway so I don't pay attention to it.\"",
      "The midfielder also heaped praise on new boss Rosenior. \"Life under Liam is amazing, he gives us all confidence,\" he said.",
      "\"Lets us be ourselves, play free. I'm sure when I'm back proper fit you'll see the best of me. Him and all the staff give us all confidence on the training pitch, with his strategies, the way we play... I really like it.\"",
      "Palmer's campaign has been plagued by fitness issues, with him sidelined for 21 matches across all competitions this term. He has, though, appeared in the previous four fixtures in all competitions, getting the nod in the last two Premier League outings.",
      "He offered a revealing acknowledgement regarding his condition. \"I don't think [I'm 100% fit] just yet,\" he said.",
      "\"Obviously people don't know what goes on behind the scenes but being injured the whole season is not ideal and when I'm not able to perform as I want to because I've been injured, and still dealing with the injury, but hopefully I can get over the injury soon by managing it. I know what level I can provide when I feel 100% fit.",
      "Cole Palmer scored a first-half hat-trick for Chelsea against Wolves (Image: Ben Roberts Photo, Getty Images)",
      "\"Not being 100% fit isn't ideal, I still feel like I can help the team but when I'm back to full fitness I feel like I can go to another level.\"",
      "In conversation with Chelsea's official site, Palmer continued: \"I've never been injured before in my career. This is something new to me, and I'm still finding out how to deal with it.",
      "\"It has been frustrating, I don't feel like I've played a game this season fully fit. I've been going into games thinking, 'Can I do certain things? Can I not?' Overthinking it.",
      "\"The staff have been really good. I've been working closely with the physios on a day-to-day basis. They have all helped, and I'll get through it.",
      "\"I'm not here to make excuses, and ''ll get over the injuries. I know what I can do when I'm fit, and hopefully I can get back to that soon. For now, I just manage it and get there.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has played 90 minutes in each of the last four games(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick believes there is ‘more to come’ from Kobbie Mainoo as his Manchester United renaissance rolls on. The midfielder looked set to have little future at Old Trafford under former boss Ruben Amorim having fallen out of contention under the Portuguese coach.",
      "He was even linked with a move away from the club, Italian side Napoli among those interested in him. But Mainoo is now firmly back in the fold at United, having played 90 minutes in each of the last four games.",
      "And it appears Carrick is a big fan, tipping Mainoo for a bright future. Speaking after Saturday’s 2-0 win vs Spurs, he said: “There’s definitely more to come from him, that’s just the age he’s at, the stage he’s at in his career you’d like to think, he’s just starting out really essentially. He has got so much experience under his belt in big games and pressured situations, which is going to help him develop learning the game.",
      "“Playing next to Case [Casmiro] and learning off him, things that he’s probably not even realising he’s picking things up just by being next to him, as well as the other players around him, I think that’s just part of his journey to learn and develop.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“I’m really conscious that he’s come in, he’s played the four games and he’s found his rhythm. Young players, they have times when they’re up and then they might have a little dip. That’s not all of a sudden he’s good or he’s a poor player, Kobbie is what he is.",
      "“Managing that’s really important, especially for younger players and understanding that. He’s doing fantastic at the moment, he’s having a really big impact on games, and we’ll keep working with him and helping him, trying to keep improving him as well as we go.",
      "Asked how Mainoo has overcome a challenging season to re-establish himself as a key player at United, Carrick replied: “There’s no doubt of Kobbie’s ability and what he can bring, he’s still so young and let’s be careful of not putting so much right on his shoulders and expecting so much of him. He’s still learning the game.",
      "Mainoo is now firmly back in contention at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“Because he’s had the big high and then obviously didn’t play for a bit, it’s easy to think he’s a lot older and more experienced probably than he is. But credit to him, he’s come right in and find his rhythm with football, which is not easy after a period of time out and he’s found that physically and mentally.",
      "“We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I’m sure he’ll keep improving. We’ve got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sancho, 25, finally chalked up his first Premier League goal contribution at the weekend as he teed-up Morgan Rogers for Villa’s opener against Bournemouth. While Emery has claimed that he is improving, the Spaniard has said that he wants to see even more from the United forward.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Sancho was then sent to Chelsea last term, with the Blues having agreed to a £25m obligation to buy, albeit the Blues paid £5m to back out of that agreement. Sancho's current United deal expires this summer and is yet to put pen to paper on a new deal with the Red Devils.",
      "Elsewhere, Sancho is not the only one of his Villa stars that Emery has sent a message to. Brazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz re-joined the side on loan from Juventus in January despite reported interest from Chelsea.",

      "Romero has to take a huge slice of the blame for Spurs' defeat to Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“We only had 11 players available - unbelievable but true and disgraceful.” Cristian Romero, after the stirring Spurs comeback against Manchester City last Sunday.",
      "And after less than half an hour in their next game, Tottenham Hotspur, on the pitch, only had 10 players available - unbelievable but true and disgraceful.",
      "That Manchester United’s revival under Michael Carrick continued with a fourth win on the spin was down to their renewed vibrancy, a couple of bits of clever finishing and an incisive, more direct, attacking style.",
      "But it was also down to the stupidity of Romero, to his entirely predictable loss of control. After the Argentinian defender’s social media post laying into the Spurs hierarchy in the week, manager Thomas Frank said the matter would be dealt with internally but that Romero would remain captain.",
      "And he did. Remained Captain Liability, that is. From the moment the 50-50 situation with Casemiro developed, there was only ever going to be one outcome.",
      "Michael Oliver’s red card was on its way out before Romero’s right boot had crunched into Casemiro’s ankle. A minority could probably argue it was a little harsh but the force left Oliver with little choice but to give Romero his fourth Premier League red card.",
      "Those cards have come against United, City, Chelsea and Liverpool. He loves a big game dismissal, Cristian. That is two reds and nine yellows this season. Some going.",
      "And this particular transgression - which, it has to be said, was not that much worse than Diogo Dalot’s yellow-card offence against Jeremy Doku here - definitely gave United a helping hand they probably did not need.",
      "Lifted by their man-advantage, a clever corner-kick routine - finished by Bryan Mbeumo - put them ahead and they never looked in any trouble from that point.",
      "Romero was sent off for a crunching challenge on Casemiro(Image: Getty Images)",
      "This was, by no means, a scintillating performance but there is a positivity about Old Trafford that makes the long-term appointment of Carrick seem increasingly like an obvious decision.",
      "The resurgence under him should be no surprise. This is a good United squad, expensively assembled and in rude health. The workload is very easily manageable and the overall standard of this season’s Premier League is of dubious quality.",
      "This was United’s 27th game of the season, ten fewer than Spurs have had to play. The decisiveness of that factor cannot be underestimated. More games does not just mean more fatigue, it means more injuries.",
      "United only have 13 matches to tackle in the remaining 15 weeks of the season. With the resources at his disposal, Carrick could rotate selection if he wished but there is no need. If this eleven stays fit, he could play it for the rest of the season.",
      "He might make a few changes for Tuesday’s trip to West Ham but this set-up has a winning way about it and should have made the scoreline more convincing against the Tottenham ten.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been in brilliant form for Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Unlike during their recent away trip to Burnley, the travelling Spurs support did not turn on Frank, presumably because Spurs were playing well before Romero decided to earn himself a four-game suspension.",
      "As reckless as he can be, the centre-half will still be missed and personnel issues continue to undermine Frank. There are no such issues for Carrick, who has not only found a system that suits his players but is also getting the best out of individuals.",
      "The agreement for Casemiro and the club to part ways at the end of the season is looking more hasty with every game the Brazilian plays under Carrick.",
      "The midfield combination of Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes is purring. There are still suggestions Fernandes might also leave in the summer but, from United’s point of view, it would be madness to let him leave.",
      "For another outstanding contribution, he deserved his goal late in proceedings. And if Romero was still watching, this is what a captain’s performance looks like.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United responded quickly with a goal from Mbeumo, following a well-executed corner routine by Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo. It took some time for the Red Devils to wrap up the three points, but they did just that after a fine finish from Fernandes in the 81st minute secured a fourth-straight victory under their temporary head coach.",

      "\"My issue with Jonny is he's got no coaching. It's not as if he worked in the academy for a few years. He comes in with Darren Fletcher and he has very little experience but he's worked at academy level. Jonny gets a phone call saying: 'Do you want to come back?'",

      "Spurs were left up against it when Cristian Romero was sent off for a moment of stupidity. And the Londoners' misery was compounded when a smart set-piece routine enabled Bryan Mbeumo to break the deadlock with a measured side-foot finish beyond Guglielmo Vicario seven minutes before half-time.",
      "With a man advantage, United pushed for a second but were unable to find it until Bruno Fernandes popped up in the 81st minute to kill the game off.",
      "Tottenham hadn't lost in their previous eight meetings with Manchester United. But that stat was always on borrowed time from the second Romero was sent off by Michael Oliver.",
      "United got the goal their pressure deserved when Mbeumo found the net from inside a crowded penalty area after a neat piece of play. And while it took them until the final 10 minutes to fully kill Spurs off, the result never really felt in doubt.",

      "They say actions speak louder than words. And Romero's latest red card (he's now up to six, if you're counting) has completely outdone his latest verbal volley at the Spurs hierarchy in midweek.",
      "It was a stupid follow through on Casemiro's ankle that led to Tottenham's captain being given his marching orders. To the surprise of precisely nobody, Romero let his club and team-mates down yet again in a big match - and the smart money would be on him doing it again and again.",
      "That's because Romero is more liability than leader. He'll now miss Tottenham's next four matches and won't play again till mid-March if selected for Liverpool. And surely nobody would begrudge Thomas Frank if he decides against recalling him.",
      "A moment of genius involving Fernandes, Mainoo and Kobbie Mainoo from a corner was enough to take the game away from Tottenham in the dying embers of the first half.",
      "Spurs were completely taken by surprise as Fernandes tucked a low ball into Mainoo at the near post. He then posted the ball onto Mbuemo who kept his cool to steer a precise low shot away from the despairing Vicario and into the bottom corner.",
      "It's almost felt like a bit of a throwback at times in the Premier League this season with set-pieces becoming so important. The good news for United in their bid to finish in the top-four is that this smart routine was no one-off; only Arsenal boast a better tally when it comes to non-penalty goals from set-pieces this season than Manchester United now.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo impressed again for Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United FC)",
      "Maligned by the previous regime, Mainoo needs no introduction; everybody knows how talented he is. And yet every time you see United with Carrick at the helm, the reluctance of Amorim to find a spot for him in his team grows more and more bewildering.",
      "He was effortlessly cool and classy here as United cantered to another big win with only Fernandes (4) completing more big passes than the England star's three. Not for the first time, they were the standout players for United with Fernandes' strike bringing up his 200th goal involvement in a red shirt.",
      "In four Premier League games under Carrick, Mainoo has clocked up more minutes than he did during all Amorim's matches. The most exciting thing for United and Mainoo is that there should be plenty more to come.",
      "Michael Carrick has made a dream start to life in the Manchester United hotseat(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA)",
      "Carrick showed his class on the eve of the game when he insisted there could be no 'knee-jerk' decisions over the Manchester United head coach job despite his fine start to life in the hotseat. Even though he would be the chief beneficiary if United's top brass did decide to pull the trigger after a significant upturn in form.",
      "The thing is, soon we'll be well beyond knee-jerk territory. In winning four straight Premier League games, Carrick has achieved something that his predecessor, Ruben Amorim, never did. So how many wins before Carrick is seen as the sensible option?",
      "The next few weeks will be intriguing because if United keep winning, then it will be difficult to ignore Carrick. They are now just two points off Aston Villa in third position and motoring.",
      "United spent over a year trying to find a winning formula under Amorim, who was given every chance to make a success of his premiership. Now they've finally found one under Carrick, do they dare twist?",

      "Cristian Romero was shown a red card after a foul on Casemiro (Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Cristian Romero will serve a four-match ban after being shown a red card for a poor tackle on Manchester United midfielder Casemiro. The Tottenham captain was dismissed 29 minutes into the Premier League's early kick-off on Saturday at Old Trafford.",
      "Romero went into a challenge with Casemiro and caught the Brazilian on the ankle. Referee Michael Oliver was right on the scene and immediately brandished the red card.",
      "The Spurs skipper didn't seem to argue and went over to check on Casemiro before trudging off, leaving his side with an uphill battle against United, who took the lead shortly after through Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "He will miss Spurs' next four Premier League matches, against Newcastle, Arsenal, Fulham and Crystal Palace, having earned an extra game of suspension because its his second red of the season.",
      "The Premier League match centre wrote on X: \"The referee’s call of red card to Romero for serious foul play was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that the challenge was made with excessive force and endangered an opponent.\"",
      "Ex-Premier League referee Darren Cann told BBC Sport: \"Cristian Romero makes a forceful challenge on Casemiro which is, in law, undoubtedly a serious foul play tackle. It was a really excellent decision from referee Michael Oliver, who was brilliantly positioned.\"",
      "Ex-Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said: \"It was a really enjoyable high-tempo game, and then Romero goes through the ball with too much ferocity and catches Casemiro. It's a red card. It is irresponsible, especially after a week where he's been talking about recruitment and a lack of players. Now he's going be missing for four games. He's the captain, the leader - he needs to do better. He's let his team-mates down, because they were in the game.\"",
      "Cristian Romero went to check on Casemiro after catching him(Image: Neal Simpson/Getty Images)",
      "Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I think that is a borderline one. It is a contact sport. Casemiro's speed of thought gets him there first and Romero as he always does is fully committed. For me it is not an automatic red because it's not like he was high and over the top of the ball, but he does make contact.\"",
      "The red card continues a chaotic few months for Romero, who has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. At the start of January, he accused the Tottenham hierarchy of lying and later described the lack of depth in the squad as \"disgraceful\".",
      "Tottenham manager Thomas Frank was forced to defend his captain in the build-up to the United game. “Cuti is a very passionate player and captain who wants to leave every­thing on the pitch,” said Frank.",
      "“He is very ambitious and wants to win every single time. Sometimes, when you are like that, you can have an outburst like this time but we have dealt with it internally.”",

      "He told TNT Sport: \"Ben’s been fantastic. He’s going to be a big player for a long. I've been really impressed by him and everything I’ve seen from him is really encouraging. It was a huge moment for him last week and I'm sure he will have more of those.",
      "\"Today was just a decision I’ve made but Ben will come on and make a big difference for us again.\" Following his decisive strike in last Sunday's win at Old Trafford, Sesko was a dominant topic at Carrick's pre-match press conference with the United interim head coach making his feelings perfectly clear.",
      "He said “Huge moment [for him to score a winner at the Stretford End. I’m so, so pleased. Everyone in the changing room, players, staff, delighted for him, absolutely delighted for him and the reception he got when he came back in the changing room told us everything. Confidence, it wasn’t so much that.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "\"He’s been fantastic, we’ve worked with him a lot in different ways over the last couple of weeks. He’s bright in training, he’s looked dangerous, he’s done extra.",
      "\"The coaches have done a lot of bits on the side and Travis [Binnion], particularly, has done a lot of work one-on-one with him.",
      "\"Ben’s a big talent, he’s got so many positive things. And today’s a huge goal because that feeling as a striker to score a winner in front of the Stretford End late like that, it’s what you dream of.",
      "\"After missing the chance, which is what it is, strikers miss chances, to go again and put that away. Absolutely so, so pleased for him. He really deserved it.”",
      "It has not been an easy start to life at his new club with injury striking in the reverse fixture against Spurs. He was absent for the following four Premier League games before returning off the bench against Bournemouth in mid-December.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has scored four goals from his last four appearances(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "He failed to find the back of the net in his next four starts under Ruben Amorim, but he scored three times during Darren Fletcher's brief run in temporary charge.",
      "With more attacking options available after returns from AFCON for Bryan Mbeumo and Amad, he has been forced to play reduced minutes. The former has been starting as the centre-forward under Carrick, but Sesko has come off the bench in two of those games.",
      "United only have the Premier League to focus on which likely means he will have to settle for more substitute appearances.",
      "However, given the swift turnaround between the visit of Tottenham and trip to West Ham next Tuesday, he could be handed a start at London Stadium especially if he shines off the bench again.",

      "So it was no surprise that Carrick the coach was the man to end United's dismal recent run against Spurs. The iconic Sir Alex Ferguson phrase \"lads, it's Tottenham\" hasn't really been working recently. They had failed to beat Spurs in any of their last eight games.",
      "That reached a nadir in May in what was a rotten Europa League final in Bilbao. United didn't turn up, and Tottenham won a wretched game, but in some ways, maybe that is now helping Carrick. He is putting the free midweeks to better use than Ruben Amorim ever was, anyway.",
      "There was again evidence of United getting things right between games, though this match changed when Cristian Romero was shown a red card for catching Casemiro on the ankle after half an hour. It summed up the way things are going for Carrick at the moment that any worries about having to break down 10 men were quickly put to bed with an excellent set-piece routine.",
      "Things threatened to get nervous before Bruno Fernandes killed the game off nine minutes from the end, securing Carrick a fourth successive win in charge. Not all of this performance was convincing, but if he keeps winning, then the job will be his. Champions League football certainly feels like it is getting closer.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "That was the prize on offer in that Europa League final. United have suffered financially without it, but there is an argument they are now better placed as a result of that defeat. Had Amorim enjoyed the sort of European campaign that Thomas Frank has, then he would surely still be in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "Instead, the Stretford End is belting out 'it's Carrick, you know' and positivity is flowing around Old Trafford again. Kobbie Mainoo couldn't get a look in under Amorim but was once again outstanding here.",
      "Most importantly, United have shown the benefits of time on the training ground under a coaching staff with a plan that suits them. Carrick is hands-on at Carrington, and Steve Holland's experience has been invaluable. Some of the football they produced against Tottenham had the hallmarks of training time all over it.",
      "The front three of Amad, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo played off the cuff but with an understanding of what they were trying to do and where they would be. They were close in distance, and that allowed for the kind of interchanges that can trouble any defence.",
      "Amad and Cunha nearly prised open the Spurs defence with one slick first-half exchange, before Mainoo and Amad linked up to scythe through the midfield and open up space.",
      "United had looked enterprising, but the challenge changed when Romero was sent off. Although the advantage was now United's, Old Trafford held its breath as Casemiro rolled around in agony. The success of this season might just hinge on his fitness, so the sigh of relief when he picked himself up was audible.",
      "The sending-off meant United now had to break down a low block. The best way to do that is often from set-pieces and it took just nine minutes to do so. Jonny Evans has been in charge of set-pieces on Carrick's coaching team and he deserves credit for this routine, as do the analysts who spotted the space to exploit.",
      "Mainoo's run across the goalmouth created space, and from Fernandes' low pass, he turned it back to the edge of the box, where Mbeumo was unmarked with room to run on the ball.",
      "His low, left-footed finish was perfectly placed and was a particularly painful blow for his former Brentford boss Frank, who tried to hijack Mbeumo's move to Old Trafford in the summer. The forward only had eyes for Old Trafford and although Spurs' interest pushed the price up, he has looked to be worth every penny of the £65million it cost United to sign him.",
      "He is certainly making an impact in the big games as well. He has scored home and away against Tottenham this season, as well as finding the back of the net against Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "His goal gave United the cushion they needed, but driving home the advantage proved difficult. Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot had shots from distance saved by Guglielmo Vicario around the hour mark, and Harry Maguire could feel aggrieved he didn't get a penalty when Micky van de Ven channelled the Six Nations spirit to rugby tackle his fellow centre-back.",
      "Things were threatening to become nervous and anxiety was seeping in, but Fernandes relieved the pressure valve. Sub Benjamin Sesko couldn't connect with Dalot's cross but Fernandes produced an instinctive finish to steer the ball back across goal and inside the post to put the game to bed.",

      "Michael Carrick made it four wins from four in charge of Manchester United as his dream start continued with a 2-0 win over 10-man Tottenham.",
      "United profited from Cristian Romero's first half sending off with Bryan Mbuemo slotting the Reds in front from a well worked corner routine shortly after the visitors were reduced to 10 men.",

      "Martinez's touch was awful and Dalot completely missed a header from a corner. United cannot afford to lose concentration when the game is 1-0. Meanwhile, Carrick is preparing Sesko to be introduced to the game.",
      "United need to kill this game off with another goal because Tottenham have a chance to salvage a result if the scoreline stays the same.",

      "The turnaround with Carrick has been nothing short of remarkable. The red card changed the game completely, but United are now in a stellar position to secure a fourth win on the bounce in the Premier League.",
      "What a clever finish from Mbeumo, who finds the bottom right corner.",
      "Beautiful corner routine from Fernandes and Mainoo.",
      "That is Romero all over. A heavy touch and then a recklessly heavy tackle that could have seriously injured another player. Six red cards in his Tottenham career and although the fans love him, he is also a liability. Thankfully for United Casemiro looks fine, that could have been a lot worse for him.",

      "Cunha tried his luck with a shot form long range and it flashed inches wide of the post.",
      "Carrick watched on nervously from the touchline when Tottenham fired a ball across the box, but the danger was thwarted. Frank will be pleased with his side's start to the match. Simons has caught the eye and is finally performing in a big game. He made a poor start to life at Spurs, but is slowly getting going.",
      "Tottenham just worked the ball forward well to create a decent chance for Gallagher.",
      "Billiant pressing from Fernandes, who sprinted from the front and forced Tottenham into losing the ball.",
      "Cunha looks sharp. He just pleased the crowd with a cheeky backheel and was involved in a slick move around the box. He placed his hands on his head when it came to nothing.",
      "Same team for United but one noticeable tactical shift. Cunha is playing through the middle today, with Mbeumo out on the left. Cunha dropping deep but doing so from more of a central position."

      "Carrick's son Jacey was spotted in the away end at Arsenal last month. Carrick has spoken about how much United means to him. He was raised in Newcastle and spent time in London with West Ham and Tottenham, but he has spent his most cherished years in Manchester.",
      "There may be more special years to come at Old Trafford for Carrick. It's still too early to say whether he should be given the job on a permanent basis, but he couldn't have made a better start.",
      "Casemiro enjoyed the goal",
      "Casemiro was so chuffed with Fernandes' late goal to wrap up the victory that he attempted to persuade Senne Lammens to celebrate with the team in the corner by the Stretford End.",
      "Casemiro shared a warm embrace with Lisandro Martinez before waving his hands to gesture to Lammens to join in with his teammates. The goalkeeper briefly thought about it, jogging to the halfway line, but decided to resist the temptation.",
      "Lammens is sensible and level-headed. He knew the job wasn't done yet and didn't want to get ahead of himself by joining in with the celebrations. Andre Onana, his predecessor, did not have that perspective.",
      "The unsung analyst",
      "United are the strongest team from set-pieces this season, having recorded the highest number of goals scored per 100 set-plays. Arsenal have earned a reputation as being prolific from set-pieces, but United have a better record from fewer of them, and they scored from a beautiful routine against Spurs.",
      "Fernandes played the corner short to Mainoo, who found Mbeumo in the box. There was still plenty for the Cameroon international to do - and his finish into the bottom right corner was sublime.",
      "Carlos Fernandes looked after set-pieces when Ruben Amorim was in charge. Fernandes came onto the touchline every time United won a set-piece, but Carrick's backroom staff remained seated.",
      "It's understood set-pieces are a collective responsibility among the current coaching staff, however, perhaps Kaita Hasgawa deserves another mention for doing important work behind the scenes.",
      "Amorim namedropped Hasgawa as someone who deserved praise for improving set-pieces and helping to tactically prepare for the opponent. Hasegawa's position has not been described as senior, but he was recruited from Everton after seven years in Merseyside, and is thought to play an important role.",
      "Hasgawa sat with the analyst team beside the press box against Tottenham. The analysts would have taken great satisfaction from another set-piece goal, especially after a corner routine that was so well-worked.",
      "Stretford End jeers",
      "The Romero red card changed the complexion of the game. The contest had flowed well and Tottenham looked dangerous, but Romero could have no complaints when Michael Oliver showed him a straight red.",
      "The challenge on Casemiro was reckless and the Brazilian looked in a world of pain when he slumped to the turf. Thomas Frank tried to reason with the fourth official, but had no serious case to overturn it.",
      "The Stretford End chanted Casemiro's name while he received treatment, but their attention turned to Romero as he returned to the dressing room. \"Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio,\" fans taunted as Romero walked off.",
      "Romero slammed Tottenham's board for their lack of investment when the January transfer window closed, but the Spurs captain only had himself to blame for his side's defeat.",
      "The classy Munich tributes",
      "It was the 68th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster on Friday. United held a memorial service at Old Trafford, and there were further tributes from fans in the Stretford End before the Totttenham game.",
      "United fans unfurled a \"Busby Babes\" banner in the upper tier of the stand, which was followed by a \"we'll never die\" banner being unfurled in the lower tier. Carrick laid a wreath on the pitch alongside Frank.",
      "The players wore black armbands, and Fernandes wore a special captain's armband to pay tribute to the tragedy. Most wouldn't have seen the Munich clock attached to Fernandes' arm. \"Stand up for the Busby Babes,\" was aired in the first half, and thousands of supporters rose to their feet.",
      "United show their class with their tributes each year to the Munich Air Disaster. Fernandes attended the memorial service on the day before the game, and the armband he wore was a nice touch.",

      "The 23‑year‑old struck all three goals for Chelsea in the first half at Molineux, underlining the impact he can make on a match. During his first season at Stamford Bridge, Palmer netted 27 goals in all competitions, collected multiple individual awards, and established himself as a regular for England.",

      "Fernandes was spotted in the comments section of Palmer's Instagram post after the match, where the Chelsea star shared several snaps from the game alongside the caption: \"Just enjoy.\"",

      "Michael Carrick has given Manchester United a new lease of life(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick may just be four matches into an interim head coaching stint with Manchester United, but he has already shown up the failures that Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim managed in their disastrous time in charge during the 2024/25 season.",
      "There was a wealth of scepticism in the air when the 44-year-old arrived at Old Trafford last month. United fans were well within their right, of course, given that he was only sacked by Middlesbrough in the summer for guiding the club to a lacklustre 10th place finish in the Championship standings in 2024/25.",
      "Meanwhile, Carrick's caretaker role with the club following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November 2021 lasted less than a month before he was replaced by Ralf Rangnick.",
      "During his initial stint at the helm, Carrick achieved two wins and a draw from a total of three matches before he announced his shock decision to depart after a win against Arsenal and be replaced by the German - with Ten Hag taking up tenure at the end of 2021/22. What ensued next was two years of rot and questionable choices with an FA Cup trophy lift thrown in before the Dutchman was ultimately given the boot in October 2024, with Amorim left to pick up the pieces.",
      "The Portuguese tactician failed to restore any glory to the Theatre of Dreams in his first season in charge, finishing a lowly 15th in the Premier League standings and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur - albeit, mainly utilising a squad he inherited from his predecessor.",
      "Giving Amorim the benefit of the doubt, the board backed him in the summer transfer window and afforded him a full pre-season schedule to play with to fine-tune his team. And while Amorim was handed a sizeable budget to bring in the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens, the 41-year-old never really managed to get the best out of his new arrivals.",
      "That's largely down to Amorim being insistent on favouring a failing 3-4-2-1 formation, utilising Amad as a wing-back when he clearly thrives in an attacking role, and dropping Bruno Fernandes deeper into the heart of the engine room alongside Casemiro, despite the skipper proving time and time again he is the club's most valuable asset in the pocket.",
      "A decision to drop Kobbie Mainoo, meanwhile, rubbed a number of fans the wrong way, especially given how fruitful the England international had been in the engine room prior to his arrival.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "And that's not to mention his public fallout with Marcus Rashford, pushing away perhaps one of the club's most talented all-time academy products, who left on a short-term deal to Aston Villa and has since gone on to thrive in a season-long loan with Barcelona when he could have been doing the business at Old Trafford instead.",
      "On the flipside, Carrick has not only managed to forge promising relationships with his squad in such a short space of time, but has also been able to do something that not Amorim nor Ten Hag, nor Solskjaer nor Jose Mourinho, Louis van Gaal or David Moyes could; get United back to running like the finely-tuned machine it was under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "You can see that there's an air of fresh start fever around Old Trafford at present, revamping it into a genuine Theatre of Dreams as of late compared to the one of nightmares it has been for the past 13 or so years since Fergie's retirement.",
      "That opinion is backed further by the fact that United have now eclipsed their Premier League points season tally from last season, currently sitting fourth in the standings and on the brink of European qualification with 44 points to the 42 that Amorim and Ten Hag managed in 2024/25.",
      "Ruben Amorim was sacked by Manchester United in January(Image: PA)",
      "To add further food for thought, there are still 13 matches remaining in the current campaign, meaning United could potentially bag a further 39 points by season's end, should Carrick's undefeated form continue to burn bright. Such events coming to fruition would put the Reds on a staggering total of 83 points - just one less than Liverpool achieved to win the title last time out.",
      "Let's not get carried away, with the form that Arsenal are in at present, it would take some form of divine intervention to see Mikel Arteta bottle the club's first league title in more than two decades. But if United could achieve even seven or eight wins from their remaining fixtures it should be enough to seal qualification to the Champions League.",
      "Given the collapse of relationships have been a key factor in underwhelming seasons for United as of late - from Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho's falling out with Amorim to Cristiano Ronaldo's alarming spat with Ten Hag - it's vital that Carrick is able to keep his players content going forward, win, lose or draw.",
      "If he's able to do so, the future certainly looks bright for the Wallsend-born coach, who could even be awarded permanent tenure this summer for his achievements. While there have been calls from pundits and fans alike for United to consider a more-seasoned head coach when Carrick's interim role concludes, it's hard to see past the Englishman given his form at present.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo has admitted that the set-piece plan that saw him give his side the lead against Tottenham was tried in training - but did not work. United came out as 2-0 winners over 10-man Tottenham at Old Trafford to extend their winning run under interim manager Michael Carrick.",
      "They were handed a boost in the 29th minute when Spurs captain Cristian Romero was shown a straight red card for a foul on United midfielder Casemiro. Carrick’s side were able to make their advantage count just under 10 minutes later.",
      "A well-worked set-piece routine from a corner saw the ball make its way to Mbeumo on the edge of the area. He made no mistake with his shot, sweeping it low into the bottom right-hand corner.",

      "Michael Carrick has restored Kobbie Mainoo to the Manchester United team",
      "If there was concern for the future of the Manchester United academy while Ruben Amorim was in charge at Old Trafford, the club's prestigious record of blooding young players is in safe hands while Michael Carrick is around. Amorim's relationship with the academy wasn't a particularly strong one and his absence from games and sidelining of Kobbie Mainoo invited mistrust.",
      "In three weeks, Carrick has shown a very different approach. He has attended two Under-21 games and an FA Youth Cup tie, and Mainoo has played every minute of his three games in charge.",
      "Mainoo's renaissance has been one of the stories of Carrick's return to the dugout. The jewel in the crown of the United academy, he is set to be offered a long-term contract that reflects his status as a key player in the first team and any concerns that he might have to leave have disappeared.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "The 20-year-old was weighing up a loan move at the start of January, having failed to start a single Premier League game under Amorim this season, but he is firmly back in the picture now and contract talks are back on the agenda.",
      "Carrick restored Mainoo to the team because he knew he needed what the Stockport-born youngster could offer, but the 44-year-old is also steeped in United's traditions and although his contract is only until the end of the season, he has been a visible presence around the academy.",
      "This week, he included 15-year-old forward JJ Gabriel in first-team training, even though he is too young to appear in the Premier League this season. He also called up 17-year-old full-back Yuel Helafu, twins Jack and Tyler Fletcher, 18, and 20-year-old midfielder Jack Moorhouse.",
      "Carrick's focus on delivering Champions League football for United this season might prevent him from handing out many appearances to those young players, but over time, he is determined to see more of the club's academy graduates given their chance and believes there is nothing better than giving a young player their opportunity.",
      "\"We want more, we want more players to come through the system and to get into the first team,\" said Carrick. \"For me, there's no better feeling than giving younger players a chance. He's [Mainoo] taken the chance over recent weeks and I am sure he will continue to do that.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"Obviously, with Munich and the kind of the foundation of the football club, everything feeds off that. I'm not putting everything on Kobbie's shoulders, he's doing terrific at the moment and I'm sure he'll continue to be that way.\"",
      "United's record of including an academy graduate in every matchday squad now extends into an 89th year, although there were times under Amorim when you did fear how much longer it would last and whether it would become a tick-box exercise.",
      "That is no longer the case. Mainoo is in the team on merit and Shea Lacey has also become part of the first-team picture in recent weeks.",
      "Lacey, 18, was handed six minutes of football under Amorim and was an unused substitute in seven of the eight occasions he was named on the bench. Darren Fletcher gave the winger minutes against Burnley and Brighton and he was back in the squad under Carrick last weekend.",
      "\"I think from the club's point of view, there's an ideal scenario to bring players through the academy and have them in the team and have them go through their career at this club, staying in and around it,\" said Carrick.",
      "\"I think I was fortunate enough to be with a lot of players that managed to do that, and I think it's important.\"",

      "The 19-year-old has had a breakthrough season for RB Leipzig, registering eight goals and six assists in 21 games in Germany. Diomande only turned 19 in November but is already attracting the attention of some of Europe's biggest clubs.

Diomande only moved to the Bundesliga club last summer but major European teams are already starting to sniff around the forward.",

      "It was while Diomande was at the tournament in Morocco that he earned the seal of approval from Amad. Having enjoyed a rapid rise, United's winger has forged a good friendship with the teenager which could become useful at the end of the season.",
      "When asked about Diomande, Amad said: \"We’re very close off the pitch, so that makes things easier on the pitch. If I have the opportunity to pass to him, I pass to him; if he has the opportunity to pass to me, he passes to me.",
      "\"Yan is a very good player, everyone knows that.\" While it may seem trivial to some, having a player in your camp with an existing friendship with a transfer target might well help your cause.",
      "You only have to look back to the summer and Andre Onana's role in bringing Mbeumo to Old Trafford. The goalkeeper worked to convince the former Brentford man United was the right place for his next career move.",
      "Should United pick up the phone for Diomande in the summer and the forward wishes to seek advice, he may well speak to Amad. Carrick might not be the man in the hot seat by then, but the job he is doing so far should make any sell a little easier by the summer.",
      "Champions League football might be a must for Diomande in the 2026/27 season and there is no guarantee either United or Leipzig will be able to offer it to him. But if Carrick does manage to turn this good start into qualification for the competition, the Ivorian may be even more inclined to sign for the Reds should they make an approach.",

      "Casemiro is set to leave in the summer.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United will invest in their midfield in the summer transfer window. Casemiro will leave at the end of the season, bringing down the curtain on four years in Manchester.",
      "United agreed to Casemiro’s request to confirm his summer departure, and a video with the Brazilian explaining his decision was released on club channels. United sources said the decision not to renew Casemiro's contract had been made well in advance of the announcement.",
      "Michael Carrick recently said his opinion would be canvassed on potential replacements for Casemiro, and the conversation about who should succeed the 33-year-old is ongoing among supporters.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are admired at Old Trafford. None of those options would be available cheaply, and there are question marks about whether they are ready to sign for United. Our writers have debated who United should sign to replace Casemiro...",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "The challenge for whoever comes in to replace Casemiro will be dealing with the pressure of doing just that. A five-time Champions League winner, 82 caps (and counting) for Brazil and nine years at Real Madrid, he was comfortable in the Old Trafford pressure cooker from day one.",
      "I like Elliot Anderson as the most stylistically similar fit to Casemiro. He is proving his worth as a holding midfielder for England, but also has a brilliant passing range. Casemiro could do both of those jobs, shielding his back four but also progressing the ball and helping to penetrate a low block.",
      "Anderson has nowhere near the experience of Casemiro, but he is the type of character who doesn't seem to get fazed. The way he has settled into the England squad and won over Thomas Tuchel is a positive sign.",
      "Adam Wharton is a fascinating player, but also a bit of a maverick in that position. I would be fascinated to see him at an elite-level club. But I think Anderson is more likely to be successful and brings a better all-round package at the moment.",
      "Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest(Image: Andrew Kearns - CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "Steven Railston",
      "If United are prepared to splash close to £100m on the likes of Anderson, Baleba and Wharton, they should test the waters by enquiring about Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.",
      "The worst Madrid can do is say no. I would prefer Anderson to Baleba and Wharton, but I've got my doubts about whether the Nottingham Forest talent is cut out for such a big move at this stage of his career.",
      "The expectation to perform to a high level each week at United is completely different to playing for Nottingham Forest. Anderson has excelled for England, but in games against the likes of Wales and Latvia.",
      "Camavinga may be an ambitious target, though. There were murmurs of interest in Morten Hjulmand last summer, and perhaps he could be an option. The 26-year-old is a Denmark international and scored an equaliser against England at Euro 2024, finishing brilliantly from 30 yards to secure a point for his country in the group stage.",
      "Atletico Madrid have been linked with a move for the Sporting Lisbon captain at the end of the season. United did alright the last time they raided Sporting for a midfielder.",
      "Sporting captain Morten Hjulmand.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Jeremy Cross",
      "United need to look to the future when strengthening their midfield this summer. Casemiro has been an expensive sticking plaster.",
      "United have to invest in someone who has his best years ahead of him, and will still have sell-on value when the time comes for him to move elsewhere. Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton both fit the bill.",
      "And United should pick Anderson ahead of Wharton. The Nottingham Forest midfielder is more versatile than Wharton, and has now established himself at the highest level with England.",
      "He will go to the World Cup this summer, where it is hoped he will improve his game even more. He doesn't look like someone who would be fazed by the pressure and expectation that comes with playing for United.",

      "Benjamin Sesko delivered for Michael Carrick last week and now he needs to start a game",
      "The injury Patrick Dorgu picked up against Arsenal made Michael Carrick's decision a simple one last week, but had the in-form winger remained fit, it would have been interesting to see how the Manchester United head coach would have dealt with a predicament that is threatening to become a regular occurrence.",
      "After two goals in two games against Manchester City and Arsenal, Dorgu looked to have nailed down the spot on the left wing in Carrick's 4-2-3-1 system. The headache was Matheus Cunha, who came off the bench in both matches to register an assist and a goal.",
      "Carrick was interesting when speaking about the Brazilian at the Emirates Stadium after he scored the late winner, explaining how disappointed he had been not to start either game, but that he had channelled that frustration in the right way to make an impact off the bench.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "It was excellent man-management from the 44-year-old, but Carrick has been around the block often enough to know that it also has a shelf life. After that kind of impact as a substitute, Cunha needs the reward of a start.",
      "The problem with that is the lack of games available to United this season. In the flow of a relatively standard United season, there would have been a European game for Cunha to start between those fixtures. There would be another FA Cup tie on the horizon.",
      "Instead, there are only league fixtures, and only a couple of those are midweek rounds between now and the end of the season. After his heroics as a substitute, Cunha hadn't started for three weeks. Carrick had got a tune out of the £62.5million summer signing, but had he been benched once again for the Fulham fixture, that might have changed.",
      "It is all well and good to challenge players to make an impact off the bench, but there has to be a reward when they rise to that challenge; otherwise, it becomes hollow. There will be a feeling that no matter what you do with your limited time on the pitch, it won't be enough to earn you a start.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "That's why Cunha had to start against Fulham, no matter what. The injury to Dorgu, while extremely unfortunate for a player in the best form of his United career, simply opened an easy route back into the team.",
      "Keeping a squad happy will be a challenge for Carrick over the next 14 games. It might even be the biggest challenge he faces when there are just four games in February and four games in March. Rotation isn't looking likely at the moment, with a settled team delivering results.",
      "The next situation for the former United midfielder to assess is that of Benjamin Sesko, who shone in two games under Darren Fletcher but has been a substitute in all three under Carrick. The £73million striker has been on the pitch for just 25 minutes across those matches.",
      "But he delivered what Carrick believes to be a \"huge moment\" on Sunday, scoring that 94th-minute winner against Fulham. It has undoubtedly given the 22-year-old a major lift and he has four goals in his last four appearances for United.",
      "Can Carrick keep that confidence and momentum going with cameos off the bench here and there? Or does he need to reward another young player who has done what was asked of him and influenced a game from the bench?",
      "You feel it should be the latter and that's why Sesko is surely deserving of a start against Tottenham on Saturday or West Ham on Tuesday.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",

      "4th (Manchester United) – £45m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Brentford, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 22 with three more games each.",
      "Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Fulham were only selected once more – on the March midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (26 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £21.8m in 2024/25",

      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",
      "The Spurs hoodoo is over and Manchester United have a firm grip on Champions League qualification.",
      "But what of Frank and Romero’s futures in north London? It’s not looking great.",
      "",
      "1) Prepare yourselves for three days of the most wild and tiresome haircut discourse involving Manchester United since Garth Crooks conquered his Paul Pogba obsession.",
      "",
      "2) That is testament to the impact of Michael Carrick, whose simplification of a seemingly maddening equation continues to impress.",
      "There are no square pegs in round holes, no-one crowbarred in with the system given precedence to the players. They have a sturdy defence, a reliable midfield and a productive attack, all being asked to do relatively straightforward things in front of a competent keeper.",
      "They have had the composite parts to do this all season, but a coach who specifically chose not to. And that will never not be funny.",
      "Yet even then, Darren Fletcher struggled to make sense of it in his winless pair of games, so Carrick deserves the utmost credit. Unfortunately, so do the bumbling suits who appointed him.",
      "",
      "3) It is the first time since February 2024 that Manchester United have won four consecutive Premier League games. The scorers in a run which saw Wolves, West Ham, Aston Villa and Luton all vanquished were Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Scott McTominay, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "More of them play for Napoli two years later than for Manchester United.",
      "If Ruben Amorim had seen out January then Barcelona and Chelsea would have possessed more of those players than the Red Devils too.",
      "But the Portuguese had to be sacked as much to release Mainoo from his baffling prison as to rescue the club’s performances, results and dignity.",
      "Mainoo was brilliant again, creating more chances than any player bar the absurd Bruno Fernandes, having more touches than any player aside from the Butt and Scholes-silencing Lisandro Martinez, and just generally patrolling midfield with a quiet authority.",
      "It is difficult not to watch him excel in a midfield two without wondering what the f*** the previous manager was thinking.",
      "",
      "4) It is even tougher to watch Cristian Romero without wondering what the f*** he is thinking – even when his latest case of avoidable and self-destructive head loss is so predictable.",
      "",
      "5) But it is very Spurs for their captain to rant on social media about their ‘unbelievable but true and disgraceful’ lack of available players, before proceeding to get sent off not even half an hour into their next fixture when the game was in the balance and the visitors had acquitted themselves well at Old Trafford.",
      "He might struggle blaming the Lewis family for his upcoming four-match suspension, including a potentially ruinous north London derby.",
      "Romero has long since been a liability and as justifiable as he and many others may feel his pop at the board was for the lack of January reinforcements to a threadbare squad, his words are frequently undermined by his actions.",
      "And they make him far from irreplaceable. Spurs are not blessed with many particularly saleable assets, or at least players who can command a worthwhile enough fee to cash in on without the entire team falling in on itself.",
      "Romero’s cons far outweigh his positives at this point; there are cheaper players out there whose ceilings might be lower, but at least their floors aren’t made of infuriating lava.",
      "Spurs need reliability at this stage and their captain guarantees the opposite.",
      "",
      "6) Thomas Frank was never likely to enter his post-match media duties holding aloft a bloody captain’s band on the disembodied arm of Romero. But of course he basically absolved the Argentinean of blame and insisted there were “no regrets” about making giving someone so consistently reckless and daft a leadership role.",
      "“He’s apologised to his team-mates in the changing room. I think he’s one of the most important players,” Frank said, adding that “Cuti clearly tried to go for the ball. Unfortunately, the way the rules is, it’s then a red”.",
      "That argument might wash in ordinary circumstances, but not when discussing someone who has been sent off more times than any other Premier League player in all competitions since making his debut.",
      "It had far less to do with “the way the rules is”, and far more to do with a player who routinely breaks them and faces barely any consequence for doing so.",
      "Again, Frank’s hands are tied slightly in terms of how he handles it publicly, but it is tough to envisage him coming down much harder on Romero behind the scenes. The controversy earlier in the week was “dealt with internally” and this felt like a child testing the boundaries of a weak parent even further to see what they can get away with.",
      "",
      "7) And this press conference exchange after the defeat is exceptional.",
      "Journalist: “It’s Romero’s fourth suspension of the season, you’ll lose him for four games and he’s close to a fifth suspension for yellow cards, how do you take out the recklessness while keeping the aggression?”",
      "Frank: “I think if you look at how many red cards he has had, it’s not like he had that many throughout his career. You know, you play with passion and you play with aggression. And there’s a fine line when you do that.”",
      "Journalist: “He’s got the most red cards of all Premier League players since he arrived at the club.”",
      "Frank: “At the club? Yeah, but not in the Premier League.”",
      "Journalist: “Of all Premier League players, I think.”",
      "Frank: “Of Premier League players? OK, I didn’t know that.”",
      "He does himself precisely no favours.",
      "",
      "8) It changed the game. The shot count was seven to five in favour of the hosts by that point, with possession roughly equal and no clear better team emerging.",
      "Spurs did not have another effort on goal until Xavi Simons whistled one just wide in the 57th minute – from a poor Luke Shaw pass with no team-mate within 20 yards of the Dutchman – and were a goal down soon after.",
      "Yet only a clever set-piece routine broke down that Spurs low block before they felt compelled to open up and try to nick one on the counter in the final ten minutes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes’ short corner found an intelligent Mainoo run parallel to the front post, with his pass around the shoulder seeking out Bryan Mbeumo on the edge of the area. The placed finish perfectly matched the two balls which preceded it.",
      "It wasn’t Arsenal scoring from a header so there need be no crisis declared about the state of the sport. But it was wonderful, and further proof that the most effective way of breaching a defence lies in those moves which can be devised and perfected to mimic actual in-game situations most accurately on the training ground, and are almost certain to happen a handful of times across any match.",
      "It is a damning indictment on any team which chooses not to try and maximise them.",
      "",
      "9) There is some sympathy for Frank, who was let down so thoroughly by his captain after half an hour, then made a triple substitution to bring on two forwards and a Yves Bissouma for the final ten minutes, before conceding a second almost instantly.",
      "Mathys Tel even ranked joint-second for dribbles behind Simons, while conjuring up only Spurs’ second shot with ten men in the fifth minute of stoppage time.",
      "They had a man advantage for an hour and were playing at home to relegation fodder but Manchester United seeing that result out so smoothly felt deeply unsettling. It is only 75 days since they lost in similar conditions.",
      "",
      "10) Frank might even try and spin some vindication from this, considering known transfer target and former Brentford favourite Mbeumo has scored against Spurs home and away while thriving on a bigger stage.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is another who got away – having never felt particularly close. They are flourishing but have also been given the platform and framework in which to do so; Spurs have neither that attacking structure nor individual quality currently.",
      "",
      "11) The game state was obviously skewed but this was Carrick’s first win as a Premier League manager with more than 50 per cent possession. He has overseen two bouts of late drama against Arsenal and Fulham, a deserved rope-a-dope victory over Manchester City and now a consummately professional dispatching of Spurs.",
      "Long may it continue, if only to force Gary Neville and Roy Keane down from such stupidly definitive stances.",
      "",
      "12) Souza seemed bright on his Premier League debut, despite the slightly sub-optimal circumstances. He will have to be, considering Destiny Udogie succumbed to injury and joined Djed Spence on the sidelines to further deplete Spurs’ stock of left-backs.",
      "He should do well in the Championship anyway.",
      "",
      "13) Frank has not reached for the ‘Spurs finished 17th last season’ button for some time, perhaps realising the futility when he has them in 14th and can hardly recycle domestic failure into European glory the same way Ange Postecoglou did.",
      "But this is a relegation battle. Spurs are level on points with Crystal Palace and Leeds, three clear of Nottingham Forest and only six above West Ham. They cannot win at home, have not won in the league this year, and neither their manager nor the players seem to possess the mentality or skillset necessary for what lies ahead.",
      "Even in keeping Brentford up – a remarkable achievement, to be sure – Frank never really had them in a position of genuine danger. The Bees never ended a single Premier League matchday in a position lower than 16th under him; Spurs are spiralling that far down and very possibly further.",
      "",
      "14) Fernandes is an interesting case study to consider when it comes to Romero.",
      "There have been at least a couple of calls for the Portuguese to be stripped of the Manchester United captaincy over the years. His petulance can be enraging and his demeanour exasperating.",
      "Fernandes became a burden last season with three red cards, including in a defeat to Spurs.",
      "Yet he has been phenomenal for months and, really, with a handful of exceptions, years. He will still self-sabotage at times – although that tendency has certainly been less prevalent of late – but what he brings to the team far outstrips what he is capable of taking away.",
      "His finish to make it 2-0 and end the game as a contest was glorious improvisation from a player at his peak. Fernandes has six goals and 13 assists this season, and tore Spurs to shreds with eight shots and six key passes here – the most by a player in a single Premier League game since October 2024.",
      "",
      "15) As far as rallying cries go, “We can’t run away from [the fact] we haven’t won enough in the Premier League. But there is no other alternative than keep going, which we will do, of course,” is a generational effort from Frank.",
      "They host Newcastle on Tuesday, a team almost as awful away as Spurs are at home in a true meeting of resistible force and moveable object.",
      "Then after that it’s Arsenal, and the prospect of the Gunners celebrating another victory en route to the Premier League title with a 90-minute chant of “Arsenal boys, we’re on a bender, Thomas Frank is a silver member”.",
      "Sacking him before then won’t stop that, but it might be the kindest thing to do.",
      "",
      "16) Manchester United have lost one of their last 13 Premier League games and are three points off title challengers Aston Villa. What an absurd season they have had.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero will be banned for four matches after being sent off during his side’s 2-0 loss against Manchester United.",
      "Michael Carrick’s chances of being Manchester United’s next permanent manager are ever-increasing, with Cristian Romero, Ruben Amorim and co. helping…",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘major development’ regarding Thomas Frank’s future at Spurs, who have a ‘frontrunner’ replacement in mind.",
      "Michael Carrick has made his latest no-brainer decision as Manchester United interim boss, while Thomas Frank has sent a ‘message’ to Cristian Romero.",
      "Manchester United’s sustainability story smacks of box-ticking more than a drive towards meaningful change. They should be leading the way like Liverpool.",
      "Pep Guardiola may wish that Manchester City had spent more on players, but he can’t complain at their willingness to pay big wages…"

      "This makes this fixture incredibly difficult to forecast, but our Dave Tickner calling a red card for Cristian Romero was his safest of his ten pre-match predictions.",
      "Following his full-blooded challenge on Tottenham’s board due to their lack of January transfer business, Romero was equally as committed with his needless follow-through on Casemiro to be sent off inside half an hour against Man Utd.",
      "It was as utterly idiotic as expected from a player who cannot be trusted to lead this broken Spurs ship without having a brainless act of his own to sink them further.",
      "Before Romero’s latest calamitous moment, Spurs were actually a match for Man Utd as the two sides exchanged good chances, but the hosts took control thereafter.",
      "There was more evidence of United’s defensive shakiness displayed against Fulham here, but everyone associated with the Red Devils will happily accept having that weakness because their fabled DNA has finally come to the fore again.",
      "READ: Is Man Utd ‘no d**kheads’ policy finally reaping rewards?",
      "In his brief time in charge, interim manager Michael Carrick has been faultless as Man Utd deservedly won four straight Premier League games (supporter Frank Ilett is so close to having that haircut) against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and now Spurs via performances that have been a throwback to the United of old.",
      "But Carrick has been dealt a very good hand by INEOS, which is mainly because former boss Ruben Amorim took them so far away from their deep-rooted principles that only a few simple decisions were needed to spark an immediate upturn.",
      "This has mainly been the long-awaited recall of Kobbie Mainoo, who has remarkably taken no time to return to his masterful best despite his long exile, the switch to a four-man defence and a notable increase in United’s intensity both in and out of possession.",
      "Man Utd are obviously lacking in certain positions that will be addressed in the summer, but there was always the feeling that this group of players is capable of much more than was shown under Amorim, and recent showings have underlined that view.",
      "This was certainly not the best of United’s recent performances, but they were still far too much for Spurs in their current sorry form under Thomas Frank and could have won by a significant scoreline had they not played with their food.",
      "United took the lead only nine minutes after Romero’s dismissal, with summer signing Bryan Mbeumo scoring his ninth Premier League goal of the season via one of those straight off the training ground corners that are always very satisfying when they come off.",
      "One of the many negative hallmarks of Amorim’s reign was Man Utd’s wastefulness as they often missed big chances to improve their Champions League hopes, and they ran the risk of falling into this trap against Spurs as the scoreline remained 1-0 heading into the closing stages.",
      "But it also felt inevitable that Spurs would have been picked off at some stage and United’s second goal came almost instantly after Frank made an attacking triple change for the final ten minutes.",
      "Just as Mainoo has been a revelation alongside revitalised Casemiro in centre-midfield, the same can be said for Fernandes, who has unsurprisingly been far more influential since returning to his favoured advanced role under Carrick.",
      "He has often been the provider in recent matches, but he converted a chance for United’s second against Spurs as he deftly converted a brilliant cross from Diogo Dalot. It is now even clearer than it was before that the Red Devils cannot sacrifice their captain in a summer rebuild; he’s simply too influential to be let go.",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo may well end up contributing to Carrick landing the Man Utd job permanently in the summer, with the win against Spurs adding to the feeling that INEOS will be put in an impossible and familiar position regarding their next permanent manager appointment.",

      "According to reports, three Premier League clubs are ‘ready’ to provide competition for Manchester United for their current interim boss Michael Carrick.",
      "Carrick was recently named Man Utd’s interim manager on a deal until the end of this season, with this appointment following the overdue sacking of former boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Man Utd legend and former Middlesbrough boss had had a dream start, winning his first three games against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham to boost his side’s hopes of Champions League qualification.",
      "INEOS will have a decision to make regarding Carrick if their current form continues for the remainder of this season.",
      "Former Premier League chief executive Keith Wyness has explained what he thinks the “barrier” is to prevent Carrick from landing the job permanently.",
      "“I still believe that the barrier to success will be Champions League qualification, which is looking good right now in terms of Michael Carrick, but the feel-good factor that’s come into Old Trafford is hard to ignore,” Wyness told Football Insider.",
      "READ: Carrick makes another no-brainer Man Utd decision as Frank sends ‘message’ to Spurs captain Romero",
      "“I mean, Ratcliffe would be lynched right now if he didn’t give Carrick the job as we sit today, but I think there’s still a long way to go.",
      "“But nevertheless, that solution was staring right in front of them, and it didn’t need the whole Erik Ten Hag, [Ruben] Amorim experiment that they’ve been through and the pain they’ve been through.",
      "“Sometimes football is pretty simple, and I think Man United’s success was always going to be basically a simple formula of working hard through youth, getting an identity and loyalty to players and the club and the fan base, and it seems to be coming back.”",
      "A report from Football Insider’s Pete O’Rourke also claims Carrick will have interest from elsewhere, with AFC Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Fulham ‘ready to beat’ Man Utd to the manager in the summer.",
      "“He’s obviously building a strong case to maybe have that interim spell turned into a permanent manager’s job come the summer with Manchester United. I don’t think United are rushing into anything just yet,” O’Rourke said.",
      "“But look, if there’s a Premier League club looking for a new manager there, and if Michael Carrick is available, he’s showing he knows how to get wins in the Premier League.",
      "“If he gets Man United back in the Champions League, he’s going to be a hot commodity for a lot of clubs.",
      "“He’s proved that he can do it in the Premier League as well and obviously managing a club like Manchester United shows that he can handle the pressure as well.",
      "“So I’m sure any Premier League club who’s looking for a new manager, if Michael Carrick is available, he’ll be on the list.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand isn’t sure Michael Carrick has the “stature” for Manchester United and insists his former club should consider a huge transfer U-turn.",
      "Michael Carrick’s chances of being Manchester United’s next permanent manager are ever-increasing, with Cristian Romero, Ruben Amorim and co. helping…",
      "Michael Carrick has made his latest no-brainer decision as Manchester United interim boss, while Thomas Frank has sent a ‘message’ to Cristian Romero.",
      "Michael Owen can’t get his head around Gary Neville’s view on Manchester United appointing Michael Carrick as their permanent manager.",
      "Arsenal and Hugo Ekitike are embracing the pressure of their new roles in the Premier League, while Oliver Glasner and Eddie Howe’s cry-arsing rings hollow.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly see one player in and one player out on transfer deadline day after Michael Carrick insisted “never say never”."

      "Michael Carrick has made his latest no-brainer decision as Manchester United interim boss, while Thomas Frank has sent a ‘message’ to Cristian Romero.",
      "Carrick‘s start to life as Man Utd interim manager has gone as perfectly as he could have hoped for.",
      "Three wins via three much-improved performances on what came before have led to premature calls for Carrick to be handed the reins permanently.",
      "Roy Keane has led the pleas for cool heads from INEOS regarding the decision on Man Utd‘s next permanent manager, which appears to have been acknowledged as Carrick has insisted that club chiefs will not be making an Ole Gunnar Solskajer-esque “kneejerk” decision.",
      "Carrick said: “If they have changed [my role to permanent] then there is something wrong. It can’t be so knee-jerk either way, whether it’s really good, whether there’s a few issues we need to solve.",
      "“It’s steady progress, really. You kind of know that football can twist and turn just as quickly. So we have got to keep level and keep focusing on what we need to do. I’m loving what I’m doing. I’m here, I feel at home here. But I fully understand the situation. So I’m not getting too carried away.”",
      "READ: Man Utd v Spurs guaranteed to deliver red cards, all of the goals and late, late twists",
      "Carrick is certainly making the best of the hand he’s been dealt at Man Utd, but he has done so by making a string of no-brainer decisions.",
      "From sanctioning Kobbie Mainoo’s return to switching to a four-man defence to increasing United’s intensity, these changes were demanded from all quarters at Man Utd during Ruben Amorim’s ill-fated reign and it is no wonder that there has been such an improvement following the implementation of these changes.",
      "And Carrick’s latest sensible call came before Saturday’s home game against Spurs, with United’s boss naming an unchanged team from the 3-2 win against Fulham.",
      "Given United’s current run of form and performances, there is no need for Carrick to change what is not broken and they could easily put a fragile Spurs side to the sword at Old Trafford.",
      "As for Spurs, they have made three changes from the 2-2 comeback draw against Man City, but captain Cristian Romero unsurprisingly remains in their starting XI following his “disgraceful” dig at the club’s board.",
      "Romero definitely has a point following Tottenham’s underwhelming January transfer window, but it does not usually bode well when a player speaks out against a club so openly.",
      "But Romero finds himself in a privileged position as one of Tottenham’s top stars and will have known that he can speak out without the threat of punishment, with Frank underlining this fact by naming him in his starting XI against Man Utd.",
      "Ahead of the trip to Man Utd, Frank revealed a ‘message’ to Romero before ultimately revealing his true stance by continuing to start him.",
      "Frank said: “Cuti is a very passionate character and player, who will want to leave everything on the pitch. He’s very ambitious and wants to win every single time. Sometimes when you are like that, it can become an outburst. It is something we have of course dealt with, and dealt with internally.",
      "“There’s a lot of ways of doing things. Cuti has been very good for us this season and in the past seasons. That’s very important to be aware of.",
      "“I wouldn’t have done it. That’s my message.”",

      "Martinez is said to be valued at 55 million euros (around £48m) and Barcelona are ‘privately confident’ of signing him.",
      "There is contrasting information on this potential transfer, though.",
      "“As is often the case with United players, Martinez’s current contract expiry date is 2027, but the club have the option to extend that by one more year,” one source explained.",
      "“There’s no panic inside Old Trafford just yet, but his fine form has inevitably caught the eye of a few clubs, with Barcelona the only confirmed suitor we can mention for the moment.”",
      "Another source for the outlet said: “Of course United won’t want to sell and we can probably expect a contract offer to become a more serious conversation some time in the near future, but privately there are those close to Barcelona who suspect the truth is more along the lines that a deal could be done for the right price.”",

      "Also, Newcastle United ought to be careful what they wish for and there are contrasting views on the ‘Emptyhad’ debate.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com…",
      "",
      "Criticisms of modern Arsenal all fail to understand the underlying reasons the club has become the way it is. Let’s address the criticisms one at a time.",
      "“They’re boring!”: They’re constantly up against parked buses blockading the opponent’s goal so they can’t really play fluid attacking football. It’s the defensive blockades that other teams employ that results in Arsenal games being a grind in the league, in the Champions League things are quite different since the opposition are not as conservative. Besides, for ages Arsenal were derided for failing to break low blocks. Now we’ve found solutions to them through set pieces but people whinge about it being dull as if we should be playing like Brazil ’70 against rigid defensive blockades.",
      "“They’ve spent £1b pounds!”: Remember all the years of austerity after we moved to the new stadium? We couldn’t spend like Russian mobsters and repressive totalitarian petrostates as we had to tighten the belt. Everyone mocked us for being cheapskates then. The massive spending is the result of over a decade of austerity to pay off the stadium debt. Meanwhile City and Chelsea have been able to spending lavishly the entire time, resulting in the inflated transfer fees and wages which Arsenal now also have to pay. But go on, mock us for adapting to the market created by the vile oligarchs and dictatorships.",
      "“They use dirty tactics!”: We’re no worse than any other team in terms of the usual diving, pushing and shoving and gamesmanship. Remember all those years that Arsenal were laughed at for being “soft” and not being able to handle rough rugby teams like Stoke? And now that we’ve stepped up our resilience and developed some steel you guys try to criticise us for that. Damned if we do, damned if we don’t. Just admit that you’re rattled because we’re no longer soft.",
      "“Arteta is annoying and unlikeable!”: He’s no more annoying than any other high profile manager. We’ve had the likes of Klopp and Pep going ballistic on the touchline over decisions but because they don’t manage Arsenal they’re passed off as passionate. Meanwhile Arteta tries to inject more competitive energy into a team that was frequently found lacking in the past and he’s immediately perceived as some sort of deranged lunatic. He knows that Arsenal needs to be more steadfast and streetsmart in order to win titles, we failed to win major titles because we didn’t have these qualities. He’s got to have some edge and intensity to make sure the team is competitive, just like Pep, Klopp, Mourinho and Fergie.",

      "Greetings. Andy in the mailbox asked:",
      "“What is Stewie Griffin going to have to write in about when Arsenal, the Viking clogger, El Pulizon, and all the MAGA-lite actually close it out?”",
      "It’s a simple one, this Andy. First off, I will congratulate their delirium. Much like the High school loudmouth boasting about losing his virginity at 47, despite being richer than any eligible bachelor out there…it’s quite the flex. As is Stewie’s sardonic nature, I would also have to ask Arsenal’s unhinged MAGA-Lite koolaid warriors, to revisit a few key topical matters.",
      "When Mourinho’s Chelsea was successful, Arsenal fans derided that success, calling it “Financial doping” (he spent money on players, something Arsenal are apparently loath to do). They also in unison – and we all remember, receipts are there – called Mourinho a “chequebook manager”. Given Arteta has spent over £1bn to “build” his title-winning automatons, do the same rules apply? Or will it be MAGA Revisionism IT NEVER HAPPENED, HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP etc etc…",
      "Arsenal fans insisted that it was impossible to “financially compete” with richer clubs. You apparently couldn’t ever win a title when faced with much richer behemoths. I spent years asking how eg Klopp did it at Liverpool, and Dortmund before that, etc. So will they acknowledge it was intellectual dishonesty all along, flat out lies and dissembling to excuse failure? Ooooor will it be RADICAL FAKE NEWS MEDIA WITH AN AGENDA, TERRIBLE FOR THIS COUNTRY! Etc etc…",
      "Final one this: given the borderline erotic eulogies Gooners dish out towards El Pulizon, I have to state the obvious here: for years, we were told that successful winning managers like Jose’s Chelsea, then Hiddink’s Chelsea etc were “soulless” and that Arsenal fans “would hate to win that way”. Hence, a mantra from the years of Wenger failure aka “the Arsenal way” was born. I think it had something to do with playing pretty football that helps you batter a set of clueless kids, but shit your undies and get beat 10-2, 8-2 etc. the minute you face a serious team.\nIt also gave way to a number of (virtual) trophies: the Calendar Year trophy, the “Unbeaten v Big Six” trophy, the “FFP” trophy, the “most points in the PL over three years” trophy and of course the biggest clout of all, the Top 4 Trophy – the one where you perpetually show off about qualifying for a competition you have zero chance of winning. Like a lifetime Celibate showing off about spending a night in a Travelodge with Rihanna – yeah mate, enjoy Trivial Pursuit.",
      "But we’ve now suddenly, seen a very curious shift. Arsenal are diabolical to watch. Enduring a full 90 minutes of that dross is enough to make you want to migrate (if those racist plebs from Farage’s Reform lot are determined to enforce anti-immigration, making any foreigner sit through 90 minutes of Viking Clogger and Friends simulate entertainment is enough to make anyone self-deport).",
      "Now though? Arsenal fans are all about WINNING! Apparently, playing aesthetic football is diametrically opposed to winning! You see, if one spends over £1bn then you automatically have to deploy Taliban Tactics. Not like Pep, Mancini, Ancelotti, Fergie, Klopp et al ever won PL titles playing enterprising football eh!",
      "Now, “winning is all that counts”. The problem for them, is that both things can’t be true. You can’t spend years preaching frenetically about “oil money”, “financial doping”, “boring football” etc etc – and then suddenly – pretend you never cared for those things, when it suits!!! Why haven’t we heard about the PGMOL DEEP STATE in a while? I mean, the refs literally had to apologise for farcical decisions that have gone in Arsenal’s favour eg away to Everton. Not a word. Crickets. Same way elections are TOTALLY RIGGED when Trump loses, but the system works juuuust fine (when he wins).",
      "If requiring £1bn, seven years and £15m a year to match what Claudio Ranieri managed in one year with a nothing spend, or what the now-derided Arne Slot managed in Year One (again, spent did all doing it)…then yes, I stand corrected!\nStewie Griffin (There’s still time for them to bottle this)",

      "The reality is that a 3 game win streak will accelerate you up the table and the reverse is true.",
      "The latest being Howe out. Newcastle have always been a likeable team (even when not a fan.) When they are hot, they are on fire. But when not on fire, they can be woeful. The problem is that it is hard (impossible?) to play a brand of high tempo football throughout the Premier league. More true today than even when Klopp tried it in his first full season and ran into a wall after the Dec/Jan fixture pile up.",
      "Today, teams not in Europe still have sufficient funds, because of the Premier league payouts, to acquire decent enough players with more time to prepare and recover that only large squads with quality players can break through the winter period – or focus on fewer competitions. Either injury or overplaying key players, decimates teams. Only Arsenal and City right now have those squads. Chelsea’s is massive, but either still have a few holes or are raw. Villa, still a little short. Liverpool, still need to replace a few aging players and lack depth across all areas right now. United have a decent squad now and are benefitting from the extra time to prepare (along with round pegging.)",
      "Point is, Newcastle’s squad still relies on relatively few players and, being in Europe, can’t sustain the high tempo game for a whole season. A game which on its day is brilliant to watch and devastating. But even then, once they tire in the 60th minute plus, become too open.",
      "Point is, Howe does need to change his game plan and style. I am sure a lot of Newcastle fans would do their nut, if they played that slow, methodical, ball retention build up against low blocks that Arsenal/City/Liverpool have adopted – relying on the brilliance of one or two (expensive to buy) players to come to the rescue. In an effort to ease the workload across a long, tiring season.",
      "It’s hard unless you are City, to get ‘bargain’ high quality players because of the lure of Guardiola and the promise of always being in the CL and in with a chance of trophies. Even well run clubs with big revenues (Liverpool) have to pay over the top, sell players and lose out to bigger fish. So Newcastle are in tough.",
      "Newcastle found a few bargains in players like Guimaraes in the early days of the new regime, but that hasn’t been sustained. The disruption to their Sporting Directorship/change in top management, has been the greatest impediment to Howe.",
      "Howe is generally likeable and until Rosenior joined Chelsea, the standard bearer for an English manager, managing one of the bigger English clubs. Not sure whether English managers feel that as pressure, because the red tops certainly don’t let them forget.",
      "Regardless, the way this season is turning out, there aren’t enough top quality managers in the world available right now, if all the clubs are looking for replacements. Unless you are Chelsea, who constantly replace managers, it’s a risky game.\nPaul McDevitt",

      "It is almost impossible to imagine the tragedy of the Munich Air Disaster in today’s terms. Eight of your first team squad wiped out instantly with other squad players never to play again. Bear in mind this was a team who had won the League title two years in the row, were in the semi-final of the European Cup and with a youthful and talented squad, were considered to be on the verge of greatness. Trying to even casually superimpose these losses over your current squad should give you pause, if not chills.",
      "Now enough has been written about the tragedy itself and for one or two generations on, it has probably faded from significance like the World Wars. What I’d like to do instead is highlight some lesser known facts around the tragedy.",
      "Real Madrid, fast becoming a major rival on the European front, offered to loan Alfredo Di Stefano, arguably their best ever player, to MUFC for the remainder of the season (but the offer was rejected by the FA). They even suggested that MUFC be awarded the European Cup trophy that year. They subsequently arranged friendlies to raise funds for the victims. Liverpool offered players on loan. UEFA wanted Manchester City to replace MUFC in Europe, but the idea was rejected, most notably by City themselves. Other teams also transferred or loaned players.

      "Three wins on the bounce under the interim stewardship of Michael Carrick have raised spirits inside Old Trafford of late. Yet hardened Manchester United fans will be regarding their recent rise with extreme caution, given the club’s habit of brief revivals followed by long, grinding reminders that the problems run far deeper than a promising run of results.",
      "On the pitch, optimism has become a fragile, short-term currency. Off it, the same pattern holds true – flashes of progress masking a broader sense that United are still struggling to modernise at the pace demanded by the modern game, whether that’s in recruitment, governance or, increasingly, sustainability.",
      "For a football club whose brand is built on global reach and historical dominance, United’s environmental sustainability record reads more like a cautious compliance exercise than a statement of leadership.",
      "Find out how you can help your team rise up the Pledgeball League table",
      "Across elite football and the Premier League in particular, sustainability has moved from benign corporate social responsibility into strategic priority, with clubs setting ambitious carbon reduction targets, embedding environmental governance and publicly reporting progress.",
      "In contrast, United’s environmental performance – long present on paper but limited in ambition – now risks making the club appear a follower rather than a leader in one of the defining challenges of the modern age.",
      "Manchester United’s environmental journey formally dates back well over a decade. The club’s Environment, Energy & Carbon Reduction Programme is longstanding, and United’s environmental management system has been certified to the ISO 14001 standard, reflecting a structured approach to continual improvement across operations.",
      "United also maintain a zero waste to landfill policy and reported that a significant portion of their waste – hundreds of tonnes – is recycled or diverted to energy recovery annually, alongside food waste being processed into biogas and reused where possible. United engage with local conservation groups for biodiversity efforts at their Carrington training centre and operate renewable energy measures, including heat pumps and biofuel use for match-day generators and grounds-keeping equipment.",
      "Sport Positive Leagues records show that between April 2022 and March 2023 over half of United’s energy came from renewable sources, and the club’s Carbon Trust Standard has been maintained through at least 14 years of year-on-year carbon reduction goals.",
      "Yet in 2026, that résumé – while positive – looks decidedly modest compared with many of United’s rivals, both within England and across Europe.",
      "The crucial difference lies not in isolated initiatives but in structural targets, transparency and overarching strategy. Although United have laid early groundwork on developing a net-zero strategy, Sport Positive Leagues notes that definitive net-zero targets, milestones and a formal governance framework are still under development, rather than already established and publicly reported. In other words, United are planning their ambition rather than executing it on a measurable, timebound basis.",
      "That contrast is most apparent when you look at clubs such as Liverpool. Since launching The Red Way strategy in 2021, Liverpool have embedded environmental and social impact deeply within its operations. The Red Way sets clear goals – including a 50 per cent reduction in absolute emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2040 – with detailed inventories covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 travel emissions.",
      "In 2023-24, Liverpool reported cutting total emissions and using 96 per cent renewable or low-carbon energy across club sites, investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel to eliminate emissions from some domestic flights and utilising low-carbon biofuel for team buses. Liverpool’s progress has also been recognised with independent awards, including the Transformation category at the 2025 Sport Positive Summit, underscoring the breadth and depth of their sustainability commitment.",
      "Did you know, 100,000 tonnes of sportswear ends up in landfill every year in the UK alone?",
      "Manchester City offer another stark comparison. City’s 2024-25 sustainability reporting outlines tangible results: 25 per cent reduction in CO₂ emissions across the year, Scope 1 and 2 operations carbon-neutral, over one megawatt of solar generation on-site, significant water use reduction and expanded sustainable transport options for fans. Crucially, City have publicly committed to achieving net carbon-zero by 2030, a clear, relatively near-term target that drives investment and reporting.",
      "Even outside the top two Manchester clubs, peers are stepping up. Tottenham Hotspur became the first Premier League club to join the UN-backed Sports for Nature Framework, bolstering biodiversity protection and pledging to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2040. Independent sustainability rankings for 2025-26 place Brighton & Hove Albion as the greenest Premier League club overall, based on factors such as renewable energy use, waste diversion, water reuse and local engagement.",
      "Part of United’s catch-up problem reflects the club’s relative lack of transparent, clearly reported metrics and verified targets. Independent benchmarking, such as Premier League sustainability assessments, consistently rank United in the middle or lower tiers among the 20 clubs, largely due to limited disclosures and absence of formal net-zero timelines. While United’s ISO certification and long-running reduction programme demonstrate commitment, they lack the strategic framing around science-aligned, independently verified goals that others now publish.",
      "Operational emissions data – whether analysed through third-party assessments or club reporting – also highlights the scale of the task. Analysis suggests that the so-called “Big Six” clubs collectively account for a majority of the Premier League’s carbon emissions, with United often registering among the largest contributors due to the sheer scale of their facilities and activities, including matchday operations, training and support travel. Such findings reinforce how central the Red Devils are to the league’s environmental footprint and why their leadership on reduction strategies matters – not just for their own sustainability but for the league’s collective progress.",
      "So what would it take for United to modernise from an environmental perspective? The most immediate step would be formalising and publishing a robust net-zero strategy, complete with science-based targets, interim milestones and regular third-party verification. This should cover not only operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) but also Scope 3 emissions, including travel and supply-chain impacts, which represent the largest portion of most football clubs’ footprints.",
      "Regular sustainability reporting – in line with frameworks such as the UN Sports for Climate Action or Science Based Targets initiative – would vastly increase transparency and accountability. Intensifying investment in on-site renewable energy generation, sustainable transport infrastructure for fans and staff, and fan engagement programmes on travel choices would further align United with best practice.",
      "Embedding sustainability at executive board level – giving dedicated leadership authority and resources – would signal a shift from compliance-oriented action to strategic ambition. Ultimately, for a club with one of the world’s largest fanbases and richest brands, sustainability isn’t just a niche CSR endeavour: it’s part of safeguarding the institution’s future in a world where environmental performance increasingly informs reputations, commercial partnerships and fan loyalty.",
      "Manchester United’s sustainability story has thus far been one of legacy process rather than bold transformation – an ethos that has also seen them tread water on the pitch for more than a decade. The next era demands vision, measured progress and a willingness to compete off the pitch with the same intensity displayed on it. In that race, the Red Devils can no longer afford to lag behind the league’s green giants.",
      "To learn more about Pledgeball and how you can pledge to help your club shoot up the sustainability standings, visit Pledgeball.org.",
      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",
      "Pep Guardiola may wish that Manchester City had spent more on players, but he can’t complain at their willingness to pay big wages…",
      "To celebrate National 80s Day – it’s a thing, apparently – test your knowledge of football through the decade. Or ask your dad…",
      "Sandro Tonali ignored journalists in the mixed zone TWICE – so can only possibly be leaving Newcastle after being ‘courted by’ close friend Pep Guardiola.",
      "The Newcastle fan sentiment towards Eddie Howe has turned: he has done a phenomenal job but no longer is he the definitive best man for it. Is Jesse Marsch?",
      "The Premier League weekend begins and ends with a couple of highly promising opportunities for nonsense, with more good stuff in between."

      "It’s thought such a sale would be welcomed by Untied as it ‘would make it possible to balance accounts and reorder a squad that is still in the process of being rebuilt’, with the report adding that Yoro himself ‘would not look against a change of scenery if the sports proposal is convincing’.",
      "Maguire’s future remains up in the air as his contract is up at the end of the season, meaning Yoro may just need to be patient to force his way into the United team, but Matthijs de Ligt will provide further competition when he returns to fitness, as will fellow young defender Ayden Heaven, who’s impressed when called upon this season.",

      "“He was a fantastic player. Coaching [here], he’s come in and been refreshing. He brings great energy to the group, to the sessions”, Maguire admitted about Woodgate.",
      "“Obviously, he’s been a centre-back himself, and he’s giving me tips, and he’s definitely going to work a lot with the younger centre-backs, with Leny [Yoro], Ayden [Heaven], and Tyler [Fredricson].",

      "You’d better believe it’s a big weekend, kicking off with the inevitable bringer-of-chaos that is Man United v Spurs and then finishing with the enticing possibilities of what Liverpool and Man City might conjure up at Anfield.",
      "And there’s plenty of good stuff in between and around the country and indeed continent.",
      "We’re really looking forward to this one.",
      "",
      "Who said Liverpool wouldn’t be involved in the title race? They can be front and centre here in confirming there will not in fact be a title race at all.",
      "We make it now five times Arsenal have been confirmed as champions and six times the title race has been declared back on, but it really would be hard to see how we get anything other than Arsenal ending all those years of hurt if this weekend goes wrong for City.",
      "With Arsenal slumming it in a Saturday 3pm slot for the second weekend in a row, by the time City arrive at Anfield for Super Sunday’s headliner they could be staring at a nine-point deficit and firmly in must-win territory.",
      "That’s not ideal when you’re going to Anfield and in your last away game you failed to win from 2-0 up against a team who at the time had fewer home points than anyone bar Wolves and had almost entirely run out of available adult footballers.",
      "City got themselves back on track a bit with a Carabao paddling of Newcastle in the second leg of their semi-final, but you’d imagine they are at least a little bit trying to work out what happened in that second half at Spurs.",
      "The concession of two goals was bad, of course, but in many ways more troubling was the fact that as things got so very far away from a team that had been in such effortless first-half control, Erling Haaland and co. managed not one second-half attempt on target against a defence of Archie Gray, Joao Palhinha, Radu Dragusin and Destiny Udogie. Or put another way, a Tottenham defence that has struggled all season was able to repel City’s advances with its third-choice right-back and fourth and fifth-choice centre-backs.",
      "It’s not a great look for City. Or for Newcastle’s defence in the first half of that Carabao clash, now we think of it.",
      "Liverpool may not have title deeds to think of for themselves this weekend, but they do still have plenty to think about having found themselves embroiled in what will likely but not definitely distil into a three-into-two Champions League squabble with Chelsea and Man United for fourth and fifth.",
      "And Liverpool are already the ones on the outside looking in knowing those two can both increase that gap on Saturday. And both are up against relegation stragglers, with Chelsea travelling to Wolves and United hosting Spurs.",
      "",
      "Which brings us neatly to our team to watch. Although frankly it’s both of them, because Man United v Spurs is a lovely little Saturday lunchtime treat for us all.",
      "Spurs against A Manchester Club is about as close to a guarantee of nonsense as the Premier League can provide. The game against City last weekend delivered in grand style, and there’s no reason to think this one won’t do likewise.",
      "United themselves remain pleasingly absurd even when in good form, so long may that continue. They have developed a particular habit this year for late twists. Emphasis on plural. There are few more extreme emotions in football than joy and relief following hot on the heels of despair, and United have perfected the art this season.",
      "Their last two games have been 3-2 wins in which they’ve conceded a late equaliser then scored an even later winner, something they also did this season at Anfield, while in the reverse fixture at Spurs they were ahead at 83 minutes, behind at 91 and level at 96.",
      "Michael Carrick has them on a three-game winning run that has prompted inevitable chatter about his interim role becoming a permanent one, because there’s no way promoting an under-qualified club legend in such fashion could ever backfire.",
      "But this is in many ways his biggest test, because he’s up against a team so stupid. More stupid even than his own. He’s beaten the two best teams in the country and in Fulham an extremely competent one. He has therefore yet to face a challenge like Spurs, a team who City can once again attest are impossible to get your head around, and who United haven’t beaten in the last nine attempts. Including, of course, United suffering just about the most embarrassing fate it’s possible for a professional football team to suffer by contriving to lose to Spurs in an actual final.",
      "Luckily for United and everyone, Spurs have already ensured they will not be using that trophy win as any kind of launchpad. That’s not the way they do things, and we’re already just a Champions League last-16 exit away from confirming year one of the next decade-plus trophy drought, one in which simply remaining in the Premier League might become a stretch target.",
      "But for now what Spurs do still have is some kind of bizarre hold over the Manchester clubs, and one that United could really do with putting right this weekend. For football reasons, with Champions League qualification very much in sight, but perhaps just as importantly for their own sanity.",
      "",
      "Brentford have been the Premier League’s surprise package this year, with a widely predicted relegation fight having never remotely materialised in a season that has instead turned into an unlikely tilt at Europe under rookie boss Keith Andrews.",
      "A large part of that has been the spectacular way Igor Thiago has emerged from the shadows of the now departed Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa to score seven more Premier League goals this season than that pair combined.",
      "With Haaland having endured one of his oddly familiar mid-season slumps in front of goal, Thiago still retains genuine hope of being crowned the least likely Golden Boot winner for many a year, trailing by just four and seemingly facing Newcastle at a very good time here.",
      "Two of his 16 Premier League goals this season came in the 3-1 win over Wissa’s new team back in November, and Newcastle hit this return fixture at a low ebb.",
      "Since a three-game winning run in the Premier League at the turn of the year appeared to have turned them back into European contenders, it’s all gone wrong again. Newcastle’s only wins in eight games since have been against PSV in the Champions League and Bournemouth on penalties after a wild 3-3 draw in the FA Cup.",
      "Even in that winning run they also conceded three goals to Leeds. Aston Villa and City have both beaten them 2-0 at St James’ Park in recent weeks, and in the last week alone Newcastle have conceded seven goals in two games at Liverpool and City.",
      "Eddie Howe is coming under pressure and could really do without the sight of the Premier League’s second-best striker right about now.",
      "",
      "We already know this will be Glasner’s last time managing Palace in the not-local-but-very-real Brighton derby; what’s less clear is how many more games he’ll be in charge of Palace altogether.",
      "It does all feel rather futile trying to sustain this visibly, grumpily broken marriage through to the summer, especially while every game for which the relationship continues Palace tumble closer and closer to mortal peril.",
      "They probably won’t go down, but it would be nice to be able to say it with any kind of confidence about a team that has simply stopped winning football matches altogether as the infighting takes over.",
      "Even Palace’s fellow relegation-tumblers Spurs are managing to kick the sh*t out of some ragtag collections of poor old German farmers every now and then. Palace didn’t even beat KuPS, who look more like the first four characters of a helpfully memorable 20-character wifi password than a football team.",
      "That final Conference League game was back before Christmas, and was the second of what is now a 12-match run in all competitions in which all manner of almost pathetically easy chances to win have been knocked back.",
      "Sixth-tier side in the FA Cup? No thank you. Dr Tottenham? Honestly, we’re fine. Nottingham Forest down to 10 for the whole second half? We won’t even bother having a shot.",
      "After Brighton, Palace’s next four games are against Burnley and Wolves in the Premier League and the two legs of their Conference punishment-round tie against Zrinjski Mostar. So Glasner and the lads don’t necessarily have to get that long-awaited win in this weekend’s formbook-out-the-window caper. But if they still don’t have one a couple of weeks from now, then things are very bad indeed.",
      "",
      "One of those fixtures that feels a lot more Barclays than it is. There’s a powerful Premier League energy here that just confirms how potent early experience can be, because there have in fact only been five Premier League seasons featuring both Norwich and Blackburn, only two of them in this century and none in the last decade.",
      "But never mind that. Yer da will say that these are proper teams because their first three Premier League seasons together were the first three seasons of the Premier League – the Premiership glory days. These are the sorts of teams who if they do find themselves in the second tier will be managed by someone like Steve Bruce and he will describe them as “Premier League teams in all but name”.",
      "Except right now they absolutely are not. They are much closer to being League One teams in actual name, and this is another huge six-pointer in a Championship relegation scrap that has developed a strikingly Premier League Years look to it.",
      "Leicester’s six-point punishment this week leaves us with West Brom, Blackburn, Leicester, Portsmouth and Norwich all either in the relegation zone or within a point of it approaching the finishing straight.",
      "",
      "PSG have won their last six Ligue 1 games but haven’t yet seen off the dogged challenge of Lens, who sit just two points back, and know they can’t afford to slip up against arch-rivals Marseille.",
      "They may still be reeling from the astonishing way they were bounced out of the Champions League via their own shambolic 3-0 defeat at Club Brugge and Benfica’s injury-time goalkeeper nonsense against Real Madrid, but a second win of the season over PSG would get them back on the fringes of the title race and certainly help lift that slightly darkening mood.",
      "If that’s unlikely, then Marseille’s minds should certainly be focused by ensuring they get another chance at the Champions League next season, with a resurgent Lyon now level on points in what looks like a direct fight for the third and final spot.",
      "",
      "The newly crowned world champions Arsenal are not going to win the WSL this year even if they do manage to slow City’s charge slightly this weekend.",
      "But it’s still a vital game in what has become an intriguing battle for the minor places and the chance, in Arsenal’s case, of a further tilt at glory on the continent and beyond.",
      "City are away and clear over the horizon having won 13 of their 14 games this season, but just two points separate Man United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs in the fight for Champions League qualification.",
      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",
      "Manchester United’s sustainability story smacks of box-ticking more than a drive towards meaningful change. They should be leading the way like Liverpool.",
      "Pep Guardiola may wish that Manchester City had spent more on players, but he can’t complain at their willingness to pay big wages…",
      "To celebrate National 80s Day – it’s a thing, apparently – test your knowledge of football through the decade. Or ask your dad…",
      "Sandro Tonali ignored journalists in the mixed zone TWICE – so can only possibly be leaving Newcastle after being ‘courted by’ close friend Pep Guardiola.",
      "The Newcastle fan sentiment towards Eddie Howe has turned: he has done a phenomenal job but no longer is he the definitive best man for it. Is Jesse Marsch?"

      "The uptick in results and performances post-Ruben Amorim has led to suggestions the former United midfielder may be handed the reins on a permanent basis, but that hasn’t stopped club chiefs from tapping up one of the best in the business, according to a report late on Thursday night.",

      "The former Barcelona manager said: “These are rumours that always circulate at PSG.",

      "It’s Manchester United v Tottenham this weekend and that makes us very excited.",
      "The reason isn’t complicated; it’s because it’s almost guaranteed to be absurd but even more importantly with absolutely no guarantee about which specific way(s) it will be absurd.",
      "That’s the real fun. It will be ridiculous, sure, but not one of us can possibly know exactly how it will be ridiculous.",
      "Only a certified idiot would attempt to predict what would happen in this latest clash between the two stupidest big Premier League clubs over the last couple of years.",
      "Here then are our predictions for what will happen in this latest clash between the two stupidest big Premier League clubs over the last couple of years.",
      "",
      "Emphasis very much on the multiple here. That’s the key to this bit. Obviously every team has games that feature late drama. It is an integral part of the game for everyone, for both good and bad.",
      "Nobody goes through a season without at least a bit of late drama.",
      "What we have here, though, are two teams whose penchant for the ridiculous often extends to the best kind of late drama, where one late sucker punch is followed by another even later sucker punch, increasingly the comedy levels of the whole thing.",
      "The reverse fixture between these two earlier in the season was a classic of the genre. United were leading until Spurs equalised in the 84th minute and then went ahead through Richarlison in stoppage time.",
      "Cue a typical quiet and restrained Richarlison celebration and further proof that the Brazilian taking his shirt off is one of the most reliable harbingers of doom this universe has yet devised.",
      "After Spurs went ahead in the first added minute, United equalised in the last, leaving neither side remotely sure whether or not they should be happy about what they’d won or annoyed at what they’d spaffed away. Which for us is the perfect outcome to any football match.",
      "FUN FACT: This match took place just 90 days ago and a now relegation-fearing Spurs were 30 seconds away from going SECOND IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE.",
      "But while it’s a wonderfully pure example, as you’d expect from a game featuring both these idiots, it is far from a rogue outlier in either side’s season.",
      "Just last week, United lost and regained the lead against Fulham in stoppage-time. At Arsenal they responded to an 84th-minute equaliser with an absurd winner three minutes later. In their other big cathartic win over a historical rival in Liverpool the timings were slightly earlier but still valid, with Liverpool’s 78th-minute leveller countered by Harry Maguire’s giant cheat-code of a head six minutes later.",
      "In a wild 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in December, United trailed after 76 minutes and led after 79 before being pegged back again.",
      "In addition to the United game, Spurs have this season managed to fall behind twice and hit back twice all within the final 20 minutes of a 2-2 draw at Newcastle, and experienced the absurd delights of watching Joao Palhinha score his second overhead kick of the season (more on that later) to drag them level at Bournemouth only for Antoine Semenyo to score a winner with his last kick before joining Man City, for whom he would inevitably also score against Spurs a few short weeks later.",
      "Spurs have drawn 2-2 against PSG in a game they led 2-0 with five minutes remaining, and have drawn three games in which they have trailed 2-0 (Brighton, Bodo/Glimt, Man City).",
      "Three of Tottenham’s last four Premier League games have featured result-altering stoppage-time goals, and the one that didn’t contained one of the least likely comebacks from 2-0 down you could possibly imagine.",
      "And let’s not forget either that these two teams also had a 4-3 caper in last season’s Carabao in which a 3-0 Spurs lead was cut to 3-2 before Son Heung-min scored direct from a corner with two minutes to go, which still left time enough for Jonny Evans to score United’s third and keep Spurs honest in the closing seconds.",
      "",
      "United have scored some very good goals this season, with Matheus Cunha at Arsenal a fine recent example. But this category has surely been more of a Spurs speciality and does feel particularly on-brand.",
      "What we like best about the sheer number of genuinely ridiculous goals Spurs have scored this season is that they’ve had these frequent oases of genius and/or ridiculousness dotted around in a barren wasteland of what is unanimously agreed to be some of the worst and most joyless, uninspired and uninspiring attacking play this or any other club has ever produced. It is genuinely unwatchable at times yet very occasionally utterly unmissable at others.",
      "Spurs have so far this season scored: four overhead kicks (one of them by a centre-back – an equaliser deep into stoppage-time, naturally – and two from a workhorse, tackle-loving defensive midfielder), a box-to-box individual effort sure to get a Puskas nomination (also scored by a centre-back, but a different one), a completely pointless goal from 45 yards out in the middle of what otherwise appeared to be some kind of anti-football dirty protest of a performance in a humbling at Arsenal, and a scorpion kick to provide what was, in multiple ways, the single most unlikely equalising goal on record.",
      "So we will accept nothing less here than Destiny Udogie running the length of Old Trafford before scoring an overhead rabona from 37 yards. In the 98th minute. Before Bruno Fernandes scores a penalty in the 101st.",
      "",
      "Not, admittedly, a novel idea. But surely never a stronger claim than now.",
      "We make no apologies for the fact Romero is one of our absolute favourites. There’s always something about any player who combines genuine elite talent with what at times borders on a kind of actual madness.",
      "It also means he is often unfairly punished because there are few players more conspicuously preceded by their reputation, but never mind that now because on this occasion it helps us because we are actively predicting it.",
      "Romero is an emotional sort, prone to head-loss and at all times capable of losing the entire run of himself. It can happen at any time.",
      "But consider the current state of things and it’s easy to see why this is a perfect storm of a game.",
      "First of all, Romero can go rogue at any moment but does tend to preserve his red-card shenanigans for the biggest games. His three Premier League red cards have come against Manchester City, Chelsea and this season against Liverpool. His other two Tottenham red cards have been against Milan in the Champions League and, well, Vitesse Arnhem in the Conference League so forget about that last one.",
      "Four out of five in all and three out of three in the Barclays is still a trend, okay. Shut up.",
      "There is also his current frame of mind to consider. We’ve all seen the switch flick in games with Romero and realised what might come next. “Oh, he’s ticking,” Gary Neville will caution on co-commentary with all the faux-concern of David Brent fearing a September wedding could be a washout.",
      "Romero is going to start this game already ticking loudly after lashing out and going in two-footed, studs-ablaze on the Spurs suits after a deadline day squib.",
      "He’s also been ill, which restricted him to 45 lethargic and painful minutes against City last weekend, and none of us is at our best mentally or emotionally when we’re poorly, are we?",
      "It all has us wondering what’s the earliest in a game anyone has suffered the ‘save him from himself’ pre-red-card substitution? Because it could happen in the warm-up here.",
      "",
      "Okay, so a bit cake-and-eat-it this one, but what we’re saying here is that it’s not going to be like 1-1 or 2-1. It’s either going to have all of the goals or none.",
      "United’s last two Premier League games have been 3-2 wins and Spurs’ last two Premier League games have been 2-2 draws so we’re very hopeful it’s the former. Spurs have conceded at least twice in their last five games against Premier League opposition (one of those was Villa in the FA Cup)",
      "For Man United, it’s four of the last five (again including a 2-1 home FA Cup defeat, in this case against Brighton).",
      "Both clubs’ runs include conceding twice against Burnley, who have only managed to score twice in eight Premier League games this season. For added fun, one of the other six was also against Man United in one of what are now the Red Devils’ trademark 3-2 wins.",
      "We also of course have the 2-2 draw between these two sides from earlier in the season, as well as that 4-3 Carabao caper last season.",
      "But we must also prepare ourselves for the fact that these two sides are also capable of taking a game that appears to offer a near guarantee of goals – and also brilliant ones – yet instead provide none of that.",
      "The Europa League final remains one of the funniest things ever to happen because imagine losing to Tottenham in an actual final, but it was also one of the most wretched football matches ever staged in which Spurs scored the scrappiest imaginable version of their favourite goal under Ange – cross from the left, converted from close range by Brennan Johnson – and then defended for their lives against a United side with absolutely no idea how or what to do to prevent the banter apocalypse about to befall them.",
      "And you might say well that was such a high-stakes game for both sides it was bound to happen. But Spurs also beat United 1-0 in a crap league game last year where an early James Maddison goal was enough.",
      "Spurs famously beat United four times last season, and United failed to score in three of those games. Remember, this was a Spurs team being managed by Ange Postecoglou, a man who considered the entire concept of ‘defending’ to be an act of craven cowardice that bordered on cheating.",
      "Goals appear so inevitable here that, sure, it might be 4-4 after one team is 4-0 up after 17 minutes. But it’s also just possible these two teams are capable of stupidity that cancels the other’s out so entirely that it instead ends up the worst 0-0 draw you’ve ever seen.",
      "",
      "The boldest shout, because Spurs these days specialise in beating teams from daft little farmers’ leagues from unlikely-sounding countries such as ‘Germany’, while losing to pretty any proper (i.e. English) team.",
      "But there are a few reasons to suspect it could happen here. Firstly, a Spurs win is funnier than a Man United win and that is a powerful force in the universe.",
      "Spurs have also just emerged from a five-game Premier League run against Brentford, Sunderland, Bournemouth, West Ham and Burnley in which they took only three points and no wins. It’s vital and inevitable they outperform that pathetic return against mainly bad sides in the run of five games against mainly good sides currently underway against City, United, Newcastle, Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "A win at Old Trafford to clinch it just two games in would be powerfully Spurs and enormously United.",
      "There is also the perplexing fact that these days United don’t ever actually beat Spurs. We all know the four defeats from four games antics of last season, but they form just part of what is now a nine-game winless run for United against Spurs in all competitions.",
      "Imagine that. Imagine going nine straight games against the stupidest team in the world without a single win; it would be enough to make you think that maybe you are in fact the stupidest team in the world. Now there’s a thought.",
      "The last time Man United beat Spurs, Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick and Harry Kane was on the scoresheet. It was a long time ago, is what we’re saying here, and seems even longer than it actually is, which is a less impressive-sounding ‘just under four years ago’.",
      "We also think Spurs will win because we think United will lose. Obvious, but there you go. Simple reason being that recent history tells us that United will always lose in ludicrous fashion at the precise moment they think they’re on to something.",
      "No club turns more corners only to end up right back where they began than United, and three straight wins is just about perfect. We all obviously thought the Fulham game was ideal ‘come unstuck’ territory after beating City and Arsenal but think about it. That was too obvious. That was such an obviously different game from those first two of the Carrick Era that it would’ve been too predictable for it to go wrong there.",
      "No, far better to scrape through that by the skin of their arse and then actually come unstuck a week later against Banter FC.",
      "We do, admittedly, have some time for the counter-argument that what United will actually do is keep winning games until they eventually give in and, against their better judgement, give Carrick the job permanently only for results to then fall off a cliff.",
      "Which leads us to the safest conclusion of all. The funniest outcome here is for Spurs to win, or at least not lose, or for Man United to win.",
      "We can’t wait.",
      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero will be banned for four matches after being sent off during his side’s 2-0 loss against Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United’s sustainability story smacks of box-ticking more than a drive towards meaningful change. They should be leading the way like Liverpool.",
      "Pep Guardiola may wish that Manchester City had spent more on players, but he can’t complain at their willingness to pay big wages…",
      "Spurs defender Cristian Romero has been urged to “shut up and play football,” with one pundit claiming Thomas Frank should strip him of the captaincy.",
      "To celebrate National 80s Day – it’s a thing, apparently – test your knowledge of football through the decade. Or ask your dad…"

      "Angel Gomes was being heralded as the possible solution for Manchester United and England a little over a year ago, but now the diminutive midfield conductor finds himself at rock-bottom Wolves after a summer move to Marseille failed to pay dividends. But might a brief spell in the Premier League open up a back door to his boyhood team?",
      "“Coming here, I’ll try and show what I can do, what I’m about, try and be a positive addition to the team, and try to be as positive as possible to help in all aspects,” Gomes has said having made the loan switch to Wolves, aware that the rest of the season will act as a four-month shop window for alternative suitors.",
      "Given his “excitement” at returning to the Premier League, he’s not about to agree to a permanent move to a Championship-bound side, should Wolves take up the option from Marseille, if there are top flight sides keen on signing him in the summer.",
      "After Jose Mourinho nearly made him cry at Manchester United amid a crisis of confidence which threatened to derail his career entirely, Gomes opted to leave for France despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s attempts to keep him at Old Trafford. Some hugely impressive displays at the heart of Lille’s midfield led to a shock England call from Lee Carsley for the Nations League games at the end of 2024.",
      "At that stage, when Manchester United were knee-deep in a midfield crisis which has now abated but not yet been solved, Gomes was heavily linked with a return to his former club, for whom he made his senior debut alongside a certain Michael Carrick.",
      "“I came on and Michael Carrick did everything possible to allow me to touch the ball,” Gomes told The Guardian about his United debut in 2018. “Every time he had it, I could see that he was looking for me.”",
      "Carrick named Gomes, along with Marcus Rashford, Romelu Lukaku, Luke Shaw and Jesse Lingard, as “real, real talent” which made him feel as though he could retire with the club in safe hands. There’s clearly a mutual respect.",
      "Whether there’s enough respect to push Carrick into vouching for Gomes in a discussion with the INEOS bosses over midfield additions in the summer remains to be seen, which when added to the uncertainty of Carrick’s long-term future at the club and if the United chiefs will take any notice of his thoughts on transfers if he is handed the reins on a permanent basis combines to make Gomes to Manchester United feel a whole lot of unlikely.",
      "But amid talk of the Red Devils analysts processing the stats of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba with a view to picking their ideal new midfielder, very little has been made of the very high likelihood that they’ll need two of them, if – as we’re led to believe – Manuel Ugarte is set to follow Casemiro out of the club having failed to meet the mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Unless they have £200m to spend on two of those three top candidates, and they don’t, United are going to need to source a low-cost option to bolster the squad on top of that marquee addition.",
      "Truth is it’s going to be hard for Gomes to prove he’s that option in one of the worst teams in Premier League history, just as it will be hard for commentators to cover Wolves games featuring Angel Gomes alongside namesakes Joao, Rodrigo and Toti, but at least he’s been handed the chance to knock on that back door to Manchester United, which Carrick may be more amenable than others to open if he’s still in the job."

      "Man Utd have won four Premier League games on the bounce for the first time since 2024; Michael Carrick has overseen wins against Tottenham, Fulham, Arsenal and Manchester City; he believes the team are now playing with \"expression and excitement\"",
      "Saturday 7 February 2026 21:45, UK",
      "It's four Premier League wins in a row for Manchester United under Michael Carrick and a season that was unraveling just weeks ago now looks full of potential and promise.",
      "A 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Old Trafford extended Carrick's 100 per cent start as head coach and will further strengthen his case to be given the job on a long-term basis. At the very least, his impressive impact surely puts him in the conversation.",
      "Saturday's win also marks the first time in two years that United have won four Premier League games on the spin, with hopes of a top-four finish and a return to the lucrative Champions League now looking more realistic than not.",
      "Carrick was particularly pleased with the purpose of his side, encouraging \"expression and excitement\", as Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes scored the goals that extended their unbeaten streak to eight games overall - their longest run since 2022.",
      "\"The first goal is normally vital, to get ahead, but I think it's just encouraging the expression, the attacking play,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"Not so much enjoyment where you can do what you want and it's a playground, kind of flicks and tricks, but more playing with a purpose and confidence.",
      "\"The connection with everyone has been as good as anything. The feeling, the emotion and connection with players, staff and fans - it feels good. We've had to win games in different ways. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the stadium this way, to look forward to the excitement.",
      "\"I'm pleased with the buy-in. We're in a good emotional place and that helps you. The four games we've had look different, we've not cracked it. I'm aware of that.",
      "\"We're just moving on to the next one and not settling for what we've got. Not taking things for granted is something we speak about a lot and the boys have been really good for that so far.\"",
      "Carrick has transformed United's fortunes since he was parachuted in to replace Ruben Amorim last month. As well as beating Spurs and Fulham, he has also masterminded wins over the division's top two sides Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "Captain Fernandes believes Carrick has added 'something special.' He said: \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch.",
      "\"It's very good. I was sure he would be a great manager and he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more.",
      "\"Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club, everyone knows the expectations around it. He knows what it means for this club to win. It adds something special to the team.\"",
      "Fernandes himself has been at the heart of United's revival. Asked if the midfielder is among the most in-form players in the Premier League currently, Carrick added: \"Listen, it'd take a long time to sum it up [his contribution here].",
      "\"I think he's offered the club so much in the time he's been here, since he walked in the door. He played different roles today for us and ended up on the left. The second goal was from the left as we changed things around a little bit.",
      "\"He's a team player, he gives so much to the group. He's got big moments in him but we know the quality he has. He cares a lot for this football club and the team and that is clear to see.\"",
      "There was plenty of hyperbolic conversation in the press room at Old Trafford on Saturday. The question most were asking: 'Are Manchester United back?'",
      "Not to rain on the parade, but it's perhaps a little too early to declare United as fully reformed. They do, however, look imposing in Carrick's mould, fluid in attack and organised defensively.",
      "He was true to form post-match, calm and controlled in his exchanges with reporters, emphasising that nothing has been achieved yet. Tangibly it hasn't. But for these long-suffering United fans, the gift of four on the bounce will feel like a lottery win. These are heady times given what came before.",
      "Carrick's United have already eclipsed last season's points total with over a third of the season remaining. It's impossible to overstate the underperformance in the 18 months preceding his appointment, but equally important to highlight the impact since. What I like most is the coordination in each attacking phase; so well balanced.",
      "Carrick is also showing impressive maturity and composure in-game. His decision-making is drawing praise. This looks to be the start of something with huge promise - and maybe even longevity.",

      "Casemiro is in his best form as a United player. Luke Shaw is also rolling back the years. Diogo Dalot looks transformed. And the decision to leave Kobbie Mainoo out in the cold for so long by the previous regime is looking sillier by the week. Combined, the team have scored 10 goals in four under Carrick, and conceded just four. The improvement across the board is as obvious on the eye as it is measured by results.",
      "Man Utd's decision makers have plenty to ponder if this upturn is here to stay.Laura Hunter",
      "Cristian Romero as captain is a problem for Thomas Frank, despite him not wanting to admit it. Continually, Romero has proved himself to be unreliable and reckless. And now he's surely also beginning to lose some of the respect of his team-mates, sent off for the second time this season at the cost of a four-game suspension. He's the first player to be sent off twice in the Premier League this season.",
      "Some might argue he should not have even started the game at Old Trafford given his midweek rant about the Tottenham squad's \"disgraceful depth\", but Frank backed him. He badly let his manager down. Now he's lost the moral high ground too.",
      "There is something awfully ironic about a player so troubled by Tottenham's lack of options that he took to social media to spell out his gripe publicly, who himself is now unavailable to feature for his team until mid-March. Romero has one red card for every 25 games he has played for the club. Those in glass houses should not throw stones - the defender would be wise to remember that.Laura Hunter",
      "Gabriel Jesus' return from injury has meant one key thing from the perspective of Viktor Gyokeres. He is no longer guaranteed to lead the line for Arsenal.",
      "Given it has been a tough season for the Swede, it may have been easy for him to go into his shell even more. He has been used to averaging a goal a game or better in the last couple of seasons. With 11 goals in 31 appearances for the Gunners, he is well off those levels.",
      "But a noticeable improvement is apparent. The 27-year-old has eight goal involvements in his last eight games. In 2026, he has more goals than any other Premier League player across all competitions.",
      "Yes, some might point to the opposition in some of these. Kairat Almaty should've been brushed aside. Leeds and Sunderland are not easy games, but still ones you'd expect Arsenal to win. But amongst that are also goals and assists against Chelsea and Inter Milan too.",
      "Notably, the goal against Inter was similar to his second against the Black Cats. Gyokeres was able to bear down on goal with the opposition pressing. The finishes were different, but the nature was the same. And he was fresher having come off the bench.",
      "Perhaps that's the key for unlocking the best from Gyokeres towards the back end of the season. With Jesus and Havertz back as options, does Arteta look at Gyokeres as more of an impact player on the bench.",
      "That role would appear to suit his strengths some more. Very rarely do Arsenal play in a way that allows Gyokeres the chance to run in behind and get a march on defenders, since they are usually holding possession in areas high up the pitch.",
      "But, in tight games like against Inter or Sunderland, their resolute defensive structure means they can soak up pressure and then hit teams on the break. With Gyokeres fresh and up top in those moments, there's no player in that Gunners squad they'd rather have leading the charge.",
      "The strength in depth Arteta has at his disposal is going to be crucial from now until the end of the season. Nine goals from the bench is the highest of any Premier League club and proves just how much quality he has. But just as important as that. is how he utilises it.",
      "Would Gyokeres have been dreaming of coming to the Emirates to be a player to come off the bench? Of course not. However, that may be where he is most effective from now up until the season's end.Callum Bishop",
      "Defying expected goals has been a common theme for Aston Villa this season but it looks like their luck is beginning to run out.",
      "Morgan Rogers' well-taken goal was against the run of play and the promise they showed in the early stages of this game quickly faded.",
      "A tally of just 0.44 xG highlights the lack of cutting edge, intent and quality in the final third which plagued this performance.",
      "If it wasn't for Emiliano Martinez and the seven saves he made, Villa would have walked away empty-handed.",
      "A nine-point gap to Arsenal at the top of the table has quickly opened and dreams of competing for the title have shifted to fears over the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United closing in behind them.",
      "They still hold an eight-point gap on Liverpool in sixth but if they continue to play like this, that will reduce and their hopes of securing Champions League football will follow suit.",
      "In both the defeat to Brentford and the draw to Bournemouth, Villa have been dull and uninspiring. Injuries have plagued the squad, but there is no time for excuses; Villa need to find their spark again.Patrick Rowe",
      "One goal, one assist - Rayan's already lighting up the Premier League after just two appearances.",
      "The 19-year-old Brazilian is seen as Antoine Semenyo's long-term replacement after signing for Bournemouth in a £30.3m deal from Vasco da Gama during the January transfer window.",
      "The winger came on to provide an assist in the 2-0 victory at Wolves last weekend and was then handed his first start against Aston Villa, hitting the crossbar with a header in the first half before netting the equaliser in the second.",
      "Rayan's size instantly makes him stand out. He is not as lightweight as his compatriot Estevao at Chelsea and is more of a direct runner like Semenyo. That's how he scored what should be the first of many for Bournemouth, driving past Lucas Digne into the area before finishing.",
      "He will have little issue in adapting to the physicality of the Premier League, winning eight of his 13 duels against Villa and under Andoni Iraola, he can be moulded into the club's next hot property.David Richardson",
      "West Ham love a talisman. A maverick-type individual who doesn't necessarily bend or sway in the same direction of the team but will always deliver.",
      "From Carlos Tevez to Dimitri Payet, an individual who captures the hearts and minds of Hammers is West Ham heritage.",
      "Crysencio Summerville could be another talisman on a long line of individual stars at West Ham as he continues drive West Ham's survival bid.",
      "His fifth straight goal in as many matches at Burnley was a crucial one. For many obvious reasons, as it set the tone for the Hammers' eventual victory.",
      "However, on a personal note, it marks the \"coming of a Hammer\" for Summerville, who hadn't scored all season before his current run.",
      "While his talent has never been questioned since making the move from Leeds in 2024, his consistency due to injury has hindered his overall impact.",

      "In a season marred by injury and frustration, doubts about Cole Palmer were just starting to creep into mainstream football conversation.",
      "Before Saturday's win at Wolves, Palmer had just four goals this season, with only two Premier League goals from open play since January 2025, and looked a player bereft of confidence in a disappointing substitute appearance against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "How about a hat-trick to silence the doubters?",
      "With this triple, Palmer became the first player in Premier League history to score three hat-tricks in the first half of a match, while his four hat-tricks overall are the most of any Chelsea player in Premier League history.",
      "But it was the manner of his three goals which will mean so much to the Chelsea star. He took his two penalties with his quintessential coolness - and smashing in his hat-trick goal from open play three minutes after his second displayed the confident Palmer Chelsea fans had grown so used to seeing in the last two seasons.",
      "\"In terms of Cole, we know what a world-class player he is,\" said new Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior, who lauded his hat-trick hero throughout his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He's played a lot of football for the last year, not much rest, but when he's at his best, he's unstoppable.\"",
      "With eight wins in their last 10 games, Chelsea are a team on the up - and a fully-fit, confident Palmer will only increase opponents' fears of an already formidable side.Noah Langford",
      "Rob Edwards had seen his side go a whole month without scoring a Premier League goal so perhaps the Wolves boss could be forgiven going with such an attacking line-up for the visit of Chelsea. It was a 4-2-3-1 with Angel Gomes as a deep-lying playmaker.",
      "\"We wanted to be really positive, we wanted to be brave, press higher, and then we wanted to try and have more of an attacking threat on the pitch. Removing a defender and putting a more attacking player on it, simply speaking that was the thinking.\"",
      "He abandoned the plan when 3-0 down inside the first half. The penalties conceded by Matt Doherty and Yerson Mosquera were labelled \"ludicrous mistakes\" by Edwards. His side threatened to capitulate in the minutes that followed before going to a back five.",
      "The issues were as much mental as tactical but it was a chastening reminder for Edwards of the fragility - just one of the reasons why Wolves are rooted to the bottom of the table. Dealing with these battle scars is just part of the challenge he faces now.Adam Bate",
      "The boos that rang around St James' Park were angry and pointed. Newcastle fans expect better than this.",
      "Eddie Howe was keen to accept that - but also provide mitigating circumstances. Five injured players are out in Joelinton, Fabian Schar, Tino Livarmento, Lewis Miley and Anthony Gordon. There is also a hectic fixture list which is not holding up, while simple mistakes are being punished.",
      "The excuses have been there all season for Newcastle. A lack of attacking fluency could go date back to Alexander Isak's transfer saga - that set the club back in their pre-season preparations. Newcastle now don't know who their No 9 is out of Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa, perhaps Isak's transfer drama is finally catching up with them.",
      "But there are also circumstances that Howe can control. Newcastle have conceded 15 goals in their last five games - even though defence is an area the club actually strengthened in last summer.",
      "Everything that made Howe's Newcastle hard to beat is drifting away. And that tough fixture list, it's hotting up. Up next are four testing away games in Spurs, Aston Villa, Qarabag and Man City. If Howe can't find a solution to this slump, this could get ugly.Sam Blitz",
      "Everton manager David Moyes was not sure whether to talk up his side's European prospects or play them down after their late come-from-behind win at Fulham, and instead ended up doing both!",
      "\"Hugely important [win] and I think it probably keeps us away from the big R word at the bottom of the league, that's for sure,\" he initially said after the game without a hint of sarcasm, before revealing his true feelings.",

      "Their nine-point advantage on the drop zone was trimmed to six by Saturday's win for West Ham but that made this impressive thumping of Forest all the more important. A tricky run of fixtures is coming up but with points on the board and taking the confidence from this display, Farke's side should be optimistic of winning this Premier League survival battle.Peter Smith",

      "Match report as Michael Carrick extended his perfect record as Manchester United boss with his fourth win since taking over from Ruben Amorim; United scored once in each half after Cristian Romero was sent off for a dangerous tackle on Casemiro; Carrick's side stay fourth; Spurs are 14th",
      "Saturday 7 February 2026 19:44, UK",
      "Michael Carrick made it four wins from four as Manchester United landed a confident 2-0 victory over toothless Tottenham, with the visitors' misery compounded by Cristian Romero's second sending off of the season.",
      "The Spurs captain had been defended by Thomas Frank in the week after an outburst on social media criticised the club's \"disgraceful\" lack of depth - Frank labelled the comments \"passionate\" and opted to field him as part of a revamped back four anyway, only for him to see red for a rash challenge on Casemiro in the 29th minute.",
      "Romero has now been sent off six times across all competitions since his Spurs debut in August 2021 - more than any other player in the competition in that period and faces a four-game suspension as a consequence.",
      "The home side's opener arrived nine minutes later via a well-worked set-piece. Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo were both involved, allowing Bryan Mbeumo to tuck home his eighth goal of a fruitful campaign. United's coordination in attack was impressive despite the scarcity of more goals, needing a flurry of late chances to finally yield a game-sealing second thanks to Fernandes in the 81st minute.",
      "The same cannot be said of Spurs. Under Frank, Tottenham are winless when trailing at the break and so it proved again, with Romero's dismissal raising more questions over the management of a squad decimated by injuries, but surely better than the 14th place they find themselves in. Even with a full complement of players in the first half they looked blunt.",
      "Carrick's audition for the permanent role at Old Trafford continues to go from strength to strength, cementing their position inside the top four, while Frank's credit is surely waning. Spurs have slumped to their 10th defeat and are only nine points above the Premier League drop zone.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (7), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (6), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (6), Amad (5), Fernandes (7), Cunha (6), Mbeumo (7).\n\n\nSubs: Sesko (6), Mazraoui (n/a), Ugarte (n/a), Zirkzee (n/a), Fletcher (n/a).\n\n\nTottenham: Vicario (5), Udogie (6), Van de Ven (5), Romero (1), Gray (5), Sarr (6), Palhinha (5), Gallagher (6), Simons (6), Solanke (6), Odobert (4).\n\n\nSubs: Dragusin (6), Souza (5), Kolo Muani (n/a), Bissouma (n/a), Tel (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bruno Fernandes",
      "\"It's incredible. We have had moments where we were not great but the crowd was still like this. The energy is different because we win, everything looks brighter.\"",
      "On Carrick's impact: \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch.",
      "\"It's very good. I was sure he would be a great manager and he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more.",
      "\"Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club, everyone knows the expectations around it. He knows what it means for this club to win. It adds something special to the team.\"",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank:",
      "\"We started well, good away performance. Very even. Happy with that. The red card changed the momentum. Proud of the players for the 60 minutes, how they showed resilience and stayed in the game, kept fighting. We still created moments.",
      "\"It's very tough to go out and not get enough results, we haven't won enough. There is still a lot to hang a hat on. But form has to back that up, and we have to keep doing the right things. There is no other alternative than to keep going, which we will do.",
      "\"In the very tough times it's head down, stand up, work hard. There is no other way.\"",
      "On Romero's red: \"The red card is a red card. I've watched it back five times. Cuti tried to go for the ball. You play with passion and aggression and there's a fine line.\"",
      "Asked if he regrets making him captain: \"No. He's apologised to his team-mates in the changing room. He's one of our most important players. He doesn't have any intention to get a red card.",
      "\"He's apologised to the team and that's enough for me right now, there's nothing more to do.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Michael Carrick:",
      "\"I'm encouraging confidence, not flicks and tricks, but playing with purpose.",
      "\"The connection with everyone has been as good as anything. The feeling, the emotion and connection with players, staff and fans - it feels good. We've had to win games in different ways. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the stadium this way, to look forward to the excitement.",
      "\"I'm pleased with the buy-in. We're in a good emotional place and that helps you. The four games we've had look different, we've not cracked it. I'm aware of that.\"",

      "\"If they have changed that, there's something wrong. It can't be so knee-jerk either way, whether it's really good or whether there are a few issues we need to solve. It's steady progress, really.",
      "\"You know that football can twist and turn just as quick, so we have got to keep it a bit level, really, and keep focusing on what we need to do.\"",
      "Carrick was chosen to take charge for the remainder of the season after United also spoke to former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",

      "Man Utd won't U-turn on the decision to allow Casemiro to leave when his contract expires in June despite improved Premier League form under Michael Carrick; the club are forward planning and expected to chase a number of midfield targets in the summer, with Elliot Anderson top of list",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is in his richest vein of form since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth £70m in 2022. So why would the club let him go now?",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday, heading in the opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a sublime no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro has started all three games under Carrick, but made his impending departure official last month while Ruben Amorim was still in charge. United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",
      "\"Manchester United are determined not to have a short-term approach to signings and managers. That's what has got them into trouble in the past. It's left a lot of big-name players on big wages who are not part of the plans.",
      "\"Casemiro is flying right now. Player of the match against Fulham. I can understand why a lot of fans are saying: 'we're trying to find a midfielder but willing to let Casemiro go?'",
      "\"He turns 34 later this month, he's one of the biggest earners at the club, £325k a week, and Man Utd know that can't go on forever. He's playing out of his skin right now but they have to have a longer-term plan.",
      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "A serious injury to Mikel Merino gave Arsenal food for thought - and they tentatively explored a potential deal. However, that's as far as it got and Arsenal will continue their fight on all four fronts with the squad they have.",
      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",
